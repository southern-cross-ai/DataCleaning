    Who Did This Thing?</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THE room was black dark. The sort of darkness that is described
    as Cimmerian, Stygian, Egyptian, but is called by most of us, pitch-dark.</p>
  <p align="left">Though invisible by reason of the darkness, it was a beautiful
    room, filled with interesting and valuable pictures, tapestries, curios.</p>
  <p align="left">Nor were the people in the room visible to one another. Only
    could be heard the breathing of its occupants, calm, ordinary breathing,
    as of untroubled breasts and care-free minds.</p>
  <p align="left">Scents there were. Darkness could not conceal those.</p>
  <p align="left">Faint, elusive perfume of cyclamen; heavy, haunting fragrance
    of jasmine. A suggestion of tobacco. Another pungent familiar odor&mdash;indescribable
    but unmistakable&mdash;the clean, homely smell of mothballs. And over all,
    circling in invisible spirals, the oppressive yet poignant fumes of burning
    incense.</p>
  <p align="left">And then, with a sudden flash the place was illumined.</p>
  <p align="left">Not glaringly; save for a pair of shaded lamps, the lighting
    was indirect.</p>
  <p align="left">The room revealed itself as a man&rsquo;s library or sanctum,
    four-square, each side a deep arched alcove, lined with bookshelves.</p>
  <p align="left">The arches framed mural paintings of beauty and worth. The
    shelves held books of all sorts; antique tomes and rare bindings neighbored
    by the latest novels and mystery stories.</p>
  <p align="left">The thick rugs were Oriental gems and the few pieces of furniture
    were masterpieces of celebrated designers.</p>
  <p align="left">On a small sofa, the sort known as a love-seat, sat a man;
    on either side of him was a girl.</p>
  <p align="left">The man was not sitting upright. He had slumped a little, and
    his head had fallen forward till his chin rested on his chest.</p>
  <p align="left">One girl, a vivid, scarlet-clad little figure, perched on the
    arm of the love-seat at his left. The other, a tall, serene, Moon-goddess
    type, stood, frozen with fear on his right a few steps from the couch.</p>
  <p align="left">A low moan that rose to a shriek came from one of these girls,
    as she paled, swayed, and fell to the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">The occasion was a small party in honor of the birthday of
    Gaylord Homer, the host.</p>
  <p align="left">Twin Towers, his small but charming home, was in Westchester,
    in the exclusive and highly restricted community of New Warwick. It was not
    a new place, but one of respectable age and tested and tried desirability.</p>
  <p align="left">So Gaylord Homer bought himself a place there, and now proposed
    to take unto himself a wife. He had decided upon his choice, and though he
    had not yet brought the lady to see the matter in the same light that he
    did, he had every hope of yet achieving that expectation.</p>
  <p align="left">The lady&rsquo;s name was Diana Kittredge, and though that
    might seem formidable of itself, Gaylord Homer was not afraid of mere words
    and he was determined that this party of his should be the Rubicon which,
    when crossed, would change that surname to his own.</p>
  <p align="left">As to her Christian name she was mostly called Di, and also,
    Sky-eyes, a nickname not especially euphonious but wondrously descriptive.</p>
  <p align="left">Homer, himself, was a delightful chap, whose outstanding traits
    were geniality and capability.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, he was loyal to his friends, generous to his enemies
    and kind to his dependents. And if you think that writes him down a milksop,
    you&rsquo;re dead wrong.</p>
  <p align="left">He had a bull-dog tenacity of purpose, and if he wanted a thing
    he got it by sheer persistence and perseverance.</p>
  <p align="left">That was the way he expected to win his Diana, and the fact
    that she had not yet said yes to his pleas discouraged him not a bit.</p>
  <p align="left">He loved her with the sort of love, he sometimes assured himself,
    that the wing&eacute;d angels of heaven had coveted Miss Annabel Lee.</p>
  <p align="left">In fact, he thought Miss Lee&rsquo;s affair rather picayunish
    beside the surges of affection that swamped his own heart when he thought
    about Sky-eyes, and he resolved anew that this paragon of girls was for him
    and he must get the matter settled.</p>
  <p align="left">Hence the birthday party, which was to last over the week-end,
    and which he strongly hoped would develop into an announcement party before
    it closed.</p>
  <p align="left">It was Friday now, the party had materialized and dinner was
    in progress.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, the azure-eyed divinity, sat at the right of the host.
    Her soft, fair hair, parted in the middle, waved over her ears in a curling
    riot, but was short at the back. Her exquisite face had a translucent effect,
    as if her soul was shining through, and her gentle, regular features were
    as serenely beautiful as those of the Mona Lisa.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps her greatest charm was her mouth and teeth, and the
    smiles which they helped to make proved the undoing of many a man who watched,
    fascinated for their return.</p>
  <p align="left">In an exquisite, though severely plain gown of silver tissue,
    Diana was a veritable Moon-goddess, and Gaylord Homer, glancing at her now
    and again, concluded she was perfect.</p>
  <p align="left">Save for one thing. She would scarcely look at or speak to
    him.</p>
  <p align="left">Never rude or noticeably neglectful, an unobservant guest might
    have thought Miss Kittredge was all a host could desire in the matter of
    cordiality. But Homer saw the effort she made when she voluntarily addressed
    him, the veiled indifference in her larkspur-blue eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">He fully sensed that she had no intention of saying yes to
    his pleadings, but that only made him the more determined and the more sure
    of ultimate success.</p>
  <p align="left">Truly, the human genus is a strange proposition.</p>
  <p align="left">Now on the other side of Homer sat a girl who was positively
    eaten up with her love of him. With all the strength of her exotic nature
    she adored this man.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita Moore, whose father was an undistinguished, average
    American citizen, had had foremothers of Spanish descent, and all their amorous
    impulses, all their tricks of temperament, had merged and flourished in this
    youngest scion of the hot-blooded line.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, who looked the part, was small and lithe and sinuous.
    She was dark and her air was both domineering and defiant.</p>
  <p align="left">Her long, black eyes were now sleepy and langorous, now provocative
    and daring. Her short frock was red&mdash;the red of the hibiscus, of the
    cleft pomegranate&mdash;and in her black hair, though it was short, she had
    managed to thrust a high gold comb, that gave the final touch to her Castilian
    effects.</p>
  <p align="left">Her little hand continually clutched at the sleeve of Gaylord
    Homer&rsquo;s coat. She almost seemed as if trying to take him by force.</p>
  <p align="left">In a way, it was absurd.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita loved the man as he loved Diana. He scorned Marita,
    as Diana scorned him. Marita was determined to win him, as he was determined
    to win Diana. And he was as determined that he would never marry Marita as
    Diana was determined she would never marry him.</p>
  <p align="left">A triangle, indeed. An infernal triangle. Whatever happened,
    one heart must be broken, if not two&mdash;or three.</p>
  <p align="left">Three strong wills in a mortal clash. One, at least, must give
    way.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, there was another element.</p>
  <p align="left">The other side of Diana sat Ted Bingham, a chum of Homer&rsquo;s.
    He, too, adored Sky-eyes, and he thought, he hoped, she cared for him. But
    who could tell what she meant when those red lips and those mother-of-pearl
    teeth smiled at him?</p>
  <p align="left">And what had he to offer, a poor young sculptor, with nothing
    but faith in his own work? While Gay Homer had everything&mdash;everything
    a goddess could ask for on this earth.</p>
  <p align="left">With a suppressed sigh, he turned to his other neighbor, Mrs.
    Bobbie Abbott, a rollicking young married woman, the scapegrace of the party,
    and, incidentally, its chaperon. One of the most frivolous, vain and rattle-pated
    of her set, she still had a fine sense of relative values and a good bit
    of perception.</p>
  <p align="left">She saw how things were going and in a low tone, advised Ted
    not to give up the ship as yet.</p>
  <p align="left">The rest, round the table, were Rollin Dare, opinionated, but
    likable, Polly Opdyke, a flapper neighbor, and Cale Harrison, the confidential
    secretary of the host.</p>
  <p align="left">That was the party of Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s birthday dinner,
    and as they were all fairly well acquainted, conversation was hilarious and
    repartee untrammeled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not give up the ship?&rdquo; Bingham growled, in
    an undertone to Bobbie. &ldquo;No girl could stand out against Gaylord&rsquo;s
    arguments. He is fine, himself, and he lays at her feet all a woman can ask
    for. Wealth, position, power, and a love that is mad adoration, How can Diana
    resist all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, now, lamb, don&rsquo;t take it thataway. What&rsquo;s
    it to her, if she cares for somebody else&mdash;you, for instance. And she
    does&mdash;that is, I think she does,&rdquo; she hastily amended, for Ted
    seemed about to burst into song.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must get ahead of him some way,&rdquo; the wiseacre
    went on. &ldquo;I, too, can&rsquo;t see how Di can hold out against that
    charmer. He&rsquo;s mad about her. Oh, if he&rsquo;d only turn to the little
    vamp in red! She&rsquo;s determined to snatch him from Di&rsquo;s very grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Di isn&rsquo;t grasping him&mdash;look at her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, but that may be her clever way of egging him on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no egger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, good Lord, Teddy, what do you want me to do? I
    try my best to pet you up, and you only growl at me. If I can help, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, nobody can. When Gaylord gets that
    queer little set look in his eyes, I know he means to fight to a finish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fighting won&rsquo;t get him Diana Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It may. He may keep at it till she gives in from sheer
    exhaustion. And, Bobbie, she mustn&rsquo;t marry him! No, that isn&rsquo;t
    just jealousy, there&rsquo;s another reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the alert mind sensed gossip.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I hate those blind hints. They never mean anything,
    anyway. Well, I must babble a bit to this incubus on my other side. But look
    at the secretary person. He, I happen to know, is consumed with a burning
    passion for the firebrand in red.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No! I can&rsquo;t imagine Cale Harrison being consumed
    with anything for anything. He is the timidest bunny I know! He wouldn&rsquo;t
    dare raise his eyes to Marita&rsquo;s mascara-dipped lashes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t he? I know he has that, Friday afternoon,
    speaking pieces air, but secretly he feels himself superior to Gaylord himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Superior!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. He scorns Gay&rsquo;s money and leisure, just as
    he scorns your sculping. You know these inferiority complex people are really
    exhibitionists, their humility is just part of their pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Harrison is really a mush of apology, he&rsquo;s
    always afraid of being in the way or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way it takes him. But look at
    him, he&rsquo;s watching Marita vamp Gaylord, and it&rsquo;s picking out
    his stitches. See him squirm!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he looks as if he was just wishing he had the nerve
    to pick up Marita and run away with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He has nerve enough but he&rsquo;s a creature of habit.
    He has behaved himself so long he wouldn&rsquo;t know how to set about doing
    anything desperate or even unconventional. Now I must love my neighbor as
    myself, on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie turned to Rollin Dare who drew a long breath of relief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I thought you hadn&rsquo;t any bringing up at
    all! So you remembered I was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had another thought since we sat down!
    Been jus&rsquo; a waitin&rsquo; for you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, all right. But if you flirt with Teddy Bingham
    I&rsquo;ll tell your husband on you. Anyway, you waited too long. Gaylord&rsquo;s
    going to chase us out now. You stay by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Homer was a law unto himself in his own house. He had coffee
    at the table, and then the whole party, men and women, rose together and
    adjourned to the lounge or wherever they chose.</p>
  <p align="left">But it was Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s invariable custom, for a reason
    of his own, to go always, from his dinner table to a small room next the
    dining-room, which was called the Tapestry Room, by reason of some bits of
    choice and valuable tapestry which adorned its walls.</p>
  <p align="left">The house was built with what Bobbie Abbott called the front
    door on the side.</p>
  <p align="left">This was literally true.</p>
  <p align="left">The house was of that old-fashioned type whose large front
    room is a living-room or lounge. The back room is a dining-room, with a breakfast-room
    annex, and these two ends are connected by a long hall and another room.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps a plan would be advisable here.</p>
  <p class="cp">
  <img alt="diagram" height="750" src="1900881h-images/diagram.png" width="498"> </p>
  <p align="left">From the pleasant candle lighted dining-room, they went to
    the hall, and from there, dispersed as they chose.</p>
  <p align="left">Rollin Dare, having corralled the elusive Mrs. Abbott, held
    on to her arm, and piloted her to the lounge and to a pleasant divan in a
    corner, where he provided her with a cigarette and then sat beside her.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham followed the pair, but Gaylord Homer paused at
    the curtained entrance to the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in here with me, Di,&rdquo; he said, his low, delightful
    voice taking all sense of command from his words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she began, but he took her hand and led her
    over the threshold.</p>
  <p align="left">She couldn&rsquo;t draw back without seeming too ungracious,
    and reluctantly she went along with him.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, bounded to his other side, and clasped her two fluttering
    hands round his arm.</p>
  <p align="left">Seeing this, Diana tried to leave the group, but Gaylord held
    her fast.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no, my lady,&rdquo; he cried, laughing low. &ldquo;You
    can&rsquo;t get away! You can, Marita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, obstinately, her
    lovely face leaning near his own. &ldquo;I want to come, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So the trio went together into the room.</p>
  <p align="left">A perfect room, four-sided, in each side an alcove of bookshelves.
    Here and there pictures and draperies, including the rare tapestries that
    gave the room its name.</p>
  <p align="left">Through the draped porti&egrave;res they came from the hall,
    and Marita gayly drew Homer down on a small couch, one of those short sofas
    called a loveseat, and then perched herself on the arm of it.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana still stood at Gaylord&rsquo;s other side.</p>
  <p align="left">He was looking at her, though Marita was striving to gain his
    attention.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham, who had gone into the lounge, came to the door
    between the lounge and the Tapestry Room, and looked in to note the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly Opdyke, childishly curious, drew near Ted, to see what
    he was looking at.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted glanced at a clock.</p>
  <p align="left">All knew what would happen next.</p>
  <p align="left">The village of New Warwick, during the day and evening was
    supplied with electricity for lighting and power from a five hundred horse-power
    dynamo, driven by a Diesel engine. But after ten o&rsquo;clock, most of the
    town retired and the street lights and those of residences that used electric
    light were supplied from a fifty horse-power generator and engine.</p>
  <p align="left">So each night when the larger engine was shut down, the engineer
    disconnected the lighting circuits from the main bus and transferred them
    to the bus supplied by the small generator, after which the voltage was raised
    and the light burned at normal brightness.</p>
  <p align="left">It should have been the work of a minute or two, but owing
    to the slowness of Old Tom, the engineer, the operation often consumed two
    or three minutes and sometimes even more.</p>
  <p align="left">Hence a few moments of complete darkness occurred every night
    shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock, and so accustomed were the citizens of New
    Warwick and vicinity that it raised no comment and seldom interrupted their
    occupations.</p>
  <p align="left">Talk went on without cessation, readers merely held their books
    or papers ready for the light which would soon return.</p>
  <p align="left">Bridge players held their cards and chatted a moment, then
    resumed their play.</p>
  <p align="left">But, whether from a nervous fear of burglars, or for what reason,
    Homer never said, he always spent those dark moments in the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">The assumption was that he wanted to be on the spot if some
    evilly inclined intruder should attempt to walk off with some of his treasures.
    For the room was full of curios and rarities that represented a large sum
    in value and were too, in many cases, unique and irreplaceable.</p>
  <p align="left">All of the guests knew of the dark time, as it was always called,
    and though it often came as a surprise to those not noting the hour, yet
    they immediately bethought themselves, and waited for the flash of returning
    light.</p>
  <p align="left">And so, as Gaylord Homer sat on the miniature sofa, with Marita
    on the arm of it, and with Diana standing, haughty and inaccessible at his
    other side, the lights went out.</p>
  <p align="left">There was a little squeal from Polly in the lounge.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly always squealed when the lights went off, though living
    next door, as she did, her home invariably had the same experience.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott, still devotedly attended by Rollin Dare, was
    curled up on her divan, her cigarette just about consumed.</p>
  <p align="left">She put it out and dropped the stub in an ash tray, saying
    she liked it all dark better.</p>
  <p align="left">As Dare&rsquo;s arm stole round her shoulder, she wriggled
    a bit, not knowing how long the darkness would last.</p>
  <p align="left">It seemed a long time though, to the others, and it was nearly
    three minutes. Astonishing how much longer three minutes is in the dark than
    in the light. But at last the lights flashed on, and Bobbie straightened
    up, quickly and calmly returned the curious glance Polly Opdyke shot at her.</p>
  <p align="left">And then a scream came&mdash;a short, sharp, frightened scream,
    that came from the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">It was followed by a soft thud, as if someone had fallen.</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham, standing near the entrance to the Tapestry Room, from
    the lounge dashed through the archway and stood gazing.</p>
  <p align="left">He seemed so stunned for a moment, he made no sound at all,
    then, hastening forward, he helped Marita, who had fallen, to her feet.</p>
  <p align="left">But the girl could not stand, and Ted placed her gently in
    a chair and then turned to the slumped down figure of the love-seat.</p>
  <p align="left">Gaylord Homer sat, huddled, his chin resting on his chest,
    his arms sprawling, and his shoulders beginning to give way.</p>
  <p align="left">Near him, Diana was backing away, farther and farther away,
    with a dreadful look of fear on her beautiful face.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, from the chair where Ted had landed her, had roused
    and was staring at the scene.</p>
  <p align="left">She began to scream but thought better of it and clapped her
    hands over her mouth.</p>
  <p align="left">Then Rollin Dare came bursting into the room, and stepping
    toward that awful figure that was so strangely still and huddled, he called
    out &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; As he came nearer, he caught the gleam of metal and
    saw that Gaylord Homer had been stabbed in the back, stabbed with a jeweled
    dagger, a weapon familiar to them all; a weapon that had long lain on the
    curio cabinet near by, that was one of Homer&rsquo;s choicest and most valuable
    treasures.</p>
  <p align="left">Dare touched the dagger, was about to withdraw it, when Bobbie
    Abbott, who had followed Dare, cried out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t Rollin! Don&rsquo;t touch it! Get a doctor,
    quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This bit of sound common sense brought reaction from Dare,
    and he said, &ldquo;Where is one? Is anybody here a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s a doctor, shall I fetch him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was Polly Opdyke who spoke in a frightened voice but determined
    to help.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, child, run!&rdquo; cried Dare, as he tried gently
    to raise Homer&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p align="left">And then Cale Harrison suddenly appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he cried, harshly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gaylord&rsquo;s been stabbed,&rdquo; said Ted Bingham,
    himself trembling with horror.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stabbed! Heavens!&rdquo; Harrison&rsquo;s exclamation
    was lusty enough, but next moment he almost collapsed, himself, and leaned
    against the jamb of the doorway for support.</p>
  <p align="left">In an incredibly short time, Dr. Opdyke appeared and took charge
    of the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">A moment&rsquo;s examination brought the decision.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; Dr. Opdyke said, solemnly. &ldquo;Who
    did this thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</a><br>
    Who Was in the Room?</b></h2>
  <p align="left">JUST to look at her you would know her name must be Abbie Perkins.</p>
  <p align="left">It couldn&rsquo;t have been anything else. Tightly drawn as
    to hair, skin, and clothing, she stood, motionless, in the curtained doorway
    between the Tapestry Room and the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">A wiry little figure of a woman, the coiled knot at the back
    of her head so taut that it seemed the reason for the prominence of her round
    brown eyes. Thin, angular, flat, she seemed cut out of tin.</p>
  <p align="left">She had about as much of the quality recently dubbed sex appeal
    as an icepick, and this fact she knew so well and resented so fiercely that
    she was jealous and envious of every woman who had what she lacked. That
    subtle, elusive lure, much written about of late, but no more a decisive
    factor in a woman&rsquo;s fate now than in the most ancient of days.</p>
  <p align="left">The law of compensation gave her common sense, efficiency,
    housewifely skill and an uncanny intuition that was almost clairvoyance.</p>
  <p align="left">Any or all of these things she would joyfully have bartered
    for a half ounce of charm. Yet a real sense of humor saved her from misanthropy
    or sulks and Abbie Perkins was a success in her own field.</p>
  <p align="left">She was housekeeper for Gaylord Homer, and it was her generalship
    that kept things running smoothly, for a home without a mistress is not an
    easy proposition.</p>
  <p align="left">Always an inveterate talker, she stood now silenced and aghast
    at the scene before her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she breathed, clasping her bony hands
    together and staring at the tragic figure on the little sofa.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Be quiet, Abbie,&rdquo; said Dr. Opdyke, warningly; &ldquo;Mr.
    Homer is hurt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; she said, in a sharp tone. &ldquo;What
    can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The doctor flung her a grateful glance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
    can do nothing here, Abbie, but you can help a lot by looking after the servants.
    Don&rsquo;t let them get excited or hysterical. Where is Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here I am sir,&rdquo; and the butler appeared from the
    dining-room door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stay in the hall, Wood. Let no one pass in or out until
    the police can get here to take matters in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Police!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was Bobbie Abbott who spoke, but the dread and horror in
    her voice found its echo in the hearts of all present.</p>
  <p align="left">No one had spoken since the doctor&rsquo;s awful question.
    And now, the mention of police brought home to all of them the sudden realization
    that here was murder and it must be dealt with by the law.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; the doctor snapped out. &ldquo;Who
    is in charge here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He looked about. As he well knew it was Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s
    house, Gaylord Homer lived there alone, and now Gaylord Homer sat, helpless
    and still before their eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">There was no one in charge, if not Homer.</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie Perkins had gone to look after the frightened servants.
    Wood stood at attention in the hall, but these were not the ones to take
    charge.</p>
  <p align="left">Then the doctor&rsquo;s eye lighted on the secretary, Cale
    Harrison.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must take charge for the moment, Harrison,&rdquo;  Dr.
    Opdyke declared. &ldquo;As confidential secretary it is your place to do
    so, at least, until we can get his relatives here. Where are his people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any, except a distant cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, never mind that now, anyway. The thing to do first
    is to call the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was hard on the doctor, for in all his experience he had
    never been in a situation like this before, and though an able physician,
    he had but small power to meet this emergency.</p>
  <p align="left">He looked about him at the crowd of young people, he looked
    at the white scared face of Diana Kittredge, the drawn, tear-stained countenance
    of Marita Moore, the blank faces of the men, and he was glad indeed when
    his wife came across the hall and stood at his side.</p>
  <p align="left">Acting on his orders Wood had denied her admittance, but Emily
    Opdyke had insistently pursued her way, unheeding him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Who
    did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; her husband returned. &ldquo;Look
    after Polly and do anything you can for the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was someone in charge now, at least so far as the women
    were concerned. Mrs. Opdyke was tactful and kindly by nature, and always
    ready in an emergency.</p>
  <p align="left">She made all the women go with her into the lounge, she ordered
    coffee brought to them there, and found cigarettes for them. Marita she made
    lie on a couch and bathed her brow with violet water. The girl was almost
    in hysterics, but Mrs. Opdyke&rsquo;s ministrations calmed and soothed her.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana refused all such nursing and sat in a big armchair, looking
    inscrutable and a little defiant.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott was regaining her composure and wondering why
    she hadn&rsquo;t had sense enough to do the very things Mrs. Opdyke was doing.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly, reassured now by the presence of both parents, was alert
    and quite ready to chatter with Bobbie about the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">But Mrs. Opdyke banned that at once and forbade Polly to speak
    at all.</p>
  <p align="left">The doctor and Cale Harrison were in the Tapestry Room with
    the dead man, but the other two men had drifted out to the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">These two, Dare and Bingham, were silent.</p>
  <p align="left">Though in no way enemies, they were not congenial spirits,
    and neither cared to discuss the case with the other.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham was nervous and walked about lighting a cigarette
    and then throwing it aside, sitting down a moment, then suddenly jumping
    up, going out to the dining-room for a glass of water, and then coming back
    without it.</p>
  <p align="left">Rollin Dare watched him, his own big frame comfortably ensconced
    in a high-backed hall chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do sit down, Bingham,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Or
    at least stand still. You make me jumpy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who isn&rsquo;t jumpy? Do you realize what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I do. But we can&rsquo;t do anything. Why
    roll around so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham vouchsafed no answer but turned off and entered the
    Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">Here Dr. Opdyke and Cale Harrison were holding a desultory
    conversation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unthinkable,&rdquo; the doctor was saying.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Harrison agreed.</p>
  <p align="left">He was one of those men who would agree to almost anything.
    It was this trait that had endeared him to Gaylord Homer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in, Bingham,&rdquo; Dr. Opdyke said, looking up.  &ldquo;What
    do you make of it all? Mr. Harrison says there was no one in this room but
    Gaylord and two girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ted Bingham returned. &ldquo;Where
    were all the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Me? Why&mdash;I was standing in that doorway, between
    this room and the lounge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were there when the lights went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;I think so. Yes I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you stayed there through the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure. But&mdash;are you questioning me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all. I&rsquo;ll leave all that to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better. Excuse me, I don&rsquo;t mean to
    advise, but I know that an official investigation is the one that counts.
    He&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t have done it himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo; The doctor gave a grim smile. &ldquo;The
    dagger was driven in by a strong, quick stroke. It entered between the seventh
    and eighth ribs, and death was probably painless and almost instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. The murderer then had a knowledge of anatomy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, that wouldn&rsquo;t be really necessary. Anybody
    with the will to kill would strike about like that. The dagger blade is horizontal,
    you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to look at it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Ted
    walked away from the tragic sight and fingered some books that lay on a table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps it would be better if you didn&rsquo;t touch
    anything, Mr. Bingham,&rdquo; murmured Harrison, in his deprecatory way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what to do!&rdquo; Bingham flung
    back at him, and leaving the room he went to where the girls were.</p>
  <p align="left">He sat down beside Diana, who paid no attention to him. She
    seemed like one in a trance, her blue eyes looked glassy, and her pale face
    showed all too clearly the remaining dabs of rouge.</p>
  <p align="left">From her couch Marita was eying Diana attentively. Her face
    showed all her worst characteristics, hate, rage, jealousy&mdash;all gleamed
    from her great dark eyes and were shown in the straight line of her red lips.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet no one spoke. Perhaps it was because of the restraining
    presence of Mrs. Opdyke, perhaps the girls were all too overcome with the
    shock of the tragedy, but Bingham found himself in a silence that was more
    embarrassing than their first excitement had been.</p>
  <p align="left">At last the police arrived. There was the village constable,
    and a detective sergeant in plain clothes.</p>
  <p align="left">The latter took charge of affairs. No longer need Dr. Opdyke
    wonder who was at the head of things. Sergeant Cram was. He took hold with
    a force and decision that left no room or place for any one else.</p>
  <p align="left">He strode into the Tapestry Room, followed by the far less
    self-assertive constable. He walked once round the love-seat, viewing the
    body from all angles.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he said, rapping the words out; &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As no reply was forthcoming, Dr. Opdyke said, quietly.  &ldquo;We
    don&rsquo;t know that, sergeant. It is yet to be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was in the room with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It had come. The vital question, the significant query.</p>
  <p align="left">The question that had but one answer, that led to but one result.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; the doctor begged
    the question.  &ldquo;I was called in after Mr. Homer was dead. I live next
    door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, who was here? Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was Cale he turned to, and the secretary replied at once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am Harrison, the confidential secretary of Mr. Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you when Mr. Homer was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was upstairs. I went up to the study directly we left
    the dinner table, and only a few moments later, I heard a commotion down
    here and I heard a woman scream. I ran down and found Mr. Homer stabbed to
    death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did you know he was dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;then, but when he was so
    still&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t move and all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did anybody say he was dead&mdash;before the doctor
    came, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know exactly
    what did happen or what anybody said. I was sort of&mdash;sort of dazed,
    you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sort of dazed yet. Pull yourself together,
    you&rsquo;ll have a lot of talking to do. Now, tell me, someone, who was
    in this room with Mr. Homer when he was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Bingham was in that doorway,&rdquo; offered Dare,
    pointing to the arched door where Ted had stood.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hold on! Did this stabbing occur when the lights went
    off? The dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cale said, &ldquo;I thought you knew that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I knew nothing about it. How do you
    know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only because just after the lights came on again, I
    heard a shriek and a commotion down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, that fixes the time, doesn&rsquo;t it, Gorman?&rdquo;  He
    turned to his fellow policeman for the first time since his entrance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, no question about that. You&rsquo;d better talk
    to somebody who wasn&rsquo;t next door or upstairs when the thing happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His dry tone seemed to nettle the sergeant a little, but he
    agreed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call that man Bingham,&rdquo; he directed.</p>
  <p align="left">In his cautious way, Harrison stepped to the door of the lounge
    and summoned Ted.</p>
  <p align="left">Unwillingly he came, his face as black as a thunder cloud,
    his lips twitching and his whole aspect belligerent.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he said, not rudely, but with
    a decided lack of cordiality.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Cram, tersely. &ldquo;Murder has been
    committed here, and we want to get the detailed particulars at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t tell you anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can tell me where you were at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh that. Yes, I was standing in that doorway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why were you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Ted stared at him, and then said quietly: &ldquo;For no especial
    reason. We had all just come in from the dining-room, and we scattered through
    the house. I paused in the doorway to see where others were going to settle
    down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Mr. Homer came into this room directly he left the
    dining-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think so. I wasn&rsquo;t noticing, you understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you leave the dining-room after Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, right behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you couldn&rsquo;t help seeing where he went. He
    came right in here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There it was, the awful question! But Ted Bingham had no intention
    of answering it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&#8221; he said, mendaciously. &ldquo;We
    all crowded through the hall together. Gaylord turned into this room, and
    a lot of us went on to the lounge. I think Harrison went upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He did. He went up to Mr. Homer&rsquo;s study to do
    some work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, was that it? Well, I can only speak for myself.
    I don&rsquo;t know about the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Mr. Bingham, when you stood in that doorway, just
    before the lights went out, you surely saw who was in this room with Mr.
    Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ted looked his inquisitor squarely in the
    eye,  &ldquo;I was looking the other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, toward the lounge. Well, then, who was in the lounge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most of the crowd. Mrs. Abbott, Miss Opdyke&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t think I can enumerate them, really.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll learn all this from the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With that Sergeant Cram went into the lounge, leaving the constable
    and the doctor alone with the dead man.</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham and the secretary he herded before him, seeming desirous
    for their presence.</p>
  <p align="left">The lounge was a large and imposing room. Of noble proportions
    and with a lofty ceiling it was a fit setting for the treasures of furniture
    and ornament therein gathered.</p>
  <p align="left">Paneled in polished gumwood, the walls gave back reflections
    of the soft light of a myriad candles, and the darker recesses and alcoves
    added to the picturesqueness of the scene.</p>
  <p align="left">Unheeding the aesthetic effect, Cram looked about for a light-switch
    and found one. A flood of light followed, and brought into bold relief the
    faces that had willingly sought the more welcome dusk.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Cram, as he turned
    on another switch. &ldquo;Now, if you please, I want a straightforward and
    coherent story of what happened here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Though he had expressed his wishes clearly enough, nobody seemed
    inclined to grant them.</p>
  <p align="left">The silence grew oppressive, and at last Cram said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The fact that it is so hard to elicit testimony is a
    bit suspicious in itself. I find I must interrogate you individually.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a slight rustle of indignation at this, but Cram
    paid no attention to it, and addressed Rollin Dare.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have already had a few words with Mr. Harrison and
    Mr. Bingham,&rdquo; he said, in a grave but not unkindly voice, &ldquo;and
    now, Mr. Dare, I will ask you to tell me all you can as to the actual happenings
    when the lights went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; exclaimed Dare. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
    anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Over in that far corner of the lounge, over by the big
    Oriental urn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dare paused a moment, and then said, firmly, &ldquo;Mrs. Abbott
    was with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You verify that, Mrs. Abbott?&rdquo; asked Cram, turning
    to her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. We were sitting on the divan there,
    smoking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All the time the lights were off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, all the time,&rdquo; said Dare.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And please describe what happened when the lights came
    on again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Rollin Dare had no thought in his mind but to tell the exact
    truth as far as he knew it. A straightforward sort, he almost always spoke
    the truth.</p>
  <p align="left">He was a short, stocky man, physically, with a round, pleasant
    face and mirror-like black hair. He was always positive, though also given
    to changing his mind. His worst trait was that he was a bit of a sponge,
    often coming down on his friends for entertainment, favors, and even financial
    aid now and then.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet his gay good nature, and his readiness to help at any time
    kept him a favorite and caused his faults to be forgotten.</p>
  <p align="left">He was not a far-sighted chap, and now, put to it for a description
    of a scene, he thought only of being exact about it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, let me see,&rdquo; he said, thinking back. &ldquo;We
    sat there on the divan, Mrs. Abbott and I, and it was dark, and I was thinking
    as soon as the lights came on I would ask Homer to let us have a dance. Then
    the lights did come on, just as they always do, you know, and I reached out
    for a cigarette and gave one to Mrs. Abbott. I was just lighting hers for
    her, when there came a scream, a girl&rsquo;s scream from the Tapestry Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did you know it was from that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I dunno as I did know at the time&mdash;not
    for sure. But it sounded from that direction, and when we jumped up and went
    that way&mdash;everybody was going that way, why, we could see that was where
    the scream came from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and how could you see that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, Marita&mdash;Miss Moore, you know&mdash;had fallen
    to the floor, and I guess she was the one who had screamed. Though I&rsquo;m
    not sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it you who screamed, Miss Moore?&rdquo; Cram whirled
    round toward her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; Marita said, in a low voice, but
    speaking steadily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did you scream?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because, when the lights came on, I saw&mdash;I saw
    Gaylord, with a&mdash;a dagger sticking in his back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you screamed from fright?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita&rsquo;s great eyes gave one glance round the room, and
    then came to rest on the countenance of the detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;yes, from fright,
    and terror and grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know then that Mr. Homer was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I surmised it. The way he looked, the way he was huddled
    down, the way that terrible dagger stuck out&mdash;oh, oh,&mdash;hush! Don&rsquo;t
    ask me any more!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita gave way to an unrestrained sobbing, and Mrs. Opdyke
    went quickly to her side, hoping to calm her.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram turned at once to Diana, and said, with a sort of intuition. &ldquo;Were
    you in that room, too, the Tapestry Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The girl had been looking pale and distressed, but this question
    seemed to break down her final barriers. She collapsed, her head drooped
    forward in her hands, and she seemed unable to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let her alone,&rdquo; stormed Ted Bingham. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you see she is ill&mdash;she is almost distracted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Cram said, &ldquo;but this inquiry
    must go on. It is imperative. Perhaps Miss Kittredge will answer this one
    question. Were you in that room with Mr. Homer when the lights went off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana nodded an assent, and the detective mercifully let her
    alone.</p>
  <p align="left">He turned to Bingham.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Bingham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must ask you to
    answer me carefully. When you stood in the doorway, and the electric lights
    went dark, were you standing there alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; Ted replied.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When the lights came on again, were you still standing
    there alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was then in the Tapestry Room with Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For a moment Ted hesitated, and then the eye of his inquisitor
    being firmly fixed on him, he said, slowly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore was in there and Miss Kittredge, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you must have turned round, Mr. Bingham. You have
    already told me that you were facing the lounge and couldn&rsquo;t see into
    the other room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I suppose I did turn around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you saw the two ladies there, when the light returned.
    What were they doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing, that I noticed. Miss Moore had fallen to the
    floor, and naturally I hastened to help her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You had heard Miss Moore scream?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were then not surprised to find she had fallen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I heard her fall&mdash;I mean I heard a sound as if
    someone had fallen. I think that was when I turned that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Miss Moore didn&rsquo;t scream until after the lights
    came on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she? I&rsquo;m a bit confused. The shock
    of it all has dazed my memory a bit. I&rsquo;ve told you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</a><br>
    It Had to Be One of Them!</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THE arrival of the coroner called the detective away from the
    lounge and he was closeted for a time, with Coroner Hale and Dr. Opdyke in
    the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">The silent constable sat in the hall, where he was glowered
    at by Wood, and by any of the servants who chanced to pass.</p>
  <p align="left">Few did, however, for Abbie Perkins had rounded up the staff
    and given them orders to remain in the kitchen department unless by her express
    directions.</p>
  <p align="left">Wood, the butler, of course, was not under Abbie&rsquo;s law,
    and he drifted about like a lost sheep.</p>
  <p align="left">Relieved of the presence of the terrifying detective, the groups
    of the lounge began to chatter a little.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bumptious old bounder,&rdquo; remarked Dare. &ldquo;I
    suppose the police people have to put on that God-almighty attitude to hold
    up their end. But if he&rsquo;d just ask his necessary questions in a decent,
    straightforward way, he&rsquo;d get better results.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that he was rude or unmannerly,&rdquo; said
    Harrison, in his low, timid voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his business to get
    at the truth of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, the truth of the matter doesn&rsquo;t concern
    any of us. We didn&rsquo;t stab old Gaylord. We ought to be deferred to as
    guests who are shocked and grieved at the disaster. Instead of which he seems
    positively suspicious of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, Rollin,&rdquo; cried Bobbie Abbott. &ldquo;You
    can&rsquo;t think he suspects any of us being implicated in the&mdash;the
    affair! Oh, I wish Roger was here! I wish I hadn&rsquo;t come! I wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She broke down and sobbed so alarmingly that Mrs. Opdyke left
    her post by the side of Marita and went over to the new demand on her ministrations.</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie Perkins stalked into the room. She paused just inside
    the threshold, and stood, hands on hips, surveying the group.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I been a-lissenin&rsquo; at the doctors,&rdquo; she
    said, unblushingly,  &ldquo;and I heard the coroner one say as he&rsquo;d
    have the inquest tomorrow and everybody must stay over for it. &rsquo;Course
    most o&rsquo; you folks planned to stay two-three days anyhow. Mis&rsquo; Opdyke,
    what about you? And Polly? I want for to set out the bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I think we&rsquo;ll be allowed to go home, Abbie.
    Only next door, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I know. But that coroner one, he said everybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll let us know soon, I think,&rdquo; and Emily
    Opdyke turned back to the now hysterical Bobbie.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Brace up, Bobs,&rdquo; said Ted Bingham, coming toward
    her and speaking gently. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of. It&rsquo;s
    a ghastly thing to happen, but it&rsquo;s up to all of us to put up a brave
    front and carry on as best we can. Once the inquest is over, you can go home.
    Somebody will come to fetch you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Ted, somebody will come for me. Roger expects to
    be away a week, but I&rsquo;ll send for Jimmy or Dad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham passed on and came to anchor next to Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">He sat down beside her without a word. By no word or look did
    she acknowledge his presence, but glancing at her sidewise he saw or imagined
    he saw a slight look of relief on her face.</p>
  <p align="left">Pale as a waxen image, silent as a marble statue, Diana sat
    looking off into space, her sky-blue eyes vacant and devoid of all expression.
    A sudden tremor shook her whole frame, and Bingham dared to put out his hand
    and clasp hers. She gave him an answering pressure, so slight he could scarce
    notice it, but unmistakable.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you want to leave the room&mdash;with me?&rdquo; he
    whispered.  &ldquo;Go outside for a stroll?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she murmured back. &ldquo;That
    terrible man will return and he&rsquo;ll want to bully me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody shall bully you, Diana, not while I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything to help, Ted. Or, yes, you
    do help, just by your presence. Stand by, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; he responded emphatically, and then
    the men came in from the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">Coroner Hale addressed the waiting crowd.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Homer has been murdered,&rdquo; he said, quietly.  &ldquo;He
    has been stabbed in the back with a jeweled dagger, one of his own belongings,
    I am told. The blade reached his heart and death was practically instantaneous.
    The probability is that the victim made no sound and almost no movement after
    that attack. Did anyone near him hear any sound from him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was no response to this, and the coroner proceeded.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale was a tall, spare man, with sharp features and darting
    black eyes. He was evidently informed as to the known facts of the tragedy,
    and he looked piercingly at Diana and also at Marita as he talked.</p>
  <p align="left">Getting no reply to his question, he went on in curt, incisive
    sentences.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Homer was sitting at the time, sitting on a small
    sofa. The lights went off, as they do every night, and in the few moments
    of darkness someone procured the dagger from the small table where, I am
    told, it is accustomed to lie and, in the darkness or semi-darkness, drove
    the blade into the victim. I must now make some pointed inquiries. Who was
    in the room with Mr. Homer when the electric lights went out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The silence that followed this question was for a full minute
    unbroken.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale looked from one to another, noting the expressions on
    the various faces. Sergeant Cram also scrutinized the faces of the party.
    Diana still preserved her icy calm, and Marita&rsquo;s face was hidden in
    her hands.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I may as well state,&rdquo; Coroner Hale said, not unkindly,  &ldquo;that
    it will in no way help anyone to try to hide or evade the truth. It is, of
    course, known who was in that room, but for your own sake, I ask you to speak
    out and tell any facts bearing on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in the room,&rdquo; Diana said, then, &ldquo;I
    was standing near the sofa on which Mr. Homer was sitting. But I know no
    facts bearing on the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She spoke with perfect calm and a quiet dignity that commanded
    the respect of all present.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in the room, too!&rdquo; Marita exclaimed. Her
    voice was jerky, her manner excited, indeed, she gave the effect of speaking
    because Diana had spoken, &ldquo;I was near the sofa, too, at Mr. Homer&rsquo;s
    other side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And can you tell me anything more?&rdquo; asked Hale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; what is there to tell? We three were there, the
    lights went out. When the lights came on again, we saw Gaylord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were you standing, Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;N&mdash;no. I was&mdash;sitting on the arm of the sofa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Talking to Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. I mean I don&rsquo;t know
    whether I was talking or not, when the lights went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were not,&rdquo; Diana said; &ldquo;Mr. Homer was
    talking to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, he was,&rdquo; put in Hale. &ldquo;What was he talking
    about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was asking me if I would rather dance or go for a
    stroll in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you replied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t replied at all. Just then the darkness
    came. We are accustomed to it, we often don&rsquo;t notice it, but tonight,
    for some reason, it made us all silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the silence, then, you could of course hear if another
    person entered the room. Did you hear any such sound&mdash;any sound?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana hesitated. Her calm face gave no hint of what was passing
    in her mind save that her lips quivered a little.</p>
  <p align="left">At last she replied, with a murmured &ldquo;No&rdquo; so low-voiced
    that it could scarcely be heard at all.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale turned quickly to Marita.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you, Miss Moore?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I?&mdash;Me?&mdash;Why, no&mdash;no, indeed, I heard
    nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet in a silence, a two minute or more silence, a man
    was stabbed, killed, and you two, only a few inches from him, heard no sound?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, who was lying on a couch, nestled in a dozen pillows,
    sprang to an upright attitude.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I heard no sound,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There
    were lots of sounds, I heard a clock ticking, I heard low laughter and chatter
    from the lounge, I heard Mr. Harrison walk across the hall, I heard the parrot
    squawk in the dining-room, I heard&mdash;well, there were many confused sounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But did you hear any sound that you would judge made
    by Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Marita turned white and shivered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Diana, as pale as Marita, but keeping
    her poise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did either of you,&rdquo; Hale was very grave now, &ldquo;did
    either of you hear any sound that might have been made by some intruder,
    by someone who came into the room for the purpose of crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Marita, for Hale looked
    toward her. &ldquo;But by that I mean I didn&rsquo;t knowingly hear any such
    sound. There may have been such, however, for as I said, there were various
    vague and unidentifiable sounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hale looked at her in slight surprise. From a decidedly hysterical
    attitude she had roused herself to coherent talking and to definite description.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard no such indications, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not. But I heard nothing. That is, I do not remember
    hearing the clock tick or the parrot cry out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What were you thinking about? Having no intimation of
    the impending tragedy, what was occupying your thoughts at the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A look of desperate fear came into the blue eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">It was evident that now Diana had all she could do to keep
    her poise, to retain her calm.</p>
  <p align="left">But she struggled bravely with herself, and at last stammered
    out:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot tell you what I was thinking about, for I do
    not remember. Merely the trivial thoughts of the day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How far were you from Mr. Homer at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How far? Why, I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps a yard or
    so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, Diana,&rdquo; Marita broke in, &ldquo;you were
    not more than a foot from the couch Gaylord sat on. And you were coming toward
    it, you were about to sit down beside him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Marita, no, I was not. I meant to leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Hale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For no especial reason,&rdquo; Diana returned, naughtily
    now. &ldquo;I merely thought I would go into the lounge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And then dark came. You expected the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. It always occurred about ten o&rsquo;clock.
    But I never know the exact time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You did tonight,&rdquo; Marita said, &ldquo;because
    I had just told you it was five past ten. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I believe you had,&rdquo; Diana said, wearily. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t see that it matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Bingham,&rdquo; Hale turned to Ted, &ldquo;will
    you tell me exactly, as to the attitudes of the two ladies in the room with
    Mr. Homer. You were in the deep alcoved doorway that leads from that room
    to this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Attitudes?&rdquo; said Bingham. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, attitudes. Miss Moore, I am told, was sitting on
    the arm of the sofa. Was she at Mr. Homer&rsquo;s right or left side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why&mdash;let me see&mdash;the left, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I was on his left,&rdquo; Marita cried out. &ldquo;Why
    not ask me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were you touching him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When the dark came I had my hand on his shoulder, but
    as the light went out I took my hand away, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And jumped up from where you were sitting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I believe I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And&mdash;I&rsquo;m speaking to you, Mr. Bingham,&mdash;Miss
    Kittredge was on the right of Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, she was,&rdquo; Ted asserted. &ldquo;About four
    or five feet away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you had your back to them all, how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was from Sergeant Cram, and Ted thought to himself with
    what pleasure he could wring the detective&rsquo;s neck.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know, because I saw Miss Kittredge when the lights
    came on again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And at that time, Miss Moore had fallen to the floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ted, curtly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not my duty,&rdquo; Hale went on, in his harsh,
    rasping tones, &ldquo;to investigate the possibilities of this case, as to
    the identity of the murderer. That belongs in the jurisdiction of my colleague,
    Mr. Cram. It is for me to determine the method of the death, and that has
    been done. I shall have an inquest tomorrow afternoon, and it is necessary
    that you all remain here until after that time. Dr. and Mrs. Opdyke and their
    daughter will be permitted to go to their home, next door. The rest of you
    must remain until excused. The situation is a bit difficult, in that there
    seems to be no real head of the house. In his position of confidential secretary
    Mr. Harrison is, in a way, in authority. Who, Mr. Harrison, is Mr. Homer&rsquo;s
    heir or his next of kin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His next of kin, I think, is a second cousin, who lives
    in New York City. But as to his heir, I happen to know that Mr. Homer made
    a new will within the past week, and while I do not know its contents, I
    do know it is the only will he ever made, for he told me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is of interest, and must be looked into. Who is
    Mr. Homer&rsquo;s lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Crawford. Edgar Crawford of New York City. But he
    didn&rsquo;t draw up the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And who is the cousin in the city? What is his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Moffatt. His first name is either Alfred or Albert,
    I&rsquo;m not sure which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you find out? Mr. Moffatt should be notified at
    once of his cousin&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I can get his address from Mr. Homer&rsquo;s address
    book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Get it now, then. I think it only right to tell him
    the news tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is nearly midnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Get me the address, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison obeyed, and quickly finding the address and telephone
    number, Hale passed the book over to Sergeant Cram and asked him to call
    up Mr. Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call in the butler and housekeeper,&rdquo; Hale then
    directed, and Wood and Abbie Perkins appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale addressed the butler first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see any stranger or idler about the place today?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Wood replied. &ldquo;No one at all who
    didn&rsquo;t belong here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you noticed any unusual behavior on the part of
    Mr. Homer the last few days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. Except that he was a bit excited like, getting
    up this party. He looked forward to it, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it was his birthday party; that is, Sunday would
    be his birthday and there was to be extra doin&rsquo;s. And besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, man, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Besides, he always liked company and he looked forward
    to a good time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is not what you started to say. Why did you change
    your mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t change my mind, sir. I know nothing more
    of the matter than I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Neither he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke in Abbie Perkins. &ldquo;Wood
    is as honest as the day is long, and if he knew anything else he&rsquo;d
    tell it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you know? Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, that I don&rsquo;t. Only I can&rsquo;t help seein&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
    right under my nose, can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what was right under your nose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, only that Mr. Homer hoped and prayed that when this
    party was over and done with, a certain lady would be his fianc&eacute;e,
    that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Perkins bridled and smiled a little, evidently so full
    of her exclusive knowledge of her master&rsquo;s affairs that she felt a
    great superiority.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and who was the certain lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But in the meantime, Abbie Perkins had received such a black
    look from Ted Bingham, that she collapsed like a burst balloon.</p>
  <p align="left">He added a most negative shake of his head and was altogether
    so forbidding of aspect that she dared not go on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; she said, quickly
    calling out her reserves of diplomacy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the
    lady was, but Mr. Homer had just sort of intimated, you see, that there was
    somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think you do know the lady&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, cross my heart, I don&rsquo;t! But what does
    it matter now? And the poor man dead and all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Just then Cram returned, saying he had talked with Mr. Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Hale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was in bed, asleep, and it took me a few minutes
    to get him awake enough to understand what I was talking about. Then he seemed
    shocked of course, and asked what we wanted of him. I told him he ought to
    come up here, and he said he would come tomorrow, then added, that if necessary,
    he would come tonight. He began to get onto the true inwardness of the matter
    at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You told him it was murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, and while he was properly astounded he really
    showed little deep feeling. He said, again, &lsquo;Want I should come up
    there tonight?&rsquo; But I said tomorrow would do, for he couldn&rsquo;t
    get here under an hour or more, and I take it we&rsquo;re about through for
    tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think so. Better call an undertaker and have
    the body taken upstairs tonight. If Moffatt is the heir, I&rsquo;d like to
    have him here as soon as possible, but no use delaying things for his arrival.
    And your work, Cram, can be in no way assisted by keeping the dead man down
    here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no doubt about the method and the
    cause of death. I&rsquo;ll take charge of the dagger, it&rsquo;s a valuable
    piece of property, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Opdyke told them, &ldquo;it is a rare
    and valuable curio. It is a gold and jeweled weapon that was said to be used
    in the play of Othello, when given by Booth and Barrett. A fine piece of
    workmanship, aside from its associations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was it kept?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, where was it, Abbie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Always on the small table in the Tapestry Room. The
    table behind where Mr. Homer was sitting when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her feelings overcame her, and she ran from the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; said Hale, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t
    do anything more tonight. Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he nodded at the crowd, &ldquo;you
    are all dismissed for the night. Of course you are not under arrest or even
    detained, but you must stay in this house or grounds until you are given
    permission to leave. A dastardly crime has been committed, and the perpetrator
    must be brought to justice. Anyone who can do so must testify to any facts
    they know of. To withhold such testimony makes you an accessory and as liable
    to punishment as the principal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The coroner left the room and could be heard in the Tapestry
    Room, talking in low tones with the undertaker who had recently come in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come out for a breath of air,&rdquo; Ted Bingham begged
    of Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">But she only looked at him with cold eyes and said she must
    go to her room at once.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison cast longing eyes at Marita, but dared not cross the
    room to speak to her. Timid always, he was more embarrassed than ever now
    with the cloud of tragedy and crime hanging over the house, with the police
    giving furtive glances now and again toward the beautiful and defiant looking
    girl he adored.</p>
  <p align="left">He tried hard, did Harrison, to go to her side, but his weak
    will and weaker muscles refused to act for him.</p>
  <p align="left">Rollin Dare was not so timid. He went up to Marita, where she
    still reclined among her pillows and said, cheerily:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come on, Rita, come for a sprint through the gardens.
    It will make you feel a whole lot better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But after a moment of hesitation, Marita said no, she wanted
    to go to her room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, with her own gay smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    go with you tomorrow morning. I&rsquo;ll be better then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dare returned, &ldquo;good-night,
    then. Come along, Bobbie I&rsquo;ve got to get some fresh air, and I hate
    to walk alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott consented, and catching up a light wrap, went
    with him out to the garden.</p>
  <p align="left">Dare was not surprised, though it scared Bobbie, to find the
    whole place patrolled by policemen.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he whispered to her, as
    he pleasantly greeted the guards. &ldquo;Good-night, officer, we&rsquo;re
    just walking around a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But at last they managed to find an arbor out of earshot of
    the patrolmen, and Bobbie burst forth:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Rollin, tell me, do! Was it Marita?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not! Hush, don&rsquo;t say such things!
    Keep quiet, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it must have been Diana! It had to be one of them!
    You know it had to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anything of the sort. And if we
    do, we mustn&rsquo;t breathe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not? The truth has got to come out. Oh, Rollin,
    which one did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Listen here, Bobbie. I tell you you mustn&rsquo;t talk
    like that. Don&rsquo;t you see what a dreadful thing you&rsquo;re doing to
    accuse either of those girls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But it had to be one of them. They were in there alone
    with Gaylord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No matter if they were, you must not mention their names
    as possible suspects. If you do, you may get into deep trouble yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why? How? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But Dare refused to tell what he meant and forbade her to continue
    the subject.</p>

    Make Your Own Will</b></h2>
  <p align="left">WHEN Sergeant Cram arrived at Twin Towers the next morning,
    he was met by Bingham, who asked him to join him in a conference in the study
    on the second floor, where Homer&rsquo;s business matters were always attended
    to.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had breakfast?&rdquo; asked the detective,
    as they went up the stairs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I was up early.&rdquo; He ushered Cram into
    a pleasant room, where Cale Harrison sat at his desk.</p>
  <p align="left">Another and more elaborate desk was obviously the dead man&rsquo;s,
    and at this Bingham sat down, after offering Cram a near-by chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have decided,&rdquo; Bingham said, &ldquo;to take
    the helm myself. I don&rsquo;t mean in any officious or presumptuous way,
    but I feel somebody should take charge and as Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s near
    friend and chum, I think I am the one to do so. For the moment, at least.
    When it transpires that there is an executor or an inheritor, I will turn
    over to him a full report of all I have done and all the responsibilities
    I have incurred. But in the absence of such an authority, I feel myself justified
    in keeping an eye on developments as they occur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram looked at the speaker a little dubiously, but said nothing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The lawyer, Mr. Crawford, will come here this morning,
    and he may give us such information as will excuse me from any further duty.
    But until that occurs I propose to take charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can see no objection to your plan, Mr. Bingham. I
    assume Mr. Harrison also agrees to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes,&rdquo; said Cale Harrison, earnestly. &ldquo;I
    am merely a secretary, and I would wish for someone to whom I may report.
    I shall continue to do my work as usual, until I receive other orders from
    someone in a position to give them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is the office of the late Mr. Homer?&rdquo; asked
    Cram, looking about the room.</p>
  <p align="left">It was directly above the Tapestry Room on the first floor,
    and though equipped with office furniture, with desks and filing cabinets
    and a good-sized safe, the pieces were all evidently made to order of choice
    woods and were of fine workmanship. Also there were valuable pictures and
    lamps, and the desk fittings were of the finest variety. Those on Homer&rsquo;s
    desk were of carved jade, while Harrison&rsquo;s were of beautiful bronze
    work.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, it is the office,&rdquo; answered Harrison, &ldquo;though
    always called the study. But all business matters are looked after here.
    Mr. Homer was methodical and systematic in his business. You will find his
    papers and accounts in perfect order, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtless, oh, yes, doubtless,&rdquo; said Cram. &ldquo;Of
    course, the papers must be gone through, but it will be well to wait for
    the lawyer&rsquo;s arrival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; agreed Bingham. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Cram,
    what we want to talk over, Harrison and I, is the&mdash;er&mdash;the crime
    itself. Are you willing to say what you think as to&mdash;as to the identity
    of the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You put a difficult question, Mr. Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you saw the whole affair, that is, as much as anybody
    could see, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have a very decided opinion, and it is that the murderer
    is someone who came in from outside, and who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is an old proverb, Mr. Bingham, about the wish
    being father to the thought. May I suggest, that you strongly hope that the
    murderer did come in from outside, and that is the ground for your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The color flew to Ted&rsquo;s cheeks and brow, and the sympathetic
    Harrison also looked embarrassed and distressed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have other grounds,&rdquo; Ted said, struggling to
    retain his composure, &ldquo;I know perfectly well that no one in our party
    of friends here could have done such a thing. I know the servants are beyond
    suspicion. Therefore the doctrine of elimination points beyond doubt to an
    outsider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Elimination is a fine thing,&rdquo; Cram returned, &ldquo;but
    your knowledge and belief is not sufficient to eliminate the people in the
    house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you suspect any of us!&rdquo; exclaimed
    Harrison, in his scared way. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Harrison, that has yet to be determined. I am quite
    ready to admit we have a deep problem before us, but it cannot be solved
    by surmise or suspicion, nor yet by belief and faith. We must have evidence
    and testimony. They must be sifted and proved. Reliable and trustworthy witnesses
    must be heard and their stories listened to with care. It is too soon to
    point the finger of suspicion at anybody. Even if circumstances seem adverse,
    there may be extenuating conditions, there may be misleading facts. So, I
    cannot hazard an opinion at present as to the identity of the criminal, but
    at the inquest this afternoon, there may be facts brought forward and evidence
    given that will be significant if not decisive. Now, since we are here, I
    will put a question or two myself. Mr. Harrison, you mentioned a will of
    Mr. Homer&rsquo;s but you said it was not drawn up by his lawyer. Will you
    tell me further of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why&mdash;it was this way. Although conventional and
    of normal habits in most ways, Mr. Homer sometimes broke loose and became
    a law unto himself. In the matter of a will he did so. He had never made
    a will, but when he did conclude he wanted one he made it himself. He bought
    a book entitled, &lsquo;Make Your Own Will,&rsquo; and he read it thoroughly
    and then made his own will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is that will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it is in the book. You
    see, the book had a pocket in the back cover, and that pocket held a blank
    will. I mean a will with the preliminary matter already printed, and then
    various blanks for any legacies the testator desired to record. Mr. Homer
    showed me the book and the blank will when he bought it, and since then I
    have often seen him poring over the book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In this room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sometimes. But more often as he sat down in the Tapestry
    Room. He always sat there after dinner for a time, and he kept the will book
    down there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the bookshelves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Usually on the table, or carting it round in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The will must of course be found. Do you know the gist
    of its contents?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The book will, of
    course, turn up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. It will be found among his things somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Homer was a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;really, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t say. Mr. Crawford
    will tell you all such details. I&rsquo;m only a secretary, you see, and
    I hesitate to make statements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram thought to himself that Harrison hesitated to do almost
    anything at all, but he asked him no further questions at the time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can tell you that,&rdquo; broke in Bingham. &ldquo;I
    see no harm in saying that Gaylord Homer was a rich man. He inherited a pile
    from his father, and he has judiciously invested it until it has about doubled
    itself. I know this from what he has told me himself. Never a braggart, he
    has often expressed a satisfaction that he had the wherewithal to gratify
    his tastes for books and art objects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And do you know who was to be the beneficiary under
    his will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do not. I didn&rsquo;t know he had made a will, until
    Harrison told of it. I often said to Gaylord that he ought to make one, but
    he only laughed and said he was good for many years yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then he had no apprehensions, no fears of any enemy
    coming in to do him harm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not that I know of. Yet who can tell about his friends?
    Homer was not one to babble, and for all I know he may have had a dozen enemies
    who wanted to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit transparent, Mr. Bingham.&rdquo; Cram
    smiled a little. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want any of your friends in the house
    suspected, so you invent these enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite fair, Mr. Cram,&rdquo; said Harrison, his
    voice steady enough, but his fingers twitching nervously. &ldquo;Of course,
    none of us wants suspicion to rest on anyone in the household, if there is
    an enemy outside who may have done this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s natural enough,&rdquo; said Cram, quietly, &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;m going downstairs now, and before I go, I want to advise you two
    men not to talk the matter over too much with the others. It&rsquo;s wiser
    to keep your own counsel for the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old fossil!&rdquo; exclaimed Ted, as the detective disappeared
    downstairs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mid-Victorian! I&rsquo;d like to get an up-and-coming
    detective who could ferret out some unknown enemy of Gaylord&rsquo;s who
    sneaked in and killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; and Harrison glanced furtively at
    Bingham. &ldquo;But, you must realize, Mr. Bingham, there was no way an outsider
    could get in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because we were all in the hall or lounge or Tapestry
    Room when the lights went out. No outsider could have come in a dark house
    and made his way to the Tapestry Room in the dark and committed the murder
    in the dark and got out again, in the dark, without being heard or seen by
    some of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem likely, but, hang it all,
    Cale, it must have happened, for you know as well as I do that neither of
    those girls stabbed Gaylord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Harrison sighed, &ldquo;I know it, but can
    we make the police believe it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; and Ted banged his hand down on the
    desk before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down and dog the footsteps of that
    Cram person. I shan&rsquo;t let him put his rotten stuff over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cale Harrison watched the other man as he swung out of the
    door and down the stairs.</p>
  <p align="left">The secretary was a personable man, fair-haired, blue-eyed
    and of good complexion. He was neither a prig nor a sissy, yet he lacked
    a firmness of speech which gave him the effect of lacking firmness of character.
    This was not the truth. Cale Harrison had a strong will and a quick, sane
    power of judgment. But his environment as a child had made him shy in manner
    and over-modest as to his own attainments.</p>
  <p align="left">Gaylord Homer had noticed this, and in his good-natured way
    had tried to uproot it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a vice,&rdquo; he had once said to
    Cale. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t want you to cultivate wickedness, but take
    it from me, a chap too goody-goody can&rsquo;t get along in these hectic
    days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The remark had settled into Cale&rsquo;s mind, and he had thought
    it over many times. Although in some ways he had scorned Gaylord Homer, in
    other ways he had greatly admired him. For Harrison was a close observer,
    and he had long since come to the conclusion that a small portion of vice,
    of some wild sort, ought to be his.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, not being entirely above human curiosity, he was impatient
    to know what legacy his employer had left to him in that home-made will of
    his.</p>
  <p align="left">For a substantial sum had been promised, and Gaylord had worked
    hard over the precious document.</p>
  <p align="left">On an impulse, Harrison began to look through the drawers of
    Homer&rsquo;s desk in an attempt to find the important will book and will.</p>
  <p align="left">Engrossed in this pursuit, he was startled at the entrance
    of Lawyer Crawford and Detective Sergeant Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; Harrison said, &ldquo;beg pardon come
    in, be seated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was no reason for this embarrassment, for the secretary
    always had free access to his employer&rsquo;s papers.</p>
  <p align="left">As always, his shyness brought about an air of bravado, of
    superciliousness, and he covered his confusion by an overdone carelessness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, here you are,&rdquo; he said, dropping the papers
    he held. &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Crawford responded duly and paid little attention to Harrison&rsquo;s
    nervousness. For he knew the secretary well, but to Cram this flustered manner
    was peculiar, even suspicious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was looking for Mr. Homer&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; Cale
    went on,  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He never made any,&rdquo; said Crawford, promptly.</p>
  <p align="left">And then Harrison had to tell him of the will book and the
    will that Gaylord Homer had drawn up for himself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; the lawyer exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    no sense in such a thing! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I have drawn his will, as I
    attended to all his other legal business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; Harrison said,
    looking helplessly at him; &ldquo;only I do know that is what Mr. Homer did,
    and the will must be around somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What were the terms of the will?&rdquo; stormed the
    lawyer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know a lot about it, Harrison, and it is your duty
    to tell,&rdquo; Cram informed him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo; asked the vacillating secretary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think so. Though of course the will must be found.
    Who was the principal beneficiary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A&mdash;a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss&mdash;Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective made a half articulate noise in his throat, which,
    however, was more intelligible than the &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; of Lawyer Crawford.</p>
  <p align="left">While the three men in the study set up a determined search
    for the will, the lady who, as Harrison said, was the chief beneficiary,
    was taking part in what for lack of a more descriptive term may be called
    a scene.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, with Marita and Bobbie Abbott, sat in the lounge, and
    though the conversation had at first been conventional and courteous, it
    was now becoming more and more personal.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie had brought about the climax when she said,  &ldquo;Of
    course neither of you girls could have done such a thing, but who did kill
    Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita&rsquo;s temper, always inflammable, burst into flame
    at this, and she exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the same as saying that either Diana or
    I must have done it! And I hereby declare that I didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Though possessing plenty of self-control, Diana let it go to
    the winds at this speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must certainly declare also that I didn&rsquo;t do
    it!&rdquo;  Diana said, in a cold cutting voice that somehow seemed to carry
    more weight than Marita&rsquo;s hasty speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course you did, Di,&rdquo; Marita cried; &ldquo;I
    didn&rsquo;t, and there was no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think my statement must be believed before yours,&rdquo;  Diana
    said, slowly. &ldquo;I am in the habit of speaking the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her eloquent pause was more scathing than any denunciation
    could have been.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita flew into a fearful rage, and so wildly did she gesticulate
    and so madly pour forth her words that she was like a whirling dervish.</p>
  <p align="left">Frightened, Bobbie tried to catch Marita, to calm her, but
    the angry girl flew at Diana and attempted to strike her, screaming out anathemas
    in Spanish that were understandable only from their accompanying gestures.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana coolly grasped the outstretched hands, and said, contemptuously, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    be a fool, Marita. Stop this nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The clear, incisive tone, more than the words, checked Marita&rsquo;s
    ebullition of wrath, and she cowered a little, though casting venomous glances
    at Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t kill Gaylord,&rdquo; Diana went
    on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll make everybody think you did by such actions. Now,
    behave yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This stirred up Marita afresh, and she was about to begin a
    new tirade, when Wood appeared at the doorway with a stranger.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is Mr. Moffatt, ladies,&rdquo; Wood said, urbanely.  &ldquo;I
    will call Mr. Harris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The butler went upstairs, and Diana took charge of the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am Miss Kittredge,&rdquo; she said, with a touch of
    hauteur in her calm tones. &ldquo;This is Mrs. Abbott and Miss Moore. I suppose
    you are Mr. Moffatt, the cousin of Gaylord Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a low, pleasant voice. &ldquo;I
    was told of the&mdash;er&mdash;trouble last night, and I came as soon as
    I could this morning. May I&mdash;would you tell me some of the particulars?
    Was Gaylord still calm and perfectly composed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana answered him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Gaylord was killed, stabbed
    to death. The police are in charge here and will, I dare say, see you at
    once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The visitor looked dazed, not only at the news given him, but,
    it was plain to be seen, at the manner of this beautiful but strange girl.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita was huddled on the couch, her face turned away from
    them, and her shoulders heaving with deep sobs and occasional moans.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie, still scared over the fuss between the two girls, was
    also interested in the stranger. It wouldn&rsquo;t be Bobbie Abbott, if she
    were not interested in any man who came within her ken.</p>
  <p align="left">And this man looked attractive. His tall, gaunt form and lean,
    rugged face gave somewhat the effect of a modern Forty-niner, though his
    apparel was modish and his manner courteous and suave.</p>
  <p align="left">So Bobbie had to get into the game.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The inquest will be this afternoon,&rdquo; she vouchsafed,
    adding, &ldquo;but I suppose you knew that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know it before Moffatt said. Will
    it be held here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; Bobbie spoke uncertainly,
    but neither of the others volunteered any help.</p>
  <p align="left">And then the three men from upstairs came down, and Harrison
    stepped forward and greeted the visitor.</p>
  <p align="left">In his nervous, embarrassed way, he introduced the lawyer and
    the detective, and then, to his great relief, he was ignored and Mr. Moffatt
    became the center of attention.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are a cousin of the late Gaylord Homer?&rdquo; Cram
    asked him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A second cousin,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Our fathers
    were cousins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were intimate friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Moffatt said, settling back in his chair, &ldquo;not
    intimate friends, but always friendly. I came here to see Gaylord once or
    twice a year, but our tastes varied widely and while we were not uncongenial,
    we had little in common. Also,&rdquo; he smiled a little, &ldquo;I am a proud
    man, and I was unwilling to seem as if I was sponging on my cousin for entertainment
    or hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Cram, nodding his head. &ldquo;And
    when did you see Mr. Homer last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About two or three weeks ago, I was up here and staid
    over night. We had a pleasant visit, rather more so than usual, and Gaylord
    asked me to come again in the summer time, in July, he said. I promised to
    do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You live in New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, in rooms in Thirty-eighth street. I have lived
    there for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you help us in any way? You see, Mr. Homer was stabbed
    by an unknown foe. Can you think of any enemy he had who would do such a
    thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. You see, I knew very few of Gaylord&rsquo;s
    acquaintances and he knew few of mine. But he must have had a fierce enemy
    to do such a thing as that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed, yes. Do you know of other relatives he had?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think I am the only one of his kin. I have heard him
    say so many times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And do you know anything about his intended disposition
    of his property?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a thing. Some years ago, he said he would leave
    me a small bequest. But I never counted on it, partly because it is my habit
    never to count on anything until I get it, and partly because Gaylord was
    younger than I and would probably outlive me. Moreover, I am not in need.
    While not wealthy, my wants are simple and I can supply them myself. But
    I am overcome at the tragedy of his death. I want to do anything I can to
    help. I mean in tracking down the wretch who killed him and bringing him
    to justice. Please command me, Mr. Cram, and I will do anything I can to
    aid you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you not in business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am a real estate agent. But my time is my
    own, and I repeat, if I can help, I will willingly do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know the Tapestry Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Surely. I&rsquo;ve been here frequently, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was there Mr. Homer was sitting when he was stabbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sitting there? Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There were guests all about the house. It was what we
    call the dark time. You know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember now, when I was here last, the lights
    went off soon after dinner and then flashed on suddenly after a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly. It was during those few moments that the tragedy
    occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt pondered this.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you mean he was struck
    down in the darkness? Or were there candles or something like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, there were no candles lighted. The blow must have
    been dealt in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Again Moffatt seemed to think deeply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That would seem to indicate that someone in the house
    did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; agreed Cram. &ldquo;Do you
    remember a very handsome dagger Mr. Homer had, a treasure, really?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A dagger? No, I don&rsquo;t think I remember it. Where
    was it kept?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where, Mr. Harrison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It always lay on the mosaic table in the Tapestry Room.
    It must have been there when you were here last, Mr. Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doubtless it was, but I&rsquo;ve no recollection of
    it. That&rsquo;s what I meant when I said my cousin and I had not the same
    tastes. I never cared for those curios and bits of bric-a-brac that he so
    loved. I am an outdoorsy man, and I love all outdoor sports. Gaylord loved
    his books and his collections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cram went on, feeling that this cousin
    was entitled to the facts of the affair, &ldquo;the dagger lay on the table
    and was picked up and used by the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt gave a little gasp and then apologized.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose, sergeant,
    these things are every day matters to you, but to me it is a shock. Have
    you any idea of the identity of the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The inquest will be held this afternoon. I assume you
    will attend it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course. Can I be put up for the night, or shall
    I go back to the city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As you like, Mr. Moffatt. There are rooms enough, perhaps
    you would better stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I assume Mrs. Perkins will make me comfortable.
    I came unprepared, but I will telephone for my man to bring me a bag.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</a><br>
    A Flood of Questions</b></h2>
  <p align="left">ABBIE PERKINS couldn&rsquo;t shut her mouth.</p>
  <p align="left">Which doesn&rsquo;t mean she couldn&rsquo;t keep her own counsel,
    for she jolly well could do that. But owing to an unfortunate formation of
    jawbone and teeth, her lips refused to stay closed.</p>
  <p align="left">So, as opportunity creates the sinner, she talked a great deal.
    Perhaps her ingrained economy made her feel that since her mouth was open
    necessarily, she might as well use it for conversation.</p>
  <p align="left">She took Bert Moffatt to a pleasant room on the third floor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Kinda up in the world,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but
    as you know, Mr. Moffatt, we ain&rsquo;t got such a lot of extra bedrooms.
    And if this here house party is going to stay on indefinite like, and it
    does seem &rsquo;sif they&rsquo;re going to, why, I&rsquo;ll be put about
    to take care of &rsquo;em. But, my land, there&rsquo;s room enough of course,
    only, I just can&rsquo;t get used to doing without Mr. Homer. Say, Mr. Moffatt,&rdquo;  she
    entered the room with him and closed the door, &ldquo;who in the mortal universe
    killed that blessed man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt looked at her earnestly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Abbie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
    I suppose suspicion will rest on those two girls. Yet it couldn&rsquo;t have
    been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush, Mr. Moffatt, no good singing out names. The whole
    crowd is upset enough. You see, one of those girls was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Which one was Gaylord&rsquo;s choice of the two?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Miss Kittredge. He worshipped the ground she walked
    on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the dark-eyed beauty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir; that&rsquo;s Miss Moore. And, if you please,
    she&rsquo;s as madly in love with Mr. Homer as he is with Miss Kittredge.
    Was, I s&rsquo;pose I should say. I just can&rsquo;t get used to having him
    in the past tense, as you might say. Well, there&rsquo;s the case in a peanut
    shell. Of them two girls, one loved him and he loved the other. And&mdash;they
    was both in that room with him when he died, and&mdash;nobody else was. Figure
    it out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Any sign of a burglar? Anything missing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not as I know of. But, land, they haven&rsquo;t begun
    any searching business yet. Going to wait till after the inquest, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me all the names of the people staying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie recounted the house guests and added the three Opdykes
    from next door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she finished her list. &ldquo;Now,
    can&rsquo;t you do something to help?&rdquo; she looked at Moffatt wistfully. &ldquo;You
    always were a good friend of Gaylord&rsquo;s, he liked you, even if you didn&rsquo;t
    come here often. Are you any sort of a detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; Moffatt smiled. &ldquo;But I
    do take an interest in ferreting out a mystery, especially when it has to
    do with my own relative. If I can help, Abbie, you may be sure I will. But
    of course, the police have it in charge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. But between you and me and the sewing
    machine, I don&rsquo;t set such great store by them police. They poke around
    and pry into things, but do they get anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This looks to me like a difficult case, Abbie, and,
    from what you tell me, a delicate case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, Mr. Moffatt! Mighty delicate.
    Think of those two girls, right there beside him, and nobody else in the
    room, and then, lights up! Man dead! Pretty awful, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is, indeed. Run along, now, Abbie. Send up my things
    when they come. I telephoned my Jap to bring a suitcase or two. I suppose
    I&rsquo;ll want dress things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sir, they&rsquo;re a dressy lot, yes, but what
    they&rsquo;ll do now, I couldn&rsquo;t say. Miss Kittredge, she has switched
    herself into a black frock, I see, but Miss Moore, she&rsquo;s got on a white
    dress. Oh, well, they can&rsquo;t all get into blacks. I&rsquo;ll be going
    along now, Mr. Moffatt. Everything&rsquo;s all right in this room, I know,
    I looked after it myself. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here, sir, it didn&rsquo;t
    seem decent to have none of the family connections round about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to represent the family, as far as that
    goes, but I confess, Abbie, I&rsquo;m a little bewildered at the whole affair.
    I can&rsquo;t form any opinions or come to any conclusions until I know more
    about it all. It&rsquo;s the strangest case I ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">If it seemed strange to Albert Moffatt at that time, it seemed
    even more so when he went downstairs shortly after and joined the party at
    luncheon.</p>
  <p align="left">Without being asked, he was given the seat Gaylord had occupied
    at the head of the table. This embarrassed him a little, but he remembered
    his promise to Abbie to represent the family, and he tried to do his best.</p>
  <p align="left">As all kept their respective seats, he found himself between
    Diana and Marita, and the prospect of table-talk with those two young women
    gave him cold shivers.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet he needn&rsquo;t have felt too apprehensive, for the girls
    took the situation in hand.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana&rsquo;s course was to ignore him utterly, and he soon
    saw that there was nothing invidious about that, for she ignored everybody
    else as well.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, on the other hand, talked incessantly to him and to
    everybody else. It was a nervous, hysterical chatter, full of broken sentences
    and anguished exclamations.</p>
  <p align="left">She looked beautiful, her big, dark eyes pathetically filled
    with tears, her mocking laughter stilled, her low, tropical sounding voice
    quivering with half suppressed sobs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was so dear,&rdquo; Marita murmured, for about the
    twentieth time. &ldquo;There never was such a man as Gaylord. Fine, strong,
    generous&mdash;oh, I think he was a very king among men! And how could anyone
    strike down a man like that? How could anybody drive that terrible dagger
    straight to his heart&mdash;his warm, loving heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, do hush, Marita,&rdquo; burst from Diana. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    drive me crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes? And why not? Are you not already crazy, from grief,
    remorse, regret, a stricken conscience?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stop it, Marita!&rdquo; Ted Bingham shouted. &ldquo;I
    won&rsquo;t allow you to act like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And who gave you authority to tell me how to act? I
    say, Mr. Moffatt, do you think that man ought to dictate to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt was at his wits&rsquo; end. Never before had he been
    in a position like this. How could he answer this excited, emotional girl
    when at his other side sat that icicle, that snow-maiden, who said no word
    and betrayed no feeling.</p>
  <p align="left">But to his relief, Marita didn&rsquo;t wait for an answer,
    but went ahead with her tirade, unheeding whether anyone listened or not.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And now comes this inquest!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;An
    inquest! What is that? I shall be asked questions! Yes? And I shall answer,
    yes, answer!&rdquo;  her fierce gaze swept the faces of her listeners, coming
    to rest on Diana, who showed a slight, supercilious smile at the excited
    talker.</p>
  <p align="left">This further roused Marita&rsquo;s ire, and she went on:  &ldquo;And
    I shall tell the truth&mdash;tell who it was who drove that dreadful weapon
    home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See that you do tell the truth, Marita,&rdquo; Diana
    said, slowly and coldly, and then, as if dismissing the subject once for
    all, she turned to Ted Bingham and said, &ldquo;I suppose we can all go home
    as soon as it&rsquo;s over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Di,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;but
    I think probably, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The luncheon dragged to a close, and they all rose to go to
    the lounge, where the inquest would take place.</p>
  <p align="left">Coroner Hale was apparently anxious to get matters started.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sit here, please,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Will you sit here?&rdquo; he
    said to them as they appeared before him.</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham kept a firm grip on Diana&rsquo;s arm and, unheeding
    the coroner&rsquo;s directions, led her to a davenport, on which he made
    her comfortable with cushions and then sat down beside her.</p>
  <p align="left">Seeing this performance, Cale Harrison whispered to Marita
    and they two ensconced themselves on another davenport.</p>
  <p align="left">The eyes of the small but capable jury took this all in as
    they gazed curiously at the two girls. Rollin Dare sat by Bobbie Abbott and
    the Opdykes were all together.</p>
  <p align="left">The parents had greatly wanted to leave Polly at home, but
    the authorities demanded her presence, as they did all who were known to
    be in the house at the time of the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">The inquest was not very formal and perhaps not exactly conventional.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale chose rather to make a conversational affair of it and
    addressed himself first of all to Harrison, the secretary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just tell in your own words,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
    you did exactly, on leaving the dining-room after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was one of the last to leave the dining-room,&rdquo;  Cale
    said, speaking easily enough. &ldquo;I went through the hall behind Mrs.
    Abbott and one or two of the others. I chanced to glance into the Tapestry
    Room as I passed, and I saw Mr. Bingham in the doorway between that room
    and this. I went on by them all and went upstairs. The evening mail had been
    brought in while we were at dinner and it is my habit to go over it and sort
    out anything that may need immediate attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You then went up to Mr. Homer&rsquo;s study?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you remained there at work until&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Until after the lights had gone off and had come on
    again, and I had heard a cry from downstairs and also a general commotion
    of people moving about and uttering exclamations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And then you went downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and found Mr. Homer had been killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember doing anything in particular.
    I was a bit stunned, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. In a moment Dr. Opdyke
    came in and took charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told he put you in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Merely in a nominal way. I, mean the doctor took charge
    of the situation in the Tapestry Room, examined the wound and told us all
    that Mr. Homer was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then Hale turned to Albert Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are the nearest relative of Mr. Gaylord Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and so far as I know the only relative. I am a
    second cousin, and there are no other second cousins that I know of, and
    no nearer relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You live in New York City?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, in East Thirty-eighth Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am a real estate agent, in the firm of Garson, Kemp
    and Co.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you last evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I dined at the Yale Club and afterward went to a Moving
    Picture show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went to a small club, where I met some friends, stayed
    with them until about half past eleven and then went home and went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, now will you please tell us anything you may know
    of the doings of Mr. Homer, lately? Please do not take offense at my questions,
    I only want to learn all I can of the facts. You know, a coroner&rsquo;s
    jury doesn&rsquo;t do anything but discover the cause of death. Then, if
    it seems to the police that the matter needs further investigation, they
    take up that part of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am quite willing to tell anything I can, but as a
    matter of fact I have not seen Mr. Homer for two or three weeks. Though as
    a rule, I don&rsquo;t see him but twice a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were good friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very good friends, but never intimates. My cousin invited
    me here twice a year, and I usually accepted the invitations. He was companionable
    enough, and we hit it off all right, but we had few tastes in common and
    so seldom sought each other&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were here two weeks ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did anything especial occur during your visit here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, nothing at all. In fact, we had rather a dull time.
    The weather was wretched, and as I am fond of outdoor sports, and could have
    none, I was frankly bored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You two were housed, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most of the time. Gaylord invited a couple of his chums
    in to play bridge but the time dragged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When you were here, did Mr. Homer tell you any of his
    affairs, his personal affairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not to any great extent. But he let drop that he thought
    of marrying if he could win the lady of his choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he say who the lady was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he say how his property would be left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes. But he referred to it in a jesting way. He
    told me he was going to draw up his own will; that he had a book of explicit
    directions and meant to do it all himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In order to save the lawyer&rsquo;s fees?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I assumed so, though he didn&rsquo;t say that. I reminded
    him how lawyers have said that those books directing people how to make a
    will have brought large emoluments to the lawyers themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The idea being that even with the instruction book,
    the average citizen is so incapable of making a proper will, that the lawyers
    have to be called in to settle the estate, thereby getting larger fees than
    if they had drawn the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. And did Mr. Homer make this will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He merely told me he intended to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he say how his property would be left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only in a general way. He said there would be enough
    coming to me to buy a ring to remember him by. He said he should generously
    remember the servants who had for the most part been with him a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he speak of a residuary legatee or principal beneficiary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this point Albert Moffatt began to look worried. He tried
    to ignore the question, but the coroner repeated it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he did say something of the sort,&rdquo; Moffatt
    admitted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, exactly, did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He said that the bulk of his estate he should will to
    the lady he hoped to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did he then mention the name of the lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I would very much like to be excused from answering
    that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A stir of something like admiration ran round the room. Moffatt
    was a good-looking chap, though firm-lipped and with a shade of stubbornness
    in his eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must ask you to answer, Mr. Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, no; he didn&rsquo;t mention her name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did you hesitate to answer that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For a moment Moffatt was silent. He seemed to be making up
    his mind. He was in no way embarrassed, and his dark, rather somber eyes
    looked steadily at the coroner. His clean-shaven face was strong and his
    jaw showed determination. Then, with a sudden jerk of his head, he spoke
    what was in his mind.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to quibble,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but
    it was this way. My cousin did not tell me the name of the lady in question,
    but he showed me her photograph. And so I know her name&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Diana Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was no great surprise to anyone present, for they all
    knew of Homer&rsquo;s passion for Diana and knew, too, that it was well-nigh
    hopeless.</p>
  <p align="left">But Moffatt didn&rsquo;t know this, and he assumed that the
    pair were practically engaged.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did it happen that Mr. Homer showed you the picture
    but withheld the name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I chanced to go into his study one day, and he was gazing
    at a small picture he held in his hand. It was merely a snapshot. He held
    it out for me to look at and then said that he hoped some day she would be
    his wife. I asked no questions and he put the picture back in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now Mr. Moffatt, we have not found your cousin&rsquo;s
    will, and we are anxious to do so. Have you any idea where he would put it
    for safe keeping?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo; Moffatt looked astonished. &ldquo;I
    know nothing at all of Gaylord&rsquo;s affairs. Surely, his secretary or
    his household can tell you, or his lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. Did Mr. Homer speak to you of any other lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not that I remember. He may have made casual allusions,
    but nothing definite in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have not heard from him since your recent visit
    here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. We never wrote to one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you know of no other relatives Mr. Homer possessed,
    except yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know of none, though there may be some one on his
    mother&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then Mr. Moffatt, do you realize that if no such relatives
    put in an appearance and if Mr. Homer&rsquo;s will is not found, you will
    be sole heir to the estate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt&rsquo;s eyes widened a trifle, but otherwise he showed
    no elation or excitement.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose that would thrill most men,&rdquo; he said,
    with a little smile. &ldquo;But I am simple in my tastes and have never longed
    for great riches. Should I be heir to the estate of my cousin, I would do
    my best to manage it wisely and carry out any plans or projects he had in
    mind, if I am advised of them. But I sincerely hope his will may be forthcoming,
    that his own wishes and desires may be known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This speech was in no way rhetorical; every one present felt
    it to be the simple, straightforward statement of a man of plain tastes and
    right feeling.</p>
  <p align="left">It seemed to say that if the fortune of Gaylord Homer was meant
    for Miss Kittredge, he wanted her to have it, but if the law designated it
    as his, he would accept the responsibility of it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are the first man I have ever known, Mr. Moffatt,
    who was not anxious to get any money that was coming to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A dull red rose to Moffatt&rsquo;s cheeks, but he only said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps I did not express myself clearly. I do not scorn
    riches, but neither am I eager for them. To my mind the great object now
    to be decided is to discover who murdered my cousin. To apprehend the criminal,
    I would willingly devote any inheritance that may come to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was a sort of talk that with less sincerity of manner
    might sound bombastic or hypocritical. But there was no false note in Moffatt&rsquo;s
    voice, no hint of diplomacy; his candid air and ingenuous countenance carried
    conviction and made for confidence.</p>
  <p align="left">Coroner Hale noted that this man did not take kindly to any
    impugning of his motives, and said no more on the subject.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, I take it,&rdquo; he wound up, &ldquo;that you
    can give us no hint as to who the murderer may have been? You know of no
    person sufficiently inimical to Gaylord Homer to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly do not,&rdquo; Moffatt replied, quietly, &ldquo;but
    I shall do all in my power to aid in finding out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He was excused and Hale drew a sigh as he realized that he
    must soon question the two he dreaded, the witnesses he shrank from, the
    two girls that were in the room.</p>
  <p align="left">But at present he called the doctor who had first attended
    the victim of the attack.</p>
  <p align="left">Eden Opdyke gave his recital over again, telling of the stab
    wound that had proved fatal.</p>
  <p align="left">Opdyke was one of the men that can be called the magnificent
    type.</p>
  <p align="left">He had a mass of snow white hair, bushy and a trifle long;
    piercing black eyes peered out from beneath shaggy white eyebrows, and yet
    his healthily red cheeks and smooth, sun-browned skin bespoke not age but
    a youngish middle age.</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, he was fifty, but save for his white hair,
    he might easily have passed for forty-five.</p>
  <p align="left">He was adored by his wife and daughter, and they were equally
    dear to him.</p>
  <p align="left">As he told the details of the wound that had killed his friend
    and neighbor, his voice was unsteady and a hard note was heard in it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The dagger entered between the seventh and eighth ribs,&rdquo; Hale
    repeated the doctor&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Yes, I found it so. Now, would
    you not say that a knowledge of anatomy was necessary to strike the heart
    so surely as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a very great knowledge,&rdquo; returned Opdyke,
    thoughtfully.  &ldquo;A tyro could accomplish the stroke, though a slight
    familiarity with the bones would, of course, be an advantage. The difficult
    part of the matter was the striking in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it actually dark when the lights go off at the power-house?&rdquo; Hale
    inquired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Opdyke told him. &ldquo;Unless one has
    candles or oil lamps in readiness it is black dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then the blow was planned while the lights were on and
    delivered the instant they went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was probably so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it likely that after a stab like that, a man would
    move?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not likely, but possible. There may have been a convulsive
    muscular movement, or merely a slump down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would he make any sound?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He might utter a groan or a sigh. Or, as is more probable,
    he would make no sound at all or, perhaps a slight gurgle in the throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would not a man, stabbed in the back, fall forward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If he were standing, yes. But Mr. Homer was seated,
    and, as I noticed, he was leaning rather far back. Therefore, when he lost
    control of his muscles he simply sagged down in a heap and did not really
    fall forward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And there was no blood flow, outside his garments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;None. And but a little inside his clothing. The dagger
    was a sharp one, with two cutting sides. It was thrust in laterally, between
    the ribs, but aimed downward. So it pierced the heart at once, causing instant
    death or practically instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6">Chapter 6</a><br>
    Sky-Eyes and the Other Girl</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;ONE more question, Dr. Opdyke,&rdquo; the Coroner said. &ldquo;Does
    the dagger-thrust that was given presuppose a strong, muscular arm that made
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The fine face of the doctor took on a slightly annoyed expression.</p>
  <p align="left">But he replied, steadily: &ldquo;Not necessarily. It did not
    require great force&mdash;anyone nerved by anger or hatred could have given
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is all, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Still looking vaguely upset, Dr. Opdyke resumed his seat beside
    his wife, and Hale next called Abbie Perkins.</p>
  <p align="left">She had been sitting in the front row, watching proceedings,
    with her mouth open and her expensive and very white porcelain teeth exposed
    in two shining rows.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; the Coroner asked curtly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Abigail Perkins, and as good as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie&rsquo;s voice held no trace of pertness, it was as one
    stating a simple fact, and she was evidently resentful of Hale&rsquo;s lack
    of courtesy.</p>
  <p align="left">That he understood was obvious from his rising color and he
    continued in a more gentle tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you when the murder occurred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean where was I in the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, put it that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in my own room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land, no. What would I be doing going to bed at that
    hour? In my sitting-room, I mean, just back of the breakfast room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were there during the whole of the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was. I most always am, or try to be. I don&rsquo;t
    like the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it absolutely dark, or could you see a little?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dark as the black cat&rsquo;s pocket. It is every night.
    But we don&rsquo;t bother to light candles, for it&rsquo;s over in a minute
    or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were you in your sitting-room all through the dinner
    hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no. I was back and forth in the pantry and kitchen.
    And some of the time I was in the breakfast room looking at the party. I
    like to look in at the pretty ladies and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When you watched the diners, did you notice anything
    unusual or peculiar in Mr. Homer&rsquo;s manner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. That poor man didn&rsquo;t know
    he was going to be killed! Why should he act queer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did anybody act queer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t for me to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly for you to say. And you&rsquo;ll
    say it. If you noticed anything peculiar about any of the guests, you&rsquo;ll
    tell it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, not to say peculiar. But as you&rsquo;re outside
    like, you can judge a lot about those as isn&rsquo;t talking, but just looking
    their thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course you can,&rdquo; Hale sought to draw her
    out. &ldquo;And what did you judge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I judged there was some people present who didn&rsquo;t
    like Mr. Homer overmuch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. And who were these people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s no secret that Miss
    Kittredge liked him about as much as a cat likes hot soap. And I likewise
    s&rsquo;pose that Mr. Harrison wasn&rsquo;t crazy about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think I have a right to protest against this sort
    of witnessing,&rdquo; Cale Harrison put in. He didn&rsquo;t speak angrily,
    but rather in an injured tone, as if it was a matter of small importance
    anyway.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you notice, Mrs. Perkins, that some of the people
    did like Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t need your fur-off glasses to
    see that Miss Moore was over head and ears in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this Marita clapped her hands, and murmured, &ldquo;Good
    for you, Abbie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hale went on, unheeding. &ldquo;Mrs. Perkins, where were you
    when the guests left the table and left the dining-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in the breakfast room, watching the ladies go
    by, in their fine gowns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The whole party passed you and went out to the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then they dispersed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Separated&mdash;went various ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, they did. I saw Mr. Homer go into the Tapestry
    Room with Miss Moore a-clinging to one of his arms and Miss Kittredge trying
    to get away from him on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Trying to get away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just that. He was urging her along, and she was hanging
    back, like. He had a grip on her arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then these three went in the Tapestry Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yeppee, that&rsquo;s right. And Mr. Harrison, he scooted
    off upstairs, and the rest of them sorter trailed along into the lounge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you went back to your Sitting-room and then the
    dark time came?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly. You got it dead right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was the butler at the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see. Better ask him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Seeming relieved to be rid of this peppery witness, Hale turned
    to Wood, the butler, and asked him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in the dining-room, sir, beginning to clear the
    table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did you do in the darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stopped where I stood, until the lights came on again.
    We always do that every night. For, if you move about you may collide with
    somebody else and upset something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were all the other servants out there with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Out where, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Out in the dining-room, or kitchen, or pantry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, except maybe one or two of the maids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where would they be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think one was in the lounge, looking after the ash
    trays, sir, and one may have been upstairs, in the ladies&rsquo; dressing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Find out definitely and bring me any of the servants
    who were not under your eye in the kitchen quarters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A mere nod on the part of Wood brought one maid from the huddled
    bunch of servants in the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is Rhoda,&rdquo; the butler said. &ldquo;She is
    the parlormaid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where were you, Rhoda, at the dark time?&rdquo; Hale
    asked her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was upstairs, sir, in case the ladies wanted my help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When did you come down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When I heard the scream, that is just after the lights
    came on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were there any ladies upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No sir, not any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And when you heard the scream, you ran downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t run. I came to the head of the stairs
    and looked down. Then I saw them all running about, and the ladies saying, &lsquo;Oh,
    dear!&rsquo;  and I came halfway downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was Mr. Harrison upstairs then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, he had gone down&mdash;he must have, &rsquo;cause
    he didn&rsquo;t pass me on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were any other of the maids upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or downstairs, in the lounge or hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. I tidied up the lounge myself, before I went
    upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are a capable servant, Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I try to do my duty, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hale looked at the girl sharply. To his discerning eye she
    seemed a little too good to be true. She was so smooth and oily that he concluded
    she could evade the truth if she wished to do so. But he had no hook to hang
    any suspicion of her on. No reason whatever to doubt her word, yet somehow
    he did doubt it. He sighed and dismissed the suave Rhoda.</p>
  <p align="left">And then he felt he could no longer put off the two witnesses
    he most dreaded.</p>
  <p align="left">He glanced at the two girls, uncertain which to call first.</p>
  <p align="left">Then in a quiet voice, he said, &ldquo;Miss Kittredge, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the response, in the sweetest tones,
    he thought, he had ever heard.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Trying to put it over on me, are you?&rdquo; he said
    to himself and set his face more sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You went into the Tapestry Room with Mr. Homer, on your
    way from the dinner table?&rdquo; he said, not so much interrogatively but
    as if making a statement.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Willingly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana looked a little surprised, but answered, steadily:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not entirely so. I wanted to go into the lounge, but
    Mr. Homer urged me toward the Tapestry Room, so I went with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Homer was in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you love him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The lovely arched eyebrows raised themselves slightly, but
    the answer came promptly, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You liked him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very much. We were good friends, but I preferred to
    remain only friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Now, Miss Kittredge, please tell exactly what
    happened in the Tapestry Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I told you last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know you did, but you must repeat it for the benefit
    of the jury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I see,&rdquo; and Diana went over the narrative she
    had given the coroner the night before.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Hale summed up, &ldquo;you heard no unusual
    sound, you heard nothing to let you know that Mr. Homer had received a death
    blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Diana, steadily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any idea who struck that blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Diana &ldquo;I cannot answer that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no, I cannot&mdash;no, I&rsquo;ve no idea, no idea
    at all, who struck the blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was the dagger?&rdquo; Hale asked, suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the table behind Mr. Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You saw it there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is always there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But was it there when you went into the room last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I saw it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you suggest anyone who might have used it except
    yourself and Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana looked at him piteously, but as his inexorable attitude
    demanded an answer, she breathed out a low-voiced &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you suggest Miss Moore might have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Diana shuddered and looked unutterably
    wretched.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you do it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; and now her eyes blazed and her curved
    lips set in a straight line. There was no tremor of voice or muscle, and
    her air, if a bit defiant, was heroically brave.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore?&rdquo; Hale turned toward the girl.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said, with a decided note of insolence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You corroborate all Miss Kittredge has said regarding
    the few moments before the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I guess she got it about right,&rdquo; Marita returned,
    her small brown fingers flicking the ash from her cigarette.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You sat on the arm of the couch where Mr. Homer was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were, then, very near to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it not likely, then, you would have heard some indicative
    sound when he was stabbed to death at your side?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is likely. And, more, I may have heard such a sound,
    without knowing its significance. You see, I had no thought of his being
    killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not. Who do you think killed him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mercy, I don&rsquo;t know. Isn&rsquo;t that for you
    to find out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, with your help. Which was nearer to him, you or
    Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you sat beside him. Practically against his left
    arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hold on there, I wasn&rsquo;t as close as that. But
    Diana stood right in front of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was in front of him,&rdquo; Diana said, slowly, &ldquo;but
    I was several feet away from the couch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must be very direct, now,&rdquo; Hale said, looking
    keenly at one girl, then at the other. &ldquo;Did you see the dagger on the
    table, Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know it was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you ever seen it in the Tapestry Room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not to notice it especially. There&rsquo;s such a lot
    of junk there, and it all looks alike to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aside from the facts, is it your opinion that anyone
    would have time to get that dagger from its place on the table and use it
    for the murderous deed in the short time known as the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. The dark time is two minutes or more, generally.
    That&rsquo;s a longer time than it sounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But how could the stabbing be accomplished in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it was accomplished, wasn&rsquo;t it? Then it
    must have been done by somebody who knew the room well, and who knew how
    and where to make a successful stab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">More than the words, Marita&rsquo;s accusing glance at Diana
    showed clearly the thought that was in her mind.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any knowledge of anatomy, Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the slightest. I don&rsquo;t know one bone from
    another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have a small knowledge of physiology.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should think she had!&rdquo; exclaimed Marita. &ldquo;She
    studied to be a trained nurse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is that a fact, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Diana turned a ghastly white.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When did you study nursing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About five or six years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you graduate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I gave it up. I took up the study because I thought
    I had to support myself. But an uncle died and left me sufficient to live
    on, so I abandoned my idea of being a nurse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana&rsquo;s blue eyes looked straight into Hale&rsquo;s with
    serenity and candor.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet to those who knew her best, she was clearly nervous and
    unstrung.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott, chin in hand, sat staring at her. Bobbie&rsquo;s
    fuzzy, yellow hair stood out like a Circassian girl&rsquo;s, and the most
    bewildering thoughts were running through her brain, inside the yellow mop.</p>
  <p align="left">One of those two girls must have done the deed, she decided,
    and now, which one could it have been?</p>
  <p align="left">Surely not Diana, that stately goddess woman! To be sure, she
    detested Gaylord, or, at least, she detested his making love to her, but
    that didn&rsquo;t mean she would kill him to get rid of him! No, it must
    have been Marita. But Marita loved him. Well, then, she killed him because
    he didn&rsquo;t love her. Yes, that was it, of course.</p>
  <p align="left">Hale was droning on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, Miss Kittredge, you have said you didn&rsquo;t
    stab Mr. Homer. You have said you don&rsquo;t accuse Miss Moore of the crime.
    Will you, then, tell me your opinion as to how the tragedy did occur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot imagine how it occurred,&rdquo; Diana said. &ldquo;I
    suppose it must have been the work of either Miss Moore or myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita gave a sharp exclamation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a confession!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;For
    I didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You did, Marita! You must have!&rdquo; Diana&rsquo;s
    blue eyes stared unseeingly, she swayed a little, then, with a sudden quick
    movement, she clasped her hands together and murmured, &ldquo;Anyway I didn&rsquo;t
    do it&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She did!&rdquo; Marita declared. &ldquo;There were only
    the two of us there. Would I kill the man I loved? For I am not ashamed to
    say I loved him. I adored that splendid man! Think you, then, that I would
    put an end to his life? Absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hale looked helpless.</p>
  <p align="left">He had no witnesses but these two. He had no suspects but these
    two. It must be, it had to be, that one of these two killed Gaylord Homer.
    There was no other possible theory.</p>
  <p align="left">He turned to Ted Bingham.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You seem to be the only person who was near these three
    people in the Tapestry Room, Mr. Bingham. Will you tell exactly how they
    were standing when the lights reappeared?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore was not standing at all. She had fallen to
    the floor. Miss Kittredge stood a few feet away from the couch where Mr.
    Homer sat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Could you have entered the room in the dark time and
    gone around behind Mr. Homer and stabbed him and returned to your place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Ted stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Hale, I suppose I could have done so, but
    it would have been a difficult job to manage in the dark. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t
    do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am not accusing you. I only want to find out if some
    other person than these two ladies, could have entered the room, committed
    the crime and gone out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is within the realm of possibility, I should say,
    but not probability. There was time enough in the dark interval, but the
    murderer could scarcely get past the two girls and the couch, get the dagger,
    and do his wicked work all in the dark. He would almost surely run into something
    or somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were standing in the deep doorway between the lounge
    and the room where the murder took place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is a deep doorway and fairly wide. Do you think
    anyone could have slipped past you in the darkness and so got into the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham paused before his reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose that could have been done. Always, when the
    dark time comes, people are moving about, on their way here or there, and
    we never notice it if someone brushes against us, as we would notice in the
    light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you remember anyone brushing against you, as you
    stood there in the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No not at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Could anyone have entered through the other door, the
    door to the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hale spoke half to himself, half as if he expected someone
    to volunteer information.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody did!&rdquo; Marita exclaimed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should have heard them. I have most unusual hearing.
    I heard every sound in that room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you hear as well in the dark as in the light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Even better. I hear the lightest footfall on the softest
    carpet. I hear the faintest sigh, the softest breathing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you hear any footfalls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I heard someone move stealthily round to the table,
    get the dagger and then I heard the gasping sigh, which was the last sound
    Mr. Homer ever made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard more footsteps, as the one who used the dagger
    stepped away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I heard nothing more. I lost my senses. I do not mean
    I lost consciousness, but I heard no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In a calm voice Diana spoke.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore is making that up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for
    there were no audible footsteps. I have good hearing, though not super-normal,
    and I heard no footsteps whatever. There must have been some, for the murderer
    had to walk away, but they were silent on the deep soft rug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were nearest the hall door, Miss Kittredge. Could
    someone have come in at that door, passed you by, gone to the table and taken
    up the dagger, stabbed his victim, and departed the way he came, all in the
    dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot say,&rdquo; Diana looked perplexed. &ldquo;There
    was not time enough, though the dark time seemed unusually long last night.
    And how could anyone do all that in the dark? And I was standing practically
    between Mr. Homer and the hall doorway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, in your opinion, no one entered that room in the
    dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is my&mdash;my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her beautiful face white, her beautiful eyes glassy, her curved
    lips quivering as her teeth bit into them, she shuddered as one stricken
    with the ague. The horror of the whole situation seemed to have just come
    home to her and she looked round the room piteously, as if in search of a
    friend.</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham rose, brought his chair, and sat down beside her. He
    said no word to her, nor to anyone, but, folding his arms, he tacitly established
    himself as her bulwark and protection.</p>
  <p align="left">This roused Marita to a point of frenzy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t save her, Ted,&rdquo; she fairly jeered
    at him. The black looks of the Coroner failed to quiet her, and she went
    on:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was Diana who killed Gaylord. Diana, the haughty,
    the icicle! She knows where to strike! She knows how to move about noiselessly!
    She hated Gaylord, she scorned his devotion, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the
    girl&rsquo;s flaming eyes glared at Diana, &ldquo;and she wanted the fortune
    he left to her!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7">Chapter 7</a><br>
    Odors of Evidence</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THIS last outburst of Marita&rsquo;s brought a look of terror
    to Diana&rsquo;s face. The blue eyes filled with fear, not anger, as the
    vicious words rang out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Kindly keep silent, Miss Moore,&rdquo; the Coroner said,
    more sternly than he had yet spoken. &ldquo;Miss Kittredge, are you aware
    that Mr. Homer&rsquo;s will leaves his estate largely to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; Diana said, in a weak,
    tired voice. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he had made a will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does no one know of this will of Mr. Homer&rsquo;s?
    Does no one know where it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know that he made it,&rdquo; volunteered Mrs. Opdyke.
    The doctor had been called away to his duties. &ldquo;I know, because my
    husband and I witnessed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About a week ago. Mr. Homer said we could be witnesses
    because there was in his will no bequest to either of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And where did this incident take place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the Tapestry Room. There is no writing desk there,
    but we signed with a fountain pen that Mr. Homer carried in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And was the will a large or long document?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, it seemed rather short. It was a folded paper that
    Mr. Homer took from the pocket in the cover of a book. He explained that
    it was a book of directions for making a will, and he had made his in accordance
    with the directions and on a blank provided. Mr. Homer signed it in our presence
    and then we signed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is that will now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have no idea. When we left, the book lay on a small
    table beside the chair Mr. Homer sat in. I never saw it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Harrison, as Mr. Homer&rsquo;s secretary, do you
    not know where the book in question may be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m quite sure it is not in
    Mr. Homer&rsquo;s study, and though I&rsquo;ve looked about in the Tapestry
    Room, I can&rsquo;t find it there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What sort of book is it? Large?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, rather smallish. Not so big as an ordinary novel,
    but nearly. It has a brown cover with black lettering on it. That&rsquo;s
    all I remember about it. I paid little attention to it, for I thought Mr.
    Homer would read and study it, and then call in Mr. Crawford to make his
    will in the ordinary way. I was surprised when I learned he had really made
    a will and had the neighbors in to witness it. But I don&rsquo;t know at
    all what he did with it, or where he kept it. It must surely turn up, even
    if he hid it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do your best to find it, Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly shall,&rdquo; Cale returned, a little haughtily.</p>
  <p align="left">Always meek and deferential, he had seemed to grow more self-assertive
    since Homer&rsquo;s death. Perhaps this was not to be wondered at, as he
    was now in a position of great responsibility. Except for the lawyer, no
    one else knew anything about Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s affairs or property.</p>
  <p align="left">Homer had been singularly alone in the world. Save for the
    cousin, whom he so seldom saw, he had no known relatives. He was fond of
    his friends, but none was an intimate or a confidant.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham was probably the nearest approach to such, and
    even he knew almost nothing of Homer&rsquo;s financial matters.</p>
  <p align="left">Therefore, the only man really cognizant of Homer&rsquo;s daily
    life and running expenses was Cale Harrison. He, if anyone, would know where
    the will book was kept.</p>
  <p align="left">More than one glance of inquiry was turned upon him, but he
    bore their scrutiny with perfect equanimity.</p>
  <p align="left">His meekness had slipped from him as a garment, and he seemed
    to be changing, under their very eyes, from an underling to a commander.
    Not everyone noticed this, but those who did were surprised at it.</p>
  <p align="left">Albert Moffatt, calm-eyed and quiet, watched the secretary
    closely. And then, with a nod of apology to the Coroner, he spoke:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As the nearest relative of the late Mr. Homer, I am
    told I must inherit his estate if no will can be found. I am, therefore,
    most anxious that the will should be found, since we know that one exists,
    or has existed. For, as you will readily understand, I should not like to
    take over property that has been devised elsewhere. My cousin told me the
    last time I saw him, that he intended to make a will, and I learn from Mrs.
    Opdyke that he did make a will. I think I am within my rights in asking that
    a most vigorous and exhaustive search be made for that will, by skilled searchers.
    For unless it is found I shall be in an embarrassing position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt&rsquo;s smile was winning and his tone of candor and
    sincerity impressed the Coroner favorably.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are quite right, Mr. Moffatt. The search must be
    drastic, and it will probably result in finding the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The Coroner pronounced this opinion with the air of an ultimatum
    and then sat for a few moments, looking at the two girls who were, to his
    mind, under grave suspicion. But he could not decide in his own mind, which
    was more likely to have committed the murder, so he declared an adjournment
    for a week in order to collect more evidence for the case.</p>
  <p align="left">The wiseacre jury filed out, their minds bewildered at the
    astonishing situation. Here was a murder with two suspects, no material witnesses,
    only vaguely suggested motives, exclusive opportunity, and, so far as was
    known, no clues of any sort.</p>
  <p align="left">Small wonder they were bewildered, and the men were glad to
    leave the house at once, without becoming entangled in perplexing questions.</p>
  <p align="left">The inefficient coroner, too, departed, and Detective Sergeant
    Cram, with his small lot of uniformed and plain clothes men, remained in
    charge.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, Mr. Moffatt,&rdquo; Cale Harrison said, at once,  &ldquo;in
    the absence of any real head of this house, I shall carry on just as I did
    when Mr. Homer was here. Of course, I always attended to the mail and all
    that, so I shall continue to do so. Mr. Homer, while not in any business,
    was a director in several companies and had rather wide interests in various
    fields of finance. My books and accounts will always be open to Mr. Crawford,
    the lawyer, but I can&rsquo;t feel that anyone else has any right to examine
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anyone else who would have such
    a right,&rdquo; Moffatt returned, a slight smile hovering round his lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; Cale floundered a little, &ldquo;I
    thought you might, as Mr. Homer&rsquo;s next of kin&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Set your mind at rest, Mr. Harrison,&rdquo; Moffatt
    said, in a cordial tone. &ldquo;I make no claims of any sort. I have small
    interest in my cousin&rsquo;s affairs, and I trust the will may be found
    and its testaments carried out. If I can assist in any way, I shall be glad
    to do so, if not I will return to my home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d stay on a bit, Moffatt,&rdquo; Ted
    Bingham said. &ldquo;I mean to have a hand in this investigation myself.
    From my point of view, the will is of far less importance than the discovery
    of who killed Gaylord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is the main issue,&rdquo; agreed Crawford, who
    had been listening in silence. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve but one suggestion to
    make. That is, to get a real, live detective, who will find the murderer.
    I can&rsquo;t think it was either one of those two girls, yet I can&rsquo;t
    see any possibility of anyone else. But I&rsquo;m no detective. Yet I have
    great faith in the powers of a clever investigator. He could find the will,
    too, and the matter could be easily and quickly settled up; whereas, if left
    to the police, it will drone along for weeks or months. You all saw how efficient
    that coroner was! And while Cram is bright enough, he is hampered by the
    machinery of headquarters, and unable to go his own gait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush, here comes Cram,&rdquo; whispered Cale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Ted, independently. &ldquo;Mr.
    Cram, we are talking about getting in a private investigator. Would you have
    any objections?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I would,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose that would keep you off it. If you&rsquo;re set to get one you&rsquo;ll
    get him. And there&rsquo;s so many of you. I don&rsquo;t even know who I&rsquo;m
    to report to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said Harrison quickly. &ldquo;As Mr. Homer&rsquo;s
    confidential secretary, I am in authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that, Mr. Harrison,&rdquo; Crawford
    said a little curtly. &ldquo;If the will is found and appoints an executor,
    you have nothing to say. If the will is never found, the state will take
    charge, and you will have still less to say. Don&rsquo;t be too cocky, young
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t be too dictatorial, Mr. Crawford. At
    present, there is no executor and no state in charge. Therefore, I, as knowing
    the most about Mr. Homer&rsquo;s personal affairs, am in the seat of authority,
    if only temporarily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Crawford said, carelessly, &ldquo;the
    matter isn&rsquo;t worth quarreling over. The estate must be and will be
    looked after properly. But the detective work ought to be started at once.
    I know a first-class chap, a man named Pitt, who is in the business, and
    he will give it his personal attention if I ask him. I&rsquo;ll write him
    at once. It&rsquo;s not a thing for the telephone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you staying here, Mr. Crawford?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay for a day or two. There&rsquo;s much
    to be done. I&rsquo;ll go over the desk with Mr. Harrison, and we&rsquo;ll
    all turn in and search for the will. Shall you stay, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what to do. I think I&rsquo;ll
    run down to town this afternoon, and back tonight or tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too far away,&rdquo; said Crawford. &ldquo;Remember,
    if the will doesn&rsquo;t materialize, you&rsquo;re the heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll find the will,&rdquo; Moffatt told
    him. &ldquo;Gaylord was set on making it and unless you can find a flaw in
    his home-made document, it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I take it, Cram, you won&rsquo;t be all upset at
    our engaging a detective of sorts,&rdquo; the lawyer went on to the police
    detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. I know you want him, and I&rsquo;m not so stuck
    on my own powers as I might be. I&rsquo;m a plodder, sir, but I&rsquo;ve
    little originality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine statement,&rdquo; Moffatt said,
    smiling his approval. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never before seen a detective who
    wasn&rsquo;t stuck on his own powers. Get your man, Mr. Crawford, and I&rsquo;m
    sure Cram, here, will work with him, and no antagonism.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The antagonism may be on the other foot,&rdquo; Cram
    said shrewdly. &ldquo;Those hifalutin tecs aren&rsquo;t crazy to have the
    police help them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Pitt is all right,&rdquo; Crawford declared. &ldquo;He
    wants results, and he doesn&rsquo;t refuse help anywhere he can get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think you make a mistake to call in a detective yet,&rdquo; Harrison
    observed. &ldquo;Why not give Cram a chance to see what he can do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Crawford insisted. &ldquo;A detective, to
    be any good, must have the first chance at clues and evidence. In fact, nothing
    ought to be touched until he comes. Nothing, I mean, in the Tapestry Room,
    or Homer&rsquo;s study or bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The rooms upstairs have nothing to do with the murder,&rdquo;  Cale
    said, frowning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No matter, they must not be touched until Pitt comes.
    Wood, come here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The butler came, impassive as always and waiting the word.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wood,&rdquo; Crawford went on, &ldquo;I want you to
    lock the Tapestry Room and bring me the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is locked, sir, and Mr. Cram has the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, then, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Crawford looked crestfallen, and said no more about locks or
    keys.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can we search for the will, with that room locked
    up?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open it when you want to look for the will,&rdquo;  Cram
    told him, and then Ted became quiet.</p>
  <p align="left">It rather seemed that the strongest wills rose to the top and
    held the supremacy.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison had subsided to his old-time meekness. Bingham, little
    interested in the will, anyway, relapsed into silence. Moffatt was non-committal.</p>
  <p align="left">Really only Cram and Crawford were taking the lead, and the
    rest seemed to agree tacitly.</p>
  <p align="left">Rollin Dare had gone for a stroll in the grounds with Bobbie
    Abbott, and the Opdykes had gone home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the house crowd?&rdquo; Crawford asked of
    Cram.  &ldquo;Can they come and go as they please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; and Cram&rsquo;s face looked
    sober. &ldquo;The two young ladies who were&mdash;who were&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, who were in the Tapestry Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. They must stay for a time, and they are under
    surveillance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They can go out in the gardens?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but they will be constantly watched. It&rsquo;s
    my job, you know, to find out which one of them is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning that one of them must be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly, sir. Who else could have done it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for our detective to find out. I&rsquo;ll
    go and write that letter now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll take the next train to New York,&rdquo; Moffatt
    said, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Shall I mail your letter in the city,
    and so gain a few hours&rsquo; time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, do. I&rsquo;ll have it ready and leave it on the
    hall table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt went up to his room, and almost immediately Abbie Perkins
    followed him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to excuse me, Mr. Moffatt.
    But I just had to come to you. I can&rsquo;t get anything out of anybody
    else. Do tell me what they think. Do they judge that one of those two young
    ladies killed Mr. Homer? &rsquo;Cause if they do, I just simply can&rsquo;t
    stand it, that I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Abbie, that&rsquo;s what they do think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Like you, I can&rsquo;t bear to believe it, yet, what
    else is there to think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather suspeck Mr. Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bingham! Why he was Gaylord&rsquo;s best friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s more like a man&rsquo;s work than a
    woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all I know, Abbie. Mr. Crawford
    is sending for a big detective. Perhaps he can find out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Goody! I like detectives. Mr. Homer did, too. He had
    a good friend, who was a detective. Well, I won&rsquo;t stay and bother you.
    You&rsquo;ll be back tonight, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tonight or tomorrow morning. I can&rsquo;t tell which
    till I see about some business in New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Left alone, he stood a moment at the window and looked out
    on the gardens.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an open and shut case,&rdquo; he said to
    himself.  &ldquo;No suspect but those two young women. I wonder which one
    they&rsquo;ll fasten it on. And so, Miss Kittredge has a knowledge of anatomy.
    But the little Spanish beauty has a power to stab as a birthright. All tropical
    people stab, especially Spaniards. And Marita is wild enough for anything.
    I&rsquo;ll help her if I can. I like her better than the Vere de Vere one.
    Well, the will will probably be found, and then Lady Diana will come into
    her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The Lady Diana was, at that moment, lying on a chaise longue
    in her boudoir. She had telephoned her home in New York City, that she would
    stay at Twin Towers a few days longer.</p>
  <p align="left">Her mother had been dead many years, and her father was a helpless
    invalid. It was her father&rsquo;s nurse to whom she had telephoned, a man
    of good sense and judgment. She had told him that doubtless he would read
    in the papers what had happened, but on no account to let her father know
    about it. This would not be a difficult matter, for the sick man never read
    the papers and the nurse could pick and choose what to read to him.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana had no brothers or sisters and lived with her father
    in one of the still unchanged brownstone houses just off Fifth Avenue.</p>
  <p align="left">Having told Carlisle, the nurse, she lay back among her pillows,
    and tried to face the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">She knew that she was in very real danger. Aside from the suspicion
    that had fastened itself upon her, she was menaced by Marita&rsquo;s enmity.
    The Spanish girl was of a positively venomous nature and would stoop to words
    and deeds that Diana would scorn.</p>
  <p align="left">Her thoughts flew back to that dinner party. Gaylord had been
    unbearable. He had vowed he would make her marry him, make her love him&mdash;and
    all the time her heart was beating wildly with love for Ted Bingham. She
    had never realized until last night how much she cared for Ted, with his
    open, honest nature and his gay, debonair ways.</p>
  <p align="left">She had told Gaylord this, at least, she had hinted of it,
    and Gaylord had said he would kill any man that she loved better than she
    did him.</p>
  <p align="left">She had thought he said it jokingly, until&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">Someone was knocking at her door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Diana wearily, and Bobbie entered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You blessed angel,&rdquo; her visitor said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
    there something I can do for you? Take heart, Di, darling, they&rsquo;re
    sending for a whacking big detective, and he&rsquo;ll know by looking at
    you that you couldn&rsquo;t do a wrong thing if you wanted to. Where do you
    keep your cigarettes? Under some beflounced doll thing, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re in that jade box on the stand there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here, have one yourself, it will iron out your nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana accepted one and then lay staring at Bobbie.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bobs,&rdquo; she said, suddenly, &ldquo;who killed Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Bobbie, calmly, inhaling smoke.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do they all think that?&rdquo; Diana went white.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, not all. &rsquo;Bout evenly divided. Dunno as I
    think it myself. Just wanted to give you a jolt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, you do think it. So I suppose Rollin does, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Rollin does. But Ted doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, of course not. What&rsquo;s Marita doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Singing Spanish songs to her guitar, in the music room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Caley, of course. What a queer duck he is! One minute
    he&rsquo;s a regular Uriah Heep, then in a jiffy, he&rsquo;s acting like
    a strutting Napoleon. I don&rsquo;t get him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wonder if he thinks I&rsquo;m guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure! He&rsquo;s on Marita&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are there two camps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yep. It&rsquo;s a game. It must have been either you
    or Marita. So we choose sides.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bobbie, be serious a minute! Do you really suspect me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes and no. I do and I don&rsquo;t. But it must
    be one of you, for there&rsquo;s no way anybody else could have got round
    to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have a case on Rollin, or if he
    didn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m the one, you wouldn&rsquo;t either, would
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, no, Di, I dunno&rsquo;s I would.&rdquo; She shook
    her straight Dutch bob, and gazed into Diana&rsquo;s sky-blue eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;nobody could look at
    you and call you wicked. You beautiful angel! Oh Diana, do you know how lovely
    you are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet you think I am a mur&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush, don&rsquo;t say it! I don&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t
    think any wrong of you. And I won&rsquo;t let Rollin, either!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, Bobbie, don&rsquo;t get too much mixed up
    with Rollin Dare. What will Roger say when he comes home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m only having the lightest
    kind of flirtation. Roger&rsquo;s coming home in a few days and then it&rsquo;s
    good-bye, Rollin Dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you going to stay here long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Until Roger comes for me. I say, Diana, I wonder if
    we&rsquo;d be allowed to leave if we wanted to. You and Marita wouldn&rsquo;t,
    of course, but I suppose I would, or Rollin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose so. There&rsquo;s someone at the door. See
    who it is, Bobbie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It was Abbie Perkins, and with mouth and eyes open she came
    into the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Miss Kittredge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I just
    happened in to see if I could do anything for you. You going down to dinner,
    or you want it up here on a tray?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you advise, Bobs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh come on along down. Put on a smashing frock and putty
    up your face and come down and make a good impression. Injured innocence
    and all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Say, Miss Kittredge, you didn&rsquo;t do that job, did
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie looked at Diana, half scared, half defiant.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Abbie,&rdquo; came the reply. &ldquo;But if I had,
    do you suppose I&rsquo;d say I did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land sake, miss, what a thing to say! &rsquo;Course
    I know you couldn&rsquo;t have stob Mr. Homer, but likewise also I know Miss
    Moore couldn&rsquo;t have done it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not, Abbie? Why couldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, ain&rsquo;t she in love with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But sometimes people kill the ones they love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They do, miss! Now why ever would they do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Diana turned pettish. &ldquo;I
    wish this thing was all over! I wish I&rsquo;d never come here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take it more sensible, Miss Kittredge?
    Instead of yelpin&rsquo; like a hurt dog, why don&rsquo;t you brace up and
    find out some other suspeck? I mean &rsquo;sides you and Miss Moore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody else to suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, get up some evidence. Some what do they call  &rsquo;em?
    Clueses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the one to hunt for clueses, Abbie. The
    detectives must do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you were there, in the room. Didn&rsquo;t you hear
    anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Marita did the hearing for us all. She heard a whole
    heap of things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She hears better&rsquo;n you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I hear well enough, only there wasn&rsquo;t anything
    to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t see a thing, s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See? Mercy, no. It was pitch dark. But I&rsquo;ll tell
    you one thing, I could smell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s something, miss. And they do say,
    folks as don&rsquo;t hear so awful good, smell better&rsquo;n others. What,
    now, did you notice, a-smellin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie burst into shrieks of laughter, but Diana was serious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I noticed an awful lot of smells, Abbie. Of course,
    there was the cyclamen perfume I always use. And, too, that heavy stuff Marita
    likes; jasmine, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bobbie, making a face. &ldquo;Sickening
    stuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What else, Miss Diana?&rdquo; Abbie urged on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, tobacco, of course, we had all three been smoking
    more or less. And then, the incense was burning in the Oriental vase. That
    was floating round in the air. And I remember there was some freesia in one
    of the flower vases. I hate freesia. But I noticed it. And that&rsquo;s all&mdash;oh,
    yes, I did notice a smell of mothballs. You know, those carbolicky ones.
    I don&rsquo;t mind that odor, it&rsquo;s so nice and clean. But where did
    it come from? I never use mothballs. Was Mr. Homer&rsquo;s coat done up in
    them ever, Abbie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, Wood keeps those tar things in the closets
    where the woolens are. But Mr. Homer&rsquo;s evening things wouldn&rsquo;t
    be there, they&rsquo;d be in his own wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I smelled it, and I can&rsquo;t be mistaken about
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a clue,&rdquo; exclaimed Bobbie, triumphantly.  &ldquo;Now,
    Di, from that mothball we&rsquo;ll track down the villain! Abbie, can&rsquo;t
    you help us? You go round the house while we&rsquo;re at dinner, and smell
    into everybody&rsquo;s closets and bureau drawers and trunks, and see if
    you can catch a whiff of mothballs. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean it, Mrs. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I do. Now, you see to it.&rdquo;</p>

    Fleming Stone Takes Up the Case</b></h2>
  <p align="left">IT was nearly noon the next day when Cram called Lawyer Crawford
    and Albert Moffatt to a conference.</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt had just returned from New York, and said, as he joined
    the others:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fixed up things in my office so I can stay
    here a few days more. I may as well confess I&rsquo;ve a leaning toward detective
    work, and if I can be of any help in sleuthing about, I&rsquo;ll be glad.
    I don&rsquo;t read detective stories, I&rsquo;m not that sort of enthusiast,
    but I do believe in looking matters squarely in the face and trying to grasp
    their meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of detective work that counts,
    Mr. Moffatt,&rdquo; Cram said, approvingly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take much
    stock, myself, in scientific deduction or psycho-analyzing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all right in their place, Cram,&rdquo; Crawford
    told him. &ldquo;But what I want to talk about is this. We must get hold
    of Homer&rsquo;s will. I&rsquo;m his legal adviser and I can&rsquo;t tackle
    the estate or do any settling, until I know whether the man died intestate
    or not. It&rsquo;s all very well to say the will can&rsquo;t be found, but
    it&rsquo;s got to be found. It isn&rsquo;t like a document that would be
    stolen by interested parties. Maybe he made a will and didn&rsquo;t leave
    Miss Kittredge the residuary legatee at all. Maybe he gave great sums in
    charities. Any way we must track it down. The thing to do is to search the
    Tapestry Room thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done that, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; Cram asserted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    been through every piece of furniture that has cupboards or drawers in it,
    and there&rsquo;s no sign of that will book. It isn&rsquo;t like an ordinary
    will, just a folded sheet of paper, that could be slipped between other papers
    and so hidden. This thing is a book, a fair-sized book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe he didn&rsquo;t leave the will in the book finally,&rdquo;  suggested
    Moffatt, &ldquo;but hid it somewhere by itself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, where&rsquo;s the book?&rdquo; countered Crawford. &ldquo;He
    wouldn&rsquo;t throw the book away, after buying it for a purpose. Sure it
    isn&rsquo;t in the Tapestry Room, Cram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, of course, I didn&rsquo;t go over all the bookshelves,
    but Harrison says he never put the book on the shelves, just kept it around
    on the table or windowseat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the lawyer said, decidedly, &ldquo;Gaylord
    never hid that book and that will. Why should he? They were for use in case
    of his death. Why on earth would he conceal them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying he did conceal them purposely,&rdquo; Cram
    said, slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying he concealed them at all. But they
    can&rsquo;t be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What price Harrison hiding them?&rdquo; Moffatt asked.  &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know that chap at all, but he seems a man of infinite resource
    and sagacity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the sense of that? If the will is found
    Harrison may receive a legacy. If it isn&rsquo;t found, he most certainly
    will not. Where&rsquo;s his motive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Motives seem to be lacking all round,&rdquo; Moffatt
    remarked, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The murder, now. Who had a motive for that?
    Well, the little Spanish pepper-pot might have the motive of jealousy or
    hatred. You know what&rsquo;s said about a woman scorned. But the fair girl
    had no motive. Even if she resented Gaylord&rsquo;s persistent attentions,
    that isn&rsquo;t a reason for murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You forget the legacy,&rdquo; Crawford said. &ldquo;If
    she was to inherit a fortune&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s too impossible!&rdquo; Moffatt&rsquo;s
    face showed his unfeigned horror.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; Cram said. &ldquo;Here are three
    of us who were not present at the time of the murder, so we can&rsquo;t be
    biased by what we saw or didn&rsquo;t see. On the face of things, just judging
    by the evidence, who killed Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When you say evidence, I suppose you mean the evidence
    we&rsquo;ve heard so far,&rdquo; Crawford put in. &ldquo;There may be&mdash;must
    be a lot of unknown evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Which may never be known,&rdquo; suggested Moffatt. &ldquo;It
    seems to me there are only two people who could tell us any more about the
    matter than we know already. And, for obvious reasons, they won&rsquo;t.
    Why, if, say, some outsider did come in, through the window or any other
    way, and either of those girls heard him, which they must have done in such
    a case, don&rsquo;t you suppose they&rsquo;d tell of it mighty quick? They&rsquo;re
    not anxious to accuse one another except in self-defense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Cram. &ldquo;If anybody
    crept in, and they heard him, of course they&rsquo;d say so. But how could
    anybody creep in? From where? And who? Now, between ourselves here, how many
    possible suspects are there? Only those two girls and perhaps&mdash;a very
    slim perhaps&mdash;young Bingham. He was in the doorway and he could have
    crept over to the table where the dagger was and used it and crept back again,
    in the dark time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Moffatt. &ldquo;In the dark? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And why would he?&rdquo; asked Crawford. &ldquo;He was
    Gaylord&rsquo;s good friend, why would he kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take the shape of the room,&rdquo; Cram spoke musingly.  &ldquo;Queer
    shape, ain&rsquo;t it? That vaulted ceiling, they call it a groined ceiling,
    I&rsquo;m told, sorter runs down to the four walls. Then the four walls&mdash;why,
    they ain&rsquo;t walls at all, They&rsquo;re deep alcoves, all four of &rsquo;em.
    One arches over the door to the hall. One arches over the door to the lounge
    place. Opposite that, against the dining-room wall, is the fireplace, and
    opposite the hall door is a big window. The books are all in cases under
    the arches, and &rsquo;longside the windows and doors. Not a terrible lot
    of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And then the tapestries, that&rsquo;s what the room&rsquo;s
    named for. Two of those, one each side of the fireplace. I&rsquo;ve heard
    they&rsquo;re both worth thousands, but they look to me just like any upholst&rsquo;ry
    goods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wonders!&rdquo; declared Crawford. &ldquo;Among
    the finest in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; exclaimed Moffatt. &ldquo;I confess
    I&rsquo;m pretty near in Cram&rsquo;s class. They mean nothing to me. I remember
    hearing Gaylord gloating over them, but I thought it was just part of his
    fad for antiques.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, tapestries are tremendously valuable, very rare
    pieces. But as to the murderer. I think everyone who was in the house at
    the time ought to be suspected and thoroughly investigated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I agree to that,&rdquo; Moffatt declared. &ldquo;I hope
    your man Pitt is a good one at a quiz. You can learn a lot from the way people
    answer questions, even if they&rsquo;re not guilty themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about Dr. Opdyke?&rdquo; said Cram, suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Heavens, man, he&rsquo;s a long-time friend of Homer&rsquo;s.
    And why would he do it? He&rsquo;d have no possible motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bequest,&rdquo; said Cram, laconically.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the doctor and his wife witnessed the will. They
    couldn&rsquo;t have done that if they were to inherit anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, yes, Cram said, &ldquo;but the girl, the daughter.
    Homer meant to leave her quite a nice sum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She told me herself. She&rsquo;s a gabby little piece,
    and I had a talk with her. Oh, I haven&rsquo;t been absolutely idle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But surely you can&rsquo;t suspect that child of any
    wrongdoing!&rdquo;  Moffatt cried, aghast at the idea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cram agreed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. But say
    the doc is in financial straits and the kiddy&rsquo;s bequest would pull
    him out. And&mdash;he would know where to strike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But how could he get in the house?&rdquo; asked Crawford.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said Cram. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    talked with the servants and that butler person declares nobody could possibly
    have come in at the front door and across the hall in the dark time. For,
    he said, he always instinctively stands near the door between the dining-room
    and hall and listens, when it is dark each evening. He says it&rsquo;s a
    habit with him and he always does it. So, if the doctor or anybody else tried
    to scoot across the hall to the Tapestry Room, Wood must have heard him,
    if he couldn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly credible,&rdquo; Moffatt said; &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t suspect Dr. Opdyke. Why, he looks like a saint, with that halo
    of white hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Wood appeared just then, with a telegram for Crawford.</p>
  <p align="left">As he read it, the lawyer&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pitt can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
    just starting for California on an important case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know of anyone else equally good?&rdquo; asked
    Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I doubt if there is anyone equally good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me dig along for a few days, Mr. Crawford,&rdquo;  Cram
    begged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making headway, I think. Anyway, leave it till after
    the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bad plan to postpone investigations,&rdquo; Crawford
    said, musingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over, Cram. You&rsquo;ll stay
    over for the funeral, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. Today being Sunday, I think I&rsquo;ll
    stick around the house. Unless somebody would like to go for a motor drive.
    What about Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a bit of a collapse. The doctor put
    her to bed with orders to see nobody for twenty-four hours at least,&rdquo; Crawford
    enlightened him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Miss Moore? Mrs. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re about somewhere, I suppose. But I doubt
    if Miss Moore would be allowed to go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt looked his astonishment, and Cram put in:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must try to realize, Mr. Moffatt, that this is a
    very grave case. Those two ladies had exclusive opportunity. Nobody else
    had a look in. One of those girls committed that murder just as sure as I
    sit here. So, we daren&rsquo;t let either of them out of our sight, until
    we know which of them is the guilty party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you propose to find out?&rdquo; asked Moffatt,
    looking greatly distressed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are ways,&rdquo; said Cram, with a mysterious
    nod;  &ldquo;and since I can&rsquo;t see Miss Kittredge today, I&rsquo;ll
    have a session with Miss Moore. Want to be present, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lord, no! I do want to help in the work of avenging
    my cousin&rsquo;s murder, but I&rsquo;d rather do anything than interview
    those two girls!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The three men went their ways, but as Crawford started to go
    home, Wood silently beckoned him aside.</p>
  <p align="left">The two went into the breakfast room, and the butler closed
    the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to seem forthputting, Mr. Crawford,
    sir, but this seems to me a time when eggstrawdinary measures are called
    for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes, Wood, you may say what you wish. Make any
    suggestion you have in mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, sir. Then, it&rsquo;s just this. I couldn&rsquo;t
    help hearing you say that the detective you wanted can&rsquo;t come. Now,
    I know of a great detective who was an old friend of Mr. Homer&rsquo;s. Mightn&rsquo;t
    it be a good thing to get him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. Who is this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fleming Stone, sir. He&rsquo;s famous, I&rsquo;ve been
    told; indeed, Mr. Homer said he was the best detective outside a story-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of him. I didn&rsquo;t know he
    knew Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, very well, sir. That&rsquo;s why I think he would
    come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Know his address?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, but surely you can find that out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, without doubt. Well, Wood, I&rsquo;ll look it up.
    I&rsquo;m going home now, but I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow for the funeral.
    Are there no relatives at all to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A few, from out of town. Just connections by marriage.
    No, no real relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never knew a chap so alone in the world. You&rsquo;ve
    lost a good master, Wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have that, Mr. Crawford. If so be that Mr. Moffatt
    inherits, I hope he keeps me on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope so, too, Wood. I like that man. He is quiet and
    a bit queer, but very much the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Good-day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As Crawford drove down to the city in his roadster, he thought
    over Wood&rsquo;s suggestion, and it struck him favorably.</p>
  <p align="left">He concluded to try to get Fleming Stone, without saying anything
    to anybody about it. For, he argued to himself, he had suggested Pitt and
    no objection was raised by anyone, so they could not logically object to
    Stone. And, too, who had any right to object? Moffatt, perhaps, but he was
    always ready to agree to anything that would further the cause, so Crawford
    concluded to go ahead. He easily found Stone&rsquo;s address and telephoned
    him at once.</p>
  <p align="left">By a lucky chance, Stone was free at the moment, and on learning
    that it was Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s death he was asked to investigate, he agreed
    to call on Crawford immediately.</p>
  <p align="left">He kept his word, and inside of half an hour, the two men were
    seated in the lawyer&rsquo;s office, going over the case.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As soon as I heard of the tragedy, I wanted to offer
    my help,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Gaylord for years, and
    I&rsquo;m glad of the chance to track down his murderer. A fine chap was
    Gaylord Homer, and if tireless perseverance can accomplish it, this particular
    criminal will be run to earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone was a tall, spare man, with deep-set, dark eyes, and
    greying hair. His manner was calm, but with a hint of forcefulness, and his
    keen gaze was penetrating enough to disconcert a guilty conscience.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who is in charge?&rdquo; he asked, directly. &ldquo;Who
    is engaging my services?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part of it,&rdquo; Crawford replied.  &ldquo;There
    is no one in charge legally. Gaylord left no heirs, no relatives at all,
    but one second cousin. He is said to have made a will, but it cannot be found.
    So there are no executors. But I am engaging you, Mr. Stone, on my own. If
    you will take up the matter, I will see that your fees are paid, either from
    the Homer estate or by myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that part of it,&rdquo; Stone
    smiled.  &ldquo;If I can bring to judgment the man who killed Gaylord Homer,
    I shall not care whether I get paid for it or not. But, I want to make one
    stipulation. The room where he was killed, has it been used, or cleaned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Neither. The police sergeant locked it up at once, and
    has kept the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well. See to it, he lets no one in that room until
    I see it. I may not crawl around the carpet with a lens, but there may be
    clues that a careless person could brush away unwittingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, but we did search the room enough to learn
    that the murderer didn&rsquo;t drop anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dropped clues are out of date. Nobody now drops a handkerchief
    or a cuff-link, any more than he leaves fingerprints. But the clues I like
    best are not dropped articles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether understand, but it doesn&rsquo;t
    matter. I&rsquo;m so glad you will come to our aid. Now I must tell you how
    matters stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With his usual brief clarity, the lawyer told the detective
    all he knew about Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s death and all that had transpired
    since.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone listened in silence, save for a question now and then,
    and grew more and more absorbed as the interest developed.</p>
  <p align="left">He caught at the salient points at once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say Miss Moore has unusually sharp hearing?&rdquo;  he
    asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, she says so, and I&rsquo;ve noticed instances to
    prove it. On the other hand, I think Miss Kittredge&rsquo;s hearing is a
    little defective. She won&rsquo;t admit it&mdash;in fact, she claims to hear
    perfectly, but I doubt it. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only that if Miss Moore hears so well, she would have
    heard any intruder who came into the room from the lounge or who came into
    the house by the front door and entered the room that way. If it was somebody
    she didn&rsquo;t wish to incriminate she might shield him, but that is unlikely
    when she is herself a suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But nobody could enter the front door, cross the hall,
    get into the Tapestry Room and find the dagger and give the stab, all in
    the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I admit that would be impossible,&rdquo; Stone agreed,  &ldquo;and
    even if it could have been, Miss Moore must have heard a sound of some sort.
    Then, unless it was somebody in collusion with her, she would have told of
    it, to save herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are many theories to be conjectured, Mr. Stone,
    but the facts remain that those two girls were within a foot or two of Gaylord,
    and within equal distance of the table where the dagger lay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t assume anything until I see the room,&rdquo; Stone
    said, positively. &ldquo;Now, what shall I do? Go up there, openly, or in
    disguise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see no reason for disguise. If the guilty party knows
    you are on the job it can do no harm. To my mind there is not the slightest
    shadow of doubt that one of those girls stabbed Gaylord; that is self-evident.
    I am shocked, of course, at the idea of such a thing, but there it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the girls&rsquo; natures? And were they both
    in love with Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no. Miss Moore was in love with him, deeply, passionately&mdash;she&rsquo;s
    of Spanish descent. But Gay didn&rsquo;t care two cents for her. He was in
    love with the other one, Di Kittredge. And she scorned his devotion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I see. Quite a complication. The girl he loved and
    the girl who loved him, each had opportunity. And motive? For Diana, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A material one, that she is supposed to be the residuary
    legatee, and a less plausible one, that she was tired of Gaylord&rsquo;s
    persistent love-making.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Neither of them very strong. Not in it with the Spanish
    girl&rsquo;s unrequited passion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Marita isn&rsquo;t a Spanish girl, really. Her remote
    ancestors were, but she&rsquo;s American enough, save for a dash of temperament.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did the coroner get anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nowhere at all. He&rsquo;s one of those men who talk
    and talk and never say anything. But, I tell you, Mr. Stone, there&rsquo;s
    nowhere to get, except to find out which girl struck the blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Either of them have any anatomical knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kittredge studied for a trained nurse, Miss
    Moore, no knowledge of physiology at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A Spaniard doesn&rsquo;t need that to know where to
    stab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The deed is much more in keeping with Miss Moore&rsquo;s
    make-up than with Miss Kittredge&rsquo;s. Marita flies into spasms of anger
    or joy on the slightest provocation. Diana is cool, calm, collected, always.
    She is absolutely mistress of herself, whereas Marita continually loses her
    head and her temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You make them about equally suspectable! Both have traits
    that argue the criminal. Shall I go up there today?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not? You remember Wood, the butler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not definitely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind. He remembers you, or at least, he remembers
    you&rsquo;re Gaylord&rsquo;s friend. He&rsquo;ll look after you. I needn&rsquo;t
    go back there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m not shy. I&rsquo;ll just walk in and
    camp down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, do. Cale Harrison is the confidential secretary.
    He&rsquo;s a milk-minded chap, spineless and rather abject. There&rsquo;s
    a character sketch of a housekeeper, but smile at her and she&rsquo;ll coddle
    you. A few more guests and the cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, the cousin. What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A good sort. Nothing brilliant about him, but a comfortable,
    easy-going type. Says he doesn&rsquo;t hanker for Gaylord&rsquo;s money,
    but if it must come his way he&rsquo;ll bear up under the strain. Somehow
    I believe in him; he&rsquo;s of simple tastes and most eager to get even
    with the one who did for Gaylord, whoever it may be. I think he shrinks from
    the idea of the girls having done it, and is bent on finding an intruder
    or something like that. He&rsquo;ll welcome you, for he was much disappointed
    that the coroner got nowhere. Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s Bingham&mdash;Ted Bingham.
    He was a great friend of Gay&rsquo;s. Now, he stood in the doorway between
    the Tapestry Room and the lounge. Maybe he could have slipped in, grabbed
    the dagger and used it&mdash;but I doubt it. And why would he? To be sure,
    he is in love with Diana, and she with him. There&rsquo;s a chance but it&rsquo;s
    too absurd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing is absurd, Crawford, that has a bit of bearing
    on the case. What about the servants? I may as well learn all I can before
    I go up there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been questioned, but except for one of
    the maids and Wood, they had no opportunity. Unless they could slip in in
    the dark, and there, again Marita would have heard them. And, again, why?
    Had one of them wanted to stab Gay, far better opportunity could have been
    found than those two minutes of dark time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean by dark time, exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Crawford explained, and Stone was deeply interested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What a beautiful situation,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That
    proves it a premeditated business. For one taking advantage, unexpectedly,
    of that dark time couldn&rsquo;t know how long it would last. However, all
    present were familiar with the routine, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. I think they all had been there before,
    unless perhaps Mrs. Abbott. And I think it was Marita&rsquo;s first visit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why was she asked, if Gaylord didn&rsquo;t care for
    her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He used to be in love with her. But along came Diana,
    and Gay turned to her like the sunflower to the sun. This stirred up the
    firebrand, and she is said to have sworn vengeance and all that. Incidentally,
    the secretary person is in love with Marita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The milk and water chap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t that the way of the world! Marita would
    lead him a life, should they two hit it off! Now, I think that&rsquo;s about
    all the dramatis personae. Rollin Dare doesn&rsquo;t count. I think he was
    just asked to make an even number.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He may be the dark horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no. He&rsquo;s an average, law-abiding citizen.
    Flirting just now with Mrs. Abbott, but it&rsquo;s merely a playful game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my eye on him just the same. These playful
    gamesters sometimes are deeper than they seem. I&rsquo;ll land up there about
    tea time, I suppose. Do they have tea? Not all of our best people do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a well run house. If you want tea you&rsquo;ve
    only to say the word. I&rsquo;ll be up tomorrow for the funeral. Till then,
    good-by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; echoed Fleming Stone and set off on
    his new quest.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9">Chapter 9</a><br>
    The Ticking Clock</b></h2>
  <p align="left">FLEMING STONE reached Twin Towers late in the afternoon. Though
    it was but a short walk, he had taken a taxi over from the station, and as
    it chanced, the driver was gracious.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone didn&rsquo;t check his flow of language, but listened
    eagerly, for he was never above picking up information from any source.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, mister, it&rsquo;s a puzzlin&rsquo; case. That
    is to say, I mean, it&rsquo;s a puzzle to know which of them ladies done
    it. Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard all the dee-tails. I know he loved one lady and
    t&rsquo;other one loved him. That&rsquo;s a set-to to begin with, ain&rsquo;t
    it? Now I says to myself, mabbe them girls was in what they call c&rsquo;lusion.
    But old Cram, he says that ain&rsquo;t noways possible. And you can see tain&rsquo;t.
    Why&rsquo;d they want to help each other to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then which one do you think did it?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh the little furriner, of course. She&rsquo;s Spanish
    inclined, and she was despritally in love with Mr. Homer. Yes, sir, she&rsquo;s
    the vilyun, she is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But would she kill a man she loved?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir! That&rsquo;s wimmen all over! They&rsquo;re
    first of all, jealous. And once a woman&rsquo;s jealous, it&rsquo;s all up
    with the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You seem to have made a study of the sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to. It&rsquo;s all on the outside.
    I&rsquo;ve seen that black-eyed witch, that Miss Moore, and she&rsquo;s a
    killer, all right. You can see it stickin&rsquo; out all over her! She&rsquo;d
    knife any man who didn&rsquo;t give her what she wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what did she want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Want? Why, Mr. Homer, and his big house and his fortune
    and all. And more than that, she didn&rsquo;t want the other girl, the angel-faced
    one, to get him. So he had to go out, biff!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Farley&mdash;Jed Farley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know the people staying at the Homer house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help seeing &rsquo;em about. They&rsquo;re
    always comin&rsquo;  down to the village, buying things in the shops or kitin&rsquo; to
    the post-office or telegraphin&rsquo; or cajooverin&rsquo; around for something. &rsquo;Course
    I know &rsquo;em. The angel-faced lady never killed anybody. And for why
    should she? She didn&rsquo;t love Mr. Homer, she&rsquo;s sweet on the Bingham
    man, but she never jabbed a knife into anybody. Well, here you are, sir,
    here&rsquo;s Twin Towers. You see, they&rsquo;s a big tower on each of the
    two front corners, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s named that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; and Fleming Stone looked at the two
    towers that rose high above the roof in accordance with no known rule of
    architecture. Yet the effect was not unpleasing, and he concluded the towers
    were all right and they made delightful reading nooks inside the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Dismissing his garrulous Jehu, he rang the bell at the front
    door, which, as has been said, was around at the side of the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Wood answered it, and when he saw Stone, he allowed himself
    a smile of real welcome.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Stone, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    right glad to see you, sir.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Wood, here I am, and on a sad errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Crawford sent you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Can you put me up? And who will receive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Harrison, I think, sir. Or Mr. Bingham. Do you know
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Better hand me over to Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So the butler showed Fleming Stone up to the study, where Cale
    Harrison was engaged looking over papers at Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s desk.</p>
  <p align="left">He rose, with a questioning glance, as the distinguished-looking
    stranger advanced.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Fleming Stone,&rdquo; Wood announced, and immediately
    effaced himself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Stone, the detective?&rdquo; said Cale, quite evidently
    surprised.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone replied, suavely. &ldquo;At Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s
    request, I am here to investigate the death of my friend, Gaylord Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone sensed in the attitude of Harrison a decided objection
    to his presence, but this had no effect on the detective, save to make him
    look more keenly at the secretary, and then let his glance stray to the papers
    on the desk.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Crawford did not tell me he expected you,&rdquo; Cale
    said, rising and shuffling some of the top papers together.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No? I think he wasn&rsquo;t sure I could come, and so
    said nothing until he found out. I hope you welcome my assistance, Mr. Harrison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;of course. But I always dislike
    to be surprised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant. I&rsquo;m sorry. Now, if you
    will turn me over to a housekeeper I will settle myself into my rightful
    niche.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cale touched a bell, and vouchsafed no further word until Abbie
    appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Stone is staying here,&rdquo; he said, a little
    curtly.  &ldquo;Give him two of the best rooms you can, Abbie. Make him comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The housekeeper looked embarrassed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The house is very full, Mr. Harrison,&rdquo; she began,
    but Stone interrupted her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One room will do me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a small
    one at that. Or, if you are crowded, I will go to the inn, if there is one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no, you must stay here,&rdquo; Harrison said, though
    quite evidently speaking against his will. &ldquo;If Crawford sent you, he&rsquo;ll
    want you right here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Homer&rsquo;s rooms, sir,&rdquo; Abbie
    said, hesitantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Cale acceded. &ldquo;Would you mind
    using those?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;if it suits the
    convenience of the household. Have they taken Gaylord away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. To the mortuary, and from there to the church tomorrow,
    for the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, if it incommodes no one, let me have his
    rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone followed Abbie Perkins and was ushered into the beautiful
    suite of rooms that Homer had designed for his own use.</p>
  <p align="left">The large bedroom and sitting-room, the dressing-room and bath
    were all furnished with fine, quiet taste and the appointments were of the
    most modern and comfortable type:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrible glad you&rsquo;re here, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Abbie
    said, as she closed the door to the hall. &ldquo;I remember you well, though
    I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you remember me. When you was here last, Mr. Homer
    had just come home from Europe and he brought a lot of Oriental junk, that
    you just about went crazy over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I remember that, certainly. So you&rsquo;ve been here
    a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. And that time, too, Mr. Homer brought home
    the tapestries that hang in the little room where he was killed. Are you
    going to find out who did it, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope so, Abbie,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone, gravely.  &ldquo;But
    it seems to be a mysterious case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not mysterious a bit. Plain as the nose on your face.
    That Spanish vixen, she&rsquo;s the one you&rsquo;re after. And I hope you
    can pin it on her, that I do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore? Why, I thought she cared for Mr. Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cared for him, is it? She worshipped the ground he walked
    on. She was in love with him like you read about. But he jilted her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Jilted her! Were they ever engaged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure they were. Or at least, she said so. And he chucked
    her over as soon as he met Miss Kittredge. Ah, there&rsquo;s a lady for you!
    Do you know her, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never met her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, once you lay your two eyes on her you&rsquo;ll
    know she never could do a stroke of wrong. She&rsquo;s a born angel. Why
    she couldn&rsquo;t love Mr. Homer is more&rsquo;n I can tell. But she didn&rsquo;t,
    and there you are. We can&rsquo;t always direct the beatin&rsquo;s of our
    hearts!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie rolled her eyes upward, as if her greatest griefs were
    the occasions when she couldn&rsquo;t return the loves that were laid at
    her feet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall be glad to see Miss Kittredge,&rdquo; Stone
    said, casually. &ldquo;Is tea served, Abbie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It will be today, yes, sir. Sometimes &rsquo;tis and
    sometimes  &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t. You can always have it if you like. Now here&rsquo;s
    the bath, sir, as you see, and here&rsquo;s the bells. But mostly you&rsquo;d
    better ring Wood or me. The younger servants is all more or less nervious
    and &rsquo;stericky. The maids are no good whatsomever, and the men are &rsquo;bout
    as bad. Wood will look after your things&mdash;or are you bringing a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, with Wood&rsquo;s help and yours I shall do nicely
    for myself. Abbie, why are you so sure Miss Kittredge is so much less to
    be suspected than Miss Moore? Only because of her angel face?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mostly that.&rdquo; Abbie nodded her tightly knobbed
    head vigorously. &ldquo;But, too, Miss Kittredge is a lady, a calm, sweet
    genteel sort of person, and Miss Moore is no lady at all! She&rsquo;s low-bred,
    common, and wild-tempered. She was so jealous of the other one it made her
    fairly yellow in the face. And when she found out that Mr. Homer hoped to
    make this party an announcement party, she broke loose and put a stop to
    it all, in her own way. Well, sir, as soon as you see the two of &rsquo;em,
    you&rsquo;ll realize I&rsquo;m telling you the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Left alone, Fleming Stone threw himself into an easy-chair
    that stood at a window overlooking the gardens.</p>
  <p align="left">At first he gave himself up to the &aelig;sthetic enjoyment
    of the flowers beneath him, the blue sky above, and the green woods and fields
    in the distance.</p>
  <p align="left">The room, too, pleased his rather fastidious taste, and he
    was glad they had given him Homer&rsquo;s apartments.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, he hoped that some chance might reveal a clue or a helpful
    bit of evidence in those rooms. It would not be strange if he should find
    a stray letter or account-book that might prove of value.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet he had to admit to himself that, so far as he could see,
    there was no one to suspect but the two girls who were in the room when Gaylord
    died.</p>
  <p align="left">He remembered the room, with its great arches above the deep
    doorways. Over the doors were lunettes, beautifully painted by celebrated
    artists. The whole house was not only luxurious but in the best of taste,
    and Stone sighed at the thought of the sudden end of it all for the man he
    had called his friend.</p>
  <p align="left">This friendship, though not an intimate one, extended over
    many years, and several times Fleming Stone had visited at Twin Towers.</p>
  <p align="left">Then realizing that he was here for a purpose, the detective
    made ready and went downstairs.</p>
  <p align="left">Voices in the lounge turned his attention that way, and he
    went in the room to find most of the party assembled there.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison performed somewhat perfunctory introductions, and
    it didn&rsquo;t take the shrewd detective half a minute to learn that there
    were two distinct divisions, one hostile toward him and one friendly.</p>
  <p align="left">The facts were patent in voice, look, and gesture.</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham greeted him with all the warmth a man can show
    to a welcome visitor. Moffatt, too, grasped his hand in friendly cordiality.
    But Diana Kittredge was not present.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone was told that owing to a nervous breakdown, she had been
    ordered to bed, but expected to be able to attend the funeral ceremonies
    next day.</p>
  <p align="left">Polly Opdyke, who was very much in evidence, capered around
    Stone like the child she was. She remembered him from his last visit, and
    she drew her chair close to his own and sat gazing up into his eyes in rapt
    admiration.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see, when I saw you last, I hadn&rsquo;t ever read
    any detective stories,&rdquo; she chattered, &ldquo;but now I&rsquo;ve read
    lots of them, so I know just how you set to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must help me, then,&rdquo; said Stone, smiling at
    her &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m uncertain myself how to set to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Begin on me, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and from the tone of
    her voice, Stone knew that Marita was inimical to his presence among them.</p>
  <p align="left">Cale Harrison, sitting by her, looked at her apprehensively,
    but save for a clouded brow, he offered no hindrance.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott gave a little gasp, and turned away from Stone
    to whisper to Rollin Dare, who, as usual, was at her side.</p>
  <p align="left">The atmosphere seemed electric, and Stone rapidly and accurately
    sized up the mental attitude of those about him.</p>
  <p align="left">He wondered on which side Diana would range herself, and then
    smiled as he realized that Bingham would never have welcomed him so pleasantly,
    unless Miss Kittredge was of similar mind.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Miss Moore,&rdquo; he said, easily, &ldquo;I will
    begin with you, and thank you for the invitation. As you all know, I am here
    at Mr. Crawford&rsquo;s request, to try to discover the murderer of Gaylord
    Homer. It is not my custom to mince words or to gloss over unpleasant facts.
    Mr. Homer was killed in a brutal manner and with consummate cleverness. I
    think we need have no maudlin sympathy or pity for the murderer, for anyone
    who would strike a man in the back, and also in the dark, is among the lowest
    ranks of villains. I have been told that suspicion rests on two women who
    were in the room when Mr. Homer died. But I do not propose to start my investigation
    with any preconceived notions of my own or anyone else&rsquo;s. So, Miss
    Moore, when I question you, do not think I am accusing you, but only getting
    necessary information for my work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go to it, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Marita, fitting a fresh
    cigarette into a long jade holder, and letting Harrison light it for her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    bother about me, just satisfy your curiosity. To save your time, I&rsquo;ll
    help along by saying I was in love with Gaylord Homer, I thought him the
    most fascinating man I ever met. He didn&rsquo;t reciprocate, for some unimaginable
    reason, and I resented that. But not to the extent of putting him out of
    the way entirely! No, that was the work of&mdash;of somebody else, somebody
    who loved him less than I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Though the words were straightforward and commonplace in themselves,
    Marita&rsquo;s manner gave them a fire and a sting that made them seem positively
    venomous. And the last sentence had a spiteful fling that left no one in
    doubt it was meant for Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">Not often surprised, Stone was truly amazed at this tirade,
    for the quick speech and sharp accents made it a tirade. But accustomed to
    conceal his thoughts he let no hint of what he felt appear on his face, and
    calmly knocked off ashes from his cigarette as he went on unconcernedly.
    &#8220;I see. It hardly seems that you would kill the man you loved so well&mdash;yet
    such things have happened.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">At his first sentence Marita smiled at him, but as he added
    the latter clause, her face changed and her red mouth twisted into a veritable
    grimace of wrath&mdash;of wrath mixed with fear. In the big black eyes fear
    showed plainly for all to see.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have perfect hearing, Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;My hearing
    is super-normal. I can hear sounds at a distance that would amaze you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then&mdash;and remember, I&rsquo;m only trying to find
    another suspect than yourself or Miss Kittredge&mdash;then, if any other
    person had come into the Tapestry Room in that dark time, you must have heard
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I most assuredly must have,&rdquo; she said, but the
    insolence had gone from her voice now. &ldquo;I have wanted to think that
    happened, for it would help to remove unjust suspicion from me, but I am
    sure I heard no footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you said you did,&rdquo; Stone calmly interrupted
    her. &ldquo;You said so to the coroner. You told him you heard Mr. Harrison
    walk across the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say any such thing! I didn&rsquo;t!
    How dare you say I did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on record,&rdquo; said Stone, quietly. &ldquo;Why
    did you say you heard Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s step?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita turned sullen. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I thought I did.
    I s&rsquo;pose it was Wood stepping about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wood was not in the hall during the dark time. He stood
    in the dining-room door. Now, as your hearing is so acute, you must have
    heard the step you thought you heard. Do you still think it was Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. He was upstairs all through the dark
    time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He told me so.&rdquo; She cast a look of sudden fear
    at Harrison, who looked the picture of dejection.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You corroborate that, Mr. Harrison?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course, I&rsquo;ve said all along I was upstairs
    in the study at that time. I came down when I heard Marita scream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, Miss Moore, whose step can it be that you heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Marita lifted her head with a look of defiance
    and went on steadily, &ldquo;then, I can only think it was the step of Miss
    Kittredge as she went round to get the dagger from the table where it lay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you said the step was in the hall, and your hearing
    is so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more about my hearing!&rdquo; she
    cried, pettishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of hearing about it! I suppose I
    could be mistaken as to where the step was. That I heard a step I am positive.
    Therefore it must have been in the room and not in the hall. Surely that
    is plain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very plain,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Bingham
    stood in the lounge doorway. Could it have been his step?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No&mdash;that is&mdash;I suppose it could have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re romancing, Miss Moore. Stick to the truth.
    Was it like Mr. Bingham&rsquo;s step?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita&rsquo;s thoughts could be read in her face. About to
    say No, she suddenly thought better of it, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes, of
    course it could have been. That&rsquo;s just who it was!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then your hearing is far from acute. You could be mistaken
    in thinking you heard a step, or its direction. But one with acute hearing
    would not mistake one well-known step for another or one direction for one
    nearly opposite. Your self-avowed super-normal hearing would preclude that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nonsense! How could I tell what or where the sounds
    were. I was all upset.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why were you upset? The tragedy hadn&rsquo;t occurred
    at that time, or if it had, you didn&rsquo;t know of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business why I was upset. Talk
    to somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and Stone turned unperturbed to Ted Bingham.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These scenes are unpleasant,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but
    they have to be gone through with. Now, Mr. Bingham, you were in a somewhat
    precarious position standing in the doorway of the room where the crime occurred.
    You saw nothing, I assume, during the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing at all, Mr. Stone. Accustomed to its occurrence
    every evening, I merely stood there, waiting for the return of the lights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did you hear nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is a question I have asked of myself since. That
    night I said and believed I heard nothing, but a sort of subconscious memory
    makes me think I did hear some faint sounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A sort of deep, fluttering sigh, which I now think was
    the death gurgle of my friend. Also the ticking of the clock and the squawk
    of the parrot, that Miss Moore has already mentioned. Now, I&rsquo;m quite
    willing to admit that maybe I didn&rsquo;t hear these things, but they are
    suggestions from hearing of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard no footsteps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No footstep of any sort. The murderer must have stepped
    softly, also the rug is soft and thick. Besides, there was more or less chatter
    and laughter in the lounge. The dark time is provocative of squeals and giggles
    always, and I heard the girls laughing in there. That might have dulled the
    sound of a footstep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then the first sound you heard after the lights came
    on was&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore&rsquo;s scream and her fall to the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You picked her up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did she seem frightened, as of somebody else, or, more
    as if aghast at her own deed? Answer carefully, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For a time it seemed as if Ted didn&rsquo;t intend to answer
    at all. Then, with an effort, and slowly, he said, &ldquo;She seemed to me
    as if aghast or stunned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a full answer. Aghast as at her own
    deed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell that. I thought nothing of such fine
    shades of meaning. I saw her fallen to the floor, and I had no impulse but
    to raise her to her feet. I didn&rsquo;t know then what had happened to Gaylord,
    and I thought only of Marita.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At that moment, what was Miss Kittredge doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I was concerned only with Miss Moore.
    I thought she was going to faint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I placed her in a chair, and then I turned to see
    about Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, listen carefully, Mr. Bingham. The lights came
    up, you heard Miss Moore scream, you heard or saw her fall, you sprang to
    her assistance, and all this time you did not know anything had happened
    to Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have stated it truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, how did Miss Moore know something had happened
    to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Ted stared as the intent of this question was forced upon him.</p>
  <p align="left">True enough, if Ted knew nothing of Homer&rsquo;s death, how
    did Marita know? Even sooner, even as the lights came on, she knew. She screamed
    and fell to the floor, before Ted, only three or four feet distant, had any
    idea of the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Answer for yourself, Miss Moore,&rdquo; Stone&rsquo;s
    inexorable voice rang out. &ldquo;How did you know so instantly that Mr.
    Homer was dead or dying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because I heard that footstep, and I knew that someone
    in that room, someone near me, had stabbed him with that terrible dagger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard his death sigh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You knew it for what it was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is no mistaking a sound of that nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is all for the present; thank you, Miss Moore.&rdquo;</p>

    Abbie Perkins Helps Along</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THE funeral services for Gaylord Homer were to take place on
    Monday afternoon at three.</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone remained in his room most of the morning, but
    came down and went for a walk before luncheon.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a very sociable chap,&rdquo; commented Moffatt,
    as he and Marita watched the detective walk swingingly down the path.</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt had become friendly with the girl. He felt sorry for
    her, he told himself, but aside from that, he was under the spell of her
    subtle lure.</p>
  <p align="left">Never one to seek the society of women, his manner was a little
    shy, his speech a little uncertain. This piqued Marita&rsquo;s interest,
    for her men friends were usually of the most sophisticated. She played him
    at once, as the experienced angler plays the simple-minded trout.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather stunning
    looking, but he&rsquo;s one of those know-it-all chaps. Me, I prefer the
    strong, silent men, like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now, Moffatt was often silent for the simple reason that he
    could think of nothing to say. But he was not strong, that is, not with the
    strength usually attributed to the strong, silent class. He was of average
    strength, physically; of average strength mentally, but his character was
    too vacillating and changeable to be called strong. He was kindly by nature,
    gentle in his ways, and pathetically grateful if anybody seemed to like him.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, clever little devil, read him like a book, and decided
    to add him to her train.</p>
  <p align="left">He made no reply to the somewhat barefaced compliment, because
    he could think of no effective bit of speech, but he gave the girl a look
    of such sincere gratitude that she began to think she really liked him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He thinks I killed Gaylord,&rdquo; she went on, an angry
    flame of resentment coming into her eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think so,
    do you, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">If he had been positively convinced of her guilt, he could
    not have said so, with those limpid dark eyes looking into his.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;of course I don&rsquo;t.
    I don&rsquo;t think any woman did it. It was the work of a man, I&rsquo;m
    sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it must have been Ted. But why are you so sure?&rdquo;  She
    looked at him with a wheedling smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only that it seems to me impossible that a woman could
    have struck that blow. It was a vicious stroke, a blow of real force.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Diana is strong,&rdquo; Marita suggested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, she is athletic, muscular, I know. But she is of
    high, noble character. A queenly nature. No, she couldn&rsquo;t have done
    that thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then was it Ted Bingham?&rdquo; Marita&rsquo;s red lips
    parted in a horrified wonder. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe Ted would kill
    his friend&mdash;his chum, like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He had motive and opportunity,&rdquo; Moffatt said,
    slowly.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the detectives look for, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you of a detective&mdash;what do they call it&mdash;instinct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt smiled a little.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly that, but I&rsquo;d like to look into this case
    a bit. I&rsquo;m going to ask Stone to let me work with him. I&rsquo;m sure
    I could be of use, and I&rsquo;m quite willing to be under orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d be under my orders,&rdquo; the siren
    voice grew lower and lower until it trailed off to silence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Miss Moore&mdash;Marita&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, now, who said you might call me that?&rdquo; But
    the accompanying smile belied the words, and Moffatt&rsquo;s heart leaped
    with joy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let me be under your orders, do, Marita&mdash;do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For once he seemed to forget his shyness, and he took a step
    nearer and laid his hand on the rosy fingers that curled themselves over
    the window sill.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, why, you bad, strong, silent man! Don&rsquo;t you
    dare flirt with me! Don&rsquo;t you know that I&rsquo;ve more suitors now
    than I know what to do with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do. You said you wished I&rsquo;d
    be under your orders&mdash;and I will. Give me some now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I only just said that because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But let me help you, I wanted to and I&rsquo;m sure
    I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You just said you meant to help Mr. Stone, and he is&mdash;against
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m against him! I&rsquo;m for you, and you
    only. Tell me how I can help. I&rsquo;ll do anything&mdash;anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; and Marita looked serious, &ldquo;then
    keep to your first idea of helping Mr. Stone, but also give him to understand
    I didn&rsquo;t kill Gaylord. Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can do my part of it. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? I don&rsquo;t
    think for a minute you killed Gaylord. I&rsquo;m glad to say that to anybody.
    But the thing is to find out who did do it. That&rsquo;s the only thing that
    will relieve you and Miss Kittredge both of suspicion. Now, who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the girl hesitated, &ldquo;you see, I don&rsquo;t
    think, as you do, that it had to be a man. I don&rsquo;t see why Diana couldn&rsquo;t
    have done it. She is very strong, not only physically, but she is a strong
    character, with an inflexible will. She knows anatomy. And circumstances
    aided her. I mean she was standing; a step would take her to the table where
    the dagger was, and a few seconds would see the matter through. Then, too,
    she has collapsed since. The deed and the aftermath proved too much for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But the motive? She had no real reason to kill Gay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The money. She knew Gaylord had made a will in her favor.
    She didn&rsquo;t know it was not among his regular papers. She is poor and
    proud. Her father is old and ill, and Ted Bingham has no money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita stopped suddenly, alarmed at the horror stamped plainly
    on Moffatt&rsquo;s face. She realized he was shocked at her attitude, at
    her speech, and she hastened to repair the damage.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t want to think she did it, don&rsquo;t
    misjudge me! But what other explanation is possible? Ted Bingham simply couldn&rsquo;t
    get by me and across the room to reach the dagger. He couldn&rsquo;t have
    stabbed Gay and then have got back to his place in the doorway in the time
    he had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They say it was more than two minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but Ted wouldn&rsquo;t do it, anyway. He loved
    Gaylord, and even though he is mad about Diana, he wouldn&rsquo;t commit
    murder for her sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he would. But, there must be
    somebody else&mdash;some other suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The luncheon gong sounded, and Marita slipped her arm through
    Moffatt&rsquo;s as they went toward the dining-room.</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone materialized with surprising quickness, and most
    of the others appeared at once.</p>
  <p align="left">The party was a silent one, for all realized that the last
    rites for Gaylord Homer had to be solemnized without their having discovered
    the identity of his murderer. Even the servants went round like shadows and
    Wood positively seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone helped a little, by his calm composure, and his flow
    of pleasant small talk on light and interesting subjects.</p>
  <p align="left">But when they all began to take the places in the motor cars
    that awaited them, Stone drew Wood aside, and whispered that he should not
    attend the funeral but would remain at the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Wood nodded, understandingly, and then after the rest were
    all looked after, the butler himself got into the last car.</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone, left alone in the big house, set at once to
    work.</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Kittredge, whom he had not yet seen, for she didn&rsquo;t
    appear at lunch, had gone to the church with the rest, and Stone went to
    her room first.</p>
  <p align="left">His suspicions centered on this girl rather than on the emotional
    Marita, but he had, as yet, no bit of evidence against her.</p>
  <p align="left">He, therefore, went at once to her room, knowing which one
    it was.</p>
  <p align="left">Softly turning the knob, he went in, and received a decided
    surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">In a low chair in the middle of the room, sat Abbie Perkins,
    complacently nodding her head at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come here first,&rdquo; she said,
    calmly.  &ldquo;So I sat and waited for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you at the funeral?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My duty is here,&rdquo; she said, solemnly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    here to find out the wicked murderer and I&rsquo;m here to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want any help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You want mine, or leastwise, you&rsquo;ll take it whether
    you want it or not. I propose to go over the house with you, for I know that&rsquo;s
    what you&rsquo;re out for to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, I am. But I prefer to work alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I prefer to work with you. Now, come along and get
    about your snoopin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you object to my investigation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a bit, but it is snoopin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t it?
    See, I&rsquo;ve been through the burey draws myself. Nothin&rsquo; in &rsquo;em
    but Miss Di&rsquo;s innercent belongin&rsquo;s for the most part. But under
    a pile of linjerry was this note. You&rsquo;d better read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone was baffled. He wished he could pitch Abbie Perkins
    out of a window, but he couldn&rsquo;t feel he had a right to resort to such
    drastic methods.</p>
  <p align="left">And she was so smiling and commonplace. With such an air of
    making herself at home, and expecting him to accept the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">To gain a moment to think, he read the note she held out to
    him.</p>
  <p align="left">It ran: </p>
  <p align="left" class="note">Di Darling:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight must settle it. In the Tapestry room, after dinner
    you will say yes, won&rsquo;t you? But you said you would&mdash;you promised&mdash;my
    beauty, my queen! For a few hours more, then,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your waiting lover.</p>
  <p align="left">So interested was Fleming Stone, that he forgot Abbie was an
    intruder on his work and his time, and tacitly accepted her as part of the
    game.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is Gaylord&rsquo;s writing,&rdquo; he said, nodding
    his head at the clear, characteristic script.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&rsquo;d always know his writing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But after all, it&rsquo;s only a reminder that she said
    she&rsquo;d give him his answer that night after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Abbie said, slowly, &ldquo;and she give
    him his answer&mdash;didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump at conclusions. This note is no proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, of Miss Kittredge&rsquo;s guilt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie nodded like a mandarin.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But, look here, Abbie, you told me yesterday you were
    sure Miss Moore did the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know I did, and I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. You see,
    I&rsquo;m a-hunting clueses, and so, havin&rsquo; found that there note,
    I hold it&rsquo;s a clue and it means Miss Di is the murdereress after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You talk like a crazy woman. Now, I don&rsquo;t want
    to hear any more of your ideas or opinions. If you want to go round with
    me to show me the rooms, come along, but don&rsquo;t chatter all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Stone made his own investigation of Diana Kittredge&rsquo;s
    room, but it wasn&rsquo;t a matter of searching bureau drawers. He looked
    at the photographs and trinkets scattered about, he stepped into the bathroom,
    and looked at the bottles on the shelf there, noting those that contained
    medical prescriptions. He asked Abbie to find the shoes Miss Kittredge had
    worn on the fatal night, and when the silver slippers were produced, he looked
    long and intently at their soles.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t step in no blood spots,&rdquo; Abbie
    said, sapiently. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t no blood came from that wound,
    to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t speak of it!&rdquo; snapped Stone,
    and Abbie, leaving her mouth open, stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">He gave her back the shoes, looked around a bit more, then
    left the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie trotted after and Stone said, curtly, &ldquo;Miss Moore&rsquo;s
    room next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Golly! won&rsquo;t she be mad!&rdquo; murmured his guide. &ldquo;Come
    on, here, then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita&rsquo;s room was in a turmoil. It was evident she had
    dressed in a hurry, and also, had tried on different gowns before making
    a choice. A hat or two had been thrown on the chaise longue and some scarfs
    lay on the dresser.</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie made a dash for the dresser-drawers and Stone let her
    alone. He turned to the desk and then to the books and letters on a night
    table, and even opened a portfolio that lay in the window seat.</p>
  <p align="left">Half a dozen books were there, too, and the detective glanced
    at their titles. All were recent novels of the lightest type.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her own books or Mr. Homer&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Homer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Abbie said, after a quick
    glance.  &ldquo;He always leaves those paper covers on his books till they
    fair drops off in tatters. Me, I jerk off that cover soon&rsquo;s I get a
    book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was Stone&rsquo;s habit, too, but when he noticed the
    fruit stains and cigarette burns on the books in question, he understood
    why the protecting covers stayed on.</p>
  <p align="left">The portfolio yielded two or three passionate love notes from
    Cale Harrison, notes so ardent that Stone marvelled at their being the work
    of that apparently timid and diffident man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two soul-sides,&rdquo; he murmured and went on with
    his distasteful task.</p>
  <p align="left">The other rooms were done up in short order. Bobbie Abbott&rsquo;s
    desk showed a few short notes from Dare, left out in full view, and not of
    great interest. Also some long letters from her husband, which Stone forebore
    to read.</p>
  <p align="left">He lingered longer in the rooms of Rollin Dare and Ted Bingham.
    But he found nothing that made for evidence and nothing that could be called
    a clue.</p>
  <p align="left">Both men had hidden away trifling souvenirs, a faded flower
    or a tiny handkerchief, but Stone thought only, &ldquo;How young they are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Albert Moffatt&rsquo;s room was also bare of interesting items.
    Stone noticed neatness and the tidy way the letters and papers were placed
    in the desk.</p>
  <p align="left">He hastily ran over the letters and found them merely business
    matters, evidently brought up from his New York office.</p>
  <p align="left">In every room Stone looked carefully at the shoes available,
    but in no case did he find any that claimed more than a passing notice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All over, Abbie,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    learn much, it&rsquo;s true, but I feel a little better acquainted with these
    people. Now, for the Tapestry Room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Cram keeps that locked up, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it, but I have the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May I go in with you, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; Abbie inquired,
    duly humble after Stone&rsquo;s small snubs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;ll not chatter. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For the first time, Fleming Stone went into the room where
    the tragedy had occurred. The room from which he hoped to gain some information,
    some idea of which way to look for the criminal. He had been there before,
    but he stood still, as he entered, impressed anew by the beauty of the place.</p>
  <p align="left">They had entered by the door from the lounge, so that he paused
    in the very doorway where Ted Bingham had stood.</p>
  <p align="left">The door itself was an ordinary one, but it opened into the
    deep arch that formed that side of the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Both sides of the door held bookshelves, built in to the height
    of six or seven feet. Above were pictures, and higher, in the arch itself,
    a lunette painting of great beauty and worth.</p>
  <p align="left">Opposite him was the fireplace, that filled the arch on that
    side. Either side of the fireplace hung the rare and celebrated tapestries.
    They hung flat and straight, a few inches from the wall, and on a table near
    by, were various magnifying glasses through which visitors studied the exquisite
    handiwork.</p>
  <p align="left">To Stone&rsquo;s right was the arch over the window, and to
    his left the arch over the hall door. Both these arches were flanked by bookcases,
    and all the bookshelves were full.</p>
  <p align="left">As is so often the case in a small library, the overflow of
    books were laid flat on top of the standing books, giving an effect of untidiness,
    but also one of homeliness and comfort.</p>
  <p align="left">There were several tables, laden with curios and rare volumes,
    several chairs and the small sofa or love-seat, on which Homer had met his
    death.</p>
  <p align="left">Everything, Stone had been assured, was just as it had been
    left the night of the tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">He stepped around softly, his eyes roving swiftly over every
    detail of the place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hope I&rsquo;m not intruding,&rdquo; said a quiet voice,
    and looking round, Stone saw Albert Moffatt standing in the doorway to the
    lounge.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all, come on in,&rdquo; said Stone, cordially,
    rather glad of someone to speak to beside the unsatisfactory Abbie. &ldquo;Is
    the funeral over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but most of them stayed to talk with friends or
    neighbors. I didn&rsquo;t know the friends and neighbors so I came along
    home here. Snug little room, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, a beautiful room, and comfortable too. Gaylord
    used it a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh yes, he loved it. Whenever I&rsquo;ve visited here,
    we always sat here after dinner every night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And he told you all about the treasures, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He tried to,&rdquo; Moffatt smiled a little. &ldquo;But
    I wasn&rsquo;t terribly interested in the history of the tapestries or the
    old books. I suppose I&rsquo;m a Philistine, but the love of those things
    was somehow left out of my composition. See here, Mr. Stone, are you going
    to catch the one that killed Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope so, Mr. Moffatt. Can you give me any hint or
    advice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t see that I can. But I do want to
    ask you to look in any other possible direction before you accuse either
    one of those girls. It&rsquo;s too preposterous to think they could do it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It seems so to me, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo; exclaimed Abbie,
    who had lingered after Moffatt&rsquo;s arrival. &ldquo;A woman has as much
    hate and venom in her nature as a man has. A woman has as much greed and
    money-lust as a man has. Any woman is quite as capable of murder as any man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie&rsquo;s long, gaunt figure fairly quivered with wrath
    as she pronounced her decree. Her bony hands knitted themselves together
    and her foot tapped nervously on the soft, deep rug.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leave us now, Abbie,&rdquo; Stone said, not at all unkindly.  &ldquo;Mr.
    Moffatt and I want a little talk by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">None too willingly, Abbie stalked out of the room, and Stone
    turned to Moffatt. &#8220;I think that you may as well make up your mind that you
    are your cousin&rsquo;s heir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think
    any will will be found, and in fact I can&rsquo;t feel sure Gaylord made
    that will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I only know, Mr. Stone, that he told me he intended
    to make it, and intended to leave most of his wealth to Miss Kittredge. Before
    I should consent to inherit we must use every effort to locate that will.
    You see my position, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly. Every effort must and will be made.
    But, I&rsquo;m only saying I doubt the existence of that will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the police and the detectives to find
    out. Tell me, have you any hopes of finding the murderer? That&rsquo;s more
    the burden of my desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I always have hope, Mr. Moffatt. But aside from hope,
    I confess that so far I&rsquo;ve found little to work on. Hark, is that the
    people coming home from the church?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, it is. I hear Bingham&rsquo;s voice and Dare&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, some of them. Here they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Several came to the open door of the lounge and looked in at
    the two men in the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May we come in?&rdquo; asked Polly Opdyke, who had come
    along with the others.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stone said, smiling down at her. &ldquo;Not
    today, Polly dear. Tomorrow, if you wish. Tell me, are Miss Kittredge and
    Miss Moore there? And Mr. Bingham?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Polly said; &ldquo;want &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do. Ask them to come here, will you? That&rsquo;s
    a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Polly did the errand and reluctantly went off home.</p>
  <p align="left">The ones Stone had asked for came wonderingly to the doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; the detective said, in his pleasant
    voice.  &ldquo;Moffatt, present me to Miss Kittredge, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Fleming Stone looked for the first time on the face
    of Sky-eyes, the beautiful one.</p>
  <p align="left">He often said, afterward, that he was completely bowled over.
    He had never imagined such perfect beauty as that, and the sudden thought
    of suspecting that goddess of crime seemed to him too absurd to dream of.</p>
  <p align="left">But, accustomed to hiding his feelings, Stone merely bowed
    his acknowledgment of the introduction, and said, in a tone of real solicitude:  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    afraid you are weary, Miss Kittredge, after the services.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Diana said, in a strong, tense voice
    that made Stone look at her quickly. &ldquo;I am quite well,&rdquo; she went
    on. &ldquo;Do you want to question me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not now, Miss Kittredge. But I want something else
    of you, that may be a bit of an ordeal. I want you to do your part in the
    reconstruction of the scene of the tragedy of Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana paled and her air of bravado seemed to leave her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come on, Di,&rdquo; Marita said, with a touch of haughtiness
    in her tone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it, if Mr. Stone asks us, and we
    may as well do it now as to put it off. Come on, I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Moore,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;Believe
    me, I would not ask it save that I think it necessary. Mr. Bingham, will
    you assist us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; growled Bingham,
    not at all pleased at the idea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Moffatt interrupted, &ldquo;is it necessary,
    Stone? It&rsquo;ll be a hard strain on nerves pretty much frazzled already.&rdquo; He
    looked at Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; Stone said, coldly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11">Chapter 11</a><br>
    The Reconstruction</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;M SORRY,&rdquo; Stone said, in a really regretful
    tone, &ldquo;but since I am investigating this case, I feel I must do it
    in my own way. And while this reconstruction is, I know, a painful ordeal
    for all concerned, yet we all want to get at the truth, and so I am counting
    on your cooperation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Count on mine, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Moffatt said; &ldquo;if
    you think this thing must be done, I&rsquo;m sure it must be. I think we
    all have only the wish you mention, that of getting at the truth, and this
    may be the means of discovering the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then will you two ladies please stand by this couch&mdash;no,
    better yet, go to the dining-room and walk in here. Who will act Gaylord&rsquo;s
    part?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone spoke in no light tone, he gave the affair no
    effect of stage-play, but neither was he lugubrious about it. He was business-like
    and cool, and he looked from one to another of the three men before him,
    for Dare and Bobbie Abbott had come into the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Count me out on that!&rdquo; Dare said, emphatically.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And Bingham has his own part to play,&rdquo; Moffatt
    said,  &ldquo;so it devolves on me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; Stone returned. &ldquo;Will you,
    then, go into the dining-room with the two ladies and come back here, just
    as it was done Friday evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course, and the ladies will give me instructions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana&rsquo;s blue eyes filled with horror, but she walked
    steadily to the hall and on to the dining-room.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita grasped Moffatt&rsquo;s arm and drew him with her, in
    Diana&rsquo;s wake.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take your place in the doorway, please, Mr. Bingham,&rdquo;  Stone
    directed. &ldquo;Mr. Dare and Mrs. Abbott, please step into the window alcove,
    and do not speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It began to seem eerie, but Stone&rsquo;s matter-of-fact manner
    was cool and determined.</p>
  <p align="left">A little frightened, Rollin Dare and Bobbie withdrew into the
    deep window embrasure, and much to his distaste, Bingham stood in the doorway
    to the lounge.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now come in,&rdquo; Stone said clearly to the waiting
    trio. &ldquo;Enter just as you did Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In a deathly stillness, Moffatt came through the hall, with
    one hand clasping that of Diana, as she walked by his side, and on his other
    arm, Marita clung with both hands.</p>
  <p align="left">They came into the room, watched by Stone and Bingham, as well
    as the pair in the window.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, Marita, who was too much of an actress not to enter into
    the spirit of the thing, drew Moffatt down on the love-seat, and perched
    herself on the arm of it, at his left side.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana paused before reaching the couch and stood, a few feet
    in front and to the right of Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham stared from the doorway, his face white and his lips
    in a tense line.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; and this time Stone&rsquo;s voice had a
    bit of hollow ring in it, &ldquo;all close your eyes and pretend it is the
    dark time. Keep them closed until I tell you to open them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">None dared disobey, and as if hypnotized, they closed their
    eyes, all but Fleming Stone himself.</p>
  <p align="left">Standing in front of the group, he watched them all.</p>
  <p align="left">And then Marita, carried away by the dramatic situation, gave
    a sudden start, screamed and fell to the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">Without volition of his senses, Bingham started toward her,
    to raise her, but Moffatt was ahead of him and had picked up the slight figure,
    and placed her in an easy chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to criticize your method, Mr. Stone,&rdquo;  he
    cried, &ldquo;but I do think this is all a bit of unnecessary cruelty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I doubt if it has seriously harmed Miss Moore,&rdquo;  Stone
    said, coolly. &ldquo;She seems all right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And sure enough, Marita was quite herself and almost seemed
    to be enjoying her little scene.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana had accepted the chair Stone pushed toward her, and Ted
    came and stood behind her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was necessary,&rdquo; Stone went on, &ldquo;for I
    needed to know just the situation. Remember, we have no eye-witness save
    the two ladies, and they can scarcely be called such in the dark. Now, if
    you please, a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; and Harrison&rsquo;s apologetic
    voice sounded in the hall doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone said, curtly, &ldquo;but sit down
    and be quiet. Miss Moore, what made you scream and fall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied, and her face
    was colorless.  &ldquo;I think because it brought back the scene so sharply.
    And I kept listening for the sounds I heard that night, but I heard none
    of them, except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She paused, and her face grew horrified as she saw, for the
    first time that Harrison had entered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Stone said, quickly, &ldquo;except what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I heard none of them,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;None
    at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Except the step in the hall,&rdquo; prompted Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, obediently, &ldquo;except the
    step in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s step,&rdquo; Stone supplied, and
    she nodded her head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear the parrot call?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor the gasp of&mdash;of Mr. Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; she shuddered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor the laughter and talk from those in the lounge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor the clock ticking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not strange,&rdquo; Stone said, musingly, &ldquo;for
    now your nerves are taut and your mind is in a whirl. Friday night you were
    calm and collected, with senses calm and receptive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Marita nodded comprehendingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are sure you heard the clock ticking Friday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ticking loudly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not very loudly, but clearly and unmistakably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore,&rdquo; Stone looked at her, and then looked
    quickly round the room, &ldquo;there is no clock here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita looked round, wonderingly, curiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s been carried away,&rdquo; she said,
    positively.  &ldquo;I know I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe it was your wrist watch,&rdquo; Stone said, looking
    at the diamond and platinum bracelet watch she wore.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Marita looked perplexed, &ldquo;this watch
    of mine has the faintest tick&mdash;listen,&rdquo; she held up her arm, and
    the sound was barely audible,  &ldquo;and any way, I wouldn&rsquo;t think
    my own watch, that I&rsquo;m accustomed to, was a clock! No, there was a
    clock in here, I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look up the matter,&rdquo; and Stone spoke
    soothingly.  &ldquo;Did you hear a clock tick, Friday night, Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You heard nothing, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing at all, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was a silence, and then Marita exclaimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, there it is! Hear it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And a soft ticking sound was faintly but clearly audible in
    the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a watch,&rdquo; said Moffatt, listening.</p>
  <p align="left">Involuntarily, every one in the room glanced at his or her
    own hand.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, Stone, Bingham, and Moffatt wore no wrist watch. Bobbie
    and Dare both had them on, but theirs were as faint of sound as Marita&rsquo;s
    own.</p>
  <p align="left">But Cale Harrison&rsquo;s wrist watch, neither a beautiful
    nor valuable one, ticked quite as loudly as a small clock might do.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison stared at it, with a slightly embarrassed air.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s my watch you hear, Marita,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t one of those expensive ones, it&rsquo;s a good
    timekeeper, but it has a loud tick, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sounds just like the ticking I heard Friday night,&rdquo;  Marita
    said, her whole attention on Cale&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, Miss Moore,&rdquo; Stone went on, smoothly, &ldquo;if
    you heard Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s step in the hall and Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s
    watch ticking, during the dark time, won&rsquo;t we have to assume that Mr.
    Harrison came downstairs a bit sooner than he thought he did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The secretary half rose from his chair, an angry light in his
    eye.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is this an accusation, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By no means, Mr. Harrison. It is a well known fact that
    when a sudden shock occurs to one, the memory is often apt to become a blank
    for a few moments. It is far from improbable that you are quite unable to
    remember the exact moment that you came downstairs on Friday night. Nor is
    it likely that it makes any difference to our inquiry. But we want the facts
    as far as we can get them, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Harrison said, but his eyes were
    frowning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Send me Rhoda,&rdquo; Stone said, carelessly, to someone
    in the hall, and Wood did his bidding.</p>
  <p align="left">The maid appeared, looking a little sullen.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rhoda,&rdquo; Stone said, looking directly at her, &ldquo;think
    carefully now, when you came downstairs, Friday night, after hearing somebody
    scream, who was left upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody sir,&rdquo; the girl said, fingering her apron.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody except Mr. Harrison, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not Mr. Harrison, sir. He had gone down already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And when did he go down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A sudden look passed between Harrison and the girl. It was
    all too easily read. It was a warning, a menacing look, and Rhoda caught
    its intent.</p>
  <p align="left">With an easy grace, she shifted her attitude and, looking thoughtful,
    said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m wrong about that&mdash;let me see&mdash;Mr.
    Harrison came out of the study, just after I ran downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that, Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may go.&rdquo; Then, turning to the others, he said.  &ldquo;That
    lets Mr. Harrison out&mdash;if Rhoda is telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; came from Marita, in a spiteful
    tone.  &ldquo;Abbie Perkins says Rhoda is an awful liar, and never tells
    the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, Marita!&rdquo; exclaimed Harrison, in such a hurt
    wail, that Bobbie broke into nervous laughter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, I think,&rdquo; Stone said, gently, &ldquo;you
    have all been most kind in your efforts to help me. And I think you&rsquo;d
    all be better for a good rest or bit of recreation. Run away, please, all
    but one of you. I have a little more to do in this room, and I want the help
    of one. I don&rsquo;t care which one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; Cale said, sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    had enough reconstruction!&rdquo;  and he left the room swiftly and suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hateful thing!&rdquo; Marita exclaimed. &ldquo;Then
    I did hear him, and it was his watch I thought was a clock! But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; her
    eyes grew big with fright,  &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t kill Gaylord, did he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to deduce without all the facts, Miss
    Moore,&rdquo; Stone spoke gravely. &ldquo;Better run away for a little time,
    and get some exercise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I will. Come along, Mr. Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was about to offer my services to Mr. Stone,&rdquo;  was
    the hesitating reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh well, then don&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; and Marita flung
    herself angrily out of the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But perhaps you don&rsquo;t want me,&rdquo; Moffatt
    turned to the detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like either you or Mr. Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, please&mdash;any other time,&rdquo; Ted said, for
    he was longing to get off for a little talk with Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, it looks like you, Mr. Moffatt,&rdquo; and Stone
    smiled at him. &ldquo;Sorry to impose on your good nature, but&mdash;well,
    I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime, while talking, he had dismissed the people all except
    Moffatt, and had closed the doors of the Tapestry Room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see, I think it imperative that the will, if any,
    be found. I think we can&rsquo;t go ahead intelligently until we settle that
    matter. For, no matter what your cousin told you, is it not possible that
    he changed his mind before he made the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is quite possible, Mr. Stone. Gaylord was not at
    all of set purpose. He was often vacillating. But I, too, want the will found,
    whatever its contents. You see,&rdquo; he smiled a little, &ldquo;if he did
    change his mind and left me the bulk of his estate, how much more comforting
    for me to know that, than to take it by default as it were. And if he left
    it to Miss Kittredge, I shall indeed be glad to know I am not getting it
    under false pretensions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Well, then, Mr. Moffatt, I want to search this
    room for that will, and while the room is not large, it&rsquo;s a goodish
    job. If you&rsquo;ll help, it will cut the work in two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed, yes. Any plan of approach?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what do you think? Suppose we each take half the
    room, and then take over one another&rsquo;s half. Thus we can check up on
    each other, and make the thing thorough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s go. Which side do you want to begin
    on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ll start here, at the hall
    door and go back toward the fireplace, and you start at the hall door and
    go the other way. When we meet we&rsquo;ll change places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Righto. Now, do we open every book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, we&rsquo;d never get done, that way. How big
    was the book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About like this.&rdquo; Moffatt took from the shelf
    the play of The Bluebird, and held it up.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I see. Then, let&rsquo;s skip over all big folios and
    quartos and also all duodecimos and just take down books of this size. And
    we&rsquo;ll just take the ones of which we&rsquo;re uncertain. I mean, where
    there&rsquo;s a whole shelf of plays or novels or poems, and we can read
    their labels clearly, there&rsquo;s no sense in pulling them down. But we
    must look behind the books. In a word, satisfy ourselves that the book in
    question is not here. We&rsquo;ve a good two hours before dinner. That ought
    to do it. Are you game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Game it is,&rdquo; and already Moffatt had three or
    four books in his hand which he quickly ran over, and replaced.</p>
  <p align="left">Both men were alert at this sort of work, both were efficient
    and of quick motion, and they worked away in silence for a time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fine set of Conrad here,&rdquo; said Moffatt; &ldquo;fond
    of him, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only read half a dozen or so. I&rsquo;m sorry
    to say, I get scant time for reading. I care a lot for bindings, though.
    Old or rare bindings are a treat to me, just to look at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you must look in this case. It&rsquo;s full of
    that sort of stuff. Probably you don&rsquo;t care much for light reading,
    then. I mean, novels and poems, and brief essays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I almost never read novels and poems. Essays, sometimes.
    What an incongruous lot there is here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All sorts, yes. I wonder why so good a mind as Gaylord
    had would waste itself on trash. Here&rsquo;s a whole case full of the silliest
    truck: love stories, adventure, detective stories&mdash;you ought to like
    those, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I have enough in real life not to
    read about sleuthing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And plays. Gaylord seems to have run to plays. Many
    of them worn out, too, at least, their paper jackets are worn out. Well,
    we&rsquo;re getting nearly together. No sign of the will book yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They met, and confessed mutual failure. Then, in accordance
    with Stone&rsquo;s rather elaborate plan, they started round the other way,
    each one going over the other&rsquo;s territory.</p>
  <p align="left">It wanted but a quarter of an hour to dinner time when they
    called the work finished and prepared to leave the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Beautiful place,&rdquo; Stone said, looking about him.  &ldquo;Are
    there more books anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, two or three big bookcases up in the study.
    These are the choice volumes, though. Though, of course, he might have taken
    the will book up there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why call this the Tapestry Room? Why not the library?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;One of Gay&rsquo;s fads.
    He said library was a pretentious word, unless a chap had stacks and stacks
    of books. He liked bookroom better, but when he got these tapestries, he
    said they were worthy of a named room. So he called it the Tapestry Room.
    They&rsquo;re grand, I know, but I&rsquo;m no judge of such things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Anything behind them?&rdquo; Stone asked, as he gazed
    at the work through a lens, and admired the marvelous coloring.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One hides a small wall safe, the other nothing. They
    do fit in, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They do so,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll
    miss the cocktails.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They went to the lounge, for it had been agreed not to dress
    for dinner that night.</p>
  <p align="left">The rest, or most of them, were there, and Stone was surprised
    to find both Diana and Marita most kindly disposed toward him. He had expected
    dark looks and cold shoulders, but both girls seemed more friendly than before
    the scene of the afternoon.</p>
  <p align="left">Pleased at this, he, too, made himself agreeable, and when
    Fleming Stone set out to do that, he did it very well indeed.</p>
  <p align="left">Dinner was far less gloomy than anyone had anticipated, and
    if a dark shadow hung over the group at the table, it was not referred to
    or noticed by any of them.</p>
  <p align="left">The only one who seemed out of sorts was Harrison. Though he
    had not changed for dinner, he had removed his wrist watch.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone thought this a decided improvement, but he made a note
    of the fact.</p>
  <p align="left">Indeed, that astute gentleman was making note of many facts,
    and his bland and suave demeanor was merely a cover for a riot of facts and
    theories that were gyrating in his head.</p>
  <p align="left">He was not a notebook detective. All he saw, all he deduced,
    all he imagined he had trained his memory to store up against the time when
    he could sit down to sort and classify them.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana had recovered her poise, and, looking very beautiful,
    she chose to smile upon him a little.</p>
  <p align="left">With Marita on his other side, and far from being a parlor
    knight, Fleming Stone felt a little embarrassed.</p>
  <p align="left">Nor is that entirely surprising. To sit at dinner between two
    beautiful girls, both under suspicion of murder, is enough to disturb the
    equanimity of the bravest.</p>
  <p align="left">And add to that, the fact that both girls were apparently at
    their ease, apparently carefree, it is small wonder a mere man was a little
    unnerved.</p>
  <p align="left">But, watching them closely, Stone could see that their pleasant
    glances for him, did not extend to each other. He sensed an undercurrent
    of enmity, and read it to his own satisfaction.</p>
  <p align="left">He decided that whichever one of them was guilty, they were
    both smart enough to put on a bold front, thus each wearing the air of innocence.</p>
  <p align="left">He was more than ever sure of this when each in turn, tried
    to talk to him in a low tone, a veritable t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, first, getting his undivided attention, cautiously inquired
    if the reconstruction, as she straightforwardly called it, didn&rsquo;t incriminate
    Marita.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; fenced Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, because she&rsquo;s so temperamental, you know,
    and that scene brought it all back to her, and made her scream and fall on
    the floor, as she remembered the scene of Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not quite clear, Miss Kittredge,&rdquo; Stone
    said, smiling into her eyes in a disarming way. &ldquo;I understand Miss
    Moore&rsquo;s temperament, but why is it incriminating?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana looked disappointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I only mean,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;that because
    of that exhibition of temperament, which you may not have before realized,
    you might agree that Marita was capable of a terrible deed, that a more normal
    mind could never compass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It has been said by a great writer that we are all capable
    of crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone, that isn&rsquo;t so. I don&rsquo;t care
    who said it, it isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe not, Miss Kittredge. I don&rsquo;t vouch for its
    truth, I merely quote it. But we have to admit that somebody did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say! And who so likely as one
    with a temperament of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and Marita&rsquo;s soft voice chimed
    in at his other side, &ldquo;you must talk to me a little, you know. You
    can&rsquo;t let Sky-eyes monopolize you entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; and Stone turned gracefully
    enough to Marita. &ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t we three talk together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Diana, in her iciest voice, and turned
    away from them to Bingham, who welcomed her gladly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, Fleming Stone,&rdquo; said Marita, saucily, &ldquo;after
    that exhibition of rudeness, can you doubt which of us girls is the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone stared at her. Surely, he had never met such an outspoken
    minx.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose, Miss Moore, your inappropriate levity is
    the result of shattered nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My heavens and earth, what a stilted speech! Do you
    never unbend? Never act human at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My vocation leads me among inhuman acts and natures,&rdquo;  he
    said, speaking very seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Applesauce!&rdquo; remarked Marita rudely, and turned
    her back upon him.</p>

    The Mysterious Ticking</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THAT evening Lawyer Crawford came over to confer with Stone
    and as Sergeant Cram arrived about the same time they all discussed matters.
    They sat in the Tapestry Room, as being a place where they might be alone.</p>
  <p align="left">Crawford asked the detective if he felt ready to make a report.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a formal report, no,&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;But
    I&rsquo;m ready to talk things over. I don&rsquo;t mind saying it is one
    of the most peculiar cases I ever came across. It seems to me we have no
    real evidence of any sort. Pointing, I mean, to any individual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He told them of the reconstruction he had carried out in the
    afternoon but declared that it gave no further light on the subject than
    they already had.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You must admit, sir,&rdquo; Cram put in, &ldquo;that
    we can ascribe motive and opportunity, exclusive opportunity, to those two
    girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think the motives are flimsy,&rdquo; Stone said, seriously,  &ldquo;and
    the opportunity not exclusive.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;You&rsquo;re considering a third party?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is a possibility,&rdquo; Stone answered. &ldquo;You
    know those Bridge problems they publish in the magazines. Or, maybe you don&rsquo;t.
    Well, anyway, the problem is given and it must be solved against any possible
    defense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But why do you think of a third party?&rdquo; asked
    Moffatt.  &ldquo;And how do you theorize such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly theory,&rdquo; Stone replied, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    logic. I haven&rsquo;t been able to choose between those two girls as a likely
    culprit, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean their innocence. I&rsquo;ve tried to
    get hints from what they say about each other and about other people, but
    they say very little. As a matter of fact, they are too casual, too light-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Crawford smiled
    at him,  &ldquo;your experiences have been with older or more hardened criminals.
    I admit it is most unusual to suspect a young girl of murder, but with this
    case before us, I can see no other way to look. One of those girls must be
    the guilty party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then we must determine which one,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;But
    Miss Moore has several times referred to a step in the hall at the time of
    the murder. She says it may have been in the room, says it must have been
    Miss Kittredge going about her dreadful business. In fact, her remarks about
    that step she heard are both vague and contradictory. But her vagueness and
    contradictoriness arise from her changing affections or whims. The point
    that she did hear a step remains in my mind and it must be investigated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She said it was Harrison crossing the hall,&rdquo; began
    Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Crossing the hall when? From where to where? Harrison
    didn&rsquo;t cross the hall, and why should he? He came downstairs, either
    before or after Miss Moore screamed. I asked the maid, Rhoda, about it. She
    had said Harrison went downstairs before she did; today, at a glance from
    Harrison, she gaily changed her mind and said she went down first. Is there
    something between those two?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I believe there is,&rdquo; Crawford admitted. &ldquo;Homer
    told me once he should dismiss the secretary unless he quit fooling with
    the girl. She&rsquo;s pretty, you see, and her duties take her up to the
    second floor, where the study is, and where Harrison usually is. Now, I believe,
    Rhoda is jealous of his affection for Miss Moore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think Miss Moore has transplanted her affections,&rdquo;  Stone
    said. &ldquo;I fancy the secretary has a rival.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Meaning Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Natural, too,&rdquo; said Sergeant Cram, gruffly. &ldquo;That
    sort of girl always looks to the main chance. She never cared for Cale Harrison,
    she wanted Homer. And now that there&rsquo;s a probability of Moffatt inheriting
    the Homer fortune, she whips her affections in his direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who is Miss Moore?&rdquo; asked Stone. &ldquo;How does
    she come to be in this party at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dancer,&rdquo; Cram told him. &ldquo;I
    didn&rsquo;t know much about her at first, but I&rsquo;ve looked her up.
    She&rsquo;s all right, I guess, but a Tartar as to temper. She lives in New
    York, with a duenna sort of person, who is respectable, far&rsquo;s I can
    make out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was engaged to Homer, at one time,&rdquo; Crawford
    contributed. &ldquo;A mad fancy of his, which lasted only a short time. Then
    he met Miss Kittredge and promptly threw over Marita. He said there was no
    engagement, she said there was, but by dint of argument and some more material
    means, I induced her to call the engagement off. This sounds worse than it
    was, I fear. Gaylord was not a Lothario at all. The Moore girl dazzled him
    and roped him in. He was glad to be rid of her and honestly in love with
    Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then why was Miss Moore invited here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know, but she worked it somehow.
    She&rsquo;s a friend of Bobbie Abbott&rsquo;s and she wheedled the invitation
    through her, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Stone said, slowly, &ldquo;then Miss Moore
    has had time to arrange a premeditated crime. And it is the premeditated
    crime that is hardest to solve. I&rsquo;ve heard detectives say the contrary,
    but for ease of unraveling give me the impulsive act every time. Unless plans
    are laid and trails covered with greatest care, unexpected evidence crops
    up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Crawford objected, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    seem to see that gay little piece planning and plotting one of the worst
    murders I&rsquo;ve ever known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a criminal lawyer,&rdquo; Stone told
    him. &ldquo;Mr. Cram and I have known crimes committed by the least likely
    people in the world. Haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cram, &ldquo;and I do think Marita
    Moore did this one. She&rsquo;s a fury, when she gets really angry. The weapon
    was one she would choose. Now, if Miss Kittredge had wanted to kill Homer,
    she&rsquo;d have shot him. She&rsquo;s a wonderful shot&mdash;of course,
    I&rsquo;ve found out all about her&mdash;and she&rsquo;s way up on all sports.
    Rides and hunts and is especially fond of target-shooting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Motive?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Money,&rdquo; returned Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Crawford agreed, &ldquo;Diana Kittredge
    is up against it, financially. If she had the Homer money, she&rsquo;d be
    all right. Unless she does get some money, she&rsquo;ll have to give up her
    home, and I don&rsquo;t know what will become of her invalid father. I can
    imagine that girl doing the thing to help her old father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; Stone observed. &ldquo;A girl of Miss
    Kittredge&rsquo;s character isn&rsquo;t likely to commit a crime out of filial
    affection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All the same, she had no reason except the money. Whether
    for herself or for her old dad doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Cram reminded
    them. &ldquo;What bothers me is the absence of clues. I haven&rsquo;t had
    time to look for those yet,&rdquo; Stone said, smiling. &ldquo;There must
    be some around.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He glanced about the beautiful room, as if expecting clues
    to come fluttering to his feet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bet you won&rsquo;t find any,&rdquo; Cram told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    hunted this place from the ground up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t really disturb anything, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course not. I can skin a room and leave it as I found
    it. Now, what about collusion between those two girls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone looked at the sergeant to see if he could be in earnest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That seems to me unlikely,&rdquo; was all, he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ridiculous,&rdquo; Crawford exclaimed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Cram went on, &ldquo;if that idea&rsquo;s
    ridiculous, then there&rsquo;s nothing for it but that one of them did it.
    Now, the time&rsquo;s come for action. I&rsquo;ll have them both arrested,
    or held under detention or something till we find out for sure which is the
    one, and there you are. If Marita did the killing, then there&rsquo;s no
    will leaving the money to Diana, or the dancer wouldn&rsquo;t do it. If Diana
    did the killing then there is a will and she knows where it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pretty drastic measures, Mr. Cram,&rdquo; Stone said,
    a little taken aback at the policeman&rsquo;s crude reasoning. &ldquo;I think
    there&rsquo;s something more subtle behind this crime than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Find it, then, Mr. Stone. The chance is yours. Go over
    the ground and find your subtle evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the cousin, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing doing, Mr. Stone. I looked him up and down and
    all over. You see, he was the obvious suspect from the first, so I had him
    shadowed at once. There&rsquo;s two of our best men on him yet. Everything
    he&rsquo;s done since Friday night has been recorded.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had his rooms searched?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, with a fine tooth comb. Not a thing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was he the night of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In New York. He said, at the inquest, he had gone to
    the Movies that night, to see &lsquo;Jungle Jim.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s that
    new wild animal film. Said that afterwards he dropped into a little club
    and staid an hour, then went home. All that&rsquo;s been checked up over
    and over. We found the man he sat next to in the theater and we found the
    girl who sold him his ticket and we went to the little club&mdash;a few old
    fogy sort of young men&mdash;and every point is proved. So, we can leave
    him out. But if you&rsquo;re talking about outsiders, I mean outside of the
    Tapestry Room, what about Cale Harrison? He still sticks me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Motive?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Money, of course. I think he has the will, or knows
    where it is. I think there&rsquo;s a big bequest in it for him, or else&mdash;or
    else, he may mean to raise money on it from Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where has he hidden the will, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Somewhere in this room,&rdquo; opined Cram. &ldquo;Between
    some of the books, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Sergeant, I&rsquo;m sorry to quash that nice theory
    of yours, but this afternoon, Mr. Moffatt and I searched these books thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You did? Good work! And found no trace of the will?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No trace of the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You made a thorough search, I suppose, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;  Crawford
    spoke dubiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very thorough, Mr. Crawford. We each took half the room,
    and then went over each other&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe Moffatt gave you the slip, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I guarded against that. I had a little gadget, a sort
    of toy periscope, that I could look into, unseen by him, and I could spot
    everything he was doing. I didn&rsquo;t search much myself, for I can go
    over the room any time. But I wanted to see how he would work. He put up
    an honest search, took down the books, scrutinized them and put them back.
    You see, if there is a will, he wants to know it, so he won&rsquo;t grab
    the estate without a right to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a very interesting man, Moffatt, but he seems all
    right,&rdquo; Crawford said. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve hunted the desks and
    filing cabinets in the study, and soon I suppose I&rsquo;d better set the
    machinery going to make Moffatt the heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s the heir, I want to get
    the murderer,&rdquo;  Stone declared. &ldquo;I never had a case grip me as
    this one does, nor one that made me feel so helpless. Gaylord was my friend.
    I hadn&rsquo;t seen much of him lately, but the old affection is still there.
    I&rsquo;ve never before had a case where a friend was the victim, and then
    to think I am baffled at the outset! But I&rsquo;ll get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve nothing to get at,&rdquo; Cram said, moodily, &ldquo;but
    to choose between those two girls. One of them did it. The step Marita heard
    was either Miss Kittredge&rsquo;s or her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why would she mention it if it was her own?&rdquo; cried
    Crawford.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To put us off the track. I&rsquo;m fully convinced,&rdquo; Cram
    went on, &ldquo;that that step she heard is a fabrication of her clever mind,
    unless, that is, it was the step of Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I doubt if she heard a step at all,&rdquo; Stone said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably not. Now, look at it. Say, it was planned,
    premeditated. That makes it out Marita. For Miss Kittredge didn&rsquo;t want
    to go in the room with Homer at all. She tried not to. But Miss Moore forced
    her way in. She knew the dark time would come in a minute or two. She even
    told Diana what time it was. She testified that. She had on a wrist watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Stone, and he told them
    about the ticking clock and Harrison&rsquo;s loud ticking watch.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram thought this over in silence.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he said, &ldquo;That must be looked into, Mr. Stone. But
    I believe the jade made that all up. I don&rsquo;t think she heard any ticking
    watch or clock either. Harrison couldn&rsquo;t have got into the room, past
    Diana, without those girls knowing it. Look here, Mr. Stone, you had your
    reconstruction. Tell us exactly where the three were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Stone looked at his watch. &ldquo;The
    dark time tonight is almost due. I&rsquo;ll show you the places, and let
    us keep them till the light comes on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Explaining, Stone placed Crawford in Gaylord&rsquo;s place
    on the love-seat, made Cram sit on the arm of it at Crawford&rsquo;s left
    hand, and himself stood at the lawyer&rsquo;s right, half way between the
    love-seat and the hall door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I am standing just where
    Miss Kittredge says she stood. Now, I hold it would be impossible for anyone
    to come in from the hall, get past me without my hearing or feeling him,
    get over to that table behind Gaylord, and then stab him in the dark and
    get away in the dark, without being sensed by Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean sensed?&rdquo; asked Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I mean a sort of sense of somebody&rsquo;s presence.
    Perhaps not quite seeing or hearing or feeling, but a mingling of all three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get that stuff,&rdquo; Cram grunted, &ldquo;but
    I wish you&rsquo;d all stay like this till the dark comes. In a minute now,
    I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Willingly enough they kept their positions, and after a moment
    the lights went off. It was not a new sensation to any of them. The thing
    had occurred many times in the experience of all of them, yet they felt a
    thrill as the darkness came like a stroke.</p>
  <p align="left">Instinctively they kept silent, and even remained so, when
    they heard, or thought they heard the ticking of a clock.</p>
  <p align="left">The seconds went by, and the ticking though faint was clear.
    Yet no one spoke, and then they heard a slow, long-drawn sigh like a gasp,
    and the lights flashed back to them.</p>
  <p align="left">The illumination showed each man in his place, but Crawford&rsquo;s
    face was white and scared, Cram looked red and angry, and Fleming Stone very
    grave and puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo; whispered Crawford.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone nodded. &ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
    expected to hear it, so we thought we did hear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Imagination your grandmother!&rdquo; snorted Cram. &ldquo;That
    was a clock with good steel springs in it, or I miss my guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a guessing game,&rdquo; Stone said,
    his eyes bright with interest. &ldquo;Did you hear anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Imagination, I suppose,&rdquo; Cram looked a little
    sheepish.  &ldquo;But I thought I imagined a sort of sigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More like a gasp,&rdquo; said Crawford. &ldquo;Open
    the doors, Stone, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a minute. We mustn&rsquo;t give ourselves away.
    Those sounds were really imagination or else they were intentionally made.
    If the latter, the criminal did it. Which girl could?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, that Marita,&rdquo; Cram blurted out. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
    devil enough for anything. Her and her foreign tricks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Harrison is a mechanical genius,&rdquo; Crawford said
    slowly, and Stone turned to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really? Can he do stunts, ventriloquism, that sort of
    thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I mean wired things. He could rig up a contraption
    to make a clock tick in this room when there wasn&rsquo;t any clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon see,&rdquo; and Stone eagerly searched
    round the wainscoting and behind radiators and such places.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Well, never mind hunting it down now. We can see
    about it tomorrow. But on no account let anyone know we heard or thought
    we heard anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because it would put our criminal on guard. Now, remember,
    please, don&rsquo;t tell anyone. But before we leave the room, notice where
    I stand. Could anyone get past me coming in from the hall and going round
    to the table there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram tried it. He found he could not pass Stone on the route
    indicated, without brushing against him or passing close enough to allow
    his breathing or footstep to be audible.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That lays this down as a fact,&rdquo; Stone said: &ldquo;unless
    Miss Kittredge is mistaken in the place she stood, or unless she moved, then
    the criminal is one of those two girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unless she moved, the criminal is Marita,&rdquo; Cram
    said, a little drily. &ldquo;Whoever killed him had to move.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Stone said and stepped to the side
    wall near the tapestry to straighten a picture that hung slightly askew. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    stand a picture hanging crooked,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well, shall we
    call it a day? Look at the books, Cram. Moffatt and I went over them all,
    twice. And we both looked out to see that there was no chance of that will
    book being behind the books in rows. We felt well down behind each row. Thank
    goodness the books are clean&mdash;kept well dusted by the efficient Abbie,
    I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the dagger?&rdquo; Crawford asked, and
    Cram said,  &ldquo;the police have it. I don&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;ll
    be used as a parlor ornament again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No fingerprints?&rdquo; asked Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, but that doesn&rsquo;t premise a professional, nowadays.
    A young girl who ever read a thriller&mdash;and who hasn&rsquo;t?&mdash;would
    know better than to leave prints. Not gloves, more likely wrap her hanky
    round her hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably. Well, Cram, I think I&rsquo;ll put those two
    girls through a third degree of my own. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean like anything
    the police set up. Just a little individual grilling of my own. No roughhouse
    work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Mr. Stone. Have it your own way. Let me know
    if I can help. But haven&rsquo;t you spotted any clues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed a few oddments. I don&rsquo;t know
    that they will turn out to be clues. You know I don&rsquo;t look for dropped
    clues. They&rsquo;re obsolete. Give a criminal rope enough and he will make
    his own clues. How long do you suppose the house party will stay here without
    making a fuss about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Moore and Miss Kittredge will have to stay as long
    as the police say so,&rdquo; Cram returned. &ldquo;Mr. Moffatt and Mr. Bingham
    seem inclined to stay. Mrs. Abbott wants to get away as soon as she can,
    and that Dare man is straining at the leash. He harps on his importance in
    Wall Street, till I&rsquo;m afraid the street will fall through if he doesn&rsquo;t
    get there pretty soon. Harrison has no intention of leaving till he&rsquo;s
    fired. But if he falls under suspicion in any way, he may make a bolt for
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the plausible doctor next door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram stared at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Stone, it&rsquo;s funny you should mention
    him! I&rsquo;ve been thinking him over, likewise looking him up. He&rsquo;s
    over head and ears in debt. Fine man in many ways, but he lives beyond his
    income. Maybe he can&rsquo;t collect his fees; he&rsquo;s a good doctor,
    but careless in money matters. Well, it&rsquo;s hard to connect him up with
    a crime like that, but he was a witness to the will, the will did leave his
    daughter a large sum, and I did catch him poking around in this room searching
    among the books. Also, he&rsquo;d be a slick one at making a stab, and he
    knows the house well and knows when the lights go off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he wasn&rsquo;t at the party?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, but he lives next door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But, Cram, we agreed nobody could come in the hall door,
    cross the hall, get the dagger, stab Gaylord and get away again, without
    brushing against Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We did agree to that, sir, and I stand by it. But that&rsquo;s
    a way to look. Maybe he found the book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; argued Crawford, &ldquo;if he had, and
    if he could prove his daughter&rsquo;s legacy by it, he&rsquo;d show it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When was the book last seen?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Several people have said it has been lying on this table
    right here, for several weeks. The maid Rhoda, the accredited liar, says
    it was here when she dusted up just before the people came on Friday. But
    later than that, I&rsquo;ve traced it. Polly Opdyke, she&rsquo;s a chatterer,
    you know, declared to me she saw it on the table here before dinner that
    night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;After she came and before dinner,&rdquo; mused Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. She was in here before dinner; of course,
    after dinner, after the tragedy, that child wasn&rsquo;t allowed in here.
    So, as she&rsquo;d have no reason to make up such a yarn, we may conclude
    she saw it here just before dinner. Say the old doctor prowled around, got
    in, looked at the will, pocketed it, will book and all, and then became possessed
    of a mad desire to set the ball rolling so he could get his hands on that
    legacy to his daughter. Say he went home, secreted the book, and came back
    at the dark time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t get past Miss Kittredge,&rdquo; mocked
    Stone.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a theory, Cram, it&rsquo;s a fact. There
    isn&rsquo;t room for a child to squeeze between me and the bookcase, on the
    way to where the dagger lay, and you needn&rsquo;t say there is. Let alone
    a big man like Dr. Opdyke! Think of his trying to get through here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone indicated the narrow way between himself and the bookcase,
    where an intruder would have to pass.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Cram acknowledged, but he
    shook his head.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_13">Chapter 13</a><br>
    The Persistent Mothballs</b></h2>
  <p align="left">IT was the next morning when Stone decided to use what he called
    his third degree on the two girls.</p>
  <p align="left">It&rsquo;s a ticklish business, he told himself, for they are
    both on the defensive to such an extent that a word of anything like suspicion
    or accusation sends them flying. But we must get down to brass tacks soon,
    My clues are so airy, so positively nebulous, that it isn&rsquo;t encouraging,
    to say the least, A picture hanging slightly crooked, a pressed place on
    the carpet, three streaks on the table, and a few short blades of grass.
    Leaves of grass, I shall call them, after Walt Whitman&rsquo;s famous phrase.</p>
  <p align="left">Oh, yes, and a thumbed up curtain and a small jagged slit.
    A fine lot!</p>
  <p align="left">Well, I must find out which of the girls to choose as a suspect.
    And then, other things being equal, I may get somewhere. But other things
    so seldom are equal. Fine subjects for an essay; &ldquo;The Unequalness of
    Other Things.&rdquo; Much to be said on it.</p>
  <p align="left">These thoughts occupied the detective&rsquo;s mind as he smoked
    an after breakfast cigarette, then, rising, he went in search of the victims
    of his inquisition.</p>
  <p align="left">He found Marita first, happily chatting to Albert Moffatt as
    they walked along a garden path.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Friend Sleuth, how goes it this morning?&rdquo;  asked
    Moffatt, pleasantly.</p>
  <p align="left">If there was one word Stone detested more than another, it
    was sleuth.</p>
  <p align="left">But he was fair-minded enough to recognize that Moffatt meant
    no offence, and he answered:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not so good. I can&rsquo;t seem to hit upon the clues
    that by all the laws of God and man ought to jump to the eye of the vigilant
    detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get there. We must get there. I say,
    Stone, I&rsquo;m getting anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Give the man time,&rdquo; put in Marita. &ldquo;Mr.
    Stone has hardly started yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Moffatt returned, &ldquo;but suppose
    the murderer gets away, beyond recall. As the only relative of Gaylord, I
    feel I ought to do something. Let me help you, Mr. Stone. Take me on as assistant,
    won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to, Mr. Moffatt, if you mean what
    I do by assistant. Just a helper, you know. But I can&rsquo;t take in a partner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how you regard me, just let me do
    something definite to help. To think that I was sitting there, looking at
    a moving picture while poor old Gay was being snuffed out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see, Mr. Moffatt doesn&rsquo;t suspect me,&rdquo; said
    Marita, her dazzling smile including both men.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl had more than beauty, she had charm, lure, seductiveness,
    the birthright of all of Spanish blood.</p>
  <p align="left">She stepped nearer to Stone and drummed her rosy little finger-tips
    up and down his coat sleeve.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who could?&rdquo; said Stone, and he purposely threw
    a tender note in his voice while the lowering of his eyelids half veiled
    a sudden gleam of admiration.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl fell for the bait, and her fingers crept downward
    until they rested on Stone&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lots of people do,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;Tell me,
    Mr. Stone, can&rsquo;t you get me off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt looked on, amused.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree, Marita,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;This man is a detective, not a lawyer. Though I&rsquo;ll say
    he doesn&rsquo;t act like a story-book sleuth and they&rsquo;re the only
    kind I know about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you want to be a story-book detective when you
    help me?&rdquo; Stone laughed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know a few things,&rdquo; Moffatt seemed a little
    nettled.  &ldquo;I know about fingerprints, and I know you mustn&rsquo;t
    touch the body till the coroner comes, and I know the proper caper is to
    see some small object&mdash;glittering preferred&mdash;and pick it up and
    slip it in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone laughed outright at this.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now,
    I&rsquo;m going to carry Miss Moore off for a short session, and you go and
    hunt for the small, glittering object. But don&rsquo;t make it a cuff-link,
    they&rsquo;re not used by detectives any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Taking the girl by the arm, Stone coolly led her away down
    the garden path.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You like the new heir?&rdquo; he said, looking at her
    a little reproachfully. &ldquo;I thought you cared for Gay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gay&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; she returned, and a dangerous
    light came into her dark eyes. &ldquo;I suppose you want to quiz me about
    that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;just a little. You see, things are coming
    to a head,&rdquo; he stopped, aghast at the look of fear on her face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does that frighten you?&rdquo; he went on, sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, because I suppose it means you&rsquo;re going to
    arrest Diana.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You little brute!&rdquo; exclaimed Stone, shocked more
    by the pleased look on her face than by her words. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
    think Diana did it, and you know you don&rsquo;t! You suspect Harrison, though
    he is your friend. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve thrown him over for Moffatt,
    and you&rsquo;ve taken him on, because you begin to think he will be Homer&rsquo;s
    heir. There, milady, deny those statements, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Instead of showing chagrin, Marita appeared deeply interested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think it was Cale, too?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And
    how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, Stone&rsquo;s suspicions did not point
    especially to Harrison, but he was out for information, so he said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember? I said all along that
    I heard his step in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; Stone spoke gently, &ldquo;that
    it was his step, or that it was in the hall. Granting for the moment that
    you did not do it, somebody must have stepped to the table, snatched up the
    dagger, made the thrust and then stepped away from Gaylord. Now, those footfalls
    were doubtless almost inaudible, but if you heard steps at all you must have
    heard those. Now, could they not have been Harrison&rsquo;s, Bingham&rsquo;s,
    Diana&rsquo;s, or those of some intruder from outside? You want to clear
    yourself from suspicion, of course. The best thing you can do in that direction
    is to tell me most carefully, what you remember regarding those steps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Marita shrugged her shoulders pettishly. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d
    never mentioned steps, or my acute hearing, or&mdash;or anything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Producing a wisp of handkerchief from her watch bracelet, where
    it was tucked, she used it on one eye, watching Stone with the other. Noting
    that her few pearly tears affected him not at all, she tucked the wisp back
    again, and said, curtly, &ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; he smiled at her. &ldquo;Just
    tell me exactly and most carefully what you heard, and remember, a life may
    hang on what you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This touch of the dramatic acted as a spur, which was Stone&rsquo;s
    intention.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know I heard a step,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;I
    know that. And I thought it was in the hall, because it could not have made
    a sound on the rug in the room. In the hall, there is, of course a margin
    of wood. In the room, the rug extends to the very walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good for you, Miss Moore. You show real powers of observation.
    When did you hear this step? At the beginning of the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, near the end, but that I can&rsquo;t say positively.
    For the dark time seemed very long that night. I was going to turn to Gaylord&mdash;I
    had my back to him, almost, as I sat on the chair arm&mdash;but just then
    the parrot squawked, and I laughed at that, he sounded so silly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you thought you heard a clock ticking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know I did, or a watch. And it wasn&rsquo;t my
    own watch, for that is barely audible. Now, how do you explain that? I know
    I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is a point that leads to suspicion of Cale Harrison.
    We know he has a loud ticking watch, we know he was upstairs and came down,
    we know he must have crossed the hall, and&mdash;he may be said to have a
    motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only that he hoped for a bequest from Gaylord&rsquo;s
    will, and that he knows where the will is, and will produce it when he is
    ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like Cale, he is so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Timid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and yet not quite that. He isn&rsquo;t really
    timid, he&rsquo;s, well, self-effacing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, and think carefully, does the step you heard,
    give the stepper time to get into the room, get the dagger, kill Gaylord
    and get out again before the lights came on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most certainly not! The step was only a few seconds
    before the light. That I am sure of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then our case against Harrison falls through. And, too,
    it begins to look as if the step was in your imagination after all. Or it
    may have been a step of some of those in the lounge, or of Bingham, in the
    doorway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whatever it was, it was not my imagination. I am very
    sensitive to light sounds, and I know&mdash;I know I heard that step, faintly
    but clearly, and I am certain it was in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then Cale came downstairs a trifle before he said he
    did, and preferred not to say so because of his fear of being suspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then Rhoda lied. But she&rsquo;d lie for him any minute.
    She&rsquo;s terribly in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Everybody seems to be in love with somebody around this
    house,&rdquo; Stone sighed. &ldquo;Wish somebody&rsquo;d love me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will. I can love anybody I want to.</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">&ldquo; &lsquo;I can love her and her and you and you,<br>I can love any, so she be but true.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? A quotation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t write poetry myself. Now, we&rsquo;ve
    pretty well settled that the step was Harrison&rsquo;s in the hall and the
    ticking watch was his&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in the hall. That ticking sound was in the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By Jove, Miss Moore, you&rsquo;re a marvelous witness.
    You&rsquo;ll let yourself out of the running if you&rsquo;re not careful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You mean you won&rsquo;t suspect me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can I, if you were so busy hearing sounds, you couldn&rsquo;t
    be getting at daggers and killing people at the same time. And somehow, I
    believe your story of the sounds. But nobody wears a wristwatch but Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Among the men, no. But Bobbie and Polly Opdyke wear
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It could have been either of them, then, moving about
    near the door of the Tapestry Room. But they can&rsquo;t be considered as
    suspects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; Marita smiled at the thought. &ldquo;Well,
    then, that&rsquo;s all I heard, except Gaylord&rsquo;s gasp. That, I think,
    will ring in my ears till my dying day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was no handkerchief trick this time, but two tears rolled
    unheeded down Marita&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
  <p align="left">Versed in weighing the sincerity of a witness, Stone came to
    the conclusion that this girl had been telling him the truth. At that moment
    he believed her honest in her statements and innocent of the crime. But her
    next speech clinched his belief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have killed Gaylord, anyway,&rdquo; she
    said,  &ldquo;for I was dead in love with him, and I still felt I could get
    him back out of Diana&rsquo;s net. Besides,&rdquo; she added, ingenuously, &ldquo;I
    wanted his money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone could have shaken her for this cold-blooded avowal, but
    he felt that it was, after all, a further proof that whoever killed Gaylord
    Homer it was not this lovely though vulgar little piece of femininity before
    him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about Bingham?&rdquo; he asked her, being rather
    impressed by her clear-headed opinions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about Ted. He&rsquo;s a fine
    man, and he was Gaylord&rsquo;s best chum, but you know love turns men into
    devils&mdash;even fine men. Suppose he feared Diana would yield to Gay&rsquo;s
    coaxing and marry him and his money-bags. For Di is frightfully poor, really
    poor, you know. And she had promised to give Gay his answer that night. Gay
    took her to the Tapestry Room for it&mdash;I know. That&rsquo;s why I insisted
    on going along, too. I wanted to stave off that answer just as much as Ted
    did. So, you see,&rdquo; she flashed a smile at him, &ldquo;Ted and I had
    the same motive for killing the poor boy. Well, suppose Ted stood there,
    as he did, and watched us come in, watched Gaylord sitting by me, but gazing
    at Diana as if he could eat her up; suppose, I say, Ted, from his doorway,
    saw all that, and just couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and then he saw the dagger,
    and the lights went off and&mdash;there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bingham doesn&rsquo;t wear a wrist-watch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him to. Perhaps he did that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He could have stepped on the bare floor&mdash;returning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, there is a patch of wood in the doorway where
    he stood. But you see, I didn&rsquo;t notice anything after I heard Gaylord
    gasp. It went through me like a knife. I heard that step, and that ticking,
    then the lights came, and I leaned against Gay, just for fun, you know, I
    didn&rsquo;t really think at the moment that gasp was his death gurgle, and
    I saw his face, and his shoulders all humped over, and I lost my senses and
    slid to the floor. No, I didn&rsquo;t faint, I didn&rsquo;t really lose consciousness,
    I just collapsed. Ted flew to pick me up, and the rest&mdash;I guess you
    know by this time. I&rsquo;ve heard it often enough. Now, do you think I
    killed Gaylord Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Miss Moore&mdash;Marita&mdash;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone held out his hand, and she slipped her little paw into
    it, but a quiver of intelligence or caution or both made him pull his fingers
    away quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">He knew the type of vamp who can&rsquo;t refrain from physical
    contact on the smallest provocation.</p>
  <p align="left">It&rsquo;s like the enthusiast who would &ldquo;peep and botanize,
    upon his mother&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo; he said to himself, but didn&rsquo;t
    say it aloud lest she should ask him if it was a quotation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve veered round to Bingham, from Miss
    Kittredge?&rdquo;  he said, rising from the garden seat they had occupied.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not entirely. But I can&rsquo;t see beyond those two.
    Oh, goodness, I veer round all the time. An hour ago, I was strong for Caley,
    now Ted looks more like it. Are you going in? Send dear Albert back to me,
    will you? And tell him to bring some cigarettes. Last night we were out here,
    and he had to go clear back to the house to get some. And it was just at
    Dark time. I was scared into fits here alone. Dark time always scares me
    now. I wish I could go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think you can very soon, after all you&rsquo;ve told
    me this morning. I&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s duly reported in proper shape,
    and I think it will get you off soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind staying here, if I&rsquo;m not
    alone when it goes dark. Run along, Mr. Stone, send my devoted Albert to
    me, and don&rsquo;t forget the cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone went back to the house, having provided Marita with one
    cigarette to solace her until Moffatt&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I fooled him all right,&rdquo; the Spanish beauty
    remarked to herself, complacently, as she crossed her long silken legs and
    leaned back among the roses. &ldquo;If he knew what I could tell him, wouldn&rsquo;t
    he be standing on one ear! I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;m as bad as a murderer,
    but&mdash;what&rsquo;s a poor girl to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone, unconscious of the insincerity of the lovely witness
    whom he had just put through his third degree, went on to the house, and
    running across Moffatt, gave him the lady&rsquo;s message.</p>
  <p align="left">Always observant, he saw a strange look flit across Moffatt&rsquo;s
    face, and he wondered, idly, if he, too, resented the vampish proclivities
    of the imperious beauty.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps, he thought to himself, Moffatt is not so securely
    under her thumb as she thinks he is.</p>
  <p align="left">He went on, keen on his search for Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">He found her, and not unexpectedly to him, with Ted Bingham
    by her side.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, with no beating about the bush,  &ldquo;but
    as you both know, I am here on a definite business. So, Mr. Bingham, I have
    to ask you to let me have Miss Kittredge all to myself for a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His manner was suave but his voice carried a note of authority,
    and Ted understood.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, Stone,&rdquo; he said, and the detective
    noticed a new, vibrant note in his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go. I wonder,
    though, if you&rsquo;d let me stay if I told you that Diana and I have just
    become engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">They were in a small porch, made by the curve of the turret
    wall, and Diana, in a low wicker chair, was the embodiment of happiness,
    yet with an undercurrent of sadness plain to be seen in her sky-blue eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I offer my sincere congratulations,&rdquo; Stone said,  &ldquo;and
    my best wishes for all happiness. You&rsquo;re announcing this, generally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Diana said, &ldquo;we are not, but I&rsquo;ve
    thought it better to tell you. Now must Ted leave us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, please; it is better to talk alone. You know, Bingham,
    we&rsquo;re in deep waters. You know, to put it plainly, while Miss Kittredge
    must be cleared of all suspicion it cannot be done successfully, until we
    discover the real culprit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Diana&rsquo;s blue eyes clouded, &ldquo;it
    cannot. Go away for a while, Ted, dear. We&rsquo;ll send for you shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As Bingham went off, reluctantly, she looked after him a moment
    and then turned back to Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Please be direct, Mr. Stone. Don&rsquo;t try to spare
    me, don&rsquo;t evade the issue. What is it you want to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In spite of himself Stone stared at her. He thought he had
    never seen anyone so beautiful. Always lovely, there was now a new light
    in her blue eyes, a new smile on her curving lips. Surely this radiant being
    never used a dagger, never premeditated a horrendous crime!</p>
  <p align="left">He had to remind himself that many historic criminals were
    beautiful women, many murderesses had angel faces, but even so, he couldn&rsquo;t
    believe it. Yet he realized her unusual radiance arose from the fact that
    she had but just plighted her troth with Bingham, and his racing mind took
    up the train of thought and wonderment as to why this matter had been arranged
    in such apparent haste and in such an incongruous setting.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I regret very much to say anything unpleasant to you,
    Miss Kittredge, but, as you know, I am here on a very grave errand. And so,
    I am obliged to ask you some questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Stone; do not hesitate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her manner and tone, Stone reflected, were as cold and distant
    as her beauty was warm and glowing. He strongly resented the fact that the
    two suspects he had been given in this case, should be two such appallingly
    beautiful women. Beside Diana, to be sure, Marita was a cheaply pretty type,
    but after all, her glowing dark eyes and flashing smiles made her bewitching.</p>
  <p align="left">Not often bowled over by feminine charms, Fleming Stone wished
    that this time he had had to deal with plainer dames.</p>
  <p align="left">And so he hesitated. Then he plunged in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Kittredge, I will be straightforward. Who, in your
    opinion, killed Gaylord Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was a little more straightforwardness than Diana had meant
    or wanted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you a right to ask that, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have, but you needn&rsquo;t answer unless you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well. Now, do you suspect Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not intimate with the girl,
    but I can&rsquo;t think she did it. Beside, she loved him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But she had opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, she had that. So did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Diana looked so fearfully agitated, so much as if her nerves
    were getting beyond her control, that Stone, though he couldn&rsquo;t give
    up his quest, changed the topic.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear the step in the hall, or the ticking
    clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not. I think Marita imagined those. But, you know,
    Mr. Stone, I noticed an odor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Several. I told the police people about that. Of course,
    I could place the freesia, and the jasmine and cyclamen, but I surely smelled
    mothballs. If you want a clue, Mr. Stone, take that. I am peculiarly sensitive
    to odors, and of all things I noticed those carbolic scented mothballs. I
    asked Abbie if they were used in this house and she said only in a closet
    where unused woolens are kept. Now, Mr. Stone, as you know, I wouldn&rsquo;t
    willingly implicate an innocent person, but could it have been Abbie? She,
    I happen to know, was really more fond of Gaylord than appeared on the surface.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean there was anything overfriendly
    between them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that, but she adored him, and she
    is a strange woman. A starved, thwarted nature, capable of&mdash;of almost
    anything. She was inordinately jealous of me, because Gaylord admired me.
    I shan&rsquo;t apologize for my frankness, I know you understand. Now, whether
    it implicates her or not, hunt down those mothballs. I couldn&rsquo;t have
    imagined that odor, it was there. And it was not on the person of any one
    of the guests or on Gaylord himself. I know that because I sat next him at
    dinner and I should have been aware of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Kittredge, that must be looked into.
    Now, tell me, did you move from where you stood, during the dark time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When I noticed the mothballs I remember I drew back
    a little. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was that before the lights went on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, a few seconds or so. They flashed out right after
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14">Chapter 14</a><br>
    Real Clues At Last</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;WELL, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Cram said, &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll
    have to put up or shut up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bad as that?&rdquo; Stone smiled at him. &ldquo;Why
    the rush?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The two sat in the Tapestry Room, which had come to be the
    conference room of those most deeply interested in the mystery.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Cram fidgeted a little, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
    seem to be getting anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Me? Oh, I&rsquo;m right where I was when I started.
    One of those two girls shot Homer, and it&rsquo;s time we found out which
    one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How about a third party?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You got something up your sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram&rsquo;s small eyes opened wider, and he leaned forward
    eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that, but I&rsquo;ve had a pointer given me,&rdquo;  Stone
    replied.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Veerin&rsquo; which way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Toward Abbie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Abbie Perkins? Shucks, that woman! She&rsquo;s the salt
    of the earth. What&rsquo;d she want to kill Homer for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard she was in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh well, a lone woman like that is always in love with
    any man she can get next to, but they don&rsquo;t go round killin&rsquo; &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Somebody went round killing him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. And we&rsquo;ve got two perfectly good suspects.
    Now, we got to pick one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m positively certain Miss Moore didn&rsquo;t
    do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, she was my choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s innocent. I talked with her yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That third degree of yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I call it that, but I assure you I wasn&rsquo;t
    brutal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dessay not. Well, what did you get hold of that&rsquo;s
    got any weight to it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only the obvious facts. That Miss Moore was deeply in
    love with Gaylord Homer, also that she wanted to marry him for his money;
    also, that she was not afraid that Miss Kittredge was going to cut her out.
    Or, rather, she felt that in the combat, she would best Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Specially as Miss Kittredge didn&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, specially that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s sure the logical conclusion. Of course,
    I leaned to the Moore girl&rsquo;s guilt because she&rsquo;s that hot, southern
    type, but, after all, Miss Kittredge had the motive. She knew&mdash;she must
    have known that Homer was leaving her his money, and she wanted it and wanted
    it quick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You do put things horribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, they are horrible, ain&rsquo;t they? And that
    calm, icy dame could thrust an ice pick into somebody she didn&rsquo;t like,
    without turning a hair, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe she is guilty, either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who then? the cousin? I&rsquo;d like to fasten the thing
    on him, but I can&rsquo;t get a shred of evidence. Can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve had him reported on
    by three people, and&mdash;well, here&rsquo;s what they size him up as.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cram drew some papers from his pocket and passed them over
    the table.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone read them attentively.</p>
  <p align="left">The sum of them was that Albert Moffatt was a man of the average
    class.</p>
  <p align="left">In business his methods were systematic and correct. He was
    quiet, diligent, orderly in his office. A real estate agent, in the employ
    of a fairly well known firm. Not a brilliant business man, in fact, a bit
    dull, but reliable and honest. The sort that jogs along from day to day,
    without advancing in any particular.</p>
  <p align="left">At his home, which consisted of two rooms in a well-run rooming
    house, his landlady gave him the highest praise. Said she never had a better
    behaved or more satisfactory lodger. He has a man who comes in two or three
    times a week to look after his clothes, otherwise he does for himself.</p>
  <p align="left">His recreation seems to be going to the Moving Pictures and
    attending a small club of men, called The Ivanhoe. This Club&rsquo;s rooms
    are plain and provided with books, games and a smoking-room. It is of a Y.
    M. C. A. type.</p>
  <p align="left">On the Friday in question, Moffatt&rsquo;s movements have been
    carefully traced.</p>
  <p align="left">He left his office at the usual time, went home, read the papers,
    went to the Yale Club to dinner. From there, he went to the movie of &ldquo;Jungle
    Jim,&rdquo; a popular animal picture. The ticket girl knows him well and
    remembers selling him his ticket. The usher remembered where he sat, and
    spoke to him during the show. From the picture show he went directly to the
    Ivanhoe Club, and to some cronies there, he told the details of the picture
    he had seen. Staid at the club until eleven-thirty, then went home and to
    bed.</p>
  <p align="left">Called to telephone at twelve o&rsquo;clock and told of his
    cousin&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Clean bill of health,&rdquo; Stone agreed, handing back
    the report. &ldquo;But I tell you Cram, there is, there must be another person
    to be considered beside those two girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to show him up mighty quick,
    Mr. Stone, for the chief is keen on arresting one or both of those young
    ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t arrest them both!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, we can. On suspicion of being connected with
    the murder, or having knowledge of it. Maybe the threat of an arrest will
    bring them to heel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Cram, I see I&rsquo;ll have to let you in on my
    findings. I meant to do so soon, but you&rsquo;re so impatient. Look here,
    then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone first locked both doors, and drew the heavy curtains
    together before the window.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dark time?&rdquo; growled Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you some light,&rdquo; and Stone snapped
    on an electrolier.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he stepped over to the Tapestry that hung to the left
    of the fireplace.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the other tapestry hangs
    in front of the safe. But this one has nothing behind it. And it hangs out
    about ten to twelve inches from the wall. A slender man could easily conceal
    himself behind that curtain with little fear of discovery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yeah, but did he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He did. Though I can&rsquo;t say it was last Friday
    night that he did. Look here. You know nothing in this room has been touched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Drawing the tapestry aside, Stone showed the sergeant a pressed
    place on the carpet where, it was clearly evident, someone had stood for
    a time. There were no distinct footprints, but a pair of restless feet had
    pawed the nap of the Oriental rug, and the long, soft pile still showed a
    matted condition.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram stared at it, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Might have been done weeks ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Stone returned, &ldquo;well, look here,
    then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This time he pointed to the tapestry itself, to a small slit
    which had been cut at a height of about five feet or more from the floor.
    The slit was perhaps a little more than an inch in length, and it was not
    hard to deduce it had been meant for a peephole for the one concealed behind
    the tapestry.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; exclaimed the amazed Cram. &ldquo;Now,
    however, did you smell that out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say nothing about the dreadfulness of slashing into
    a priceless work of art.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Work of art be damned. That&rsquo;s a hole somebody
    cut who was a-hidin&rsquo; there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My idea exactly, sergeant. Now, see, the edge of this
    tapestry, at the same height, is distinctly thumbed up. Not frayed and worn,
    as it is in some places, for it&rsquo;s an antique bit, but thumbed by someone
    holding the eyehole to his eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly that, which proves, good enough for me, that
    all this happened last Friday night, and that the murderer we&rsquo;re after
    stood behind this curtain before or after the stabbin&rsquo; affray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, how did he get in or out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t. He was here all the time. Got away long
    afterward. After all the excitement was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t be silly. He must have concealed himself
    here, of course, but after the deed, he merely slipped into the hall and
    later joined the others when the commotion was on, and his movements would
    not be noticed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One of the house folks, then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It sure looks like it. But I&rsquo;ve got to think it
    out. My mind ain&rsquo;t a hair-trigger one, like yours. Now, see here, those
    girls must know something about this. And they&rsquo;re shieldin&rsquo; the
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, if the man is Harrison, Marita is shielding him,
    though she has soured on him lately. And if the man was Bingham&mdash;&mdash; by
    Jove, Cram, could it have been Bingham, and when Marita screamed, he ran
    to her from here, not from his doorway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Naw. And anyway, in that case, who pawed the carpet
    all up, like a frettin&rsquo; horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t right. I wanted to cast Moffatt
    for the part, but your report quashes that idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It does, and anyway that muff Moffatt hasn&rsquo;t got
    spunk enough to put on an act like this. How about Abbie now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an idea. If there&rsquo;s anything in
    the story of her being in love with Homer, and if she was insanely jealous
    of Miss Kittredge, the opportunity was hers. She says she was in her room
    at the dark time. But nobody can corroborate that. She might have been in
    here. And she could slip away afterward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And that would be the step Miss Kittredge heard in the
    hall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty thin. And, too, all these arguments
    would fit Harrison. Say he scooted into the Tapestry Room straight from the
    dinner table. Say, he got behind the curtain, and watched, and when the others
    came in he noted their positions. Then at the dark time he came out, grabbed
    the dagger, killed Homer and whacked himself upstairs. Then the maid did
    see him there, and did come downstairs ahead of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve plenty to chew on. Queer we never
    hit on that slit before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stone, drily; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s queer
    we didn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;Anything more up your sleeve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Cram, I have. I&rsquo;ve no objections to sharing
    my findings with you, for you know the ground up here better than I do, and
    you know the people, more or less. Now, here&rsquo;s my last clue. And, as
    I&rsquo;ve often said, I don&rsquo;t care much for clues that people drop
    about. But by that I mean such as handkerchiefs or bits of torn paper or
    a broken cuff-link. But if this was left behind by our vandal suspect who
    slitted that priceless piece of fabric, I hope it hangs him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">From his notebook Stone produced three or four tiny blades
    of grass, short, chopped looking bits, and laid them carefully on the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, triumphantly. &ldquo;They lay
    on the rug behind the tapestry, and if the murderer dropped those, then he
    came in from outdoors and not from the dinner table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; and Cram scrutinized the grass thoughtfully.  &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose
    he came around the house and in at the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Might have,&rdquo; Stone nodded. &ldquo;Was the grass
    cut that day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Easy to find out, from the gardeners. Then, there&rsquo;s
    Abbie again. Say she was in her room, and wanted to get into the room, behind
    that curtain. Wouldn&rsquo;t she come round the outside way, and in at the
    window, or the outside hall door? Cut grass, with the dew on it, is mighty
    apt to stick to your boot soles. Some clue finder, you are, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;ll
    hand it to you. All I ask is to let me string along. Now, let&rsquo;s sift
    this thing a little more. How about Caley? He could have stepped outside
    and round and in at the window and landed up in his hiding place before Mr.
    Homer and his two lady friends arrived. You know when folks ain&rsquo;t looking
    for tragedy or trouble, they don&rsquo;t take notice of what others are doing.
    I&rsquo;ll bet Harrison or Abbie Perkins or Bingham&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not Bingham. He was in the doorway all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How do you know he was? Only because he says so. Most
    of our knowledge is unsupported testimony, you see. Pity the curtain hider
    didn&rsquo;t drop a few of those handkerchiefs or cuff-links that you despise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another point, Cram. Harrison and Abbie
    both wear loud-ticking watches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I was waiting for you to catch that. Now which
    of them uses mothballs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mothballs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Miss Kittredge is perfectly sure she detected the
    odor of mothballs. I believe she asked Abbie to hunt round for anyone in
    the house who had any clothing that had been packed away in them. But Abbie
    never succeeded in finding any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t if they was her mothballs. Maybe
    Harrison had some of his togs done up in them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe he did. Well, there&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And a lot, I&rsquo;ll tell the world! I&rsquo;m all
    for Harrison. I can&rsquo;t think it of Abbie Perkins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Know anything about psycho-analysis, Cram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, and don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, those who do, would tell you Abbie is a perfect
    suspect. She&rsquo;s a disappointed woman, Cram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lord, I know that. What old maid isn&rsquo;t? But they
    don&rsquo;t go round stabbing folks because of that. She must have known
    Gaylord Homer would never marry her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She may have hoped he would. I&rsquo;m told there was&mdash;well,
    it was expressed as something between them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shucks! Homer was that sort. I&rsquo;ve known him for
    years. Always an eye for a pretty face or a slick figure. Yes, I know Abbie
    can&rsquo;t be described thataway, but he was a soft-hearted chap, and if
    he thought Abbie looked peaked or pinin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d chirk her up, mebbe
    kiss her, for all I know. But that was his way, that&rsquo;s all. And I make
    no doubt he remembered her in that will of his&mdash;if he made one. But
    she&rsquo;d never kill him for that. If she did it, it was sure temporary
    mental aberration, and that&rsquo;s not often a real thing, though a term
    often used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right. It&rsquo;s up to us to hunt all this down
    and find out who could and who couldn&rsquo;t have sneaked in behind that
    curtain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And maybe all that messin&rsquo; up the carpet was done
    some other time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe it was. Now, don&rsquo;t say anything about all
    this, though I know you won&rsquo;t. If we tell of the slit in the tapestry,
    there&rsquo;ll be a hullaballoo, and they will all poke their fingers in
    it and make the tear worse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or else they&rsquo;ll poke their fingers in the pie
    and make it all dough. No, Mr. Stone, I won&rsquo;t tell, but we must get
    busy. What&rsquo;ll I do first?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Find out if the grass was cut on Friday, and if there
    was a shower or a heavy dew that evening. Find out, if you can, about the
    mothballs, but do this discreetly. Find out who saw Bingham in that doorway.
    It may be all talk, started by himself. You know, Cram, after all he&rsquo;s
    the star suspect. I mean, he had the clearest motive. He was crazy about
    Miss Kittredge&mdash;they&rsquo;re engaged already. He was wild for fear
    Homer would get her away from him. He knew, probably that Homer had made
    or was said to have made a will leaving the fortune to her. Oh, I know this
    sounds base, but we must study every angle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure we must, Mr. Stone. What I want to know is whether
    the stabber stood behind his gashed curtain before or after his dirty deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe before, maybe after, maybe both. Either Harrison
    or Abbie could have gone there unnoticed, then slipped back there, and emerged
    later when the shock of the tragedy occupied everyone&rsquo;s attention.
    Those two are inconspicuous members of the household and could go and come
    unquestioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t all that apply to the butler, Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think not. He was clearing the table, he said, and
    if he hadn&rsquo;t been, some of the servants would have disputed the fact.
    No, there&rsquo;s no one else as I can see, who could have crept into this
    room without being observed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I saw somebody,&rdquo; said a high, shrill voice, and
    both Stone and the sergeant jumped.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram sprang to the French window, from which direction the
    voice seemed to come, and flung back the curtains.</p>
  <p align="left">There, her face pressed between the two glass doors, only slightly
    ajar, stood Polly Opdyke, peering in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Stone said, half laughing, half annoyed.  &ldquo;How
    long have you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; said Polly, calmly. &ldquo;I heard
    every word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You little scalawag,&rdquo; Stone began, but paused
    as he saw the look of hurt surprise on her face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There was no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; she
    said, gravely. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you were talking secrets. I
    thought everybody wanted to know who killed Gaylord, and I thought maybe
    I could help. You see, I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Know who killed Homer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Polly nodded her head slowly, and her big gray eyes took on
    an inscrutable look.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I shan&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;because
    you aren&rsquo;t nice to me. I told you, Mr. Stone, that I have read several
    detective stories, and now I&rsquo;m all set to help work on this case. And
    you treat me like a child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her voice broke in a little sob, and Stone tactfully changed
    his attitude.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Polly dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a child,
    at least you seem so to two elderly men like us. But we apologize if we have
    hurt your feelings, and we are glad to have your help. Though we&rsquo;d
    rather you&rsquo;d come to us openly, than to listen at windows. That isn&rsquo;t
    nice, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know, and I wouldn&rsquo;t in any other circumstances.
    But in detective work we have to sink our manners and our ideals, don&rsquo;t
    we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; and Stone concealed his amusement. &ldquo;Also,
    Polly, we have to work quickly. Now, if you know anything that can be of
    help, tell it quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know you have all those clues to trace down&mdash;track
    down, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look here, Polly,&rdquo; and Stone spoke sternly now,  &ldquo;understand
    you are not to mention to anybody, not to anybody at all, what you overheard.
    It was not a right thing to do, you are not a detective. But it can&rsquo;t
    be helped now, and you are strictly on your honor not to tell. Is that understood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, there&rsquo;s honor among thieves, you know.&rdquo;  Her
    absolutely serious air made her speech all the funnier. &ldquo;Well, I know
    who committed this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then out with it,&rdquo; exclaimed Cram, who was greatly
    annoyed at the whole performance and didn&rsquo;t know whether he wanted
    to arrest this nuisance or to spank her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it was a man who wore a long linen duster and
    a broad-brimmed soft hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re making this up, you&rsquo;ll be sorry
    for your trick,&rdquo; Cram exclaimed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making it up,&rdquo; Polly said, with
    calm dignity.  &ldquo;I saw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Saw him commit the crime?&rdquo; asked Stone, beginning
    to be bored by the child.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, saw the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were at dinner, you know, and I sat between Mr. Harrison
    and Mr. Dare. Mr. Dare was at the end of the table, opposite Mr. Homer, of
    course. So, from where I sat, I could see through the breakfast room and
    out of its windows. And while we were having the ice cream, I saw this man
    come up to the house and look in at the window of the breakfast room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A tramp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not exactly. More like a country man. He only gave
    a glance in and then disappeared, toward the front of the house. I never
    thought of his being the murderer until I heard you just now, telling about
    someone standing behind the tapestry, so I knew he must be the one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone looked at Cram and Cram returned the look with interest.
    The hardened policeman considered the whole tale a pure fabrication, but
    Fleming Stone, better versed in the psychology of the youthful mind, was
    ready to bank on the truth of the narrative as Polly told it, whatever bearing
    it might have on the case.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell us some more about the man,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any more to tell. He was medium height,
    I guess, but I can&rsquo;t be sure, &rsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t know just
    how high the window is from the ground. I didn&rsquo;t see his face well,
    for it was dark outside, of course, and lighted inside. But as he peered
    through the window, I caught sight of a smallish moustache, and I noticed
    particularly the wide-brimmed hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gray hat?&rdquo; asked Cram.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gray or light brown, I don&rsquo;t know. I thought nothing
    about him, you see, from the time I saw him till now. I never dreamed of
    an outsider coming after Gaylord! I thought it must be one of those girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone looked at her in perplexity. There was nothing of the
    smarty-cat about her. She showed no hesitation in telling what she knew and
    no desire to enlarge upon it. She seemed simply anxious to help, and had
    not the slightest appearance of shame or regret for her eavesdropping.</p>
  <p align="left">And but for one thing, Stone would have tossed the whole matter
    away as of no importance. And that one thing was his bits of grass.</p>
  <p align="left">If there had been such a man as Polly described, if he had
    crept into the house while the dinner was going on and had secreted himself
    behind the tapestry, he might have carried in on his boot soles some of the
    wet clippings of grass. That is, if the grass had been mowed that day!</p>
  <p align="left">A bit problematical, after all.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember whether
    the grass was cut over here on Friday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I know it was, because the noise of that old cutting
    machine bothered me so I had to stop my practising.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;m certain. Mother wanted me
    to go back and practise, but I said I positively couldn&rsquo;t till they
    got round behind the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t think of anything else distinctive
    about the strange man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, there was nothing distinctive about him. He seemed
    sort of old, but not real old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gray moustache, did you say?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say, and I don&rsquo;t know. But I think
    it was grayish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All cats are gray in the dark,&rdquo; murmured Cram,
    more and more disinclined to interest himself in this matter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t very dark,&rdquo; said Polly, meditatively.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But dinner was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh no, we were eating the ice cream. If it had been
    anything else, I might have given more attention to the man. Then, we had
    coffee after that, and liqueurs and then we sat and talked and smoked, oh,
    it was some time before dinner was over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Polly,&rdquo; Stone said, after a pause, &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know just what to say to you. I still think you were a naughty
    girl to listen at a window, but it&rsquo;s your mother&rsquo;s place to mend
    your manners, not my place. Now, it may be you&rsquo;ve given us a good tip,
    and it may not. We&rsquo;ll have to see about that. But remember, if you&rsquo;re
    to be one of us, a real detective&rsquo;s helper, you must promise not to
    tell anybody a word of all this, and I don&rsquo;t mean maybe. I mean honest
    injun, cross your heart and hope to never. Does that go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That goes,&rdquo; said the girl, solemnly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then run along, now, and remember!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She went off and the two men broke into laughter.  &ldquo;Out
    of the mouths of babes,&rdquo; said Stone. But Cram said, &ldquo;I fear it
    means her father.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15">Chapter 15</a><br>
    It May Have Been Cale</b></h2>
  <p align="left">THE situation was getting rather tense.</p>
  <p align="left">None of the house party guests had left as yet; some because
    they were not allowed to and some because they preferred to stay.</p>
  <p align="left">Bobbie Abbott wanted to stay until her husband came for her.
    Rollin Dare wanted to stay because it was a comfortable place and cost him
    nothing for board or lodging.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, in her new-found happiness, cared little where she was
    so long as Bingham was there, too. And Marita was conducting a campaign that
    she fondly hoped would be successful and result in making her mistress of
    Twin Towers, with Albert Moffatt as its master.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet the presence of Fleming Stone kept them all in full realization
    of the situation and an uncomfortable atmosphere pervaded the place.</p>
  <p align="left">The household machinery ran smoothly, for Abbie was an efficient
    housekeeper and Wood a perfect butler. The under servants had no wish to
    lose so good a situation and they went about their duties as usual, but with
    eyes and ears alert to what was going on.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram was despondent, and more and more willing to shift the
    burden of the investigation to Stone. The two men were amicable and worked
    together without friction, but while Cram was anxious to arrest Diana Kittredge,
    Stone declared there was not sufficient evidence against her, which, in his
    heart, Cram already knew.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, the startling story of Polly and the man she saw from
    the dinner table gave a new angle to things.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet Stone doubted whether there was any real importance to
    it all. The man might have been a gardener or a neighbor or a mere passer-by,
    attracted by the gay scene of the dinner party, and pausing a moment to look
    in. Surely such a man could not have known of the tapestry, and of the hiding
    place it made.</p>
  <p align="left">And that brought it back to Cram&rsquo;s last suggestion. If
    a man from outside did come in and hide, with murderous intent, that man
    could have been only Dr. Opdyke. He lived next door, he knew of the legacy
    coming to his daughter, he was in debt, he wore habitually a wrist watch
    that ticked audibly enough to be heard in a silent room, and most damaging
    of all, he could stab a man more surely and quickly than anyone else who
    had been thought of in connection with the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">Also, if he had come from home, across the two lawns, he would
    naturally collect under the instep of his shoe the bits of cut grass that
    the dew had rendered moist and clinging.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone knew from past experiences how long bits of grass or
    clover will remain sticking to a boot sole. Yet, of course, a few moments
    of standing on a deep piled rug would dislodge them and leave them behind
    for evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">And somebody had done that. Somebody had stood behind that
    tapestry and rubbed the grass off on the carpet.</p>
  <p align="left">True, it could have been done previous to the fatal night,
    but it was unlikely, for what would have been the motive?</p>
  <p align="left">Stone went to the luncheon table with his mind full of this
    new view of the affair.</p>
  <p align="left">He knew the seat Polly had occupied at the dinner party, and
    he saw at once that the girl could have seen a man passing by or stopping
    at the window of the breakfast room.</p>
  <p align="left">He turned the talk in the right direction by referring to Polly
    and her ridiculous assertion that since she had read several detective stories
    she was now competent to help him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lots of us could help you,&rdquo; Marita told him, her
    saucy eyes dancing, &ldquo;but you scorn our aid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not if it&rsquo;s worth more than the aid Polly offered,&rdquo;  Stone
    returned, smiling back at her.</p>
  <p align="left">Few men could help smiling at Marita. Even though suspected
    of crime, the girl could not lose her charm, her wonderful allurement.</p>
  <p align="left">Fickle, without doubt, ready to forget the man she had loved
    so passionately for the new hero who had come into her life.</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt had grown more accustomed to his surroundings, had
    settled into a sort of tentative ownership of the place, and had, with it,
    acquired a gentler manner, a more suave demeanor.</p>
  <p align="left">He had told Crawford repeatedly that he would never take over
    the estate so long as there was the least chance of finding the will. And
    he himself spent many hours ransacking the Tapestry Room and the study for
    the missing book.</p>
  <p align="left">They didn&rsquo;t search much for a document, as both Moffatt
    and Harrison felt sure the will was in the pocket of the book. The Opdykes,
    too, declared that Gaylord restored the paper to the book after they had
    witnessed it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think Marita&rsquo;s judgment a trifle higher than
    the flapper&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Moffatt said, in response to Stone&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;I
    lean to detective work myself, as who doesn&rsquo;t nowadays? and I think
    our Spanish princess has a decided talent in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then do help me, Miss Moore,&rdquo; Stone begged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    not the sort who makes a secret of his findings and I&rsquo;m quite willing
    to be frank. Is there anyone,&rdquo; he looked inquiringly round the table, &ldquo;outside
    this circle, outside this house, who could be imagined as concerned in this
    affair? Do you know of anyone who was enough of an enemy to Gaylord to get
    into the house unseen and commit the crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A silence followed this query, but few eyes were turned toward
    the questioner. It seemed as if their glances, for the most part, strove
    to avoid his.</p>
  <p align="left">But Cale Harrison, for one, looked straight at Stone, and said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you anyone in your mind, or are you just putting
    up a man of straw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have a definite person in mind, but I hesitate to
    speak his name, unless there is definite evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you indefinite evidence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean Dr. Opdyke?&rdquo; asked Rollin Dare, quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">Dare said little, but when he did speak he not infrequently
    hit a bull&rsquo;s eye.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Since you ask,&rdquo; Stone said, also quietly, &ldquo;I
    do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself. To malign
    that good and honest man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Steady on, Dare,&rdquo; Stone interrupted him. &ldquo;In
    my profession, to mention a man&rsquo;s name, or even to suspect a man, is
    not to malign him. I am here to find out who killed Gaylord Homer. I shall
    do the best I can to accomplish that end, irrespective of whom I offend or
    annoy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh of course,&rdquo; and Dare looked sheepish. &ldquo;I
    didn&rsquo;t mean to call you down, but, to imply the doctor&rsquo;s capability
    for such a deed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His capability is beyond question, physically,&rdquo;  Stone
    returned, calmly. &ldquo;As to morally&mdash;who can say? Criminals, as a
    rule, are not the ones you expect such things of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stone&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Cale Harrison, more
    decidedly than he often spoke. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t say this one or that
    one couldn&rsquo;t commit a crime. Now, I may know more than the rest of
    you about one phase of this thing, and that is the money side of it. As confidential
    secretary, I know that lots of Gaylord&rsquo;s friends were everlastingly
    at him for help. Financial help, I mean. And one of the most importunate
    and frequent callers was Dr. Opdyke. Gaylord gave and gave, until he became
    tired of it. Opdyke has a big practise, and why he is always short of funds
    I don&rsquo;t know. Any way, he refused the doctor the last two times, and
    the last time Opdyke went away very angry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he make any threats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he did. He said Gaylord would be sorry he had turned
    him down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is important evidence, Harrison, though, personally,
    I seldom suspect a threatener. As a rule the murderer doesn&rsquo;t threaten
    beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know more about that than I do, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;m
    only telling you what I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then we may reason that Dr. Opdyke had motive and opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How, opportunity?&rdquo; Moffatt asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, living next door, as he did, couldn&rsquo;t he
    slip over here while you were all at dinner, get into the Tapestry Room and
    hide there. Then, when the dark time came, slip from his hiding place, drive
    the dagger with a quick, skillful thrust and slip out, at the French window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ted Bingham said, emphatically. &ldquo;I
    was not far from that window and I know it was closed. It makes a fearful
    noise when it is opened&mdash;needs oiling, I guess. But anyway, your murderer
    never slipped out that window while I was there. And I was there all the
    time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Also,&rdquo; put in Moffatt, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s a
    hiding place in that room? It has no closet or cupboard except the book cases.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&#8221; Stone admitted. &ldquo;But it seemed
    as if there were several counts against the good doctor. One thing, he is
    a mothball addict.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; cried Diana, interested for the first
    time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mothballs?&rdquo; asked Moffatt, &ldquo;where do they
    come in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My pet clue,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;Or, rather
    Miss Kittredge&rsquo;s clue. She noticed the delectable odor of the things
    at the time of the crime. She stated that, I understand, at the inquest.
    So we want a man who is a user of mothballs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo; murmured Dare. &ldquo;My
    caretaker delights in stuffing them in my clothes the moment they are off
    my back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone looked at him with a new interest. He had given little
    thought to Rollin Dare, looking on him as a mere satellite of Mrs. Abbott.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a toss-up between you and Opdyke, Rollo,&rdquo;  Marita
    said, shaking her short black curls at him. &ldquo;Oh, dear, Mr. Stone, do
    find out and settle the matter once and for all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I want to. Now, then, all cards on the table. Polly
    says she saw a man looking in at the breakfast room window the night of the
    dinner. Says he was an oldish man with a gray moustache and a slouch hat
    and long linen duster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The gentleman with a duster,&rdquo; murmured Dare.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly. But could it have been the paternal Opdyke,
    on his way over here, doing a bit of scouting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It could indeed,&rdquo; Cale exclaimed. &ldquo;I believe
    you&rsquo;re on the right track, Stone, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Fleming Stone was frequently annoyed at the secretary&rsquo;s
    familiarities, but he never showed it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then help me on, Harrison,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now,
    suppose the man Polly saw was her father, just slightly disguised, and suppose,
    seeing you all at the table, he dared to go in the front door and secrete
    himself in the Tapestry Room, knowing Gaylord would come there from the dining-room.
    Now, where could he hide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison looked blank.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a place,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    think of any nook or cranny where he could hide. Can anybody?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Nobody could, or at least, nobody did, and the matter was dropped.</p>
  <p align="left">But Stone had achieved his purpose. It was too absurd to think
    that Harrison didn&rsquo;t know of the vacant space behind the tapestry curtain.
    He knew, of course, of the concealed safe on the other side of the fireplace,
    and he must know of the corresponding vacant recess. None of the others need
    know of it, for it was inconspicuous to a casual observer. But Cale certainly
    did, and he was obviously bluffing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The room is so beautiful,&rdquo; Stone went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    a pity it had to be chosen as the scene of a crime. I think tapestry and
    books the ideal furnishings for a wall. Far better than pictures and wall
    paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The whole house is in perfect taste,&rdquo; chimed in
    Bobbie, and then the talk veered to general matters and detective work was
    laid aside.</p>
  <p align="left">But Stone resumed it later in the afternoon, when Crawford
    came over to have a talk about the situation.</p>
  <p align="left">The two went to the Tapestry Room and shut themselves in.</p>
  <p align="left">Remembering Polly&rsquo;s proclivities, Stone saw to it that
    the window was fastened and the shade left up that they might see approaching
    eavesdroppers.</p>
  <p align="left">Then Stone told the lawyer of the discoveries he had made in
    the room. He showed him the slit cut in the tapestry and the pressed nap
    of the rug beneath, as well as the bits of grass which he had found just
    where the pile of the rug was disturbed.</p>
  <p align="left">Crawford viewed these things in silence for a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he sighed and said:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So it comes back to Harrison. I feared it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about Dr. Opdyke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But Crawford flouted this. Not all Stone&rsquo;s list of charges,
    including the doctor&rsquo;s habit of coming to Homer for money, and his
    knowledge of the bequest to Polly had any effect on Crawford&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Out of the question,&rdquo; he said, positively. &ldquo;Opdyke
    is a careless man with money, he&rsquo;s an extravagant spender, he doesn&rsquo;t
    collect his bills properly, but he&rsquo;s as sound as a nut. Crime? He doesn&rsquo;t
    know the meaning of the word in connection with himself. No, Mr. Stone, put
    that out of your mind at once. I&rsquo;d go bail for Eden Opdyke any day
    in the year. Now, this behind the arras business puts a new face on things.
    It looks like an outsider.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or an insider who wants it to look like an outsider,&rdquo;  Stone
    amended.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s clever of you. And more likely. Say
    one of the household, the servants, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Possibly, but the thing is almost too well done to be
    the work of a brain less than clever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True, but a servant can be clever. Old Wood and Abbie
    Perkins are both clever enough, but they&rsquo;re out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, weren&rsquo;t they engaged in clearing away the
    dinner? Had either been absent, the other servants would have said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe not. And, anyway, Abbie says herself she was alone
    in her own room all through the dark time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then she&rsquo;s accounted for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By herself, yes. But that&rsquo;s uncorroborated testimony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know, but&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think Abbie did it!
    Why, that&rsquo;s as absurd as Opdyke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have to look every way, Mr. Crawford. Many a crime
    has been committed by a trusted servant or an old retainer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;well, you must play your own game. But
    Abbie! why she worshipped the ground Gaylord walked on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. And she adored him. And he adored
    Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oho, I see. The fury of a woman scorned and all that.
    But, no, not Abbie Perkins. She knew her place. Try once more, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective looked up in time to catch the sudden quizzical
    smile of the lawyer and understood it.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;but stay, have you exonerated the two
    girls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes; haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Almost; practically, yes, since the discovery that someone
    must have hidden in this room. But, remember, there&rsquo;s always the possibility
    of those grass blades having been there a long time. They were dry when I
    found them. Well, then, if I try once more, it must be Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Right! He&rsquo;s your man. Do the grass blades fit
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, no. That is, he could have left the dining-room
    first. Nobody seems to know in just what order they came out. At least no
    two stories agree about that. But say Cale came first, slipped into this
    room and hid behind that tapestry. He knew Gaylord&rsquo;s habits, and he
    cut the slit&mdash;he&rsquo;s quite capable of chopping into a museum piece&mdash;and
    stood there, fidgeting, as he always does. Nobody else would worry the carpet
    and curtains as he would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, so far, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t think of Harrison, that
    rabbit! having the nerve to step out, when the dark came, grab the dagger
    and drive it into poor old Gaylord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those meek, repressed men who dare the wildest
    deeds sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it, and I suppose it is coming around to Cale.
    He, in that case, knows where the will is, and means to suppress it, so that
    he can get a snug position on here with Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve hit off the motive
    yet, though. I think, if he knows where the will is, he&rsquo;ll keep it
    safely until the time comes, and then he&rsquo;ll sell it to the highest
    bidder. I mean he&rsquo;ll approach Moffatt, very discreetly, and see if
    he&rsquo;ll make it worth his while to keep it dark. If Moffatt scorns this
    sort of thing, and I believe he would, then I think Friend Caleb will carefully
    approach Miss Kittredge and tell her that for a consideration he will produce
    the document.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And she would tell him to vamoose instanter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. The will is legal and all that,
    and if it benefits her she wants that benefit. She is up against it, poor
    girl, with her sick father, and her straitened means. And now she&rsquo;s
    engaged to Bingham, I hear, who is a lovable chap, but not a man of means.
    A promising sculptor, they say, but promises are poor pot-boilers. No, if
    Harrison has the will, he&rsquo;ll merely pretend he has just found it, and
    she&rsquo;ll doubtless give him a thank-offering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And if he tells Moffatt first, you think Moffatt won&rsquo;t
    compound a felony?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t. And Harrison must know
    that, too, unless he&rsquo;s a fool. But if I&rsquo;m mistaken, and Harrison
    and Moffatt should fix it up between them, they could destroy the will and
    live happy ever after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If Cale killed Gaylord, he must have known where the
    will was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It would seem so, unless they had some other quarrel;
    or unless Harrison mishandled some funds or something like that. Does he
    fit into all your clues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He can be made to. What I want is some clue that will
    fit him and nobody else. Anybody so inclined, could walk on the wet grass,
    come in silently, hide behind the tapestry and then commit his crime and
    get out again or stay there until a good chance turned up to slip out unobserved.
    With his convenient peephole he could manage that, of course. Then he has
    a rather loud ticking watch, and of course, Rhoda&rsquo;s stories could have
    been all made up at his orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In that case Rhoda knows his secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not. She may just suspect and frame
    an alibi for him on a chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the mothballs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do they stick in your crop? So they do in mine. But
    Dare said today that most people use them, so that&rsquo;s not an exclusive
    clue either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think most people use them. I&rsquo;m
    sensitive to them, and I rarely come up against them. Well, how are you going
    to run down the mild-mannered and black-hearted villain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dunno yet. Harrison is not easy to interview. Either
    he gets his back up and acts stubborn or else he just baas like an imbecile
    lamb. But I shall put my mind to it and contrive what seems to me the best
    plan. Cram will be inconsolable to learn that you frown on the Opdyke suspect.
    He was sure he had struck a trail there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in a thousand years. I say, Mr. Stone, you don&rsquo;t
    think that accursed will book is here, do you? It might easily be among the
    volumes on these shelves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It might be, but I don&rsquo;t think so. Moffatt and
    I went over the lot, checking back on each other. I even watched him covertly
    for trick work, but there was none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At any rate, I&rsquo;m glad the two girls are out of
    the running.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not quite that, but I&rsquo;ve made a study of them,
    and I can&rsquo;t pin a thing on them except their proximity to the victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing. Ted Bingham thinks
    it&rsquo;s Cale we&rsquo;re after, or should be after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll get after him.&rdquo;</p>

    Another Tragedy</b></h2>
  <p align="left">FLEMING STONE was awakened rather early the next morning by
    a tap at his bedroom door. Observant of sounds, he thought it seemed like
    the tap of an alarmed or frightened person.</p>
  <p align="left">He flung back the coverings, slipped into a dressing gown,
    and opened the door.</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie Perkins stood there, her face more gaunt and drawn than
    ever, and her fingers nervously twisting her large white apron.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Harrison, sir. Is he here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; Stone repeated, &ldquo;why, no, he isn&rsquo;t
    here. What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t find him? What do you want of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing, but we wonder where he can be. His room&rsquo;s
    not been slept in and he&rsquo;s nowhere to be found. Won&rsquo;t you do
    something, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie was trembling with excitement and Stone began to think
    there was more reason for it than the temporary absence of Cale Harrison.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say his bed hasn&rsquo;t been used?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. It&rsquo;s turned down and all, just as Rhoda
    put it, but he didn&rsquo;t go to bed at all. His pajams is there, laid on
    the bed proper, but there&rsquo;s no clothes lying around, and his brushes
    and things on his dresser haven&rsquo;t been touched. So he didn&rsquo;t
    go to bed, and where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Must have gone to town late last night, unexpectedly,
    or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No Mr. Stone, that ain&rsquo;t the explaining of it,
    that ain&rsquo;t. You get yourself dressed and come along down, won&rsquo;t
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course I will. Be down in five minutes, Abbie. Ask
    all the servants if they heard or saw anybody leave the house late. Mr. Harrison
    was here when we all came upstairs, about eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abbie disappeared and Stone made a rapid toilette.</p>
  <p align="left">He went downstairs, but first he went to Harrison&rsquo;s room
    and gave it a quick but careful look over.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s done a bolt,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that
    settles it. He&rsquo;s the murderer of Gay Homer. He must have gathered that
    he was more strongly suspected of late, and he couldn&rsquo;t stand the pressure.
    Just like him to run away. Now, what about the will! I hope to goodness if
    Moffatt falls into the property he&rsquo;ll give Diana a slice&mdash;if she&rsquo;d
    take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Rapidly he took stock of the room. As Abbie had said, the bed
    was made ready but had not been touched. He stepped in the bathroom, and
    saw only clean towels and straightened brushes. It looked as if Cale hadn&rsquo;t
    come upstairs at all after dinner, but Stone knew that he did come up with
    the rest, who had all chosen to turn in early. It was about eleven, he reflected,
    when they came upstairs and said good-night on the various landings.</p>
  <p align="left">As he looked about he could gather no idea whether Cale had
    left the house or merely gone downstairs or to the study. The latter seemed
    most probable, but of course Abbie or Wood must have looked for him there.</p>
  <p align="left">He wanted to hasten downstairs himself, but he felt this first
    examination of the room was too precious an opportunity to be lost.</p>
  <p align="left">He opened the doors of the clothes closets, but though he saw
    hats and sticks there, he had no means of knowing if any were missing.</p>
  <p align="left">The dresser gave no information, just the usual toilet implements,
    and all in straight rows, proving he had not prepared for bed at all.</p>
  <p align="left">He hesitated to open table drawers or cabinets, for if the
    explanation of Cale&rsquo;s absence was a simple one, he would resent Stone&rsquo;s
    intrusions.</p>
  <p align="left">So he gave it up and went out of the room. Passing the study,
    he saw the door was open and the room empty.</p>
  <p align="left">He went on downstairs and found Wood in the hall, calm and
    imperturbable as always, but to a close observer showing signs of suppressed
    anxiety.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh Mr. Stone, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whatever has
    become of Mr. Harrison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you know, Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Almost nothing, sir. He can&rsquo;t have gone out, for
    here&rsquo;s his hat and overcoat in the coat closet. He always kept these
    down here, besides what he had in his room. And yet, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what? If you know anything, man, for heaven&rsquo;s
    sake speak out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, only this. Martin, the second man, says he saw
    somebody leave the house by the front door just after he went upstairs. That
    would be about midnight. He doesn&rsquo;t know whether it was Mr. Harrison
    or not. He just saw from his window someone from the house go out the gate.
    He didn&rsquo;t notice much, only saw it was somebody from the house, and
    so he supposed it was all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call the man here,&rdquo; Stone said, and in a moment
    Martin appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">He could only corroborate Wood&rsquo;s statements and said
    he did see a gentleman leave the house and go out at the front gate at about
    twelve o&rsquo;clock the night before. He didn&rsquo;t observe him closely,
    for he just assumed it was one of the guests of the house, and it was none
    of his business. No, he couldn&rsquo;t say whether it was Mr. Harrison or
    not.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you know Mr. Harrison well,&rdquo; Stone said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, but he passed under the trees as I saw him,
    and I can only say I didn&rsquo;t recognize him at all. It might have been
    any of the gentlemen who are staying here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, as Mr. Harrison is absent, it is strongly probable
    that it was he. You may go, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The man left them and Stone turned again to the butler.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It must have been Mr. Harrison, Wood. He had an errand
    in the city and went off on the midnight train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But his hat and coat, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh he has other hats and coats up in his room. I saw
    several there just now when I looked in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;d most likely wear these,&rdquo; the
    butler looked dubiously at the garments in the hall coat closet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll telephone or come back or something
    soon. Breakfast ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, but if you&rsquo;ll step in the breakfast room,
    I&rsquo;ll hurry things along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, just give me a cup of coffee, and I&rsquo;ll
    go back and make a properer toilette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone turned away, and for no especial reason strolled into
    the Tapestry Room. This room was not now kept locked, as the detectives felt
    there was nothing more to be learned from its evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">The morning sunlight filtered in between the curtains not yet
    drawn, and Stone crossed the room and pulled the curtains wide apart and
    rolled up the shades.</p>
  <p align="left">As he turned back he saw himself confronted with a fresh tragedy.</p>
  <p align="left">On the floor, behind the love-seat, lay the body of Cale Harrison.</p>
  <p align="left">Horrified, Stone bent over it, not calling assistance, for
    he wanted to learn the facts for himself.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison was dead, and from his breast protruded the handle
    of a dagger. It was of dull, discolored metal, and Stone recognized it at
    once as one he had seen in a curio cabinet in the room. The body lay on its
    back, and a moment&rsquo;s feeling of the heart told Stone it would never
    beat again.</p>
  <p align="left">Harrison wore the evening clothes he had on the night before,
    and Stone at once concluded either the secretary had not gone upstairs when
    the others did, or had gone up and come down again.</p>
  <p align="left">Without disturbing the dead man further, Stone quickly looked
    around the room. The butler would come soon, he knew, to call him to his
    coffee, and he wanted to examine the room while it was untouched by other
    hands.</p>
  <p align="left">But all his trained observation and his skilled powers of deduction
    availed him nothing. He could find no shred of evidence, no trace of a clue,
    no hint of the personality of the man who had killed Cale Harrison.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor old chap,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and
    we were just about to arrest him as a murderer himself. Though, to be sure,
    this doesn&rsquo;t preclude that theory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Wood came to the doorway.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and turned a ghastly white
    as he looked at the man on the floor. &ldquo;Another!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Wood, another. So you see, whoever it was that
    went out of the house last night, it wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. But whoever it was it was the man who killed
    Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t know yet. Now, I&rsquo;ll lock this
    door, Wood, and keep the key. Don&rsquo;t say anything about this quite yet
    in the kitchen. Let the breakfast go forward quickly, and I&rsquo;ll take
    my coffee while I have the chance. Go upstairs and ask Mr. Moffatt and Mr.
    Bingham to come down as soon as they can. Don&rsquo;t bother Mr. Dare. And
    send Abbie to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Wood obeyed all orders as quietly and promptly as they had
    been given, and Abbie Perkins came at the summons.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; she said, in a quivering voice.  &ldquo;I
    knew something happened to Mr. Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, it has. Did Wood tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wormed it out of him. He couldn&rsquo;t keep a secret
    from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, everybody must know it soon. Now, you go up and
    tell the ladies. Tell them as gently as you can, and let them do as they
    wish about coming downstairs. If they&rsquo;d rather breakfast in their rooms,
    very well, but they must be down when the police get here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good Lord! The police again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not again, really, they&rsquo;re still here. But another
    job for them certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then Wood reappeared with a fresh shock for them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Bingham isn&rsquo;t in his room, sir, and his hat
    and coat are gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are we coming to?&rdquo; Abbie moaned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The end of it all, I hope,&rdquo; said Stone, gravely.  &ldquo;Wood,
    cut over next door and bring Dr. Opdyke back with you. Don&rsquo;t give the
    alarm over there, though, and don&rsquo;t let that ridiculous Polly person
    come over here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; and Wood went off.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, Abbie, I suppose you&rsquo;ll have to tell Miss
    Kittredge that Mr. Bingham is not in evidence, though I don&rsquo;t in the
    least think that he is killed, too. And as things look pretty serious I reckon
    you&rsquo;d better get everybody up. There&rsquo;ll be more or less excitement
    all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone drank his coffee, with a brooding look in his deep eyes.
    He wondered where Bingham had gone and why. The obvious answer was that Ted
    was the murderer and he had fled. But why would he kill Harrison? Unless&mdash;and
    Stone began to see a ray of light, unless Harrison had found the will and
    destroyed it. Yet, no, even though he had cut Diana out of her rightful inheritance,
    Bingham wouldn&rsquo;t kill for that. To be sure, Cale had been hunting the
    Tapestry Room a lot lately for that will book, and he had hunted the study
    too. Stone had seen him more than once searching among or behind the books
    there.</p>
  <p align="left">Hearing a step, he looked up to see Moffatt and Rollin Dare
    coming in. As they took their seats at the table, Dr. Opdyke arrived.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the doctor cried, &ldquo;another
    victim? Harrison dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, doctor. Suppose you go into the Tapestry Room and
    make your investigation, and then come back here and have some coffee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Opdyke hurried off and Wood went with him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do tell me the details,&rdquo; urged Moffatt, his eyes
    staring with horror and curiosity. &ldquo;How was he killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With a dagger,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;Not the one
    that killed Gay, the police still have that. But there are three or four
    more daggers in that room, on the stands and in the cabinets. This one used,
    is a dull, old-looking affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Rollin Dare said &ldquo;a hilt of
    ebony or teak, with dull bronze ornamentation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the one. Cale lies on the floor, with
    that dagger in his breast. That&rsquo;s actually all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where, on the floor?&rdquo; asked Moffatt.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Back of the love-seat, where Gay sat. Between it and
    the mantelpiece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then a silence fell, and each man seemed lost in thought
    till Dr. Opdyke reappeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve little to tell you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Harrison
    died probably about two or three o&rsquo;clock. I can&rsquo;t put it nearer
    than that. He was struck squarely through the heart, evidently by somebody
    who stood facing him. He fell rather in a heap but on his back. The dagger
    is still in the wound, I left it for the coroner to see. So far as I can
    judge, Harrison does not seem to have put up a fight, but of that I&rsquo;m
    not positive. Were the lights still on this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not when I went in the room,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;I
    opened up the window and let in the light, that&rsquo;s the first I knew
    about it. We must ask the servants whether the lights were on. But of course
    they were not, or they would have seen the body and raised an alarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the doctor agreed. &ldquo;Well, the
    police must be notified at once. Some of you chaps look after that, and I&rsquo;ll
    go over home and tell my wife. No, no coffee, thank you, I&rsquo;ll get along
    home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone had already telephoned for Cram, and the police sergeant
    came shortly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he
    said, gravely.  &ldquo;This continued story of murders is too much for me.
    Now, we have the whole performance to do over again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we have, Cram,&rdquo; Stone agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    have to get the coroner here, and there&rsquo;ll have to be an inquest and
    all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course. And I&rsquo;ll send some men over here to
    take charge. All the people in the house must stay, and we must follow up
    Mr. Bingham. Any idea where he went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stone replied, &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t
    know that he went willingly. He may have been forced to go by the people
    who killed Harrison. Don&rsquo;t assume that Bingham left of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh come now, Mr. Stone, it seems to me an open and shut
    case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But sometimes, Cram, openness and shutness are very
    deceptive. But go on, reconstruct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too easy. Mr. Harrison came downstairs in the night
    and went into the Tapestry Room to hunt for that confounded will. I&rsquo;m
    thinking there is a big bequest for him in it, for he&rsquo;s been hunting
    for it right along, steady. Well, then Mr. Bingham heard him down here, sized
    up what he was after and came down to see about it. Then they quarreled or
    had a row of some sort, and Mr. Bingham stabbed Mr. Harrison. Maybe in self
    defence. Anyhow the thing happened and then Bingham was so shocked and frightened
    at his own deed, he just bolted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Plausible enough,&rdquo; said Moffatt, who had been
    listening,  &ldquo;but short sighted on Bingham&rsquo;s part. He must know
    that to run away is equivalent to a confession. And how can he come back?
    And how can he stay away? No, I think Bingham too sensible a man to try that
    dodge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you think, then, Mr. Moffatt?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hard to say at present. But it seems to me the work
    of an outsider. It may be a burglar got into the Tapestry Room. You know
    the newspaper stories have played up the curios and treasures in there. Say
    an expert thief set out to steal some of the rare books or art objects. And
    Cale heard him and came downstairs. Then a struggle ensued and Cale got the
    worst of it. I think that&rsquo;s all more likely than to suspect Bingham
    of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The women came into the breakfast room as Moffatt voiced this
    opinion.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana, hearing the last words, turned white and sank into a
    chair at the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; she said, in a low,
    moaning voice. &ldquo;Where is Ted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where he is,&rdquo; Stone told her,
    speaking gently, but feeling it was better for her to know the truth at once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t he in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, or at least, we can&rsquo;t find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then he has gone down to the village, or something of
    that sort,&rdquo; Diana said, keeping her poise, and looking calmly at each
    in turn.  &ldquo;Perhaps to send a telegram or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; Moffatt agreed, and then as Marita
    entered, he rose to give her a seat next his own. Fresh coffee was brought
    and then the news of Cale&rsquo;s death was circulated and discussed.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita was visibly affected. She burst into tears, and though
    Bobbie tried to comfort her, she was beyond consolation.</p>
  <p align="left">At last, Moffatt induced her to go for a stroll in the gardens
    with him, and the two went off.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Marita is so terribly cut up,&rdquo; Dare
    observed. &ldquo;She threw Cale over long ago in favor of Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe Marita knows something&mdash;something evidential,&rdquo;  Bobbie
    said, rather proud of her technical word.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to tell it if she does,&rdquo; Stone
    said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad she went off for a while. Her temperamental
    moods are hard to manage. Now, does anyone know anything about this whole
    matter? Either Harrison&rsquo;s death or Bingham&rsquo;s disappearance? Please
    speak out if you do, for the thing is going to be hard enough to handle,
    and we&rsquo;ll be glad of any help we can get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a thing about it,&rdquo; Diana said,
    speaking clearly and slowly. &ldquo;But I do want to know where Ted is. Do
    you think, really, he&rsquo;ll be back so soon, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s no use raising false hopes,&rdquo; Stone
    said, gently. &ldquo;I think possibly Mr. Bingham has gone down to the city.
    It seems Martin, the second man saw someone leave the house about midnight,
    and it may have been Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why in the world would he go away at midnight?&rdquo;  exclaimed
    Diana, her sky-blue eyes opening wide in surprise. &ldquo;Ridiculous! Perhaps
    it was somebody else. But someone left here about twelve o&rsquo;clock last
    night. Who else could it have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was the murderer, of course,&rdquo; Diana declared.  &ldquo;But
    Mr. Bingham was not the murderer. That is certain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll probably turn up soon,&rdquo; Stone
    said. He spoke absent-mindedly, and finishing his coffee, he excused himself
    with a word and left the table.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Carry on, Cram,&rdquo; he said as he drew on a light
    overcoat.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to the village a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He left the house, and commandeered a small car from the garage.
    He drove it himself and went straight to the railroad station.</p>
  <p align="left">A few questions proved to his mind beyond all shadow of doubt
    that it was Ted Bingham who had taken the midnight train to New York. The
    ticket seller was the day man now, but he gave Stone the address of the night
    agent and Stone telephoned him.</p>
  <p align="left">Not at all pleased to be awakened, he growled out his responses.
    But learning the identity of his questioner, he became more amenable and
    declared it was Mr. Bingham.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know him. He&rsquo;s been
    here several times before. He was a great friend of Mr. Homer. Good-looking
    chap, acts as if he owned the earth, but willing other people should walk
    on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This pretty well described Ted, and Stone chuckled.  &ldquo;Tall
    and fairly heavy?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yep, and goldy hair, little bit curly, but a real he-man
    all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chap,&rdquo; Stone sighed. &ldquo;Did
    he seem nervous or upset? Or just natural?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, just natural. Well, maybe a little bit jumpy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure he took the train to New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure. Dunno where he left it, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get that from the conductor. Many thanks.
    Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then Stone happened to catch sight of the gawky rustic who
    had driven him over to Twin Towers the day of his arrival.</p>
  <p align="left">A slight effort of memory brought the name to his mind, Jed
    Farley.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hello, Farley,&rdquo; he said, going toward him. &ldquo;Want
    to do me a favor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sure, sir, if so be&rsquo;s it helps you and don&rsquo;t
    hender me none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then cast your mind back to the night Mr. Homer
    was killed. Remember it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Like as it was yesterday, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, that night did anyone come into New Warwick on
    the midnight train?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No sir, they didn&rsquo;t. I waited around all evenin&rsquo;  for
    a fare, but nary a one turned up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, not earlier in the evening, either?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, not a passenger offen the trains wanted the
    use of a fust-class bus like mine, that whole endurin&rsquo; night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody got off of any train?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, a few stragglers got offen trains, but nobody
    who was hankerin&rsquo; to ride. They all seemed possessed to walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who were they, some of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, nobody you&rsquo;d be likely to know. There
    was the Murdocks, comin&rsquo; home from a theater party, and Mr. Ellsworth
    and Mr. and Mrs. Greer, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Anybody you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nope. Or well, they was a couple, an old man and an
    old woman. But I didn&rsquo;t notice them much. They dropped offen a train
    long &rsquo;bout ha&rsquo;past nine or so and they struck off across the
    tracks towards the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Towards Twin Towers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, the other way. Towards the Highway. I never saw &rsquo;em
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did they look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I disremember. She looked like a workin&rsquo; woman
    and he&mdash;well he looked a mite tastier. Had on a soft hat, kinder broad
    brimmed, and a linen duster, or mebbe &rsquo;twas a light overcoat. I dunno.
    Anyway, they didn&rsquo;t go to Twin Towers, if that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
    interestin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing interests me just now that hasn&rsquo;t to do
    with Twin Towers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then cut out them two old critters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think they were a married pair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land! How could I tell that? I don&rsquo;t keep a bureau
    of vital statistics!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17">Chapter 17</a><br>
    The Man With Jane Black</b></h2>
  <p align="left">A MURDER and inquest in a house is an upsetting and nerve-racking
    affair. But when the affair is duplicated and all the wearing details of
    inquiry and inquest have to be gone over again, it is well-nigh unbearable.</p>
  <p align="left">Twin Towers was again in the hands of the police. Again Coroner
    Hale was carrying on his interminable questionings.</p>
  <p align="left">The women were on the verge of nervous breakdown and the men
    were chafing at this new delay of hoped-for departure.</p>
  <p align="left">To be sure, none of them had any real affection for or even
    a deep interest in Cale Harrison. He was, to all of them, merely Homer&rsquo;s
    secretary. But no one can see a fellow human being forcibly removed without
    a feeling of regret and sympathy and a righteous indignation against the
    criminal.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita, of course, was almost in hysterics. True she had discarded
    Harrison for the more profitable Moffatt, but her excitable temperament moved
    her alternately to bursts of wrath and tumultuous weeping.</p>
  <p align="left">To her surprise Moffatt wasn&rsquo;t quite as attentive to
    her as she thought he should be. In fact, he somewhat neglected her in favor
    of Fleming Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did you find out?&rdquo; he asked Stone, on his
    return from the railroad station.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s practically no doubt that Bingham went
    to New York last night on the midnight train,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;Or,
    rather, that he took that train. Whether he left it before reaching New York,
    we don&rsquo;t know yet. I keep hoping the chap will turn up. It&rsquo;s
    all a strange case, Moffatt. I don&rsquo;t know just where we stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, this new blow is unlooked for, and I can&rsquo;t
    understand it. Have you any clues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No finger prints or cuff-links,&rdquo; Stone said, with
    a grim smile. &ldquo;But until Ted returns, he will, of course, be more or
    less suspected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in a thousand years!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet somebody drove that dagger into poor old Harrison.
    I say, Mr. Stone, let me help on this thing. I may not be much good, but
    I&rsquo;ll work under your orders. Isn&rsquo;t there something I can do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, find that will, or will book. Then find out who
    was the man Polly saw while she was at dinner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What man? I never heard of him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, just a prowler, I suppose. But for the moment, you&rsquo;d
    better see what you can do for Miss Moore. She&rsquo;s on the edge of her
    nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to calm her, and then perhaps you&rsquo;ll
    have thought of something I can do to help along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Coroner Hale was at his wits&rsquo; end. He questioned everybody
    he could get hold of, but he learned absolutely nothing illuminating as to
    the death of Harrison or the disappearance of Bingham.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram was searching the Tapestry Room with zeal but with non-success.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone went in there after him, and closed the door. The coroner
    had finished his examination of the body and given permission to have it
    taken away to the mortuary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How about the slit tapestry and the foot-marked carpet
    this time?&rdquo; Cram said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to cut any ice in this case,&rdquo; Stone
    returned, gloomily. &ldquo;There is absolutely nothing resembling a clue
    to this murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That means a mighty clever brute we&rsquo;re trying
    to track down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It does. And I can&rsquo;t help thinking the same hand
    is responsible for both murders. I don&rsquo;t suspect Bingham at all, do
    you, Cram?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that, but I&rsquo;ll reserve judgment
    till I can talk to him. He&rsquo;s the only one I can think of, except, of
    course, Miss Kittredge, who has an interest in finding that will. Now it
    must have been the will Harrison was down here looking for, because it couldn&rsquo;t
    have been anything else. He could search the study when he liked, but he
    couldn&rsquo;t poke around in this room, unseen. And naturally, he didn&rsquo;t
    want his continued searching noticed. I&rsquo;m sure there was a good big
    sum left to him in that will, for Homer thought a lot of him. And doubtless
    he told Harrison of it, for those two were here alone most of the time, you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can understand Cale&rsquo;s everlasting hunt for the
    will, but I don&rsquo;t get Ted Bingham in the game. I think he had nothing
    to do with the whole affair, and he had some sudden errand in town, and he
    came downstairs and went off without going in the Tapestry Room at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pure conjecture, but you&rsquo;ve a right to that. What
    about Dr. Opdyke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always hovering in the background, of course.
    Well, between you and me, Cram, Coroner Hale won&rsquo;t find out much more
    about this case than he did about Homer&rsquo;s. So it&rsquo;s up to us to
    get busy and solve the mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Moffatt is very anxious to help. What do you think
    of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He certainly seems concerned over Cale&rsquo;s death.
    In a way, though, he is head of the house, and as there seems to be less
    and less hope of finding a will, he&rsquo;ll have to come into the property.
    He told me if he did, he should offer a handsome settlement to Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope she takes it,&rdquo; Stone said, heartily. &ldquo;It
    would be foolish of her to refuse. And yet, I don&rsquo;t see how she can,
    when she didn&rsquo;t care for Homer. It would be different if they had been
    an engaged couple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt came tapping at the door then, and Cram let him in.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Glad to see you, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose
    we may as well look on you as head of the house, for in the absence of a
    will, the property must come to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Moffatt sighed as he took a chair
    near them. &ldquo;I confess I would rather have had Gaylord&rsquo;s will
    found, whatever its contents. For this unsettled condition is far from pleasant
    to me. I little thought, when he was talking to me about it, that things
    would turn out like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just what did he tell you?&rdquo; Cram pursued.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Said he had concluded to make a will, leaving the bulk
    of his estate to Miss Kittredge. Said he would leave me a fair slice. And
    said he meant to make his own will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That was just a whim, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he was full of whims. Then he showed me the book,
    but I wasn&rsquo;t much interested in it, and paid only slight attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At that time he hoped to win Miss Kittredge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He certainly did. I think he had no doubt she would
    accept him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve looked all over this room for the will
    book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I have. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not on these
    shelves. And Harrison told me he was sure it was not up in the study. So
    there we are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lucky you have an alibi for the night of your cousin&rsquo;s
    murder,&rdquo; Cram said with a nod of his head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alibi? Why, no, I haven&rsquo;t an alibi. Oh, well,
    I&rsquo;ve told where I was, of course, but do you know, the word alibi to
    me suggests a cooked up yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Moffatt,&rdquo; Stone said, approvingly.  &ldquo;An
    innocent man doesn&rsquo;t have an alibi. Oftenest he can&rsquo;t remember
    where he was at the critical time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I remember all right, for you know they asked me about
    it the very next day. But, after all, my evenings are pretty much alike,
    or were, before these tragic times began. I go to the movies usually twice
    a week. I go to the club two or three times a week, and other nights, I just
    sit at home and read or write letters. Except for a two weeks&rsquo; vacation
    in the summer, and my infrequent visits to Gaylord up here, I&rsquo;ve always
    been a great homebody. If I do fall into this estate, I shall lead the same
    sort of simple life, even in this great house. My tastes don&rsquo;t run
    to gayeties much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But your wife&rsquo;s tastes may,&rdquo; and Cram smiled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Referring to the little Senorita?&rdquo; Moffatt asked,
    good-naturedly. &ldquo;Oh, I think she&rsquo;s only playing with me. But
    I want to do some real work on this case,&rdquo; he continued in a serious
    tone. &ldquo;I wish you chaps would give me a definite assignment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Detective work is seldom done by definite assignment,&rdquo;  Stone
    told him. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll offer you this job. Find out who came here
    the night of Gaylord&rsquo;s party and looked in the window of the breakfast
    room, while the guests were at dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man you spoke of before. Tell me more
    of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know much about him. Polly Opdyke saw
    him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Moffatt smiled
    a little,  &ldquo;girls of that age are very apt to make up sensational yarns?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; Stone agreed. &ldquo;It
    may well be the child imagined she saw the man, or she may have even made
    it up for mischief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not exactly mischief,&rdquo; Moffatt said, &ldquo;but
    in a spirit of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exhibitionism,&rdquo; prompted Stone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the word I wanted! It&rsquo;s a phase of
    adolescence that leads youngsters to say or do something to get in the limelight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a well known condition. And Polly may
    have been romancing. But you take the matter up, will you? I can only tell
    you that the chap she saw had on a linen duster and a slouch hat and wore
    a moustache, rather gray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Observant child!&rdquo; murmured Moffatt. &ldquo;All
    right, I&rsquo;ll take on the commission and see what I can do about it.
    Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only to find the will,&rdquo; Stone smiled at him. &ldquo;But
    that, I think, is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe not. I wish to Heaven it could be found. I daresay
    you think I&rsquo;m insincere in my statements, but I tell you honestly,
    I&rsquo;d rather have no share in the property than to get it without good
    and sufficient legal authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Moffatt. If it comes to you, it will
    be because there&rsquo;s no other way to arrange matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">After this confab, Fleming Stone set out in search of Abbie
    Perkins.</p>
  <p align="left">He found her in her own sitting-room, a pleasant place, back
    of the breakfast room.</p>
  <p align="left">She was nervous and jumpy, with a tear-stained face and quivering
    lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Somebody else dead?&rdquo; she asked, in a hollow voice
    as Stone appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No Abbie, and I hope there won&rsquo;t be. Now, try
    to be more composed. I want to talk to you. Do you know of any old or elderly
    couple, who would go to New York and come home late or fairly late in the
    evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land, no, I don&rsquo;t believe there are any folks
    like that in New Warwick. I&rsquo;m s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; you mean common
    folks, not swells?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, say, good, simple country people, an old couple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, there just aren&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone looked at her, uncertain whether she was sincere or trying
    to shield somebody.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You seem positive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;ve lived here all my life and I know all
    the people of my own sort. And there&rsquo;s none like that. There&rsquo;s
    a woman, old Mrs. Black, she&rsquo;s been traipsin&rsquo; down to town a
    lot of late, to see her granddaughter, who&rsquo;s sick. And once in a while
    she might come home late at night, but there wouldn&rsquo;t be a man with
    her. No sir-ee, not with Jane Black! No, I don&rsquo;t know of any couple.
    Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind why. Has the coroner talked with you yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land, yes. Long ago. And all the rest of us. But we
    didn&rsquo;t know anything. Exceptin&rsquo; Martin, of course, who saw Mr.
    Bingham go out. Oh, Mr. Stone, don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em hang that nice Mr.
    Bingham! And it&rsquo;d break Miss Diana&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hang him till we catch him, Abbie. Where
    do you think he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went on some arrant for Miss Di, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.
    But why he went off in the middle of the night, is more&rsquo;n I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. Somehow I think Mr. Bingham is innocent
    of crime and will be proved so soon. Now, brace up, and keep hold of yourself.
    Go and see if you can do anything to help the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Stone left the room, and crossing the hall, looked in for a
    moment at the group around the coroner, in the lounge.</p>
  <p align="left">With his usual lugubrious face and funereal aspect, Hale was
    questioning his squirming victims. He thought it his r&ocirc;le to make everyone
    feel guilty, whether he was or not, and he shot questions at them, without
    cessation.</p>
  <p align="left">Knowing he would get a full report of all this later, Stone
    found his coat and hat and in the small car set off again for a talk with
    Jed Farley.</p>
  <p align="left">He knew, none better, that unless a person is interested in
    a passer-by, he can&rsquo;t remember details about him, and he had small
    hopes that Jed had noticed the people he wanted to know about. But it was
    worth trying, and by good luck, Stone found the cab driver idle at the rank.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just a question or two, Farley,&rdquo; he said, cheerily.  &ldquo;And
    it&rsquo;s about that old couple you saw that night and paid no attention
    to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The night of Gaylord Homer&rsquo;s death. An elderly
    couple who got off a late train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yeah. Well, they wasn&rsquo;t so elderly, and it
    wasn&rsquo;t so late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That so? Now, can&rsquo;t you place them? Can&rsquo;t
    you think who they were or could have been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a queer thing, but since you mentioned
    the matter, I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; over that pair. And it might have
    been old Jane Black, but she&rsquo;s been a widder for years and years. And
    she wouldn&rsquo;t have a man with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Might have been a neighbor, who happened along on the
    same train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, Jane Black ain&rsquo;t got any neighbors. No, I
    don&rsquo;t get it. But that&rsquo;s all I can tell you. It couldn&rsquo;t
    of been Jane, with a man, and I don&rsquo;t know anybody else it could of
    been. So there you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, there I am. Now, where does Jane Black live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, just over that way, down the road a piece. But you
    won&rsquo;t get anything outa her, and she&rsquo;ll bite your head off besides.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk my head,&rdquo; laughed Stone and started
    his car in the direction indicated.</p>
  <p align="left">He soon reached the home of the redoubtable Jane, and rang
    the bell with a feeling that he was about to find out something in spite
    of Farley&rsquo;s predictions.</p>
  <p align="left">The small place was immaculate and the woman who answered his
    ring was most neat and tidy, but with the expression of the old lady in the
    poem, who &ldquo;lived upon lemons and buttermilk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A sourer faced dame Stone thought he had never met.</p>
  <p align="left">But with his most deferential air, he inquired if he spoke
    to Mrs. Black and if he might enter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked, in curt, bitten-off
    words of inhospitality.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone changed his tactics.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I represent the law, madam, and it is for your own interest
    to tell me what I wish to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This succeeded better, and with a trace of fear on her gaunt
    old face she made way for him to come in.</p>
  <p align="left">She led the way to a tiny parlor and offered a chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is nothing alarming,&rdquo; Stone tried smiling at
    her once more, &ldquo;but I am obliged to discover whether you went to New
    York on the evening of April fourteenth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember dates like that, how long ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two weeks ago tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, I guess I did. Say, was that the day Mr. Homer
    was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That night, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, yes, I was down to town that day. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What time did you get home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I came on the train due here at nine-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it on time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, I guess so. I don&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who was with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nobody. Nobody never&rsquo;s with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I was told a man accompanied you from the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing of the sort! Who dares to say a thing like that
    about Jane Black?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her old eyes snapped, and her scrawny throat knotted itself
    into cords with her indignant grunts of disdain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But think back. Some man did step off the train with
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Sudden recollection dawned in her eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. I don&rsquo;t know who he was,
    but he did step off right along behind me. He didn&rsquo;t bother me none,
    but he asked me the way to the Highroad. That was just the way I was goin&rsquo;,
    and he took a step or two  &rsquo;long by my side. Then he sorter fell back,
    like he didn&rsquo;t mean to trouble me, and I thought no more about it.
    If he&rsquo;d kept on speaking to me I&rsquo;d have given him his comeuppance,
    but he just fell away like and I didn&rsquo;t see him again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land, I didn&rsquo;t notice him. Didn&rsquo;t so much
    as glance at his face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, how was he dressed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, either. Or, yes, he had on
    a long light coat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A linen duster?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Land, no. More like a light spring overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And his hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lemmesee. Seems like it was a biggish hat. But I didn&rsquo;t
    notice. I can&rsquo;t tell you another mite about him, &rsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t
    take notice. Me never dreaming I&rsquo;d be questioned about him! Who was
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. Now just one more thing. Did you
    notice the odor of mothballs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, yes, I did. How&rsquo;d you know that? Not strong,
    but I noticed it. Well, anything more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, thank you, Mrs. Black, and I&rsquo;m much obliged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Stone turned back as she was closing the
    door,  &ldquo;did he have a moustache?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I didn&rsquo;t look at him, I tell
    you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The door slammed and Fleming Stone went away well satisfied
    with his interview.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bless that Diana and her mothballs!&rdquo; he said to
    himself. &ldquo;I do believe we&rsquo;ll avenge Gaylord by those things!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He went home full of hope and found that Ted Bingham had returned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, old chap,&rdquo; Stone said, grasping his hand,  &ldquo;you
    gave us a scare. We thought you had been kidnapped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pity I hadn&rsquo;t been,&rdquo; Ted returned. &ldquo;Then
    I&rsquo;d have an alibi. As it is, I&rsquo;m suspected of doing in Cale Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, we ought to be able to fix that up. Come in
    here with me.&rdquo; Stone led him into the little breakfast room, and closed
    the door.  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; he said,</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I suppose I was a chump, but I
    got a notion about who killed Gay, and I couldn&rsquo;t rest till I tracked
    it down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s foolish, but I had a suspicion of
    Moffatt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Moffatt!&rdquo; exclaimed Stone, but keeping his voice
    low.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Diana was so set on the mothball business, that
    I thought it would be grand if I could pin the mothball onto somebody. And
    Moffatt was the only one I could think of. So I was lying there in bed last
    night and I was possessed to go down to Moffatt&rsquo;s place and trace it
    out. So I did. I didn&rsquo;t dream it would raise such a rumpus. I just
    put on my hat and walked out of the front door in time to catch the late
    train. Then I went to my diggings when I got to New York, and early this
    morning I went to Moffatt&rsquo;s home and interviewed his landlady. That&rsquo;s
    all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did it get you anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nowhere at all. The old woman said Mr. Moffatt never
    liked mothballs. Said he found one once that she had put in his blankets
    or something and he made quite a row about it, and told her never to do such
    a thing again. I asked if I might go into Moffatt&rsquo;s rooms to get a
    book he had asked me to bring him. She made no objection, showed me the rooms
    and went off and left me. I played sleuth, but there was nothing to find.
    All his things were in the neatest order and even his papers and things in
    his desk were in apple-pie trim. I hunted all over to find some clue or bit
    of evidence against him, but nothing doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What in the world made you suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he had a motive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Bingham, why he cares almost nothing about the inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, honestly, Stone, I was at my wits&rsquo; end to
    think of some way to look that didn&rsquo;t lead to Diana! Or Marita. But
    I think those fat-headed policemen have discarded Marita for Di. And, I tell
    you, I&rsquo;m scared to death. Why, if they take the notion, they can railroad
    Diana right through! There&rsquo;s no other suspect&mdash;and I must find
    one&mdash;I must!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Bingham had a wild look in his eyes and his fingers nervously
    intertwined themselves.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I know you&rsquo;ve done all you can, Stone. You&rsquo;re
    a wizard and all that, but even a wizard has to have something to bite on.
    And you haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve no more idea who killed Gay this minute
    than I had in the beginning. And now, if they accuse me of Cale&rsquo;s death,
    they&rsquo;ll probably tack Gaylord&rsquo;s on me, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Ted, I fear they will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad of it! If I swing for it, that will
    set Diana free, and that&rsquo;s all I care about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No calm down&mdash;be sensible. You&rsquo;re not accused
    yet, but you&rsquo;re going to be questioned, and soon, too. What are you
    going to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Say? The truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, come now, don&rsquo;t say you went down to the city
    to pry into Moffatt&rsquo;s affairs. They&rsquo;ll all be down on you then.
    But be sure to say just what time you went, for they have set Cale&rsquo;s
    death at about two or three o&rsquo;clock, and that lets you out. It&rsquo;s
    your only chance at an alibi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall tell the truth,&rdquo; repeated Bingham, doggedly.</p>
  <p align="left">And then the coroner sent to summon him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18">Chapter 18</a><br>
    The Solution of the Whole Matter</b></h2>
  <p align="left">STONE stayed out of the lounge, where Hale was conducting his
    investigation, and started for the Tapestry Room, which place he found most
    conducive to thought on this tangled case.</p>
  <p align="left">He was not very well pleased with himself. He felt that he
    had not made the rapid strides toward success that he usually did accomplish.
    He knew he had had little to work on, but he had hoped for inspiration that
    didn&rsquo;t come. He set it down in part to the fact that he was working
    on the case of a dear friend, and he argued that he couldn&rsquo;t do as
    good work as he could in a disinterested affair.</p>
  <p align="left">Cram met him in the hall and turned with him to the Tapestry
    Room.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone detailed his interview with Mrs. Black, but Cram wasn&rsquo;t
    greatly interested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pretty ridiculous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man going
    away from Twin Towers asks the way to the Highroad, just in the opposite
    direction from this place. Then he goes about his business. No, I can&rsquo;t
    see anything there. And as to Polly&rsquo;s man, I&rsquo;d as soon believe
    a fairy story made up by one of my own youngsters. No Mr. Stone, we&rsquo;re
    on the right track now, with Bingham and Miss Kittredge both involved. They
    have motive, Miss Kittredge wants the money and he wants the girl. I had
    a talk with Miss Kittredge and she told me what a wonderful sculptor Bingham
    is, or promises to be, but alas, he has no money. If he could study abroad,
    he would be a world shaker after a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But she never would have said all that to you, Cram,
    if she had killed a man for the sake of getting that money they want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh well, we argue round in a circle. Wait and see what
    Hale gets out of Bingham. It&rsquo;s pretty sure Bingham knows who killed
    Harrison. He must know, when he was poking around the house about midnight.
    Now, I must go back to the seat of war. Coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. You see that careful notes are taken. I&rsquo;m
    going out for a while, can&rsquo;t stay in this house. It&rsquo;s too oppressive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll look after things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a minute, Cram. What about Moffatt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, as a suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve ploughed that field thoroughly. He was
    my pet candidate, but I&rsquo;ve been to his rooms in New York, and I&rsquo;ve
    interviewed his cronies and I&rsquo;ve hunted through all his belongings,
    and there isn&rsquo;t a trace of suspicion anywhere possible. His business
    associates, his club fellows, his landlady, all give him the warmest praise,
    and set him down as a quiet, decent, honest citizen. A bit dull, some of
    his acquaintances say, but thoroughly reliable. And his cronies check up
    his story of that evening. He met them at the club, as he said, and told
    them the story of the movie he had seen, an animal picture, you know. And
    I even went to the picture house, and saw the ticket girl. She knows him
    well, and remembered his coming. No, there&rsquo;s not a shred to hang on
    that man. He&rsquo;s as quiet as they come. Why, his very rooms are quiet.
    When I was there, I noticed how quiet they were. And that reminds me, you
    know that I telephoned Moffatt that first night, perhaps an hour after Mr.
    Homer died. Well sir, I could hear his clock ticking over the telephone.
    That shows how quiet his place is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone sighed, &ldquo;he is a quiet man.
    And he seems sincere in not being crazy to inherit the estate. But I guess
    he&rsquo;ll get it all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll get it, and he ought to have it.
    He says he&rsquo;ll look out for Miss Kittredge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t take anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that. I&rsquo;ve heard of
    these folks who wouldn&rsquo;t take money, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, hush, Diana Kittredge is a superior woman. I know
    that. But she has an invalid father, and she wants Bingham to pursue his
    art studies. She&rsquo;d sacrifice her pride for those two men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is, if she gets out of this scrape. I tell you
    frankly, Mr. Stone, unless you trump up some other suspect, and a good one,
    too, mighty soon, it&rsquo;ll be black days for Miss Kittredge and Mr. Bingham,
    too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When will the inquest be? Tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, probably. Hale&rsquo;s rushing his preliminary
    investigation through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go along, then, Cram, and be sure to have a verbatim
    report made especially for me. I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Unheeding the group in the lounge, Stone went upstairs and
    hurriedly prepared for a trip to New York.</p>
  <p align="left">Once there, he went to Moffatt&rsquo;s home.</p>
  <p align="left">The landlady, a Mrs. Bindle, seemed none too glad to see him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, grumblingly,  &ldquo;but
    I wish Mr. Moffatt would send some word if he wants people going through
    his things all the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Stone, affably, &ldquo;who has done
    it before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who hasn&rsquo;t done it before?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Policemen
    and a man early this morning,&mdash;sitting on the door step he was, when
    I came here! And now you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I assure you it&rsquo;s all right. You see Mr.
    Moffatt is an important man now. His cousin is dead, and he may be the heir
    to all the property. So he can&rsquo;t be running about to attend to trifles,
    and we do it for him. Now I&rsquo;ll take a look in his rooms to see if I
    can find the paper he asked me to bring him. You needn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed, I won&rsquo;t wait. I have my work to do. Tell
    me when you&rsquo;re through and I can lock his doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So Fleming Stone embarked on the voyage of investigation that
    had already claimed the attention of others.</p>
  <p align="left">But the results were much the same.</p>
  <p align="left">Everything was in perfect order. Books were stood in neat rows,
    papers folded in tidy piles, and the desk a very model of immaculate order.</p>
  <p align="left">In the bedroom it was the same. Clothes in closets or dresser
    drawers all placed just so, ties, handkerchiefs, gloves, all wearing apparel
    just where it should be.</p>
  <p align="left">Pipes, cigarettes, tobacco, all in their proper receptacles.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone gave a grunt of annoyance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who could find a clue in a place like this?&rdquo; he
    exclaimed to himself. &ldquo;Not even a scrap in the wastebasket! Well, I
    guess Moffatt is a blank draw. Which way shall I look next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He gave one last survey of the clothing and toilet implements,
    and left the room.</p>
  <p align="left">Finding Mrs. Bindle, he gave her the keys and stood talking
    a minute.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not but what I&rsquo;ll be glad for Mr. Moffatt to come
    into money,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll miss him here. He&rsquo;s
    the best roomer I ever had. Quiet and decent and makes no trouble at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And generous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh yes. He gave me this,&rdquo; touching an ornament
    she was wearing, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s free enough with tips to the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;Mr. Moffatt
    wanted me to see the&mdash;what do you call him&mdash;janitor? porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, you mean the handy man, Thomas. Well he&rsquo;s
    around back. Go round if you like, but I&rsquo;ll have to see to my baking,&rdquo; and
    for the second time that day Fleming Stone had the door slammed at him by
    a woman.</p>
  <p align="left">Smiling at this coincidence he sauntered round back and came
    upon one who was most evidently the Thomas in question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, here you are,&rdquo; Stone said genially. &ldquo;I
    say, Mr. Moffatt asked me to give you a little tip. Said he forgot it when
    he was here last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Forgot it, did he? Well, the more the merrier.</p>
  <p align="left">He held out a grimy hand and Stone gave him a noble douceur.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Guess Mr. Moffatt gives you other things, too, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, wonderingly. &ldquo;No, he
    don&rsquo;t, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo;  a coat once, he never gave me nothin&rsquo;,
    barrin&rsquo; some chicken feed now&rsquo;n then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll tell him
    that I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Smiling, Stone turned away, and made briskly for the nearest
    corner to hail a taxi.</p>
  <p align="left">Except for a short stop at a public telephone booth, Stone
    went directly to the station and took the train for New Warwick.</p>
  <p align="left">It was when he was about halfway there, that he had a brilliant
    idea, so brilliant that he emitted a long, low whistle, and made several
    people look round in surprise.</p>
  <p align="left">But his grave, ascetic face made them feel uncertain that he
    was the whistler, and they promptly forgot the incident.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For the love of Mike!&rdquo; exclaimed Stone to himself,
    for he used slang only in soliloquy, &ldquo;if that isn&rsquo;t one clever
    dodge! I can&rsquo;t wait to get there! That clears up everything, I believe!
    And there was I innocently rummaging through Moffatt&rsquo;s belongings!
    Well, I must be getting in my dotage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Back at Twin Towers, Stone went in search of food, and though
    it was mid-afternoon, Wood and Martin saw to it that he had a satisfactory
    repast.</p>
  <p align="left">Then he went to the Tapestry Room, took precautions to lock
    the doors and draw the curtains. But in less than a minute he had the curtains
    open and the doors unlocked again, and the severest scrutiny could not have
    detected the slightest change in the room or its contents.</p>
  <p align="left">Slowly Stone sauntered across the hall and went into the lounge.</p>
  <p align="left">He took a seat near the door, next to Diana.</p>
  <p align="left">As he looked at her, and noted how sad and despairing she looked,
    he permitted himself to touch her hand and give her a whispered word of cheer.</p>
  <p align="left">But she only returned a wistful glance and sank back into her
    pathetic apathy.</p>
  <p align="left">Coroner Hale was floundering on, getting nowhere at all beyond
    the first and undeniable facts, when Stone, taking advantage of a pause,
    said, slowly:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Coroner, I think I am prepared to present some evidence,
    which may turn the tide of suspicion in a new direction. Shall I do so now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish you would, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and the worn and
    harassed coroner gave a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I am glad to listen to any
    well authenticated evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It may be rather a long story,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;as
    I must go back to the first crime committed here, the murder of Gaylord Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To say that everybody present became alertly attentive would
    be putting it very mildly.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana and Bingham drew a little closer to one another, and
    she let her hand steal into his.</p>
  <p align="left">Marita&rsquo;s face was expectant, yet a bit fearful, and the
    others showed varying expressions of surprise and interest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was not here at that time,&rdquo; Stone went on, &#8220;but
    those of you who were here can correct me if I am wrong. I am prepared to give you, if not the name of the murderer,
    at least sufficient data to allow you to supply the name yourselves. As you
    know, the circumstances of that first crime were strange, even dramatic.
    The fact that there were only the dead man and the two girls in the room
    when the lights flashed on would make it seem that one of those girls must
    have done the deed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Which one was it?&rdquo; asked Moffatt, his eyes wide
    as he awaited the answer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have not said it was either of them,&rdquo; Stone
    returned, in his low, level voice. &ldquo;I said it seemed so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I prefer that Mr. Stone should not be interrupted save
    by myself or Sergeant Cram,&rdquo; the coroner announced.</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt acknowledged the rebuke with a good-natured nod, and
    Stone went on.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When I came up here and heard the particulars of the
    case, I thought it over and came to this conclusion. Either one of the two
    girls in question committed the crime, or it was the work of some outsider
    who gained entrance to the Tapestry Room. For all the rest of the household
    were known to be in certain places where the commission of the crime would
    be impossible. A single exception might have been Mr. Harrison, and he will
    be considered, though as he is now the victim also of the murderer&rsquo;s
    dagger, it seems to eliminate him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By a reconstruction of the crime, I, of course, knew
    as well how the matter stood as if I had been present. Learning, therefore,
    that Miss Kittredge stood between the love-seat and the doorway to the hall,
    I soon saw that unless she moved from that position before the crime, nobody
    could enter from the hall. But if she moved from that position during or
    after the crime, somebody could get out through the hall. I was told by Miss
    Kittredge that she did move backward when she smelled the mothballs. For
    that odor is most distasteful to her, and she naturally drew back. Therefore,
    somebody could go past her and into the hall after the stabbing but not before.
    And this is exactly what happened. Somebody was already in the Tapestry Room
    before Mr. Homer and the two ladies went in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the room!&rdquo; the exclamation burst involuntarily
    from Marita.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes; concealed behind the tapestry curtain at the left
    of the fireplace. This somebody was the murderer, waiting there for the dark
    time. He stood behind the curtain, but he cut a little slit or peephole,
    that he might see into the room. Also, he stood there so long that his boots
    made press marks in the deep pile of the rug, and, moreover, his nervous
    fingers plucked at the side of the curtain, leaving visible marks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Finger prints!&rdquo; exclaimed Moffatt, &ldquo;how
    interesting!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not fingerprints in the police sense of the term. But
    creased marks, which may be seen, as they are still there. This man, then,
    stood there in concealment until the dark time came. At that moment, he knew
    exactly where everyone was, also where the dagger was. And bear this in mind.
    When he stepped out from his hiding place, he, being accustomed to the darkness
    behind the curtain could see better than one whose sight has just been cut
    off by the elimination of a bright light. Then knowing just where to find
    it, he grasps the dagger, and in a few seconds has driven it home to its
    fatal mark. Then he glides past Miss Kittredge, who has drawn back a little,
    and he steps into the hall and out of the front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cale!&rdquo; murmured Marita, her face scared and her
    voice a mere whisper.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone made no reply and went on with his narrative.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now, it is impossible to mistake the identity of this
    man because he left so many positive clues behind him. Moreover, he was seen.
    It was during dinner that Polly Opdyke saw a man steal up and look in at
    the window of the breakfast room, which she could see, of course, between
    the pillars that divide that room from the dining-room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Polly described him as an oldish man, with a gray moustache,
    a wide-brimmed hat and a linen duster. A man answering this description was
    also seen by two other people and his identity has since been learned. Incidentally,
    he wore a rather loud ticking wrist watch, which is what Miss Moore thought
    to be a clock ticking. Also, this man wore a garment which was strongly scented
    with the odor of mothballs, which Miss Kittredge noted. Also, and most important
    of all, this man had the greatest possible motive, from his own point of
    view, for the removal of Gaylord Homer. Now shall I tell you his name, or
    will you tell me,&rdquo; Stone looked around at the awed group, &ldquo;or&mdash;will
    he himself confess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A silence fell, which lasted so long that Stone spoke again. &ldquo;It
    would seem that he does not mean to confess, so I suppose I must say his
    name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Ted Bingham looked miserable. Diana but a little less so.</p>
  <p align="left">Stone suddenly realized that Bingham thought he was the accused
    man, and he spoke out involuntarily:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good Lord, Bingham, not you! Moffatt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this, Albert Moffatt roused to fury. He changed in an instant
    from the mild-mannered, suave gentleman, to a raging brute. Two men waiting
    in the hall sprang to seize him and pinioned his arms and held him firmly.
    But so unmanageable did he become, they had to resort to handcuffs.</p>
  <p align="left">He flung at Stone abuse and epithets. He jeered at Bingham,
    and even threw spiteful remarks at the two girls.</p>
  <p align="left">But as they were about to remove him, Stone bade them pause.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One moment, Moffatt,&rdquo; he said, calmly. &ldquo;Before
    you go, tell us where the will book is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A leer of cunning passed over Albert Moffatt&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That you will never find,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Stone said, and stepping
    to the Tapestry Room, while they all breathlessly waited, he returned with
    the will book, and showed that in the pocket of its cover was the will of
    Gaylord Homer.</p>
  <p align="left">He handed it over to Cram, who put it in his pocket.</p>
  <p align="left">Moffatt&rsquo;s face became fairly livid with rage. &ldquo;Where
    did you get that?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Where did you find it? How did
    you think of it? Oh, if I could get at you, Fleming Stone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then, fairly frothing at the mouth, he was half led, half
    carried away.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A clever villain if there ever was one,&rdquo; Stone
    said, looking at the others.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My work is done, I suppose, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Cram said,  &ldquo;but
    I wish you would tell us a few more details of your discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you most,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;You
    see, Moffatt is that terrible thing that Poe called a monstrum horrendum&mdash;an
    unprincipled man of genius. He is a man of genius, but genius in a wrong
    direction. He planned out this great coup long ago. He laid all his wires
    and, in fact, planned his whole life to this one end. He knew he was the
    only heir. If Homer died intestate the property must all be his, and he set
    to work to bring it about. But he overreached his own ends. He builded not
    wisely but too well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Bingham, greatly
    interested.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just this. He planned to live such a simple, blameless
    life, that when the time came nobody could suspect such a colorless, commonplace
    man of a great crime. But he overdid it. Bingham went to his rooms and found
    everything in such order that he was amazed. I went down there and found
    it all so perfectly in order that I suspected it was done on purpose. Now,
    he was the man in the linen duster. A false moustache and a slouch hat changed
    his appearance completely, though he mightn&rsquo;t have been recognized
    anyway. Note his cleverness. He got off the train that night at half past
    nine, stepped along by an old lady, that passers-by might think they were
    companions. He asked her the way to the Highroad, just opposite to his real
    destination. Then, after she answered, he slipped away, turned and came over
    here and reached here about nine-forty, glanced in the dining-room to be
    sure the coast was clear and then slipped into the Tapestry Room and behind
    the curtain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But&mdash;before doing so he pulled off the cleverest
    bit of all. He picked up the will book from the table, and hid it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He took a play, &lsquo;The Blue Bird,&rsquo; from the
    shelf, took off its paper jacket, put the jacket on the will book, and put
    it on the shelf among the plays. &lsquo;The Blue Bird,&rsquo; he put on the
    same shelf without a jacket. So, we all looked over the books again and again,
    but didn&rsquo;t take down any of the plays or novels. In fact we took down
    no books that were distinctly lettered. We looked behind books and we peeped
    into books about whose titles we were uncertain, but not those we felt sure
    about. I just bethought me of this possibility as I came up in the train
    this afternoon. I am an imbecile not to have thought of it sooner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There were other clues. One of the best was a few blades
    of grass dried and found lying on the floor behind the tapestry. These I
    felt sure were left by the murderer if he had walked across the lawn, which
    had been mowed that day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he had, and I also found a few dried grass blades
    on the soles of one of Moffatt&rsquo;s shoes in his room in New York, this
    afternoon. That was a slip on his part. They were up between the heel and
    sole. It is astonishing how long such bits remain. And then, too, if you
    please, there was his landlady wearing a wrist watch which she said Mr. Moffatt
    gave her recently. Of course, it was his wrist watch which Miss Moore heard,
    and also Sergeant Cram heard it over the telephone when he gave the information
    of Homer&rsquo;s death. And the handy man this afternoon, told me of a coat
    Moffatt had given him. That was the light overcoat&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
    a linen duster, though it was thought to be&mdash;and of course Moffatt gave
    it away because it smelled of mothballs, an unusual condition for his clothing,
    as he disliked the odor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, a made-up story won&rsquo;t stand the test. Truth
    can be knocked about and come out victor. But a lie, once it begins to be
    tracked down, must fail. Moffatt worked too hard to make his alibi perfect.
    He made it too convincing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about his alibi?&rdquo; asked Bingham, suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">At that point Cram returned, having seen his prisoner safely
    on the way to jail.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about it, Cram?&rdquo; Stone asked, &ldquo;did
    you dig it out of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, he babbles about everything as if he was proud
    of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Such distorted minds are proud of their deeds,&rdquo;  Stone
    said, sadly. &ldquo;A criminal is an exhibitionist and he admires his own
    work. What about his movie stunt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, he had it all timed to the minute. Went to the movies,
    as he said, at half past eight. Then, if you please, he makes his slight
    changes in the darkened theater, clips on his false moustache, gets up, gets
    into his long light coat, and dons his soft hat, sticking his cap in his
    pocket. Out he slips, catches a taxi, makes the nine-ten train, gets here
    at nine-thirty, to the house at nine-forty, into the Tapestry Room at once
    and waits behind the curtain watching through the slit; then he does his
    fell work in two minutes of the dark time and is out of the front door before
    the lights are on again. Doesn&rsquo;t dare risk the station again, so goes
    back to New York by trolley and taxi, and is at his club soon after the theater
    is over. Goes in and meets his friends and tells them all about the picture
    which he really saw a few nights previous! Then home and to bed, and is awakened&mdash;if
    he could sleep!&mdash;at midnight by me, calling on the telephone that his
    cousin is dead! What a brain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Devilish!&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t regret
    anything that is coming to him. Now as to Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cram, &ldquo;Moffatt fessed up to that.
    Still cocky and proud of his exploits. It seems, he heard Harrison come down
    stairs last night&mdash;long after you left the house, Mr. Bingham&mdash;and
    he sneaked down after him to see if he was after the will. Well, he was,
    and he found it, Harrison did, I mean, and so Moffatt grabbed another dagger
    and did for him. My, I&rsquo;m glad that fiend is off the earth, or as good
    as!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;if he was at the
    bottom of that foolery one other night at the dark time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, he was,&rdquo; Cram replied. &ldquo;He chuckled
    over it. Said he held his watch outside the window so you&rsquo;d hear the
    ticking and be scared. He gave a gasp, too. He had come to the house on an
    errand for Miss Moore, and grabbed his chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And another thing he did,&rdquo; Stone declared, &ldquo;was
    to suppress that letter he said he&rsquo;d mail to Pitt. I telephoned Pitt
    this afternoon, in New York and found that out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is there no end to that man&rsquo;s baseness?&rdquo; exclaimed
    Bingham. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more. Come, Diana, come out with
    me for a walk in the garden, do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; and Stone smiled, &ldquo;till you hear
    the contents of Gaylord&rsquo;s will. You&rsquo;re the most interested parties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To the surprise of none, all of Homer&rsquo;s estate was left
    to Diana, except for some generous bequests to the servants and certain charities.</p>
  <p align="left">Diana had no qualms about accepting it now, as it could not
    benefit Moffatt in any case and there were no other natural heirs.</p>
  <p align="left">So she went with Ted into the garden, happy and at peace for
    the first time in many weeks, and quite ready to accept his suggestion that
    they strive to forget the worst man they had ever known, and to think only
    loving thoughts of Gaylord, who had made possible their happy future.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Funny about the will book, Mr. Stone, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  said
    Cram. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dub enough never to think of the disguising jacket,
    but it fooled you, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; Stone said, frankly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    the oldest dodge known to history. You know, Poe&rsquo;s Purloined Letter
    was worked by that game. They hid the important letter right in plain sight,
    on the desk, so everybody overlooked it! Here, we all pawed over those books
    on the shelves and probably saw the cover on the book we were hunting a dozen
    times, but, of course, thought nothing of it. Oh, Moffatt was a clever villain,
    but he did smell of mothballs and he did walk across the freshly cut and
    dew-laden lawn and left his blades of grass behind him. Well, one can&rsquo;t
    think of everything, as the man said, when he went to the woods to chop down
    trees and forgot his axe.&rdquo;</p>
