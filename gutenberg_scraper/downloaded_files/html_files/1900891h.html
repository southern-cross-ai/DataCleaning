<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. THE TRADE ROOM IS
EMPTY</h2>

<p>Peter Sherwin stepped out on to the verandah of the trading
station and blew sharply on a whistle.</p>

<p>A native lying in the shade of a clump of coconut-palms rose at
the summons and approached. He was an old man clad in a loin-cloth
of red calico that left him naked above the waist and his legs
bare. The space between his nostrils was torn and distended, as
were the lobes of his ears.</p>

<p>"You look boat yet?" the white man asked. The native grunted.
"No come yet. I no savee what's matter."</p>

<p>"Two days from Thursday Island to Daru, two days from there to
discharge and pick up cargo, and then, say, three more days to get
here," Sherwin calculated. "She should have been here by Saturday
at the latest. That is a generous enough allowance. Yet here it is
Wednesday afternoon and no sign of her. I hope nothing's wrong." He
turned to the native. "Tell them man in village to look out good,
Bamu. Tell them sing out when they look sail."</p>

<p>"I been speak them feller," Bamu said. "I tell them might be you
give one stick tobacco to man who look boat first time."</p>

<p>Sherwin laughed. "You are an old scamp to go promising things on
my behalf, Bamu. I fancy you want to impress the village that you
are running this station. All right, I give tobacco, right enough,"
he added. "Now hurry up and see if those other fellows have
finished filling those copra bags."</p>

<p>Bamu went immediately and Sherwin took out his pipe and lit it.
Then he sprawled indolently in a canvas chair, his bare feet
resting on the verandah railing. He was about thirty-five years of
age, brown-haired, grey-eyed and tall if he eared to straighten his
back.</p>

<p>"Never been so cut out of everything before," he said to
himself. "The blooming store-room has never been so empty since it
was built. Down to the last pound of tobacco, even, and not a
jew's-harp, trade-mirror or fathom of calico on the premises. And
just when there is a rush on! Mobs of niggers floating down from
the up-river country with canoe-loads of coconuts and copra! I
never saw such a lot of good trade before! And here's me without a
blessed thing to barter with. I wonder what's delaying the 'Mokohu
V Just my luck that the supply ship should be late at this
time."</p>

<p>He laughed good-humoredly enough and stared through the
coconut-palms at the grey-blue sea and the surf pounding on the
beach. "But what's the use of grumbling?" he went on. "An isolated
New Guinea trader has to learn to cheerfully put up with things as
they come."</p>

<p>The trading station stood in the centre of a peninsula a quarter
of a mile long and not more than three feet above high-tide mark.
On one side was a waste of heaving, uneasy water unrelieved by a
single island, reef or sandbank for as far as the eye could reach.
From up over the horizon came an endless succession of mighty
rollers that moved with a certain stately grace and dignity,
seemingly undisturbed by the coarse jest of the wind lashing their
heads into spray. On reaching the shallows of the shore, each wall
of water half-halted in its turn and reared like a wilful horse.
Then, with a roar that had a note of groaning agony, they crashed
forward on their faces and rushed high up the beach in welters of
smothering foam.</p>

<p>On the other side was a mile-wide river that paralleled the
coast for some distance from its mouth before curving away inland.
It lapped the low bank gently, caressingly, the faintest echo of
the roaring, crashing ocean outside. From bank to bank it was a
stretch of sapphire-hued water, fanned by the wind into series of
following ripples that gleamed iridescent in the sparkling sunlight
and danced as though alive. From the point of the peninsula to the
opposite shore, right across the river's mouth, was an unbroken
line of breakers that indicated the whereabouts of the bar. The bar
was responsible for the smoothness of the water inside the river.
It was the doorstep that tripped the rollers seeking to force an
entrance.</p>

<p>The station consisted of a half-dozen buildings of coconut and
nipa-palm fronds thatched over a frame of bush timber. The largest
was the trader's residence&mdash;a two-roomed bungalow,
wide-verandahed and high off the ground. A copra-house and store
stood immediately at the rear, and to the left and right were the
living quarters of the natives connected with the station.</p>

<p>There were coconut-palms everywhere, the ground being streaked
and cris-crossed with their shade. In clusters, in pairs and singly
they leaned at all angles, some with their tops entwined, others
standing away by themselves as though of another caste and
disdainful. Both beaches were fringed with them, some growing so
close to the water that the tidal action had uncovered masses of
their long, brown lateral roots.</p>

<p>A string of natives carrying coconuts lashed together in pairs
across long poles filed up to the clear space in front of the
house. As they dumped their burdens on to the ground, Sherwin took
his feet off the rail and surveyed them somewhat gloomily.</p>

<p>"No good," he said. "I no got tobacco, no calico. Everything
finish. Can't buy coconut till schooner come."</p>

<p>The natives spoke amongst themselves for a few moments. Then the
one who knew the most English addressed Sherwin:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No matter. We leave-im coconut. Bye-em-bye when schooner come
we get pay."</p>

<p>"No you don't," the white man said quickly. "A hundred coconuts
left on those terms would grow to a thousand when the stores
arrived. There would be endless argument. Bamu!" The old man came
running. "Explain to these people I no want them to leave the nuts.
Tell 'em to take the lot away at once. If I start buying on credit,
I will end up by paying for about three times the quantity.
Savee?"</p>

<p>Bamu addressed the others in a series of quick, jerky sentences.
He was a coastal native and general factotum on the station. The
others belonged to an up-river village and knew little about
white-man trading. Bamu regarded himself as being immensely their
superior. He did not bother to go into any detailed explanation of
Sherwin's refusal to allow the nuts to be left, and when he
finished, he turned to his master.</p>

<p>"I tell them you sorry for them they not got tobacco to smoke,"
he said. "But you mus' wait schooner come first time. Then I tell
them go hell." He smiled broadly. "They all go now."</p>

<p>The natives had shouldered their loads of nuts and were making
off in the direction of the village.</p>

<p>"You must not talk like that, Bamu," Sherwin said, sternly.
"You'll drive all the trade away."</p>

<p>"No good them feller hum-bug round here." Bamu's tone was
stubborn.</p>

<p>"You no talk like that longa man come here for trade any more,"
Sherwin said. "I'll pitch you out on your head if you do it again.
Savee? Send you back to the village, where you'll have to live on
yams and taro and coconut. I think you are getting too accustomed
to tin-meat and other white-man tucker."</p>

<p>Bamu hung his head.</p>

<p>"All right, Taubada (Master). I speak proper next time."</p>

<p>"Now go and tell the cook-boy to hurry-up my kaikai (food). I
think he must be asleep."</p>

<p>Bamu mounted the steps on to the verandah and went to the
kitchen at the rear, and presently a young native in a white
loin-cloth appeared and intimated that luncheon was ready.</p>

<p>Sherwin rose and went to the end of the verandah, where a small
table was laid out.</p>

<p>"The last tin of meat and no milk or sugar," he said, drawing up
a chair and sitting down. "What has the cook roused up for me?"</p>

<p>It was a poor meal to set before a white man. There were boiled
yams, pink and hard-looking; sweet-potatoes roasted, and split down
the centre; some fried fish, and an unopened tin of boiled beef. A
jug of coconut water stood in the centre of the table.</p>

<p>"I would like a cup of tea immensely," Sherwin muttered. "I'm
tired of this everlasting coconut mush. And yams! And
sweet-potatoes! It's the tucker that gets us down in New Guinea.
The fever gets the blame, but if there was plenty of fresh,
white-man's food we would be ever so much better off."</p>

<p>He picked at the fish and ate a half of one of the
sweet-potatoes. The tin of meat he left unopened: there was no
telling he might be glad of it before the stores arrived. He had
been ten years in the wilds of the Gulf of Papua, and he knew that
the unexpected was more often to be expected than otherwise.</p>

<p>He was midway through the meal when a shout arose from the
direction of the village. Sherwin jumped up, and the cook-boy came
running.</p>

<p>"Sail-oh!" cried the latter. "Schooner come!"</p>

<p>Sherwin went along the verandah to where an absence of sunblinds
afforded a clear view of the sea. For a time he saw nothing but the
waste of heaving water; then he spied a tiny upright speck on the
western horizon.</p>

<p>"She is standing out on the long tack," he said to himself. "The
wind is dead ahead. She will go about presently and stand in for
the shore. Then another long tack ought to put her in a position to
run in here. Another long leg and a short one ought to do it."</p>

<p>A crowd of natives flocked up to the house, all shouting
excitedly and pointing seaward. Sherwin silenced them with a
gesture.</p>

<p>"Who been look schooner first time?" he asked. Three or four
voices answered, and a young woman stepped forward. She was dressed
in a waist-to-knee petticoat of broad-bladed grass, and about her
arms were shell bangles and ornaments of plaited cane. She stood
straight and erect with the grace that comes to bearers of
head-burdens, and her neck and arms were rounded and full.</p>

<p>"You look first, Lapa?" Sherwin asked.</p>

<p>The girl nodded, and Sherwin threw a couple of sticks of "trade"
tobacco down to her. She picked them up and wound them in her fuzzy
hair, and stepped back to the others.</p>

<p>"That girl, Lapa, got eye more better than man," said Bamu,
appearing suddenly beside the white man. "She look very quick.
'Spose man take Lapa longa eanoe when they go look for turtle,
Inns' they get plenty. She 'nother kind, that feller."</p>

<p>Sherwin sent to the village for the best canoe-men, and when
they were assembled in front of the house, he ordered them to have
their canoes ready to take the copra out to the schooner and to
bring the stores back. The south-east trade wind had been blowing
hard for over a week, and a sea had arisen on the river bar which
made it far too risky to attempt crossing with a deep-draughted
schooner like the "Mokohu." The alternative was for the vessel to
anchor off the beach, well clear of the outer line of breakers, and
transport her cargo to the shore by means of canoes. This meant a
lot of hard, rough, dangerous work, and it was a first principle
that the canoes should be in first-class order. After that
everything depended on the skill of the paddlers. Sherwin explained
to the men that on the first fall of the tide after the schooner
anchored they were to bring the canoes to the beach in front of the
station and load with a bag of copra each. At low water the surf
would be moderated to some extent and the canoes would have a
better chance of getting out with their cargo dry.</p>

<p>The natives nodded understandingly, for they were old hands at
surf-running, and these were the pick of the village. There was a
dozen of them, all young, strong men with splendid chests and big
arm-muscles. Their skin was the color of old leather that had been
unduly exposed to the elements, and their hair was teased out and
fuzzed into the semblance of a mop. Each carried a lime-pot
fashioned from a gourd. As Sherwin spoke they chewed beetlenut and
conveyed the lime to their mouths by means of pieces of flat wood
wetted with saliva.</p>

<p>When satisfied that they fully understood, Sherwin sent them
away, and then he got out his order book and ran over a list of
items for the "Mokohu" to bring on her next trip. The schooner ran
a two-monthly service from Thursday Island to the Woodlarks&mdash;a
distance of seven hundred miles when the deviations caused by ports
of call were considered. Every native along the far-flung coast of
the Gulf of Papua was familiar with her appearance, and the sight
of no other vessel caused so much delight and rejoicing. For the
"Mokohu" was the link with the outer world; she brought the traders
turkey-red calico, sheath-knives, tomahawks, fish-hooks, scented
hair-oil and a hundred other things dear to the native heart. She
supplied the isolated missionaries and traders with mails and
newspapers and distributed the gossip of the beaches. It was
necessary to order goods a trip ahead, for there was no other means
of communication during the two months that elapsed between the
schooner's visits. Sherwin closed the book at last and sat watching
the speck gradually growing bigger. The "Mokohu" was on the shore
tack now, and she had made so much headway that the full length of
her masts was visible.</p>

<p>"It will be touch-and-go whether she gets here before dark," he
said, glancing at the position of the sun. "That will mean putting
off the cargo till to morrow. I hope the wind goes down, for it
will be the very devil for the canoes in the surf."</p>

<p>Fifty or sixty natives drifted up from the village during the
afternoon and lined the fringe of the beach to watch the approach
of the schooner. As her hull became visible it was seen that her
sails were close-reefed.</p>

<p>"He find big sea," commented Bamu. "Too much wind al'ogether. I
think might-be he no come anchor here. Might-he Cap'n too much
frighten'." The same fear had been in Sherwin's heart all the
afternoon, but he had tried to put it from him. Would the
"Mokohu's" Captain think it too dangerous to anchor off the station
in the present state of the weather? he wondered. It would
certainly be taking a risk to come in close; but then an old hand
like the Captain would not be guilty of such a mistake. He was a
man who was accustomed to taking risks merely as a part of his
business, but he would not do things foolishly or unnecessarily. He
would keep well out and trust to Sherwin's canoe-men to get the
cargo ashore. He had done it before, and there was no reason why he
should not do it again. But a little something persistently told
Sherwin that the "Mokohu" had never had the bad luck to strike such
a terrific sea as was on just now. She was generally a lucky ship
in the matter of weather.</p>

<p>At sundown the schooner was only two miles away and lying along
the shore. The stiff sou'-easter howled down with increasing fury
at the approach of night, and the vessel heeled over till her lee
rail was continually awash. Sherwin watched her with straining
eyes. Was she intending to go past? He tried to see if she was
attempting to make any signal, but the quick-growing darkness
baffled him.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when the figure of a woman appeared at the
verandah steps.</p>

<p>"What it is, Lapa?" Sherwin asked.</p>

<p>The young woman pointed to the shadowy shape of the "Mokohu,"
now almost abreast of the village. "Singal!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sherwin's heart leapt, and he tried to pick out the tops of the
masts in an effort to distinguish the flag that was the agreed-upon
anchoring signal. He saw nothing of it, but even as he looked he
knew that Lapa's eyes had seen what was hidden from his, for
suddenly the "Mokohu" rounded up to the wind, her sails flapped and
slowly began to descend.</p>

<p>Then the darkness of the tropic night came down and shut out the
view.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. THE COMING OF THE SUPPLY
SHIP</h2>

<p>After tea Sherwin took a book round to the rear verandah and
settled down for a quiet read. This side of the house was sheltered
from the wind and the lamp burned steadily and without an annoying
flicker. But, somehow, he could not set his mind on the book. He
read without assimilating the meaning of the words. A strange
uneasiness was creeping over him, and twice he got up and went to
the front and stared into the wind-swept darkness.</p>

<p>With the coming of the night the wind had increased and the
pounding of the surf had swelled to a sullen roar. The
flimsily-built house swayed and creaked, and an intermittent
flapping told of a portion of the palm-thatch broken loose from its
lashings.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am worrying for nothing," he muttered once. "Morton
is too shrewd to anchor too close in. Still, it looked to me as if
she should have been a bit further out. But then it was hard to
tell in that dim light. I wish the moon was up, so that I could
see."</p>

<p>He went inside and brought out a watch to the lamp.</p>

<p>"Eight o'clock, and the moon full four days past. It will show
up in about an hour. I'll wait for it."</p>

<p>He took up the book again and turned its pages listlessly. Then
he put it down and filled his pipe. For a time he sat smoking, his
ears subconsciously trying to detect a falling off in the velocity
of the wind. He got up and began pacing the floor, his hands
clasped behind him.</p>

<p>As he turned at the corner of the verandah, Bamu appeared. The
old man's face wore a gloomy expression, and, as the white man
stopped in front of him, he opened his mouth to speak, hesitated,
and closed it again.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you lump of misery?" Sherwin asked.
Bamu coughed and stuttered.</p>

<p>"Big sea come," he said at last. "Too much big sea."</p>

<p>Sherwin knew what was in the native's mind.</p>

<p>"What you think?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>Again Bamu hesitated, shrinking back into the shadows till only
his eyes reflected the lamp-light.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no&mdash;savee," he said very slowly. "Nobody
savee."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Sherwin, buttoning his singlet at the neck and
slipping on a pair of sand-shoes. "We go."</p>

<p>He led the way along the verandah and down the steps. On the
ground both headed by mutual impulse for the village. Bamu took the
lead along the beach, Sherwin stumbling along as best he could
behind. In ten seconds both were sopping wet with the spray of the
seas thundering on the shore, and particles of flying sand struck
their faces and got into their eyes.</p>

<p>"She ought to be quite safe," Sherwin kept repeating to himself.
"She is well over two miles out. That ought to be enough." But
somehow the thought did not relieve him.</p>

<p>At the village a half-dozen fires of quick-burning sticks flared
in positions that could be clearly seen from out to sea. A number
of women sat round each fire, feeding it as the flames threatened
to die down. Twenty or thirty men were engaged in drawing some
canoes higher up on the beach, where they would be well out of
reach of the advancing seas. Others sat in little groups beating
the palms of their hands against their thighs.</p>

<p>"Them feller make one big cry," Bamu said as Sherwin sat down on
the ground beside a coconut-palm. "They very sorry."</p>

<p>"What are they sorry for?"</p>

<p>"Wind too much angry, too much wild al'ogether."</p>

<p>"And what's the wind angry for?"</p>

<p>"Wind make bad friend longa sea. Them two feller fight. Wind
fight sea; sea fight wind. Might-be schooner broke."</p>

<p>Before Sherwin could make any comment, Bamu slipped across to
where a score of old men were sitting in an outer circle of
firelight. He sat down amongst them, and presently the white man's
ears caught a note or two of a chant above the roar of the surf and
the ripping of the wind.</p>

<p>"They are not a very cheerful crowd, I must say," Sherwin
thought as he turned to the eastward to look for the first light of
the moon.</p>

<p>"Niggers are always anticipating trouble. They&mdash;" He
stopped as he realised that he himself was not free from
forebodings.</p>

<p>It was not long before the eastern sky began to lighten, and
soon a faint flush appeared which quickly strengthened. The
new-born light revealed numerous layers of nimbus clouds, and when
the upper limb of the moon appeared its light was half-hidden
behind a veil of white. Sherwin waited impatiently for the big disc
to struggle up clear, but masses of cloud continually got in the
way. It was not nearly so dark now, but the furthest the white
man's straining eyes could see were the white tops of the breakers
of the second line.</p>

<p>The natives were all crowding to the water's edge now, their
hands shielding their faces from the spray, all waiting for the
moon to win free of the entangling clouds. Stolidly, impassively,
they stared seaward, not a man or woman speaking.</p>

<p>Despite the sound of wind and sea, Sherwin was conscious of a
sensation of tense, high-strung silence, a silence that rasped the
nerves and gave distinct physical pain. Yet the scene and
circumstances were of noise and strife and struggle. The wind,
screaming a nocturne of hate, lashed and whipped the water; and the
water, roaring, tossed its head and snapped back savagely. The moon
fought against a smother of clouds determined on blotting out this
disc of light that dared to invade their domain from the regions
below the horizon. But the sensation of silence was more
penetrating, more impressive, than the conflict.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clouds fell away, and the moon shone clearly for
the full area of its surface. The natives shouted with one accord
and pointed. "He up-sail!" cried Bamu, who was standing near
Sherwin. "He try get away!"</p>

<p>In the unhampered moonlight the "Mokohu" was clearly visible
now, and Sherwin saw that she had lifted her anchor and got under
weigh. Her sails were still double-reefed and she was racing
through the water on a course parallel to the shore.</p>

<p>"No can do," said Bamu. "He go loo'ard all the time."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you croaker!" Sherwin exclaimed. "You always try to
make out things to be worse than they are."</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, he knew that the "Mokohu" would have to do
some fine sailing to get out. The wind was blowing directly on to
the shore, and that meant that the vessel would have to sail right
up to the wind. There was no favoring slant; every yard would have
to be fought for.</p>

<p>Presently the vessel swung up in a sharp curve till her nose
smelt the wind. Here she hung a moment, irresolute, uncertain, her
sails flapping, her masts splitting the wind. Then, as though in
response to sudden resolve, she heeled over and fell away on the
other tack.</p>

<p>Sherwin sighed his relief. With her reduced sail area there had
been the danger of "missing stays," in which case a lot of ground
would have been lost in getting her into position for another
attempt at going about-ship.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the "Mokohu" took another tack, and, though
she again went round safely, it was clearly evident she was a
little closer to the outer line of breakers than before.</p>

<p>"Too much go loo'ard!" said Bamu. "Bye-embye he broke
al'ogether. I too much sorry for that schooner."</p>

<p>For an hour the laboring vessel beat up and down, sloggiug
across the wind and going about in a manner that told of a skilful
hand at the wheel. But all the time her leeway took her a little
further inshore. The moon floated clear, except for an occasional
scurry of cloud streaking its face for a moment, and as the
schooner rose on top of the high waves the details of her hull and
deck were visible to the watchers on the beach. Sherwin could see
the figure of the man at the wheel and two or three others standing
on the deck near the after rigging. Sherwin watched with his hand
so tightly clenched that the nails drew blood. He had been a sailor
himself&mdash;master and owner of a small craft that poked about
the rivers and inlets of Western New Guinea&mdash;and the sight of
the schooner fighting against heavy odds stirred his sea-instincts.
He continually calculated her chances of escape, now hoping, now
despairing. Would it not be wiser if the reefs were shaken out he
asked himself. With more sail the vessel would certainly travel
faster and make less leeway. But could she carry it in such a wind?
That was the question. More sail might mean the loss of a mast; and
then there would be nothing to prevent the crippled vessel drifting
helplessly into the breakers. He decided that the Skipper, with a
full knowledge of the capabilities of his craft, had reckoned it
all out and decided to carry on as he was doing.</p>

<p>The natives had begun wailing now, the high-pitched voices of
the women piercing the roar of the surf. The fires, unattended
since the appearance of the moon, had died down to a scatter of
glowing coals. A couple of mangy dogs and a long-snouted pig or two
prospected the colder ashes for scraps of food, now and then
assisting the wailing chant of their owners with a howl or grunt.
From one of the houses came the intermittent crying of a child, and
the leaves of the coconut-palms sighed and soughed and occasionally
groaned. The spirit of mournfulness was in the very air.</p>

<p>The "Mokohu" was very near the breakers now. From the shore it
looked as if a distance of not more than two hundred yards
separated her from the white-topped outer line. In spite of all her
brave sailing, her battling, her taking advantage of every favoring
trifle, she had lost a mile of ground. It was with a sinking heart
that Sherwin realised that the vessel was doomed. He was not
thinking of his stores, or the inconvenience their loss would cause
him; such thought had not entered his head from the time he had
first seen the schooner was in danger. It distressed his sailor's
love of a ship to see a vessel destroyed. Hardly knowing what he
did, he shook his fist at the sea and hurled imprecations into the
teeth of the wind.</p>

<p>"Schooner al'ogether broke now very quick," said Bamu's voice.
The old man was sitting on the sand, his legs crossed beneath him,
his arms raised as though in benediction. "Wind too much angry, sea
too much angry. No good!" His voice assumed a droning note. "Plenty
man dead bye-em-bye. Big sea, big wind&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherwin grasped him by the hair and jerked him to his feet.</p>

<p>"Get out of this!" he roared. "Clear out&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly as a shout arose from the other natives. He
dropped Bamu and looked seaward again.</p>

<p>The "Mokohu" was falling away from the wind rapidly. Her bow was
swinging so as to point to the shore. Then, with the great seas
directly behind her, she headed straight for the breakers.</p>

<p>"The best thing he could have done!" Sherwin exclaimed. "The
ship will be smashed up, but the men might have a chance."</p>

<p>He assembled the natives and instructed them to be ready to bear
a hand when the vessel grounded. There was no hope of a canoe
living a minute in even the nearest of the breakers, but a
practised surf-swimmer might hold his own for a few minutes. He
sent to the houses for any lengths of native rope that could be
fouud at short notice, and he drove the women and youngsters back
up the beach out of the way.</p>

<p>The "Mokohu" took the first breaker of the outer line clean over
her and emerged still holding her course for the shore.</p>

<p>"Good steering!" Sherwin ejaculated. "It would have been easy
enough for her to have got beam-on and capsized."</p>

<p>A distance of about forty yards separated the lines of breakers,
and for a few seconds the schooner travelled through unbroken
water. Then she rose high on a roller that broke into foaming froth
beneath her and sent showers of spray far up the sails. She slipped
easily enough into the trough left by the departing sea, but before
she could again rise, a great breaker lifted her stern high in the
air and surged over her full length. For ten long seconds she was
completely submerged, and the watchers on the beach thought her
decks had been stove in and she would never reappear. But presently
the distressed vessel shot up, still heading straight for the
shore, one of her masts gone and her deck swept clean of dinghies,
galley, and bulwarks.</p>

<p>"He come right in now," said Bamu. "Big high-water."</p>

<p>The worst of the breakers were behind her now, but she was still
in a bad way. Instead of following one another with easy regularity
the seas were all jumbled up, a mass of whirling, rushing water.
The vessel was tossed from side to side, the seas breaking over and
across her from all directions. But she held her course in a more
or less direct manlier that called from Sherwin fresh admiration of
the skill of the steersman.</p>

<p>It was a weird sight. The bright moonlight outlined the details
of the crippled vessel struggling in the grip of the surf. The
stump of the broken mast projected about five feet above the top of
the cabin house, a mass of tangled rigging and torn canvas trailed
over the side. The starboard stays of the remaining mast were gone,
and the mast itself, deprived of half of its support, leaned
dangerously to one side. The sail had lost its whiteness through
being wetted and a dozen ragged holes showed in its grey-brown
area. At the wheel and against the broken mast were three figures.
Sherwin knew they must be lashed in their places, for no unattached
thing could have kept the deck in that welter of sea. He wondered
if these were the sole survivors. The "Mokohu" often carried
passengers&mdash;traders on business visits to other parts of the
coast; missionaries going away on furlough; government officials
visiting outlying stations. Sherwin fervently hoped there were no
passengers on this, the last, trip of the "Mokohu."</p>

<p>The schooner was bumping the bottom now. Sherwin could tell from
the sluggish way she lifted her stern to the seas. She was still
too far out for swimmers to reach her, and when the natives pressed
round him with suggestions that they should try getting a line off,
he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wait little bit," he said. "It's a very big tide and she will
come in long way yet. We wait till she is close-to."</p>

<p>He watched the vessel bumping the ground and wondered at the
strength of the hull that could survive such treatment. All the
time she forged ahead, stopping for an instant as she took the
ground, then rushing forward on top of the next sea.</p>

<p>The tide was at its top now, the water breaking over the grass
above the bare sand of the beach. In some places it splashed the
front of a village house that had been built a little nearer the
water's edge than the others. One of these, a long, narrow building
with a high, arched front facing the sea, was wet for a quarter of
its length. It was a Dubu, or meeting-house of the chiefs.</p>

<p>"She will come right ashore," Sherwin said. The schooner was
very close now and grounding heavily between seas. "The beach
slopes so steeply here that at the present state of the tide and
sea there are full five fathoms only twenty yards out."</p>

<p>He was right. For, suddenly, the wreck of the "Mokohu" perched
high on a monster wave, hung a moment as though trying to balance,
and then slipped forward and crashed on to the sand, her splintered
jib-boom striking the front of the Dubu.</p>

<p>Then, above the hissing of the receding water, came a hoarse
voice from the deck&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grab the girl!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. THE LADY PASSENGER</h2>

<p>Followed by a score of natives, Sherwin grasped some of the
broken gear trailing from the bow and scrambled on board. He made
his way aft, carefully, for the force with which the vessel had
struck the beach had buckled the deck and burst the seams. He clung
to the stump of the mainmast till a surging sea swept past and
receded. Then he approached the wheel.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Morton?" he asked as a man untied himself from the
spokes.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the answer. "Get the girl ashore, will you? She is
about done." He pointed to the steering-gear box behind the
wheel.</p>

<p>Lashed to one of the side staunchions that held the box in
position was a white woman. Her hair was all adrift and hanging
sodden about her shoulders. Her dress was torn open at the neck and
breast, and her face was bloodlessly white. Sherwin could see she
was young, a mere girl. She hung in her lashings in that limpless
fashion that tells of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>There was a man fastened to the other side of the box, but
Sherwin did not stop to more than glance at him. He called the
natives and, when a dozen of them came running, he and Morton
tenderly unlashed the girl. A sea swept over the after end of the
wreck while they were at it, and they crouched and held on till it
passed. Then they placed the limp form of the girl in the arms of
four natives and shepherded them along the deck to the bow. Here,
Sherwin found a piece of rope and made a bo'sun's-chair and the
girl was carefully lowered to the beach.</p>

<p>"You look after her," said Morton. "I will take a couple of
these niggers and fetch the mate." He went aft again, three natives
at his heels. Sherwin slipped over the side and went up the beach
to where the girl was being carried.</p>

<p>As the natives laid their burden down, he found Bamu near him.
"Here," he said, "you run longa house and bring bottle brandy from
box under my bed. You savee that one?
Brandy&mdash;flrewater&mdash;mura-mura?" Bamu's eyes lit up with
understanding. "I savee," he said, making off. "I savee that one
mura-mura long time."</p>

<p>A crowd of women flocked round the girl lying on the sand. One
brought a piece of wood and placed it under her head for a pillow.
Others stroked her hair and touched her forehead curiously. Sherwin
knelt down and felt her heart.</p>

<p>"Only fainted, I think," he said to himself. "Doesn't look like
a case of partial drowning." He slipped his arm behind her
shoulders, half-raised her and then bent her body forward so that
her head hung between her knees. In a few minutes Bantu arrived
with the brandy ready opened for use. Sherwin lifted the girl's
head and forced a few drops of the spirit between her lips.
Presently her eyes opened, looked round wonderingly for a moment,
and closed again.</p>

<p>"Only a faint." Sherwin's tone was of distinct relief. "Here,
Lapa, Wandi, Masi! You fellers are about the cleanest women in the
village. You go longa this white misi to my house." He detailed
four men to act as carriers and saw to it that they picked the girl
up gently and carefully.</p>

<p>As they started off, Captain Morton, half-supporting the mate,
came up.</p>

<p>"How is she?" were his first words.</p>

<p>"Nothing much the matter with her," Sherwin answered. "Merely a
faint. The women will put her to bed straight away."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Morton. "The mate here got a crack on the
head from a block, or something, when the mast went. He's still a
bit groggy on his feet."</p>

<p>"Come to the house," Sherwin invited, taking the other arm of
the stumbling mate. "A stiff nip of brandy will do him
good&mdash;and you, too, I daresay."</p>

<p>Neither spoke again till they were a hundred yards along the
beach. Then Sherwin asked hesitatingly and slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nobody else&mdash;on board?"</p>

<p>The Captain shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>"The crew?"</p>

<p>There was a little silence. Then Morton said slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They were sheltering high up the mainmast rigging&mdash;" His
voice was so low that the trader strained his ears to hear above
the roar of the surf. "They were good boys, too&mdash;Hula and
Mana-Mana natives."</p>

<p>"Only three survivors!" Sherwin exclaimed on the intake of his
breath. Then he was silent. He had a score of questions to
ask&mdash;why had the captain lifted anchor instead of trying to
ride out the wind? What had delayed him at Thursday Island so that
he was so late in arriving? Who was the passenger, and whither was
she bound? But he could not ask the man who had just lost his ship
and his crew just then.</p>

<p>They caught up to the men carrying the girl as they reached the
house. Sherwin called to one of the crowd of natives who had
followed them from the village out of curiosity, to take his place
in helping the mate. Then he took the girl from her bearers and
carried her up the steps to his bed in the smaller of the two
rooms. The cook-boy brought a lamp and Sherwin sent him to the
store-room to see if there was a trade dress or anything that would
serve as feminine attire. The boy returned and shook his head. "No
find nothing," he said. "Store empty proper."</p>

<p>"This is a hard-up camp right enough," Sherwin said, looking
round the room. The place was decorated with all kinds of native
weapons and ornaments. There were curiously carved dancing shields
and face-masks, bundles of ceremonial arrows bone-and stone-tipped,
wicker baskets and "dilly-bags," strings of small cowrie shells,
woven body-belts. His eye fell on a finely plaited mat that was as
supple as a cloak.</p>

<p>He pulled it down and handed it to the women who had followed
him into the room.</p>

<p>"You feller put white misi to bed and put this round her. Savee?
Look out you don't hurt her. Lapa, you got plenty savee, you show
them other woman. Hang white misi's clothes in the wind so they dry
quick."</p>

<p>Lapa nodded understandingly, and Sherwin went out and shut the
door. Morton and the mate were on the verandah, the latter gazing
about half-dazedly. Sherwin placed him in a canvas chair and called
to the cook-boy to bring the brandy and glasses and a light. Bamu
put the bottle of brandy on the table&mdash;he had been guarding it
religiously all the time&mdash;and when the cook-boy brought a
hurricane lamp, his master poured out a third of a glass and made
the mate drink it. Then Morton had some.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't offer you anything to smoke," Sherwin said as the
Captain sat down. "I'm cut right out of all white-man stuff. There
is only 'trade' tobacco, and you won't care about that."</p>

<p>"I don't care about smoking just now," Morton said gloomily.
Sherwin cut up some of the rank, black tobacco and rammed it into
his pipe. He heard the women moving about inside the house, and he
wondered how they were getting on. The mate lay back in his chair
with his eyes half-closed, and Morton sat with his hands clasped in
front of him, staring iuto the darkness of the night. A number of
natives crouched about the front of the house, talking softly. From
portions he knew of their language. Sherwin knew they were
discussing the wrecking of the "Mokohu."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Sherwin exclaimed presently. "I quite forgot! I'll
root out some pyjamas and things for you two to change into." He
made as though to rise, but the Captain restrained him.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he said, somewhat gruffly, "and so is the mate.
A drop of salt water won't hurt either of us. I am nearly dry
anyway." He reached for the bottle. "I hope you don't mind?"</p>

<p>"Carry on," the trader said heartily. "I'll get you a change of
clothes as soon as the women are finished with the girl and I can
go into my room."</p>

<p>The brandy was not long in taking effect upon the mate, for soon
his eyes opened full and lie began to talk.</p>

<p>"Came a proper buster, eh?" he said in a pleasant voice. "How's
Miss Russell?"</p>

<p>Sherwin guessed he was referring to the passenger and he
answered. "Quite unhurt," he said. "How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Stiff and sore and somewhat stupid," the other said with a
ghost of a laugh. "I have not quite got the hang of things yet. Is
that you, Skipper?" he asked, peering at the man opposite him.</p>

<p>"Yes," Morton said shortly.</p>

<p>"We've had a bit of bad luck, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The Captain's tone was very abrupt. "Can anything be done
towards getting the schooner off again?"</p>

<p>It was Sherwin who answered this time. He saw that the Captain
was not in a frame of mind for discussing anything connected with
the loss of the "Mokohu"; the fate of his vessel was preying
heavily upon him. "I am afraid not," he said gently. "She is right
up in the village. She came ashore at the very top of the biggest
spring tide we've had for six months or more, and it will be a long
time before the water will rise to that height again. It's a good
thing it was such a high tide, as a matter of fact; had it been an
ordinary high-water, you would have stuck fast in the breakers and
been smashed to bits in no time. We could see you bumping as it
was." Lapa appeared as he finished speaking.</p>

<p>"Misi all right now," she said, and Sherwin rose at once.</p>

<p>"I will get you fellows some dry clothes," he said, and went
into the house.</p>

<p>The girl was lying straight out in the bed, the blankets drawn
close round her neck, and her hair was brought round to the front
and spread over the coverlet. Sherwin, tip-toeing across the room
to where a medley of clothes lay in a corner, stopped a moment to
look at her. The bed stood in the centre of the room, and the
mosquito-net was drawn back on one side. Sherwin stepped past the
native women sitting on the floor and bent over the girl who had
come ashore in such a ruthless fashion. It was evident she was
breathing easily and regularly. A tinge of color showed in her
cheeks. Sherwin laid his hand on her forehead to feel if she had a
temperature, and the girl at once opened her eyes. She looked round
in a startled fashion at the curios on the walls and the women on
the floor. Then she suddenly sat upright, the blankets falling away
and revealing the mat wrapped round her shoulders.</p>

<p>Sherwin pressed her gently back.</p>

<p>"You are all right," he said. "Go to sleep again. You are in
safe hands."</p>

<p>"A white man," she whispered, turning her head so as to look at
him. "I thought&mdash;" She stopped and drew her hand across her
brow. Sherwin cursed himself for not haviug removed or covered the
masks and things from the room; at first glance the girl would
naturally think she had been captured by savages, or something of
the sort, be reflected.</p>

<p>"There was such a big sea," the girl went on. "And a crash! I
don't seem to remember any more. And I am so tired."</p>

<p>"Go to sleep again," Sherwin repeated. "These women will look
after you. You are in safe hands and don't need to worry."</p>

<p>She looked at him very steadily, an expression that told of her
efforts to get matters straightened out in her mind, on her
face.</p>

<p>"Is Har&mdash;Mr. Wilson, I mean&mdash;all right?" she asked.
Despite the weakness of her voice, Sherwin detected a note of
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The mate of the 'Mokohu,' you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he is quite safe and sound."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and soon was fast asleep. Sherwin watched
her for awhile and then whispered instructions to the women to give
Miss Russell a drink should she awaken. Then he found a couple of
suits of pyjamas and returned to the men on the verandah.</p>

<p>"She is doing well," he said, in answer to a question by the
mate. "She should be quite all right by morning."</p>

<p>Morton and Wilson went into the other room and changed their
clothes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I can't offer you anything to eat," Sherwin said
when they returned. "I'm right out of everything. Been living on
native tucker for the last week."</p>

<p>"Lend me a couple of niggers," Captain Morton said, "and I'll go
off to the schooner for some of the cabin stores. The tide is
falling now, and it won't be very difficult to get the things."</p>

<p>Sherwin called the cook-boy to fetch Bamu and one or two others,
and when they arrived he ordered them to accompany Morton.</p>

<p>"Better bring some of Miss Russell's things, too," Wilson
called, as the Captain descended the steps. "She will want them in
the morning."</p>

<p>"I was not going to forget that," Morton said, and swung through
the compound, and off along the beach.</p>

<p>"The poor old chap is cut up over this business," Wilson said.
"Although he is making a brave attempt to hide it, I know he is
very worried. You see, it's this way: We were ready to sail from
Thursday Island when a wire came from Cooktown asking could we wait
for the next steamer from south, as there was a passenger very
anxious to get over to Port Moresby, and the 'Mokohu' would be the
only vessel making the passage for over a month. The Skipper did
not like losing the neaps, for the spring tides usually mean high
winds at this time of the year. He did not want to wait and run the
risk of bad weather in the Gulf of Papua, but when he reflected
that a stranger, and a lady at that, would have a weary time
awaiting the next vessel in Thursday Island, he decided to chance
it."</p>

<p>"Very good of him," Sherwin commented.</p>

<p>"We got away the morning after the steamer arrived," Wilson went
on, "and all was well till we began to approach the New Guinea
coast. Then the sou'-easter came down wallop. Miss Russell got a
dreadful doing with sea-sickness, and for two days did not eat
anything. I felt very sorry for her, I can tell you." He stopped
and gazed straight ahead for a few moments. The lamp was beside
him, and it outlined his features clearly. Sherwin saw that he was
a man of about his own age, strongly built, firm-mouthed and
clear-complexioned. He saw, also, that his skin was unyellowed by
fever and that his cheeks were rounded and full. Evidently Wilson
was a stranger to fevers and island hardships, and Sherwin wondered
where Morton had picked him up. There was something about this
stranger that told of an easy, comfortable life.</p>

<p>"We did not stay long at Daru," Wilson said presently, "and
bustled on here as quickly as possible. There was a thumping sea
on, I can tell you, and the Skipper knew he was taking a risk in
anchoring here at all. But he knew you would be short of stores and
trade goods, so he decided to lie off at anchor and see what the
surf was like in the morning. He is a good old chap, MGrton; hates
to see anybody put to inconvenience."</p>

<p>"He has always been like that," Sherwin put in. "Always ready to
go to any amount of trouble on somebody else's behalf."</p>

<p>"So we let go in forty fathoms about three miles out. Everything
would have been all right, but when the tide got into full swing,
the wind, bad enough before, came down a howler. The Skipper lay
down on the deck beside the anchor-windlass to listen for any
snatching."</p>

<p>"She should not have dragged there," the trader said. "It's all
good holding ground."</p>

<p>"She did not drag," Wilson said. "We had two anchors down and
they held the ground all right. But suddenly the seas came too big
for us, and first one cable parted, then the other. There was
nothing for it then but to up sail and try and beat out. We lost a
good deal of ground before the canvas was hoisted, and after the
first tack it was evident that the leeway would beat us. Not enough
sail, you know, and it was impossible to give her more&mdash;she
would never have carried it. We slogged on, tack for tack, sailing
across the wind, and every sea hitting us nearly abeam and adding
to the leeway."</p>

<p>"Then Captain Morton, seeing the schooner would strike the surf
beam-on, decided to run her ashore bow first, and so save some of
the lives on board, even if the vessel was lost?"</p>

<p>Wilson nodded. "The niggers climbed into the mainmast rigging
and we three Europeans lashed ourselves to the steering gear. The
rest you know better than I do."</p>

<p>Sherwin related how he and the natives had watched the "Mokohu"
come through the surf and strike the beach. He told of the loss of
the mast and the crew and the saving of Miss Russell. Wilson's face
lengthened towards the end.</p>

<p>"And the 'Mokohu' is a complete wreck, you say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No hope of salving her. Her back is broken for a
certainty."</p>

<p>"Then I am completely and utterly broke," Wilson said, but not
very despondently. "I am, or was, part owner of her. I put all I
had in the world into her."</p>

<p>"Part-owner!" exclaimed the trader.</p>

<p>"I've been dodging round about Thursday Island for the last
three or four months looking for a suitable investment for a few
hundred pounds I had left to me. The tropics have always had a
fascination for me, you know. I investigated the pearliug industry,
trepang-fishing, and one or two other things in Torres Strait, but
they all needed more capital than I could raise. Then the 'Mokohu'
came in from Moresby, and the Skipper let it drop that he was
looking for a working partner. I had had a bit of small-boat
experience round about Sydney, and the result of a couple of
conversations with Morton was that I invested my money and signed
on as mate. There was a mortgage on the 'Mokohu,' which my ready
cash cleared off, and we sailed out of Thursday Island's harbor in
a ship completely our own. Rotten luck to lose her so soon, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"A bit stiff," the trader agreed. "And who is Miss Russell?"</p>

<p>Wilson's face lit up at once.</p>

<p>"She is the sister of a chap who has a
plantation&mdash;coconuts, or rubber or something&mdash;away the
other side of Port Moresby. She came up from Sydney to visit him.
And, my word, she's a great girl!" he added enthusiastically. "If
you had seen the way she stood the thumping of the seas and refused
to show any fear! And she's that gentle and nice and
sweet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly as Captain Morton, followed by a number of
natives carrying bundles and packages, appeared at the steps.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE SEA GOES DOWN</h2>

<p>Some time during the night the wind began to ease up. At
daylight it was blowing no more than a good sailing breeze. The sun
rose bright and clear in a sky devoid of clouds, and the
half-circle of sea horizon was regular and sharply defined. The
thunder of the surf was distant and lessened, for the tide was low
and the nearest breakers a quarter of a mile from the shore.</p>

<p>Morton and Wilson had retired immediately after a meal of the
cabin stores. They lay upon stretchers on the verandah, sleeping
the sleep of exhaustion, relaxation after their strenuous time in
the surf falling heavily upon them. Sherwin had not gone to bed at
all. Right through the night he had lain on a mat outside the door
of the bedroom, ready in case Miss Russell should awaken and want
anything. But the girl did not stir, and at daylight Lapa reported
she was still asleep.</p>

<p>"Weather's changed for the better," Sherwin said, cheerily, as
the others got up. "It's going to be fine for awhile."</p>

<p>"The change is a few hours too late," Morton said gloomily. "If
it had kept on blowing for another month it would not have affected
me."</p>

<p>Sherwin was shocked at the appearance of the man. On his last
trip from Thursday Island Morton had been a breezy, jovial kind of
man, always ready with a smile and a bright remark. His good nature
was a byword along the coast, and the cheerfulness with which he
would go out of his way to assist another made him the friend of
trader, missionaries, natives and all.</p>

<p>But now his face was drawn and thin, and the light gone from his
eyes. He seemed ten years older, and the tone of his voice was
harsh and aged. A flood of pity welled up in Sherwin's breast as he
looked at him. He produced the brandy and poured out a quarter of a
glass.</p>

<p>"Take this," he said. "It will cheer you up. You are not utterly
ruined, you know; there's the insurance."</p>

<p>Morton took the glass with shaky fingers and drank it off.</p>

<p>"I can't put in a claim," he said. "I had no right to anchor so
close to a lee shore. No insurance company will take risks like
that. And, besides, what's insurance? What's the money compared to
the 'Mokohu?'&mdash;the vessel I had built to my own design, the
thing I loved like a child? There was not a better or stauncher
craft on the coast, not one. I knew her inside out, and all her
little tricks and ways." He sat down on the stretcher and wrung his
hands. "And now she's gone! And with her the best native crew ever
a man had!"</p>

<p>Sherwin looking up, happened to meet Wilson's eyes. Both looked
away quickly, embarrassed; the Captain's grief affecting them very
deeply. To create a diversion the trader called his cook-boy to
hurry the breakfast, and when the boy replied that it was all ready
and waiting, the three men got up and went to the table at the end
of the verandah.</p>

<p>There was not much conversation during the meal. Nobody felt
inclined for talk, and beyond Sherwin remarking that Miss Russell
had slept well, they were for the most part silent.</p>

<p>They were almost finished when Lapa came out of the bedroom and
approached.</p>

<p>"Eye belong misi come open," she said.</p>

<p>"She want to get up?" Sherwin asked, and when Lapa nodded her
tousled head, he went on:&mdash;"You feller help misi dress. Tell
her I will send cookie with some kai-kai when she ready. Then you
and them other woman go longa kitchen and get your breakfasts."</p>

<p>Morton rose as Lapa vanished into the room. "Come on, Wilson,"
he said. "We will go and have a look at the schooner and see what
can be done about getting the cargo out of her. I hope, for your
sake, Sherwin, that your goods are not completely ruined," he
added, with a touch of his old self in his tone.</p>

<p>Sherwin accompanied them to the steps. "I'll get all the village
to work on her, directly," he said. "I'll just see that Miss
Russell is all right and then come along."</p>

<p>On the ground, Wilson turned and looked up at the trader
standing on the verandah.</p>

<p>"You might tell her I was asking for her, will you?" he said,
his eyes shining. "I&mdash;" he stopped abruptly and, turning,
strode after Morton.</p>

<p>Sherwin stood watching the two pyjama-clad figures wind through
the coconuts and turn on to the beach.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is an understanding, or something approaching
to it, between the mate and the passenger," he said to himself,
with a laugh. "They haven't lost much time seeing they've only
known each other a few days." He leaned over the railing and
watched the lines of white-topped breakers and the scurry of the
receding seas frothing and bubbling back over the sand. The sea was
still heaving and rolling, the succession of waves still endless.
But now it moved with an easy regularity that had little more than
a hint of the angry chaos of yesterday. Beyond the breakers was a
broad expanse of blue, flecked by a dash of white as the wind took
the top off an occasional roller. The beach gleamed grey-white in
the brightness of the early-morning light, a brown line high up on
the sand marking where the tide had been during the night. A flock
of sea-birds, flying low, swooped down on small fish in the
backwash, and away to the westward a score of frigate-birds hung
motionless against a background of clear sky.</p>

<p>It was the sort of morning that makes a healthy man want to
shout his joy at being alive; when the beauty of blending color and
the tang of salt air intoxicates like wine. But the man leaning
over the verandah-rail was looking without seeing. It had suddenly
occurred to him that there was something wanting in his life. It
was a vague, indefinite kind of want, and it worried him that he
could not clearly make out what it was. Peter Sherwin was a man of
action, and as such, accustomed to knowing exactly what he wanted,
and taking the most direct means of going after it. Ten years of
trading in the Gulf of Papua; of going long canoe journeys up
little frequented rivers in search of sandalwood or native "trade,"
such as dog's teeth, toyya shells, beetlenut and skins for
drum-making; wading through miles of black, mangrove mud amongst
the delta villages of the Purari; of bartering with strange chiefs
who played seeming fair in the daytime and planned to get their
copra and vine-rubber back at night; all this builds up a man's
self-reliance and makes his actions, thoughts and desires
purposeful and decisive. But for once Peter Sherwin was floundering
in the restless sea of not knowing what he wanted.</p>

<p>A light step and a voice interrupted his train of thought.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for sleeping in so long."</p>

<p>He turned to find Miss Russell beside him. She was dressed in a
blouse and skirt of creamy white, and her hair was coiled back upon
her head. Sherwin wondered why he had not noticed before that her
hair was of that particular shade of brown streaked with bronze
that he had always admired in colored pictures of girls in
magazines.</p>

<p>"I never slept so soundly before," the girl went on. "I remember
you speaking to me when I awoke in the room, but from then on I
might have been dead for all I remember."</p>

<p>Sherwin bowed and smiled. "If you will only add that you are
hungry I will know you are perfectly recovered," he said.</p>

<p>"And so I am," she laughed, and the man noticed how her eyes
sparkled. "I believe it was hunger that awakened me."</p>

<p>Sherwin led the way to the table, and the cook-boy set out a
meal of preserved meat, cabin biscuits; and black coffee.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it's all I can offer you for the present," Sherwin
said, as the girl sat down and began. "Even this is stuff Captain
Morton brought from the cabin of the 'Mokohu.' I have run right out
of everything."</p>

<p>Miss Russell put down her knife and fork.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry for poor Captain Morton," she said slowly. "It
was so good of him to wait for me at Thursday Island&mdash;and then
to have this happen! I feel I am to blame; had he not waited for me
the 'Mokohu' would not have missed the fine weather." She sat with
her hands on the table, an expression of infinite sorrow in her
eyes. "I&mdash;I did not mean to be any trouble."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't," Sherwin said cheerfully. "And you are no
more to blame for the loss of the 'Mokohu' than I am. Please don't
talk about such a thing. Now go on and eat your breakfast."</p>

<p>She resumed her meal at that, and for a little while there was
silence. Sitting right opposite her Sherwin took advantage of the
occasion to examine her more particularly. Her face was finely
moulded and attractive, he decided, and there was an expression of
firmness that pleased him. Her head and neck were well poised and
her shoulders had just the right angle of slope. Her hands were
long and thin and sensitive-looking, and while her whole appearance
was of daintiness there was an entire absence of anything to
suggest the spoilt and petted butterfly. A sense of shame suddenly
came over Sherwin as he realised he had been criticising her as he
would have a horse offered for sale.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to introduce myself," he said presently. "My
name is Peter Sherwin, and this is my trading station at the mouth
of the Wallala River."</p>

<p>The girl held out her hand. "My name is Ellen Russell, of
Sydney, on my way to my brother's place at Hula, wherever that is."
Sherwin took her hand and shook it. "It sounds awfully formal,
doesn't it?" the girl asked with a little laugh, the worried and
sorrowful lines gone from her face. Sherwin was immensely relieved
to hear that laugh; a few moments before he had noticed a lump
rising in her throat and her eyes begin to redden
suspiciously&mdash;and he would have been hard put to it to know
what to do with a weeping woman.</p>

<p>"Are the others not up yet?" she asked, after awhile.</p>

<p>"Morton and Wilson? Oh, yes; they are at the schooner, now. We
are going to start getting the cargo out of her presently."</p>

<p>Ellen jumped up. "May I come with you, Mr. Sherwin? I might be
of some use, you know."</p>

<p>"Do you feel strong enough?" he asked doubtingly. "I think you
should lie down and rest."</p>

<p>But the girl would not hear of such a thing. "I am not going to
loaf about while there is work to be done," she exclaimed. "Perhaps
I could count the cases, or something. I know I will be
useful&mdash;and I do so want to help," she added almost
pathetically.</p>

<p>"Come on then," Sherwin said, and picked up an umbrella. "Take
this to keep the sun off you."</p>

<p>He helped her down the steps, for she was stiff and sore from
the knocking about she had received.</p>

<p>"I've got a hundred questions to ask you," she said as they went
through the coconuts to the beach. "This place seems full of
interest. There are those strange, silent women who waited on me
all through the night and helped me to dress this morning. T want
to find out how they live and what they do. They are savages,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, more or less. Just about here the natives are fairly tame,
but in some of the places I visit at times they are apt to be
tricky. You will see the village where those women live in a few
moments. The 'Mokohu' is ashore right in front of the houses."</p>

<p>She showed herself very bright and eager as they went along the
beach, and she laughed heartily at the antics of a tiny, grey crab
that dodged about her feet. She stopped to look at the thousands of
red-backed soldier-crabs marching and wheeling with military-like
precision on the wet sand, and she expressed wonderment and delight
when her companion informed her they always kept their respective
positions, and when he pointed out the officers and other leaders.
She picked up pieces of broken coral that had been swept up from
the reefs away to the westward, and tiny shells patterned in a
hundred designs.</p>

<p>Sherwin glanced at her from time to time. There was something
strange in the interest she was taking at such a time, he thought.
Then it occurred to him that she was endeavoring to keep her mind
off the disaster to the "Mokohu;" that she was trying to bear up
and be brave. And, somehow, the thought pleased him.</p>

<p>They found the schooner high and dry, fully fifty yards from the
nearest of the seas. She was sitting upright in the sand, the
violence of the impact having forced her to make a bed for herself.
In the full light of day she looked a pitiful wreck. Her sides were
bulged and bent, the ends of splintered planks protruding here and
there. There was no vestige of bulwarks, cookhouse or deckgear of
any sort excepting the wheel. Even the anchor-windlass was gone as
completely as though it had never existed.</p>

<p>Morton and Wilson hailed Sherwin and the girl from the deck.</p>

<p>"Collect those niggers, will you, Sherwin?" the Captain said.
"We'll get to work straight away while the tide is right out. The
cargo is more or less undamaged, thank goodness."</p>

<p>"He's been like that ever since I knew him," the trader said to
the girl. "He is cut to the heart about the loss of his
vessel&mdash;yet he is glad the property of other people entrusted
to his care is safe. The man is pure gold all through."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," whispered Ellen with a half-sob. "Ile is
a perfect dear. It only makes it harder for me when I think&mdash;"
She broke off and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Sherwin, attempting to comfort her. "Be brave! You
must not give way!"</p>

<p>Morton jumped down from tue deck and came running, Wilson close
behind.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Miss?" the Skipper asked. "Don't grieve,
everything will be all right." He patted her head and tried to take
her hand. "Don't worry, my dear. Keeping cheerful is the main thing
in life."</p>

<p>Ellen looked up at him, her eyes streaming.</p>

<p>"If you had not waited for me this would not have happened," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>Morton laughed&mdash;a great hearty laugh alive with good
humor.</p>

<p>"Something worse might have happened," he said. "Why, we might
have all been drowned! Who can tell what wouldn't have happened if
something else hadn't happened? Dry your eyes, my dear, and let us
see you smile."</p>

<p>Ellen took the Captain's large red fist in her hand and squeezed
it tightly. Then she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him
on the cheek.</p>

<p>"You are a dear, a perfect dear!" she cried, her eyes shining
again.</p>

<p>Morton disengaged her arms gently. "Nonsense," he said with a
mock roughness. "Now run along with Sherwin to the village and help
him to rustle up a mob of hard-working niggers&mdash;if there are
such things."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. ELLEN BEARS A HAND</h2>

<p>The village consisted of about eighty houses built mainly in one
long row facing the sea. Here and there one straggled a bit out of
line, and a couple more were distinguished by having been built at
the rear of the others. Each was constructed of palm-thatch, high
off the ground, with a crazy-looking ladder leading up to a tiny
porch or verandah.</p>

<p>A score of naked youngsters of both sexes followed Sherwin and
Ellen into the village, their eyes big with wonder and curiosity at
the sight of this strange white woman who had come out of the sea.
Not one was bold enough to get in front of her, but they all
crowded up behind her as near as possible. Once or twice Ellen felt
a timid hand touch her dress, but she did not look round, knowing
they would at once scamper in fear.</p>

<p>"Poor little creatures!" she said. "They don't know what to make
of me, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose they do," Sherwin laughed. "Which is not very
remarkable considering you are the first white woman they have ever
seen. Here come the chiefs to do you homage, now."</p>

<p>They were in the centre of the village by this time and three
old men were approaching from the direction of the Dubu, or
meeting-house. They stopped in front of the two whites and
distorted their features into what were evidently meant to be
smiles of greeting. Each wore a wisp of calico about his middle and
circlets of woven grass on his legs and arms. They wore no nose
ornaments, but from their ears hung pendants of small shells.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Taubada (Master)," said one. "Tomorrow."</p>

<p>Sherwin laughed and shook the old fellow's hand.</p>

<p>"That is the only English word he knows," he explained. "He
thinks it means 'good-day' or something similar. He works it off on
me quite proudly every time we meet."</p>

<p>"He wants to be friendly," Ellen murmured. "Shall I shake hands
with him, too?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you wish."</p>

<p>"I do wish," she said, and took the hand of each chief in turn.
"I believe they are quite pleased with themselves," she added as
the men nodded and grunted approvingly.</p>

<p>In a strange mixture of pidgin-English and native words Sherwin
told the chiefs that people were wanted at once to work at the
schooner. They waved their hands, uttured a guttural sentence or
two and went away.</p>

<p>"They will have the whole village at the wreck in a few
minutes," Sherwin said. "While we are waiting, let me show you the
houses and how the niggers live."</p>

<p>They went along the palm-shaded street, the crowd of curious
youngsters still at their heels. On the verandahs of the houses
women were sitting cross-legged weaving grass baskets or threading
necklaces of shells and yellow beans. Others squatted on the ground
husking coconuts and splitting the hard shells open to get at the
pure white flesh within. All wore the waist-to-knee grass petticoat
of their race, and about their necks and arms were shell and bone
ornaments. In the fuzzy hair of some of the younger women and girls
were pink convolvulus flowers and blood-red leaves of the spiral
croton.</p>

<p>As they laughed and talked amongst themselves, Ellen remarked
that their teeth were almost jet black.</p>

<p>"Chewing beetlenut does that," Sherwin explained. "The lime they
mix with the nut eats away the enamel."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" Ellen exclaimed. "It quite spoils their
appearance."</p>

<p>"They don't think so. It's all a matter of taste. Black teeth
are regarded amongst these natives as an aid to beauty."</p>

<p>He took her into one or two of the houses, a dozen willing black
hands helping her up the shaky ladders and through the narrow
openings in the thatch that answered as doorways. The houses were
windowless and the interiors dark and dismal.</p>

<p>"What a dreadfully musty smell!" Ellen said, as she stood in the
centre of a house that was evidently the living place of pigs, dogs
and humans combined. "It almost makes me sick."</p>

<p>Sherwin lit a match and held it over his head.</p>

<p>"You would hardly believe the medley of stuff they collect in
their houses," he said, taking the match first to one corner, then
to another. "And there is absolutely no ventilation."</p>

<p>In one corner was a heap of half-dried coconut, some of it
mouldy and crumbling, some of it smoke-colored and brown. Suspended
by a stick over a small fire that burnt on a heap of sand in the
centre of the floor were a number of pieces of fish that were none
too fresh, and piled against the wall were heaps of yams and
sweet-potatoes, just as they had been dumped out of the women's
baskets, and with the earth still clinging to them. From the
rafters hung fishing nets with weights of cowrie shells and floats
of a light, almost pithy, wood sometimes used for canoe-making.
Beside the doorway stood a bundle of arrows and a pair of heavy
bows with strings of cane that had been split fine and closely
woven. Sherwin took the arrows into the better light of the porch
and explained their uses to Ellen.</p>

<p>He told how the long, willowy, undecorated ones were used for
hunting wallabies and other game, and he showed her the elaborately
carved ceremonial weapons. Some of these latter were covered for
half their length with series after series of mitre-like affairs
not unlike chess-men, here and there interspersed with sharp prongs
that lay close to the shaft and sloped away from the point.</p>

<p>"Different arrows for different uses," he said. "The man-killing
one is not used in hunting, and the ceremonial weapon is used in
neither."</p>

<p>"But why do they go to such trouble'?" Ellen asked, fingering a
long carved arrow with a venomous-looking point of cassowary bone.
"Look at this one. It is only used for killing men, you say. Why is
it carved so elaborately? The plain arrow that is used for hunting
could kill a man as well as a wallaby."</p>

<p>Sherwin laughed. "I have often thought the same thing. But
natives have their own ideas on such matters. If a man makes up his
mind to kill a certain individual, he will carefully and at great
pains make an arrow for the purpose, and for that purpose alone. No
other one must be used. It is quite useless trying to find out the
reason of these things. There are some things at the back of the
native mind that no white will ever learn."</p>

<p>A crowd of natives was flocking through the coconuts to the
schooner as the man and girl climbed down the ladder to the
ground.</p>

<p>"The chiefs have not lost any time," said Sherwin. "We had
better leave inspecting the rest of the village till another
time."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I want to see the inside of any more houses,"
Ellen said as they reached the beach. "They smell so. What would
happen if an epidemic broke out? The poor things would die like
flies."</p>

<p>Sherwin became very grave all at once. "That's a thing I am very
frightened of. The natives have no power of resistance when it
comes to sickness; they just lie down and die. They are fatalists
in a way, and firmly believe that no efforts of theirs will save
them once they are stricken."</p>

<p>"The poor things! Could not precautions be taken? Ventilation,
sanitation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't talk about it," the man interrupted. "I am rather
touchy on the subject of epidemics just now, for, as a matter of
fact, there has been an outbreak of rubeola&mdash;German measles,
you know&mdash;in some of the villages to the eastward,
and&mdash;well, I've seen a disease sweep a village before, and I
don't want to see it again."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a few yards, then she looked up at the
man by her side and said softly:</p>

<p>"You are not what my idea of a trader was like. I believe you
take a deep interest in the welfare of your natives."</p>

<p>"Why should I not?" Sherwin asked quickly. "These people provide
me with my means of making a living. I want to see them strong and
healthy, otherwise they could not work and make copra to sell
me."</p>

<p>"That's not the only reason," said the girl. "And I am so
glad."</p>

<p>They were at the wreck now and there was no more time for
uninterrupted conversation. Work had already begun, and the natives
swarmed over the stranded vessel. The hatch-covers were off, and
bales and bundles and cases were being passed over the side by
means of ropes and slings. Sherwin scrambled on board and went to
where Morton and Wilson were standing on the cargo directing the
work.</p>

<p>"I think you had better send the stuff to my storeroom," he
suggested. "If it is left on the beach the temptation might be too
much for the villagers. When the store is full, we can stack a lot
under the living house."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Morton said. "I thought of that, but did not like to
suggest it. Will you attend to the storing while we get the stuff
out?"</p>

<p>"Right. Miss Russell has volunteered to act as tally-clerk, so
we should get the work done quickly."</p>

<p>Wilson, who was working with a bale-hook and showing three naked
natives where to get a grip on a large case, looked up quickly.
"She's a great girl, isn't she?" he asked. "Ready, willing and
sympathetic, and plucky, too. Some women would not have got over
the shock of all this for a month. I do like a sensible,
matter-of-fact girl."</p>

<p>Sherwin smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are very much in love, young man," he said to
himself as he went to the bow and climbed down to the sand. Ellen
was standing where he had left her, a dozen native women around
her, some touching her dress, others pointing to her face and
whispering wonderingly to one another at the whiteness of her skin.
With the white of her dress in sharp relief to the dark-skinned
bodies around her, the clearness of her skin, the sunlight playing
with the bronze in her hair, the daintiness of her, she looked like
some fairy queen surrounded by slaves.</p>

<p>"And I don't wonder at it, Mr. Wilson," Sherwin added as he
reached her side.</p>

<p>He explained what was to be done, and then marshalled forty
natives&mdash;men and women&mdash;and set them carrying the first
of the discharged goods along the beach. Bamu came up as the string
started off.</p>

<p>"Here, where have you been all the morning?" Sherwin questioned
roughly. "Asleep?"</p>

<p>The old native shook his head.</p>

<p>"No more," he answered. "I been clean out storeroom. He all
ready now."</p>

<p>Sherwin patted him on the back. "You are a funny old coot. Who
told you to clean out the store."</p>

<p>"Nobody tell me. I savee cargo belong you all right and I make
ready some place to put him."</p>

<p>"All right, then. You stop here now and see all these people
carry everything proper. Savee? I go house and look out for
stacking all the things. You boss for this end."</p>

<p>Bamu swung around at once and began directing some men who were
struggling with a case.</p>

<p>"I think that is just splendid," Ellen said, as she and the
trader set off for the house. "Fancy that old man cleaning out the
store without being told! It was very thoughtful of him. Have you
many natives like that?"</p>

<p>"Bamu is a funny old fellow," Sherwin laughed. "He has been with
me for years, and knows everything about the station better than I
do. When he saw that the 'Mokohu' was ashore with her hull intact,
he knew my cargo would be more or less undamaged. So he just went
to work and cleaned out the store as a matter of course."</p>

<p>"I think you must treat your natives very well for them to
behave like that," Ellen remarked. "You must be a kind master."</p>

<p>"I hope not! Kindness is a mistake&mdash;indiscriminate
kindness, at any rate&mdash;in dealing with natives. They mistake
it for weakness."</p>

<p>"Then you must be a just one."</p>

<p>"I try to be, but one's ideas become warped by long residence in
countries like this, and it is often hard to tell when one is
right. I do my best."</p>

<p>"I am sure you do." Her tone was emphatic. "I believe you regard
the natives as human beings, and not as creatures belonging to
another order, as some traders and others are supposed to do."</p>

<p>"I have met very few who hold with that idea," Sherwin said.
"It's a foolish one in any case. A trader or planter depends on his
labor, as on nothing else, for successful results, and that being
so he sensibly makes fair treatment his first rule. I certainly do
so&mdash;not from sentiment, but from business."</p>

<p>Ellen laughed and looked up at him. "You are trying to make
yourself out to be a hard-hearted sort of person who gives fair
treatment only because it pays. But it won't work; I know
better."</p>

<p>The first of the carriers had already deposited their loads in
front of the storehouse when they reached the station. Sherwin told
off a dozen men for the stacking, and Ellen obtained an
exercise-book and a pencil and sat down on a box. As the trader
called out the various brands and marks the girl noted them down,
and then the goods were bundled inside and stacked.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="im2" id="im2"></a><img src=
"1900891h-images/Image-2.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Ellen obtained an exercise book and pencil, and
sat down on a box.</p>

<p>Lapa and the other women who had waited on Ellen when she was
unconscious volunteered to lend a hand, and Sherwin put them on to
some of the lighter stuff. It was hard, straining work, for some of
the cargo was heavy and awkward; but the men worked well and
uncomplainingly, and when the time came for the midday spell and
meal, Sherwin felt very satisfied with the morning's work.</p>

<p>"The owners of this stuff might have to wait a month or two till
a vessel can come for it," he said, as he sent a boy to tell Morton
and Wilson to come for lunch. "But it will be quite safe till then.
I hope none of them are in a hurry for the stuff. I see there are
cases of tomahawks and half-axes for the Mana-Mana plantations, and
a ton of tobacco for Robertson, the trader, at Lohu. If the
plantations are short of axes and Robertson is out of tobacco,
there will be some cursing going on just now. However, we are doing
the best we can."</p>

<p>The others came along presently, and all four had their lunch at
the verandah table. Morton was in a much better humor than he had
been in the night before, and he cracked jokes and made more or
less sly allusions to the liking Wilson and Ellen had evidenced for
one another on the run from Thursday Island. Sherwin noticed that
the girl blushed at these remarks, and tried desperately to turn
the conversation. But this only made the Captain the more
determined on his fun, and Ellen at last showed such signals of
distress that Sherwin felt in mercy bound to create a change of
topic.</p>

<p>"We will have to let the authorities know about the loss of the
'Mokohu' as soon as possible," he said. "Shall I arrange for a
native to go with a message, Captain?"</p>

<p>"How far is it?" Ellen asked, before Morton had time to
answer.</p>

<p>"A good boy would get through in about ten days," the trader
said. "There is a decent beach most of the way."</p>

<p>"What a distance for one man to travel!" Ellen exclaimed. "Is
there not some way by which the letter could be carried from
village to village, in relays, I think that's the term?"</p>

<p>Sherwin's face was grave at once. "That would be the course in
ordinary circumstances," he said slowly. "But things are out of
gear just now, and I have made an order that no native is to come
here from beyond a certain point to the eastward. The man who takes
the letter must not return here for some time."</p>

<p>"Why?" the others asked in one voice.</p>

<p>Sherwin paused a moment before replying. His face was set and
lines of care and worry appeared suddenly on his brow.</p>

<p>"The German measles is raging along the coast to the eastward.
To prevent the infection spreading here I have prohibited all the
natives on the other side of the Basi river coming across. That
means that a native crossing from this side will not be allowed to
return."</p>

<p>"And will they obey?"</p>

<p>Sherwin smiled grimly. "I am the only trader for a hundred miles
of coast, and the natives know better than to fall foul of me.
There is no one else to buy their copra and supply them with
goods." He waved his hands expressively. "So, you see, I am not
likely to be disobeyed. The plan of sending to Moresby by relays is
not to be considered. But I can order a man to go right through and
instruct a friend in Moresby to keep him there till this epidemic
has passed."</p>

<p>Captain Morton stood up and felt for his pipe. "No need to send
a nigger at all," he said. "As master of the ship it is my duty to
report the loss of the vessel in person, if possible. As soon as
the cargo is safely out of her, I will go to Moresby."</p>

<p>"But what an awful journey!" Ellen exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's nothing! I'll take it in easy stages. I made up my mind to
go as soon as I got safe ashore. Now, let us get at the cargo
again."</p>

<p>They all went to the steps, and, when they reached the ground,
Mortou took Sherwin aside out of the hearing of the others.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the offer of a nigger, Sherwin," he said. "It was
very good of you. I did think of taking Wilson with me." He stopped
and looked quizzically at the other. "But I thought it would be
better to leave him to look after the cargo&mdash;the cargo, you
understand," he repeated, digging the trader playfully in the ribs,
a broad smile on his face. "Poor young things," he added, with a
mock sigh.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. TALK OF SORCERY</h2>

<p>For a matter of three days they worked at getting the cargo out
and carried to the station, and at the end of that time the
schooner was empty and the bottom of her hold littered with
packing-waste. The weather continued fine, the wind dying away at
night and, after a period of calm, coming off the land in the form
of a light air that hardly rustled the coconuts and brought with it
the odors of the inland swamps. The surf had died down to an
ordered sequence of small rollers that rose to their greatest
height at the flood of the tide and fell away to ripples at the
ebb. The sun each day floated in an immensity of blue&mdash;a blue
so delicate and yet so clear, so distant and yet so near, that it
seemed the very spirit&mdash;the poetry&mdash;of a tint. The
storehouse was filled to overflowing, and the space under the
living house was piled high with cases of all sizes and shapes.
There were hundreds of bags and mats of rice, caddys of tobacco,
"nests" of camphor-wood boxes with brass-clipped corners and made
so that three smaller sizes fitted in one large one, bags of
potatoes and onions, two motor engines for launches belonging to
some of the plantations to the eastward, dozens of bundles of empty
bags for the various trading stations, scores of cases of preserved
meats, jams, milk and fruits, tightly soldered tins of flour and
sugar for the mountain mining fields. Then there was a medley of
spare and other ship gear&mdash;sails, anchors and chains,
windlasses, spars, coils of rope of various sizes, cabin-fittings
and what not.</p>

<p>"I never knew what a lot of stuff a ship could hold before,"
Ellen said, as she and Sherwin stood looking at the last loads
being stacked under the house. "It's a whole town-full!"</p>

<p>"We have to get both a variety and a quantity of requirements in
these parts," Sherwin said. "We can't run to the corner shop when
we get short. It's a matter of looking a long way ahead."</p>

<p>That night Ellen produced her tally-book, and she and Captain
Morton compared the entries with those of the shipping receipts and
manifest, in order to see that everything shipped at Thursday
Island had been landed safely. Sherwin and Wilson lounged on the
canvas chairs, conversing desultorily. Both directly faced the pair
at the table, and the trader could not help comparing the grey and
somewhat scanty hair of the Captain with the beautiful head so
close to it, and remarking inwardly on the whiteness of the girl's
hand alongside the browned fist of her companion.</p>

<p>The comparing of the entries was a long job, for the items were
numerous and some of the brands hard to decipher. After a time
Sherwin and Wilson rose, by mutual instinct, and the former
suggested a walk along the beach. Wilson readily agreed, and the
pair slipped away without disturbing the Captain and the girl.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of the Skipper taking on that long walk
to Moresby," Wilson said, as they passed through the coconuts and
reached the clean sand of the beach. "He is not as young as he used
to be, and I know it will knock him up. But he won't hear of me
going and letting him stay here. He insists it is his duty as
master of the vessel to go."</p>

<p>"Of course, he knows best," Sherwin said. "But it looks to me as
if a letter carried by a nigger would answer the purpose just as
well."</p>

<p>For a time the two men walked in silence, each sucking
meditatively at his pipe. The night was very still, for the land
breeze had not yet sprung up and the coconuts drooped motionless in
the starlight. The tide was rising, but the beat of the surf was
subdued and gentle, a patter as of running footsteps and a
miniature crash that had a musical tinkle. Ahead a number of fires
glowed and occasionally flared amongst the coconuts of the village,
and the shadowy shape of the "Mokohu" sprawled across the beach
like some prehistoric animal resting, the stump of the mainmast
looking like a dorsal horn. A murmur of native voices floated on
the night air, and now and then came the note of a softly beaten
drum.</p>

<p>"What do you think of Miss Russell?" Wilson asked presently.</p>

<p>"A very fine girl indeed," his companion answered promptly. "I
like her immensely. She is capable and sensible and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Wilson. "I was never so pleased about
anything as when I learnt she had come safely through the surf. She
would make a splendid wife."</p>

<p>"The man who gets such beauty and goodness for his own will be a
very lucky individual." Sherwin's tone was very earnest. "I have
only known her for three days, but so much is obvious."</p>

<p>"I recognised her good qualities as soon as she stepped on board
at Thursday Island." He puffed at his pipe meditatively. "Ever
think of marrying, Sherwin?" he asked, off-handedly.</p>

<p>"Poor young fellow," the trader said to himself. "He is
evidently very much in love, and wants to work the conversation so
as to get my opinion of&mdash;" He cut short his train of thought
and said aloud: "Marrying? No hope! Isolated traders like me don't
harbor thoughts of such a thing. It would be no life for any
girl."</p>

<p>"Some girls would revel in it. Miss Russell, for instance."</p>

<p>Sherwin laughed heartily. "For about three months, perhaps; then
the glamor would begin to wear off and a longing for civilisation
and drapers' shops and the company of women of her own color would
start making her life a misery. Besides, white women don't thrive
in this climate."</p>

<p>"None of those things would matter if you loved and were
loved."</p>

<p>"You seem to know a good deal about it," the trader laughed. "I
suspect you of possessing experience."</p>

<p>Wilson hesitated.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I, well, you see, I have not lived an isolated
existence like you. My life has been spent in
civilisation&mdash;and one has all sorts of experiences, you
know."</p>

<p>"All I know about the business," said Sherwin, "is that I do not
love and am not loved, and that I'm fairly happy in spite of it.
This open, free life agrees with me, and I have no desire to change
it or burden myself with a wife."</p>

<p>"All that's wrong with you is that you haven't met a girl who
appealed to you. Some day you will; then you will go whop-oh!"</p>

<p>As they turned to retrace their steps, Ellen and Morton
appeared.</p>

<p>"We've got the business finished!" the girl exclaimed. "And I'm
not sorry. The Captain suggested a walk to see where you two had
got to. Listen! What is that?"</p>

<p>A strange wailing and howling was coming from the direction of
the village, the voices of women rising to a shrill falsetto that
quavered weirdly, the droning deeper note of men chanting in
chorus.</p>

<p>Sherwin turned abruptly. "The epidemic?" he whispered
anxiously.</p>

<p>A native came running along the beach.</p>

<p>"What is it?" the trader questioned, as the man stood panting
before them.</p>

<p>"We feller find them!"</p>

<p>"Find what?"</p>

<p>"We feller been go longa creek for to look fish"&mdash;he waved
his arm back past the village&mdash;"and we smell some'ting longa
mangroves. We look close to and we findem."</p>

<p>Sherwin shook the native roughly. "Hurry up! What did you
find?"</p>

<p>But the man preferred to tell his story in his own way.</p>

<p>"Some shark been take leg and arm and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, tell me what you are talking about at once, or The anger
and threat in Sherwin's voice pulled the native up with a round
turn.</p>

<p>"Them crew boy belong 'Mokohu,'" he said simply.</p>

<p>Ellen screamed and staggered, and Wilson, who was the nearest,
was just in time to catch her as she crumpled up in a faint.
"Better take her to the house at once," said Sherwin, as Wilson
laid his burden gently on the sand. Ellen stirred slightly and
moaned.</p>

<p>"She is coming round, I think; it's only a momentary faint,"
Morton said, bending over her.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes opened and she looked up. The wailing in the
village had increased in volume and the drums had broken into a
sharp staccato.</p>

<p>"Take me away, please," she said weakly. "I feel so sick."</p>

<p>"You take her to the house, Sherwin," said Morton, rising. "We
will come along afterwards."</p>

<p>"Make those niggers stop their howling," Sherwin said, as he
assisted Ellen to her feet. "These death wails get on one's
nerves."</p>

<p>He slipped his arm round the girl's waist and the pair set off
for the house, Morton and Wilson going in the direction of the
village.</p>

<p>"I am sure you must think I am very foolish," Ellen said, as
they reached the steps. "That turn came over me so suddenly that I
had not time to resist it."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," Sherwin said gently. "You must lie
down for awhile." He helped her on to the verandah and to the door
of her room.</p>

<p>"I think I would rather sit on the verandah, if you don't mind,"
she said. "I would like to wait till the others return."</p>

<p>He dragged a stretcher forward and smoothed the blankets on it
and placed a pillow comfortably.</p>

<p>Ellen lay down and looked at the man for some time without
speaking. The wailing was dying down now, and there was only an
occasional drum-note. From the region of the living quarters of the
natives belonging to the station came Bamu's voice, loud-toned and
evidently in expostulation.</p>

<p>"I have been dreaming about those poor boys," Ellen whispered
presently. "In my sleep I saw their bodies tossed about by the
waves, rolling over and over, tumbling&mdash;" She hid her face in
her hands. "Only last night I woke up in a cold sweat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't think of it any more," Sherwin murmured
sympathetically. "Try and go to sleep now."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I'm afraid to! I dream and dream&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again she buried her face in her hands. Sherwin rose and went
into the bedroom. He returned with a stoppered bottle of tabloids,
one of which he powdered and added to a half-glass of water.</p>

<p>"Drink this!" he said authoritatively.</p>

<p>She took the glass obediently and drained it.</p>

<p>"Merely a harmless opiate," he said in answer to the enquiry in
her eyes. For a time she lay looking at him; then an expression of
infinite weariness crept over her face and her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Sherwin pulled out his pipe and lit it.</p>

<p>"That nigger delivered his horrible news with too much
suddenness altogether," he muttered. "No wonder she fainted; I got
a bit of a shock myself. Still, I might have known what was
coming."</p>

<p>There was a creak along the verandah, and on the trader calling
out who was there, the figure of Bamu stepped into the circle of
light.</p>

<p>"You hear news?" he queried, his wrinkled face looking as though
it were a hundred years old in the lamplight. Sherwin nodded and
bade him speak softly, so as not to disturb the sleeping girl.</p>

<p>"Them feller in village want to make one big death-dance," Bamu
went on. "Two feller chief been here jus' now and talk to me. I
tell them no can make big dance. I tell them you wild like
hell!"</p>

<p>"That's right. The bodies must be buried at once and without any
dance." Sherwin knew that a big death-dance would run into several
days, perhaps weeks&mdash;an orgy of dancing and feasting and
chanting, during the currency of which there would be no copra
made, and at the end would leave the natives exhausted and worn
out. And just now he wanted his natives to keep as strong and fit
as possible. The dreaded rubeola was only a two-days' march away,
and natives exhausted by an excess of dancing would not be in fit
state to repel its ravages should it appear amongst them. The loss
of the copra did not trouble him nearly as much as the consequences
of the appearance of the epidemic after a prolonged course of
furious dancing. Peter Sherwin was a man first and a trader
afterwards, and he had seen epidemics in native villages
before.</p>

<p>"No make dance," he repeated, using pidgin-English for Bamu's
benefit. "Bury them 'Mokohu' boys one time quick. That's all. What
they want dance about them boy for? 'Mokohu' boy no belong this
place; they not countryman of this village. S'pose some of these
people dead, I let them make dance little bit."</p>

<p>Bamu shuffled round the table and to the white man's side. "Too
much puri-puri," he said, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Sherwin looked at him quickly. Sorcery was a power amongst the
natives, and he was always running up against its influences.</p>

<p>"What kiud puri-puri?" he asked.</p>

<p>The old native hesitated and looked round as though afraid of
being heard.</p>

<p>"Them chief say white misi make puri-puri," he whispered,
glancing at the sleeping girl. "They say before this misi come no
schooner been lost longa surf and nobody drown'. No white misi come
here before. This time one come, all crew he drown' and schooner
broke al'ogether. Bye-em-bye big sickness come from them other
village and all people dead damn quick. Chief say more better make
big dance and break that puri-puri."</p>

<p>Sherwin was startled. So this was the reason the natives wanted
to hold a big death-wail over the bodies of unrelated natives! They
put down the loss of the "Mokohu" and her crew to the presence of
machinations of Ellen! They regarded her as a witch and wanted to
held a ceremony that might possibly ward off her evil influence!
They wanted to guard against her bringing the disease that was
ravaging the villages to the eastward down upon them!</p>

<p>Sherwin's blood boiled and he felt like rushing to the village
and bumping some of the superstition-filled heads together. The
veins of his forehead stood out hard and he clenched his fists.
Then with an effort he collected himself.</p>

<p>"You believe, Taubada?" Bamu questioned.</p>

<p>"Believe, no!" Sherwin hissed. "White misi no can make
puri-puri, she big friend belong all native. You tell chief
that."</p>

<p>The native started to go, but the white man called him hack.</p>

<p>"I believe you are as bad as the rest," he said, accusatively.
"You believe white misi make puri-puri?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I no savee," Bamu answered, hesitatingly and
doubtingly. "I no savee." He slipped away by the hack steps, for
Morton and Wilson were coming along the verandah.</p>

<p>"Give us a drink, will you, Sherwin," the Captain said, his
voice trembling. "We saw them&mdash;and it was something awful."
They emptied the glasses Sherwin handed them at a gulp, their hands
shaking, a strange pallor on their faces.</p>

<p>"They've got them laid out in front of the village," Wilson
said. "We managed to quieten the dancing and uproar, but they are
all very sulky and muttering amongst themselves. They didn't like
our interfering at all."</p>

<p>Sherwin said nothing of what. Bamu had told him, and presently
he called Lapa and ordered her to make Miss Russell's bed ready.
Lapa obeyed readily enough, but Sherwin's quick eye for native
moods detected a strange something in her manner.</p>

<p>"It's all over the village that this girl is a witch," he said
to himself, as he and Wilson picked up Ellen's unconscious form and
carried her inside. "I'll get hold of the chiefs to-morrow and give
them a talking-to," he added grimly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. WILSON MAKES A
MISTAKE</h2>

<p>Sherwiu did not sleep much that night. He had dragged his
stretcher into a position that allowed him a clear view of the
doorway of the bedroom, and he had so arranged the lamp that that
particular part of the verandah was illuminated as much as
possible. His long experience told him that the natives would
probably avoid any direct interference, but he was not inclined to
leave anything to chance. He tossed restlessly from side to side,
and tried to break the monotony by smoking. The beat of drums came
faintly through the night air and a village dog howled a despairing
note. The coconuts rustled unceasingly in the land-breeze, and the
surf crashed its miniature thunder. Somewhere along the beach a
lone curlew cried with the wail of a motherless child.</p>

<p>To the white man lying awake on the verandah and thinking of the
village full of superstition so close at hand, there was somethiug
in these weird sounds of the night that made him very uneasy.</p>

<p>"I'll just have a peep to see she is all right," he said to
himself, some time in the early hours of the morning. He rose
softly and stepped across the lamp-lit space and into the bedroom.
He discerned Ellen's form beneath the mosquito-net and that of Lapa
sleeping on the floor beside her bed. The white girl was awake.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" she queried.</p>

<p>"No; it's all right. I thought I heard someone about." He left
the room, but just as he reached the doorway in the full glare of
the lamplight, Wilson suddenly appeared from out of the darkness
round the coruer of the verandah. He had a revolver in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I heard voices and someone moving about," he said, stopping a
moment and then advancing. "I thought some of the niggers might be
prowling about."</p>

<p>"It's all right; it's only me," Sherwin said, going to his
stretcher and sitting down. "I was just seeing&mdash;" He stopped
as he remembered that Wilson knew nothing of the accusations of
witchcraft against Ellen, and that it might not be the best policy
to tell him. Wilson was a stranger to New Guinea and the ways of
natives, and he would not understand the significauce of Bamu's
communication.</p>

<p>A frown crossed Wilson's face, and he went to the other's
side.</p>

<p>"What did you say'?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought I heard someone moving, too," Sherwin said,
somewhat lamely. "It all right, though: there is no one about."</p>

<p>Wilson looked very hard at him for a moment. "Oh!" he said deep
down in his throat. Then he turned sharply and went away.</p>

<p>Sherwin, wondering what was the matter, filled his pipe for a
final smoke before lying down. Wilsou had acted very strangely, he
thought. He was in the act of applying a match to the tobacco when
he realised that the mate might have misunderstood his action. The
man had seen him tip-toeing from the door...There was that
hesitation and stumbling when he had given his
explanation...Sherwin's cheeks flamed hotly, and he clenched his
hand with such strength that the stem of his pipe cracked. He
jumped up and extinguished the match beneath his bare foot. He
would go at once and tell Wilson of the hideous mistake he was
making.</p>

<p>He took two strides and then stopped abruptly. No other white
knew about the puri-puri business, he reflected, not even the girl
herself. They would only become upset and distressed if they
knew&mdash;especially a stranger in a strange land like Wilson.
Besides, Sherwin had resolved to talk the chiefs out of their
belief that Ellen was an agent of sorcery, and to do this he would
have to go about the matter in his own way. It would be a delicate
business from beginuing to end&mdash;natives resent affairs of such
nature being discussed by people of another race, except the rare
white man who, by long acquaintanceship, is in their confidence to
a certain extent. The interference of a non-understanding stranger
would undoubtedly ruin all. Wilson might be able to keep his mouth
shut, but the quick perceptions of the natives would soon tell them
that he possessed the knowledge; and Sher-win's task would be
vastly more difficult accordingly.</p>

<p>The trader returned to his bed and lay down. He had made up his
mind to talk to the chiefs in the morning, and when the sorcery
business was blown over he would tell Wilson the reason of his
prowling about Elleu's room in the middle of the night. Satisfied
that this course was the best, he turned over and soon was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>He awoke as the pearl-grey light of dawu was tinging the eastern
sky and rapidly swelling into that burst of golden splendor that
heralds the coming of the tropic sun. It was a flat calm, for the
night wind had gone and the south-east trade had not yet arrived. A
number of canoes were pushing off the river beach and heading
down-stream to where a certain leaping and splashing near the
centre of the bar told of schools of mullet seeking the smooth
water of the river. Sherwin went to the veraudah railing and,
pushing back a portion of the cane blind, looked out across the
dark-blue water of the stream to where the roofs of a couple of
grass houses peeped from amongst the coconuts of the other bank. A
big double-canoe was coming across, the paddlers standing upright,
three on each side. Sherwin watched it for a moment; then he let
the blind fall back into its place.</p>

<p>"The old puri-puri chief is coming over," he muttered. "They
must have sent for him last night."</p>

<p>A light footstep and the rustle of a dress caused him to turn.
Ellen was coming from her room, her eyes shining brightly, a
penitent smile upou her face.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for fainting like that," she said. "I've never
been guilty of such a thing before."</p>

<p>"You slept well?" Sherwin asked.</p>

<p>"Beautifully, thank you. That stuff you gave me was just
wonderful. Are the others not up yet? The sleepyheads to be still
in bed on such a glorious morning!" She went to the corner of the
verandah and looked out across the sea to where the sun's upper
limb was showing a rim of golden fire above the edge of the
clean-cut horizon. Broad beams of shining bronze radiated upwards,
thickening and widening as they rose, and the surface of the sea
was giving place to the heavy lauguor of the night a light-streaked
awakening. The drooping coconut fronds reflected green and silver,
and the grey went out of the beach sand and left it a glittering
white. The face of the river lit up as though with a smile, and a
hundred patches of color gave its cheeks a bloom and a sparkle to
its myriad eyes.</p>

<p>The girl watching from the verandah drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful! Wonderful! The beginning of a new world!" She
uttered the words softly, almost reverently.</p>

<p>"It is not always like this," Sherwin said. "The new day can
frown as well as smile, you know. Hulloa, here comes Wilson."</p>

<p>The mate had come around the corner of the verandah and stopped
abruptly on seeing the trader and the girl. Without speaking he
turned to go back.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Wilson," Ellen called out and the mate
stopped and faced them again.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said curtly. Ellen went up to him.</p>

<p>"Are you not well?" she asked, a note of anxiety in her
voice.</p>

<p>"I am quite well, thank you."</p>

<p>"I am sure there is something wrong with you," Ellen said. "You
are not smiling and you seem unhappy. A morning like this should
put anyone in the best of spirits." She reached tip and placed the
palm of her hand on his forehead. "You are not getting the New
Guinea fever, are you? You don't seem to have a high temperature,
but it might be as well to take some quinine. We can't have you
getting sick, after all you've been through."</p>

<p>"I assure you I am quite all right, Miss Russell," Wilson said,
and, without glancing at Sherwin, walked off.</p>

<p>Ellen watched his retreating figure with a puzzled frown on her
face. "He seems quite different this morning," she said, turning to
the trader. "I hope I have not offended him in some way."</p>

<p>Sherwin felt very much like going after Wilson and telling him
what a fool he was for his absurd suspicions, and the blood mounted
hotly to his head. It was intolerable that a girl like Ellen...</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is worrying about his financial position," he said
to Ellen. "The loss of the 'Mokohu' hits him very hard, you
know."</p>

<p>"The poor boy!" The girl's tone was full of sympathy. "I expect
he hasn't a thing left in the world. Could we not help him in some
way?" She thought a moment and then looked up and clapped her
hands. "I know! When I see my brother I'll ask him to give Mr.
Wilson a position on the plantation! My brother will do anything
for me, and when I tell him the circumstances there will be no
difficulty. That will be great, won't it? It will give him another
start in life, and perhaps he will have better luck this time."</p>

<p>She took both of Sherwin's hands in hers and shook them
impulsively. At that moment Wilson again appeared round the corner
of the verandah, and Ellen dropped Sherwin's hands.</p>

<p>"I'll tell him about it now," she said. "I'm so glad I thought
of a way of helping the poor boy!" She ran up to the mate and
Sherwin went to the steps and down to the ground.</p>

<p>"It would break her little heart if she knew what Wilson was
thinking," he muttered. "She thinks such a lot of him, too. It
strikes me that Wilson is something of a fool; he ought to think
himself a very lucky man to have won the high regard of a girl like
that." He walked across the compound to the living-quarters of the
natives and called Bamu.</p>

<p>The old native came out, blinking and fastening his
lava-lava.</p>

<p>Sherwin shook him roughly. "Here! Wake up! You see that canoe!"
He pointed to the river. "You go one time quick and tell Olpo I
want yarn longa him. Savee?"</p>

<p>Bamu looked across at the canoe now near the shore. A figure sat
hunched in the stern&mdash;a figure that was doubled and bent with
age.</p>

<p>"You tell him wait for me longa Dubu," Sherwin went on. "I come
when breakfast finish. You no frightened to speak to Olpo?"</p>

<p>The very name of the sorcerer was a power all over the district,
and it was popularly supposed that the very act of speaking to him
was fraught with danger; Olpo was a very crotchety old man and apt
to imagine offence where none was intended.</p>

<p>"I little bit frighten'," Bamu answered, "but, no matter, I
go."</p>

<p>Sherwin went to the store and took out some pieces of red calico
and a few sticks of tobacco.</p>

<p>"Off you go now," he said. "Give these things to Olpo as present
from me. Tell him wait for me."</p>

<p>As Bamu went off, Captain Morton approached.</p>

<p>"I think I'll make a start for Moresby to-day," he said, after
greetings had been exchanged. "There is nothing to wait here for
now; the cargo is safe and we've done all we can for the schooner.
There's no use in my wasting any more time. When will it be low
water?"</p>

<p>"About ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"I'll start then. That will give me a chance to get over the
creek without swimming and chancing the crocodiles."</p>

<p>"I can easily send a canoe along to ferry you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No need to do all that. I will manage all right. I say," he
broke off; "I fancy there is something wrong with the love-birds
this morning. They are hardly playing speaks."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The girl and the mate. She is trying to make herself agreeable
to him, but it appears he won't have anything to do with her. I
wonder what's the matter? I never thought Wilson would turn sulky
like this. They took to one another from the start, and all the way
across from Thursday Island it was as good as a play to watch them.
But by the look of things there's a bust-up brewing."</p>

<p>"Some trifling disagreement, I suppose," Sherwin said and
changed the subject.</p>

<p>For a time they talked of Morton's projected journey, and
discussed the probabilities of securing a vessel to come for the
cargo.</p>

<p>"I might be lucky enough to catch one of the traders from the
other side of Moresby, and if so I won't have much trouble. With
decent weather you can look for my return in about five weeks."
Morton laughed and patted the other on the back. "And see that the
surf is behaving better for my next visit," he added.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Sherwin said slowly. "I think you are one of the
gamest men I have ever met. Here you are with your vessel wrecked,
your money gone, utterly ruined, yet you are quite cheerful about
it. Some men would never get over such a disaster."</p>

<p>Morton laughed again, his face beaming with good nature.</p>

<p>"I thought I would peg out when I woke up in your house the
morning afterwards and knew the dear old 'Mokohu' was busted and I
was broke. But what was the good of grieving? I asked myself.
Everything comes all right some day. And things could have been
worse, anyway. What if Miss Russell had been drowned! What could I
tell her brother? Or if young Wilson had gone overside with the
crew? I reckon I've a lot to be thankful for."</p>

<p>"But you will have to make a fresh start in life."</p>

<p>"Well, that's nothing. I'll be startiug with a clean sheet,
anyway. If I haven't got any money, neither do I owe any; and
that's a great thing. I'm sorry for Wilson, though; he hasn't my
experience to fall back upon."</p>

<p>Sherwin laughed. "That's a new way of looking at things. But,
perhaps youthful enthusiasm will compensate him for lack of
experience."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Morton said. "Now, there is the cook-boy signalling
from the verandah that breakfast is ready."</p>

<p>They made back through the coconuts, and as they reached the
steps, the Captain took the trader by the arm.</p>

<p>"While I am away," he said softly, so that those in the house
should not hear, "don't let that little girl get miserable. Keep
her smiling. I don't like to think of her unhappy. I had a daughter
who, if she had lived, would have been about her age and rig by
this time."</p>

<p>"All right, Captain, I'll do my best."</p>

<p>"Now, don't forget, Sherwin, I look to you to make her
happy."</p>

<p>And again Sherwin promised.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. CAPTAIN MORTON
DEPARTS</h2>

<p>It was very apparent during breakfast that Ellen was distressed
and sorely puzzled by Wilson's attitude towards her, and when the
meal was over she went straight to her room. Sherwin felt very much
like taking the mate to task for his boorish conduct THE WHITE
WITCH 'Ti there and then, but he restrained himself and determined
that as soon as he was through with the sorcerer to lose no time in
telling him the truth. Incidentally, his liking and regard for the
man were beginning to suffer; it struck him that one so
unreasonably suspicious and jealous could not possess as much
goodness as he had credited him with. Sherwin considered that a
nature that could be so untrustful of a girl like Ellen must be
kinked or tainted.</p>

<p>Captain Morton had packed his gear and rations the night before,
so that when four natives whom Sherwin had ordered as carriers
appeared, there was nothing to delay his start.</p>

<p>"These men will carry your things to the creek," the trader
said, "and the people in the village just on the other side will
carry you to the next village, and so on. The rate of payment for a
day's carrying is one stick of tobacco per man."</p>

<p>"About a penny a day!" exclaimed Ellen, approaching the group at
the foot of the steps. She had come from her room at the sounds of
the Captain's preparations for departure. "Evideutly there are no
wages boards in these parts! Have you got my letter, Captain? You
might be lucky enough to catch my brother in Moresby and then you
can give it to him himself. He has a boat, you know, and goes to
Moresby for his provisions and things."</p>

<p>"I'll give him your love with it, and tell him how bright and
well and handsome you were looking when I left. It's up to you,
Sherwin&mdash;" Morton glanced at the mate "to see she keeps like
that. Now, the tide is about right and I must be off. Come on boys,
pick up your loads now."</p>

<p>The natives shouldered the bundles contaiuing preserved foods,
spare clothing, sleeping-gear and trade tobacco for the payment of
carriers. The billycaus and frying pans they carried in their
hands. As they filed through the coconuts to the gate of the
compound, Morton held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said cheerfully. "Expect me in about five
weeks."</p>

<p>Sherwin took his hand and shook it heartily. "Remember, easy
stages will do the trick," he said. "Rushing things is no good.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Morton turned to Wilson. "Keep your pecker up, sou," he said.
"If we're broke, we're still alive and healthy&mdash;and that's a
great lot. Keep an eye on the cargo, for I can't expect Sherwin to
neglect his business for the sake of keeping a look-out for
thieving niggers."</p>

<p>Wilson muttered some commonplace reply, and Ellen stepped
forward and grasped the Captain's arm.</p>

<p>"Be very careful of yourself, won't you?" she said in a sweetly
anxious voice. "I will be thinking of you tramping those
interminable beaches and wondering how you are getting on."</p>

<p>Morton's eyes suddenly dimmed, and his voice was a trifle husky
as he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had a daughter like you once&mdash;but she died. She was
loving and sweet just like you. You remind me very much of her." He
pulled himself together. "Look out you don't get the fever; I don't
want to see your fresh skin turn yellow and dried-up. And keep
those pretty eyes bright and smiling for my return."</p>

<p>Ellen looked up at him, her face softly aglow.</p>

<p>"I will! Good-bye. There!" she said, reaching up and kissing his
cheek. Morton smiled broadly at the two men. "I am having a bit of
good luck after all," he said. Then he released the girl and strode
after the carriers who were now on the beach and marching in single
file.</p>

<p>At the gate he turned and waved to the watchers at the house,
then he swung sharply to the beach and was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a good old chap?" Ellen said as the three went up the
steps. "I almost wish I was his daughter. What a cheerful outlook
he has on life! He is absolutely ruined, and yet there is nothing
in his manner to suggest he is not the most prosperous of men."
Sherwiu could not help glancing at Wilson as the girl spoke, and he
saw that she had done the same. The mate's face wore a distinctly
sullen expressiou, and when he reached the verandah he went
straight to one of the canvas chairs at the far eud and picked up a
book.</p>

<p>"He does not seem in the mood for conversation this morning,"
Ellen whispered. "Do you think I have offended him in some way?"
she asked anxiously. "He was never like this before."</p>

<p>"He will be all right presently," the trader said. "Now, I must
leave you for awhile; I have to go to the village on some
business."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me come!" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not this morning." Sherwin's tone was gentle but firm. "You
stay here and read. I won't be long."</p>

<p>"But do let me go with you. I won't be in the way; I'll not do
or say anything, and I'll keep as quiet as a mouse."</p>

<p>But Sherwin would not hear of it. He could not tell her what his
business at the village was, and he was hard put to it to make
excuses for her not coming.</p>

<p>And his task was made none the easier when she gave what he
suspected was her real reason for wanting to go. "I don't want to
stay here by myself while Mr. Wilson is grumpy like this. I can see
him glowering over the top of his book at me now."</p>

<p>"You go into your room and stay there till I come back," he
said. "I really can't take you to the village this morning; there
are things not fit for a woman...You understand?"</p>

<p>"You make me all the more curious," she laughed. "But I will
show myself good and obedient for once. I will see what there is in
the kitchen that will make up into a decent lunch. How will that
do?"</p>

<p>"Splendidly! I will hurry back." And with that he went down the
steps. "The poor girl evidently thinks the world of him; it's a
damned shame that he should treat her so. I'll fix him up when I
get back," he said to himself as he went along the beach. "Some men
don't know when they are well off."</p>

<p>He turned into the village and strode along the street past the
gaping women on the porches of the houses, and groups of young men
armed with spears, who had just returned from the early morning
hunt. One or two spoke to him and three or four youngsters came
forward with requests for lollies, but everyone knew he was on a
mission of importance and that the puri-puri chief was awaiting him
in the Dubu. Sherwin recognised there was a strange something in
the air, and a curious furtiveness was expressed in the manner of
the older men. At any other time, the trader would have been
surrounded by chattering villagers&mdash;the old men giving him the
news and, incidentally, cadging tobacco; the others telling him of
the growth of the yams and taro in the gardens, and asking if he
wanted to buy any fish. But to-day he walked alone; and, somehow,
the attitude of the natives depressed him.</p>

<p>He was rather pleased than otherwise when Bamu appeared near the
front of the Dubu. The old native had been lying in wait for his
appearance. "I tell Olpo," he said, in answer to Sherwin's unspoken
query. "He stop inside now."</p>

<p>"You come with me," the white man ordered. "Olpo no savee
English and I want you to talk."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no like, Taubada; I too much fright."</p>

<p>But Sherwin was in no mood to staud any nonsense; he just took
Bamu by the hair and propelled him to the ladder leading to the
porch of the Dubu. This porch was twelve or fifteen feet above the
ground, and was more or less shaded by a portion of the arched roof
projecting for three or four feet. The broken bowsprit of the
"Mokohu" had struck the roof a glancing blow, but with sufficient
force to dislodge some of the rafters, and leave their ends
protruding, and a portion of the thatch was draped about the
jibboom like a ragged garment.</p>

<p>"Olpo too much wild because schooner broke roof belong Dubu,"
Bamu panted as he and the white man finished climbing the rickety
ladder, and reached the porch. "He wild like hell! He say white
misi no good!"</p>

<p>From the elevation Sherwin was able to look down upon the
"Mokohu" for the full length of her deck. The vessel was quite dry,
for the tide was well out, and she sat perfectly upright in the
sand that had been heaped on either side by the action of the sea.
Her splintered deck, the absence of bulwarks, the stump of
mainmast, gave her an almost pathetic appearance&mdash;the
appearance of a brave fighter who has done his best and splendidly
failed to a superior opponent.</p>

<p>"Poor old 'Mokohu,'" Sherwin said, as he turned to the narrow
opening that served as the doorway of the Dubu, "you are there for
keeps."</p>

<p>He dragged Bamu in after him, and then stood still till his eyes
became accustomed to the gloom. The Dubu was without windows and
the only light that entered came through the doorway, and various
narrow slits in the wall that looked more accidental than
otherwise. The interior smelt abominably&mdash;the smell of black
bodies, over-ripe fruit, rank tobacco and that sickening odor
caused by lack of ventilation. But Sherwin was accustomed to that
sort of thing, and he stood patiently waiting, his eyes fixed on a
mass of glowing coals at the far end. Bamu stood behind him,
occasionally muttering strange words in a tone which the white man
recognised as that of fear. No one approached them, and there was
absolute silence. But Sherwin knew that a number of natives were
close at hand, and that they were waiting for him to move or
speak.</p>

<p>Presently the gloom began to lighten, and the various parts of
the Dubu became roughly outlined. As the influence of the bright
sunlight died in the white man's eyes he saw that each side of the
building was lined with tiny cubicles, a passage or corridor
running down the centre to the far end. Attached to the fronts of
the cubicles were grotesquely-painted and be-feathered dancing
masks and shields, some of them as much as ten feet long, with a
centre design in colored earths intended to represent a human face.
Beside them were bundles of man-killing arrows, and seven-foot bows
of fire-toughened wood. Near the door were several wooden drums,
four feet long, by about eighteen inches thick at the ends, carved
and painted, and narrow-waisted in the manner of an hour-glass. In
the first cubicle and in the one opposite were a pair of carved
figures fastened to a kind of seat. In front of each figure was a
human skull on a stick fastened to the floor.</p>

<p>Sherwin had seen these sorts of things many times before, and he
was quite unimpressed by what would have caused a stranger to
shudder. Quite calmly and deliberately, he entered the first
cubicle and took one of the skulls from off its stick. It was a
very old specimen and several of its teeth had been knocked out or
smashed by the death-blow. The gaps had been filled with artificial
teeth of gum and its nose was constructed of the same material.
Sherwin, with the gruesome object in his hand, walked down the
centre passage to where the fire glowed and partially illuminated
its immediate surroundings. He glanced in each cubicle as he
passed, and saw that several were occupied by natives squatting on
their haunches and sucking at immense bamboo pipes.</p>

<p>"Olpo!" he called as he reached the fire. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer, but presently there was a
shuffling of bare feet on the half-round surface of the flooring
slabs, and a very wizened, very small, entirely nude man
appeared.</p>

<p>"Come here, Bamu!" Sherwin ordered, and that worthy sidled up in
a half-hearted fashion.</p>

<p>"Tell Olpo I have come to ask him what for he talk puri-puri,"
Sherwin said, fingering the skull. As Bamu began the translation,
the trader seated himself on the floor and looked at this sorcerer
whose fame and influence reached from the Purari Delta to the hills
beyond Kerema. Sherwin had seen him once or twice before, but not
at such close quarters as this; Olpo lived with his three wives in
a house across the river, and rarely did he travel about. The
villagers supplied him with food, and saw to it that he was left in
undisturbed peace. The Government had tried many times to catch
this man whose influence was the cause of much tribal warfare and
trouble between villages, but the natives of his own village always
managed to smuggle him away. Not that they liked or loved the old
sorcerer; they lived in fear of his threatening them with disaster
and sudden death if his demands were not complied with. Many a
native would cheerfully have given him up and so removed a menace
from the community. But it was the fear of what Olpo would do them
in the way of revenge when he returned after a period of
imprisonment in the white man's gaol that deterred them. Even if he
did not return, or the Government sent him to another part of the
country, they considered distance would not prevent him avenging
himself. For what is distance to an all-powerful sorcerer? The fact
that he lived many days' journey away would not hinder the effects
of his machinations.</p>

<p>Sherwin saw that Olpo's hair was plastered with white clay on
both sides of his head, and twisted into a series of tapering
points in the centre. His face was streaked with red ochre,
irregularly, haphazardly to all appearances, and there were white
circles about his eyes. Suspended from his neck was a dagger of
cassowary-bone, a venomous-looking thing, single edged and bound
about the haft with native twine. On his arms were smoke-blackened
bands of woven grass, and his wrists were encircled by bracelets of
tiny shells and dog's-teeth. His ribs were picked out in white, and
his breast-bone was outlined in red.</p>

<p>As he turned his face side on to the white man to listen to
Bamu's words, Sherwin saw that the space between his nostrils had
been pierced and distended till it formed a hoop that hung below
the line of his mouth. As he sat facing the fire the light lit up
every detail of his wizened face, and revealed an expression of
deep cunning in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder they are all frightened of you, you ugly old
brute," Sherwin thought, as Bamu finished speaking. "You would give
anybody the creeps. Now, here comes the rest of the gang."</p>

<p>A number of men were coming from the cubicles, and as they
reached the fire they squatted in a circle of which Olpo was in the
centre. They were all old men, chiefs of various kinds. One of them
was the man who greeted the trader with the word "Tomorrow!"
Sherwin nodded to them and one or two replied with a grunt, but the
others seated themselves in perfect silence and stared straight at
the small, decorated figure in the centre.</p>

<p>Presently Olpo began to speak. His voice was husky with age, and
he dwelt on the guttural sounds in a way that was particularly
displeasing to the European ear. Sherwin tried to catch a word or
two that he could recognise, but failed. The other men neither
moved nor spoke when the sorcerer finished, and in a stillness that
seemed strangely tense and full of expectancy, Bamu began his
translation of Olpo's words "He say white misi make too much
trouble al'gether. Ship broke, crew dead, bye-em-bye plenty
sickness come and al'ogether people dead. This thing no happen
before. When white misi come, plenty no-good thing happen. Must be
white misi make puripuri." He stopped and the squatted circle
grunted approvingly.</p>

<p>"I know all about that," Sherwin said impatiently. "Go on!"</p>

<p>"Olpo say more better be make one big puri-puri, one big, strong
puri-puri to make white misi go 'way."</p>

<p>The white man laughed out loud&mdash;a laugh that seemed
strangely foreign to that atmosphere of gloom and superstition and
gruesome relics. "Do you think your miserable puri-puri will make
her go away?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was no response, the natives sat like graven images, their
eyes centred on the fire. Sherwin stood up, the skull still in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Your puri-puri no can make people do things," he said
derisively. "Puri-puri no can hurt white people." He lifted the
skull high above his head and made as though to throw it to the
floor. The men looked at him, alarm showiug in their faces. The
skull was a valuable treasure, as Sherwin knew by the care that had
been used in its preservation, and its destruction would be a
serious loss.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="im3" id="im3"></a><img src=
"1900891h-images/Image-3.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">He lifted the skull high above his head and made
as though to throw it on the floor.

<p>From his knowledge of native
customs, and from the fact that he had found it in a place of honor
near the doorway, Sherwin guessed it might be the skull of a great
chief or sorcerer and, as such, particularly valuable.</p>

<p>"Tell that ugly old fiend to use his puri-puri in stopping me
from smashing this thing," he said, and Bamu, grasping the import
of his words, uttered a few hurried sentences to Olpo. One or two
of the others sprang up and reached for some bamboo head-knives
hanging on the wall near by, but Sherwin pushed them aside. He
stood up, and for a full minute watched the sorcerer, the skull
still high above his head. Then, with all his might, he threw the
thing to the floor where the brittle bones, frail and half-rotten
with age, smashed to a hundred bits. The natives gasped and jumped
towards him, but Sherwin had been too long amongst natives not to
know how to handle them. A couple of well-directed blows on the
stomachs of the first pair doubled-up the recipients and deterred
the rest.</p>

<p>Olpo never moved; he sat as still and composedly as though
nothing out of the way had happened.</p>

<p>"Ask him what will happen if white misi no go away?" Sherwin
commanded. Bamu looked from the face of his master to that of the
sorcerer, and did as he was bidden.</p>

<p>Olpo uttered a single sentence in reply&mdash;and uttered it in
a tone so colorless that the threat in it was glaringly
obvious.</p>

<p>"He say might be white misi dead one-time quick."</p>

<p>A sudden fear gripped Sherwin's heart. He knew that a sorcerer
with a reputation to maintain would not hesitate to have the food
of his victim poisoned or one of certain species of snake that was
particularly venemous hidden in a bed. In a case like this, a
threat from a man like Olpo was something more than mere words, and
Sherwin knew that serious trouble would ensue if he did not take
immediate steps to stop it.</p>

<p>He sprang at the sorcerer and wound his fingers about his
wrinkled throat.</p>

<p>"I'll put a stop to your scheming!" he roared, throwing the man
to the floor. The others were taken by surprise, and for a second
they hesitated as to what to do. Olpo was gasping and striving to
tear away the powerful fingers that were choking his life out.</p>

<p>"That will do you," said Sherwin, rising just as the other men
were about to rush. "I don't want to kill you; as a matter of fact
I don't want to have anything to do with you at all. But, by God,
if you get up to any more of your tricks, I'll wring your scraggy
neck all same bird!" He looked at the sorcerer groaning on the
floor and turned rapidly.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way!" He pushed the men aside and strode up the
passage. He was half-way along when the opening of the doorway
darkened suddenly and a voice cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Sherwin! Mr. Sherwin!" and Ellen's form squeezed
through.</p>

<p>The trader ran to her side at once. "What is the matter? You
must not come in here. No women are allowed to enter this place.
Outside, quickly!" Without giving her a chance to remonstrate, he
pushed her back through the doorway, and then helped her from the
porch to the ground.</p>

<p>When they stood on the beach beside the "Mokohu" the man saw
that the girl's eyes were blazing and her cheeks flushed right
up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson!" she exclaimed, panting. "He is a horrible man! I
asked him if he were angry with me and he flew into a temper and
said&mdash;" She hid her face in her hands, and burst into a fit of
weeping. Sherwin slipped his arm around her, and drew her down on
to the sand. "Don't take any notice of it," he said, endeavoring to
soothe her by stroking her hair and patting her shoulders.</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands again, her body shaking
convulsively with sobs. A number of natives crowded round,
whispering excitedly amongst themselves. From a word or two that he
could not help recognising, Sherwin realised that the news of
Olpo's threat to put a stop to Ellen's witchery had got about the
village already, and these onlookers regarded the girl's evident
distress as a manifestation of the sorcerer's influence. "See how
quickly Olpo punished his enemies," they said...</p>

<p>Sherwin drove them off at last, and as Ellen was now more
composed, he helped her up and took her along the beach to the
station. Ellen did not speak, and Sherwin, not wishing to intrude
upon her thoughts, refrained from addressing her. He kept his arm
around her, for the girl was shaken and in need of support. He
helped her as he would have helped a sick mate, and was glad he
could be of some assistance. But as they reached the gate of the
compound, a feeling that he would give anything to kiss this girl
who leaned on him swept over him like a tidal wave. He flushed and
trembled as though with ague, and the veins of his forehead stood
out hard. Ellen sensed there was something wrong with him, for
suddenly she disengaged his arm and asked as they entered the gate
of the compound:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you cold? You are shivering."</p>

<p>"N-o!" Sherwin stammered, clenching his fists in an effort to
regain his self control. v</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. WILSON SHIFTS CAMP</h2>

<p>On reaching the house, Ellen went straight to her room. There
was no sign of Wilson, but the cook-boy informed Sherwin that soon
after Ellen had run out of the house to the village, the mate had
gone off along the river bank.</p>

<p>"He come 'nother kind, that feller," the boy added. "Too much
wild al'ogether. When I ask him if he want morning tea, he tell me
go hell one-time quick. I no savee what's matter he wild longa
me."</p>

<p>Sherwin assured the boy that he was in no way the cause of
Wilson's anger, and then he sent him with a cup of tea to Ellen. He
drank off a stiff nip of brandy, for the experience in the Dubu had
shaken him more than he had suspected at the time, and then he left
the house and went in search of Wilson.</p>

<p>The mate was behaving very ridiculously, he thought, as he
turned on to the river beach. He wondered how anyone could be so
untrustful of a girl like Ellen. And, anyway, even if his absurd
conclusions were correct, he had no right to insult the girl in
that fashion. Sherwin's blood boiled as he thought of Ellen's
distress. His fingers itched for a grip of Wilson's throat, and he
was glad that he would have an opportunity of meeting him away from
the girl's presence.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that his first duty was to keep cool, and
with an effort that was distinctly physical he forced back his
anger. The thought that the girl had flown to him in her trouble
and that weeping on his shoulder had comforted her to a certain
extent, helped him to regain his self-control. And a cool head was
needed more than anything just then. For, beside the business with
Wilson, there was a village-full of natives whose attitude towards
himself and Ellen was distinctly hostile. Olpo and the other chiefs
would lose no time in endeavoring to make trouble, and Sherwin was
the only one who had any chance of handling them. At any time there
might be occasion for that quick thinking and rapidity of decision
that so often makes one man a power against a multitude. Sherwin
had more than once been in tight places when the question of life
or death had quivered like a needle between the poles of an
electro-magnet, and such experiences had taught him the value of
calmness and deliberation in the face of an excited, hostile
mob.</p>

<p>He found Wilson sitting on a beached canoe about three hundred
yards from the house. The man looked up at his approach and jumped
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Good morning," the trader said coolly. "I've been looking for
you."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you want?" Wilson snapped, his face
scowling.</p>

<p>"Merely to ask you what you meant by speaking to Miss Russell as
you did awhile ago. You have distressed her very much."</p>

<p>The line of Wilson's lips loosened and his eyebrows went up in a
sneer.</p>

<p>"She knew where to go for consolatiou, then," he said, nastily.
"Could you not soothe her?"</p>

<p>Sherwin's fists closed involuntarily, but he answered
calmly:</p>

<p>"I am afraid such an houor is not for me. Now, I would like to
explain that you are making a hideous mistake. I could not tell you
about it before, for there were other things to be done first. But
it does not matter now."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose it does not. You keep her; I don't want her. I'm
not going to put foot inside your house again. I'll send a nigger
for my things." He turned and started to walk away. Sherwin reached
out and grasped his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" he said, keeping his tone level with an
effort. "You don't understand. Just listen till I tell
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" Wilson shouted, tearing himself free. "Keep your
explanations and the girl too. I don't want to have anything to do
with either of you. There she is coming for you now." He pointed
back along the beach, and Sherwin, turning, saw Ellen
approaching.</p>

<p>Wilson swung on his heel and took a couple of strides in the
direction of the village. Then he looked back over his shoulder and
said angrily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can't hoodwink a man who has lived in a city as I have;
I've seen too much."</p>

<p>Sherwin watched his figure go up the beach and turn in amongst
the coconuts of the village. Then he felt for his pipe and matches,
saying to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Personally, I think that if his ideas of women are
representative of those of city people, I'm glad I live in the
wilds. Also, if Ellen had not appeared at the moment she did,
nothing would have prevented me from giving him a thrashing."</p>

<p>He walked back slowly and met the approaching girl.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I saw you go and came after you," she said. "I guessed
you were lookiug for Mr. Wilson, and I wanted to prevent you and he
coming to blows."</p>

<p>"You did," Sherwin said with a little laugh. "You appeared just
at the right moment. Now, don't think about him any more, and let
us get back to the house."</p>

<p>"I thought he was such a nice boy on the 'Mokohu,'" Ellen said,
as they neared the station. "We were great friends. He looked after
my comfort and was very good in every way. He and I spent a great
deal of time in one another's company, and Captain Morton took a
delight in teasing me about it. I am dreadfully disappointed in
him. I don't know how he can be so foolish as to go on the way he
is going."</p>

<p>"Don't think any more about it," Sherwin repeated. "When he
finds out his mistake he will apologise readily enough."</p>

<p>Ellen drew herself up and looked straight at him.</p>

<p>"I never want to speak to or see him again," she said, with more
than a touch of bitterness. "I hate him!"</p>

<p>"He won't annoy you any more," the trader assured her. "He is
not going to live in the house agaiu. He will probably make the
wrecked schooner his home till Captain Morton returns."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," she said simply. "It would be unendurable to
have to meet him every hour of the day."</p>

<p>A pair of double canoes were drawn up to the bank beside the
station, and a dozen meu and women were unloading coconuts and
carrying them into the compound. Sherwin stopped to watch them for
a moment, then he addressed a man whose bearing seemed to indicate
he was some sort of chief or leader:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You come from Lahari?"</p>

<p>The man nodded, staring at Ellen, wonder at her appearance
showing in his eyes. "Yes, Taubada. We bring coconuts for you,
because we hear you got plenty tobacco and calico now."</p>

<p>"He is from one of the up-river villages," Sherwin said to
Ellen. "Lahari supplies me with a lot of coconuts." He turned to
the native:&mdash;"You been longa my village?"</p>

<p>"No; we come longa station one-time."</p>

<p>"You no hear about puri-puri?"</p>

<p>The man's face assumed a startled expression, and the others
near by dropped their coconuts and crowded up.</p>

<p>"What puri-puri? We no hear-im."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," Sherwin said, and put them off with questions
about the quantity of coconuts they had.</p>

<p>As he and Ellen turned away, the girl asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is puri-puri? It seems to be something the natives
dread."</p>

<p>"Superstition, witchcraft, sorcery. It is a very powerful factor
in their lives." He thought it as well to give her a hint that all
was not right in the village. "The natives here have got some very
sill; notions into their heads lately, and I wanted to find out if
the up-river people had been affected. If you should see any of my
people somewhat strange in their manner, you will know what is the
matter."</p>

<p>"But I don't know what is the matter," Ellen objected with a
smile. "You haven't told me what the trouble is."</p>

<p>Sherwin debated in his mind as to the advisability of putting
her in full possession of the facts. Would it do any good if she
knew the natives accused her of being a witch and were ready to
blame any and every mishap to her influence? he asked himself. He
decided that the situation would not be improved by her possessing
such knowledge, and that she would only be the more worried and
upset.</p>

<p>"It's not worth bothering about," he answered. "You would not
credit the foolishness of some of the notions natives get into
their heads at times. Now, would you like to see copra in the
process of manufacture?"</p>

<p>"I would very much indeed," she replied, and Sherwin,
congratulating himself that he had successfully diverted the
conversation from the subject of puri-puri, took her to the
drying-house, where a number of natives were engaged in splitting
coconuts.</p>

<p>The drying-house was a long, narrow building, low-roofed and
with numerous trays projecting upon ruuners from the sides. Each of
these trays was a few inches deep and about six feet long by two
wide, with a bottom of split bamboo. The building faced the east,
so that the trays on both sides received the maximum amount of
sunlight. The natives were splitting the coconuts by means of small
axes or tomahawks. Some were very expert, a single blow resulting
in the nut being split in two equal-sized pieces.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Ellen said, "before I saw them growing, I thought
the complete coconuts were the round, hairy things we used to buy
in the shops. I had no idea that they were merely the kernels, and
that in their natural state there was a thick husk around
them."</p>

<p>"A lot of people 'down South' have that impression, I am
afraid," Sherwin laughed.</p>

<p>Together they watched the split nuts being placed on the ground
with the white flesh upright. The water, or "milk" ran away in a
little gutter, or was soaked up by the porus sand.</p>

<p>"We leave them like that for a day or so, and then, when the
action of the sun-heat has loosened the 'flesh' sufficiently to
allow of its easy extraction, it is taken out, cut into small
pieces, and placed upon the trays for drying. At night the trays
have to be pushed into the house, or the dew would make the
finished article all specked. In some places, especially where
there is such a lot of heavy weather as to make sun-drying almost
impossible, artificial heat is used. Such copra does not bring as
high a price as the sun-dried, and there is a lot of work in making
and attending to the kilns. This place is lucky enough to have
plenty of sunlight."</p>

<p>"It is very interesting," Ellen said. "But I must have a look at
the stove in the kitchen. I was making up a nice luncheon when I
ran after you to the village. So, if you will excuse me, I'll see
how it is getting on."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think that the lunch is of greater interest
than the manufacture of copra," Sherwin laughed, as the girl left
him and went to the house. "It's many a year since I had a real
white lady to cook for me."</p>

<p>The Lahari men soon finished carrying their coconuts to the
station, and Sherwin took them to the storehouse and paid them. It
was a long job, for some of the men wanted tobacco and jew's harps,
while others asked for sheath-knives, glass beads, leather belts
with imitation-silver buckles, and fishing lines. The women had no
voice in the matter, although, as Sherwin well knew, they had done
most of the collecting of the coconuts. They hovered at the
doorway, content in the knowledge that their husbands would present
them with a small portion of the "trade" later on. Most of the sets
of items asked for were in excess of the value of the respective
lots of coconuts, and there was much bargaining and wrangling
before the final deal was completed.</p>

<p>But Sherwin got them out at last and shut the door.</p>

<p>"There won't be much trading as soon as the villages get to hear
about the puri-puri," he said to himself. "I wonder how long they
will be able to keep away? Every village for fifty miles around is
short of tobacco, and that's a thing they can't stand for long.
Olpo will have to show his power very soon, or lack of tobacco and
other things will drive the people to trading as usual." He glanced
at the nut-splitters. "My own boys will probably stick to me,
mainly because there are several months' wages due to them which
they would be afraid of losing if they deserted."</p>

<p>Ellen called from the verandah that luncheon was ready, and
Sherwin went to the house, his eyes fixed on the slight figure in
white awaiting him at the top of the steps.</p>

<p>"Her safety is in my hands," he muttered. "It's up to me to keep
very careful guard over the little lady."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. SHERWIN KEEPS
WATCH</h2>

<p>All through the afternoon natives came and went about the
station, and although Sherwin watched them very carefully, he
failed to detect anything suggestive of coming trouble. Several
canoe-loads of coconuts and semi-dried copra arrived from up-river
villages, and supplies of fish and native vegetables came to hand
as usual. Sherwin was well aware that the news of his defiance of
Olpo by smashing a treasured skull and the accusations against
Ellen were rapidly permeating throughout the district. In a day or
two not a village for half 'a hundred miles around would be in
ignorance of the happenings at Wallala, for, as in most black
countries, there is a system of bush telegraphing that approaches
the marvellous. From then on every native in the district would be
on the <i>qui vive</i> to hear of Olpo manifesting his power, of
him showing his might in such a way as would leave no manner of
doubt as to the infallibility of the punishment that would befall
those who dared to defy the great sorcerer.</p>

<p>Sherwin came to the conclusion that Olpo had not put a tabu on
trading, that the natives were to go about their business as usual,
and not attempt any interference with the whites for the time being
at any rate. This was evidently an illustration of the cunning that
had given Olpo his powerful position; he knew that if the trading
were stopped the consequent tobacco shortage would make the people
very restless. Olpo had probably instructed the Wallala people to
leave everything to him and the other chiefs.</p>

<p>About four o'clock a native came from the village for Wilson's
belongings, and Sherwin wrapped them up in a blanket and gave them
to him.</p>

<p>"That white man stop longa schooner." The native volunteered the
information. "He been clean out cabin. I think you two feller row,"
he added with a leer. "You been chuck him out?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. That white man got tucker?"</p>

<p>"Plen'y. He find-em tin meat and biscuits longa one locker. I
think you feller been forget them thing."</p>

<p>"Wilson has found a store of foodstuffs we must have
overlooked," Sherwin said to Ellen, when the native had gone. "I
was wondering what he was going to do for food."</p>

<p>"So he will not need to send or come here for supplies," Ellen
said. "I'm glad. I never want to see him again."</p>

<p>"Are you not a bit hard on him?" Sherwin asked. "He is making a
mistake, and a horrible one at that, but, at the same time, he is
showing how much he thought of you."</p>

<p>"And how little now!" Ellen's tone was almost vicious. "The fact
that he can think of me as he does steels me against him. I am
driven to the conclusion that he has an evil mind which influences
his judgment of others. A man like that is anathema to me!"</p>

<p>They had supper at the table on the verandah, and Sherwin gazed
his fill at the beauty and grace of the girl who sat opposite him
and poured out the tea. It was a full half-hour before dark, for
the trader preferred having the evening meal before the hordes of
mosquitoes arrived, and the last rays of the sinking sun pierced
the interstices of the blinds and lit up the girl's face and head
so that the bronze in her hair shone like new gold. She was wearing
a blouse of some light material that left uninterrupted the sloping
outline of her shoulders and the swell of her breast. The man
noticed for the first time that her arms were exquisitely moulded,
and her wrists and hands full of a delicate strength. Framed in
golden sunlight against the grey-brown thatch of the wall, she
seemed a very wonderful creature to the man who, for ten years, had
seen no feminine thing more handsome than coarse-featured native
girls. But while he intensely admired her mere animal beauty, it
was before the goodness that seemed to radiate from her that he
bowed in reverence. He did not attempt to conceal from himself that
a decade of exile from his fellows might render him a poor judge of
female beauty, and that any white-skinned woman might seem the acme
of loveliness by comparison with the copper complexioned natives he
saw every day. But he believed that a life in the open, close
contact with nature and real things, kept the mind healthy and
clean, and enabled one to recognise purity of soul. It was one of
his tenets that purity and sincerity recognised those qualities in
another. Peter Sherwin's life had been a straight one in every
sense, and Ellen's clean-mindedness made to him a powerful
appeal.</p>

<p>He smoked a pipe on the verandah after supper and for awhile he
and the girl talked of various topics connected with life in New
Guinea. He told her of the cannibal tribes in the regions of the
Upper-Purari, of the difficulties of trading with certain villages
that always demanded more than a fair price for their products, and
he spoke of the sago-makers in the swamps and the women who carried
enormous loads upon their heads.</p>

<p>"What a colorful life!" Ellen exclaimed. "How different to the
hum-drum of the cities of civilisation! I can't understand how so
many men&mdash;strong, young men&mdash;are content to fritter their
lives away at monotonous office tasks in a crowded city when there
is a life like this to be had for the taking. I know which I would
prefer if I were a man."</p>

<p>"But it's not always as pleasant as you seem to think," Sherwin
said. "There is another side besides the rosy. Think of the fever
and lack of proper white-man food. Then there is plenty of the
sordid and horrible. An epidemic, for instance. I've seen sights in
stricken villages that kept me awake for weeks, and even now I see
them in my dreams at times. When the dysentery ravaged the villages
east of Cape Possession&mdash;but there," he broke off, "I won't
distress you." He rose and knocked the ashes out of his pipe
against the railing. "I told Bamu to fix up my bunk under the
house," he said. "I'll go and see if he has done it."</p>

<p>"But why are you shifting from your usual place on the
verandah?" Ellen asked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I thought it was&mdash;er&mdash;hardly the thing
to&mdash;" He stuttered and paused. "It will be cooler there, and
as the house is seven feet off the ground, there is plenty of
room," he said hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Now please don't be silly and absurdly conventional. There is
no reason why you should put yourself out because of me."</p>

<p>"But people will talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let them!" Her tone was very scornful. "I did not think you
would be so seusitive of other people's opinions."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of you."</p>

<p>"In that case, you will occupy your usual place." She smiled and
took his hand. "It is very nice of you to be so thoughtful, and I
fully appreciate it, but I would not be happy if I thought you were
inconveniencing yourself on my behalf."</p>

<p>But Sherwin was determined. "No, Miss Russell," he said firmly.
"It won't do. I'm not going to have every low-down white and
beachcomber from Moresby to Samarai talking about you. And,
bessides, now that Wilson is away, the business of looking after
the cargo devolves on me. Some of the natives might take it into
their heads to try a bit of pilfering any night, and from under the
house there is an uninterrupted view." He held out his haud.
"Goodnight."</p>

<p>Then, before she could make any further protest, he went along
the verandah and down the steps.</p>

<p>Sherwin had auother object in sleeping under the house. That
portion of the "Mokohu's" cargo which could not be stacked in the
storeroom had beeu filed in two rows under the living house. A
clear space ran down the centre from end to end and left an
unobstructed view of both the front and back steps. Sherwin had had
his bunk placed in the centre of this space in such a position that
a man lying on it could see either steps by merely turning his
head. From the verandah above there was no such command of the
approaches to the house, and Sherwin had resolved that if Olpo the
sorcerer attempted to get into the house at night he would make the
most of every opportunity of seeing him.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it would be as well if I told her about the
puri-puri business and put her on her guard?" he asked himself as
he lay down and drew the mosquito curtain. "I know she is not
lacking in courage, and that she has plenty of spirit. But a thing
like this might unnerve her." He lay thinking it over for awhile,
and then decided not to tell her for a day or two at least; perhaps
by that time the whole business would have blown over. Indeed, it
might well be, he thought, that Olpo was disinclined to try his
tricks upon Europeans for fear of the loss of prestige failure
would bring upon him. In that case, Sherwin would only be alarming
the girl for nothing. He resolved to lie awake each night, and keep
careful watch of the steps, making up in the daytime for the loss
of sleep. Up till the time the moon rose it would be fairly dark,
but the light of the stars was sufficient to give him a clear view
round the house and its approaches.</p>

<p>But nothing happened that night. Up till midnight, or
thereabouts, there was the sound of a pair of softly-beaten
tom-toms in the village and a subdued chorus of chanting natives.
No one came near the house, and soon after the first of the
daylight flushed the sky, the watcher fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened about ten o'clock by Ellen. The girl was
standing at his side with a cup of coffee and some biscuits.</p>

<p>"How soundly you sleep!" she exclaimed. "I thought you would
never wake. It is long past breakfast time, but when Bamu told me
you had not yet risen, I thought you might not like to be
disturbed. So, I let you sleep on. You are not ill, are you?"</p>

<p>Sherwin rose and stretched himself and rubbed his eyes, which he
felt were a tell-tale red.</p>

<p>"I believe you have been awake all night," Ellen said, looking
at him sharply. "Could you not sleep?"</p>

<p>"Not very well. Ten o'clock!" Sherwin said, glancing at the
position of the sun. "I never slept in so long in my life."</p>

<p>"I knew you would not be comfortable down here," Ellen said.
"But you would not listen to me. Now, come and have your
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Nothing happened to disturb you in the night?" he asked, as he
sat down at the table on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Why do you ask? Lapa and another woman slept on the
floor beside me, and they never moved till it was time to get
up."</p>

<p>Sherwin changed the subject then, and when he finished his
belated breakfast, he left the house and went to where a number of
natives with strings of coconuts were awaiting him.</p>

<p>Several parties of men and women came from the village during
the morning and traded coconuts and copra for tobacco and calico.
They behaved in their usual manner and one of them informed him
that Wilson had fixed up the cabin of the "Mokohu" into a living
house, and had purchased some bananas and other fruit from the
villagers. They gave the trader the usual village
tittle-tattle&mdash;one of the young men had speared an extra large
rock cod; an old coconut tree belonging to Barr, the canoe-maker,
had fallen from old age; did the Taubada know that the Laharis were
going to have a big feast next time the moon was full? Bamu's
cousin, who was married to a Kerema woman was sick and his little
son was hot as though with a fever.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Bamu's cousin?" Sherwin asked.</p>

<p>"We feller no savee. Sometimes he hot; sometimes he cold. He get
'nother kind sickness."</p>

<p>When they had gone, Sherwin went back to the house.</p>

<p>"It might be a case of malaria&mdash;natives do get it
sometimes&mdash;or just a common cold," he said to Ellen. "But I
will go to the village and see. I'm that jumpy about the epidemic
that I would not be able to rest till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll come, too," Ellen said at once. "Just wait till I get my
hat. I don't like to think of those poor people being sick when
perhaps I can help them." She ran into her room and reappeared a
moment later with her Panama.</p>

<p>Sherwin told himself he was a fool for having mentioned anything
about going to the village, and he cast about in his mind for an
excuse for leaving her behind. Knowing what he knew, he deemed it
highly inadvisable for her to go near the village.</p>

<p>"Don't you bother," he said, lamely. "I'll run along and come
back immediately. There is probably nothing much the matter."</p>

<p>Ellen laughed. "Your mind has become easier about it being the
epidemic all of a sudden. Now, come on. You left me behind once
before when I wanted to go, but I am determined this time." She
went to the steps, and Sherwin, seeing that it was no use
protesting further, followed obediently.</p>

<p>Bamu caught up to them when they were midway to the village. He
had run all the way from the station, and he panted for breath as
the man and the girl stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p>"You go look cousin belong me?" he asked, addressing Sherwin,
but looking at Ellen out of the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Yes," the trader answered. "I hear he sick feller."</p>

<p>Bamu shook his head vigorously. "No more! He all right. He no
sick little bit. More better leave him."</p>

<p>"But I heard from some of the people he is sick, and son belong
him, too."</p>

<p>"They gammon. Them two feller all right, number one."</p>

<p>"He seems very anxious to convince us that there is no need for
us seeing his cousin," Ellen remarked, her tone showing she
suspected Bamu of a hidden motive. "But, since we are so near, we
might as well go on."</p>

<p>"More better leave him," Bamu said, as the pair started again.
"No good you look him." There was a hint of threat in his voice,
and Sherwin turned on him savagely "Get back to your work! Hurry! I
don't want an old coot like you telling me what to do, or not to
do!" He took a stride in the other's direction, and Bamu hung his
head and turned back for the station. But, after he had gone fifty
yards, or so, the white man saw him go to the very edge of the
water, stop, and make a number of signals with his hands. Some men
were spearing fish in the shallows of the backwash in front of the
village, and one of them waved in reply and at once went to the
houses.</p>

<p>Sherwin was relieved to see that Ellen had not noticed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE COMING OF THE
EPIDEMIC</h2>

<p>The natives crowded out of the village on to the beach at the
approach of Ellen and Sherwin. For a moment they stood looking and
chattering excitedly; then they scattered amongst the palms, some
going to the houses, others making for the bush at the rear.</p>

<p>"Whatever is the matter with them?" Ellen asked. "They seem
frightened or something."</p>

<p>Her companion did not answer, and presently he got hold of one
of the men and asked him the whereabouts of the house of Bamu's
cousin. The native looked affrightedly at Ellen and mumbled that he
did not understand. Whereupon Sherwin took him by the hair and
shook him roughly. "No humbug, now! Show me house, one-time
quick!"</p>

<p>"Nobody sick," the native said, wriggling. "Cousin belong Bamu
go take spear and look for magani (wallaby)." He pointed towards
the bush generally.</p>

<p>The white man wound his fingers in the other's fuzzy hair very
tightly and glared into his eyes. Ellen was looking on wonderingly
from a little distance off. Sherwin lowered his voice so that she
could not hear, but there was no mistaking the meaning and
earnestness of his tone.</p>

<p>"You show me that house damn quick"&mdash;he hissed the
words&mdash;"or might be some very bad thing happen longa you." He
directed the man's glance towards Ellen. The native understood at
once; the white man was threatening him with the magical powers of
the white misi if he did not obey at once&mdash;and did not
everybody know what a powerful sorcerer the white misi was? He
hesitated, mumbled and looked from one white to the other. Then he
suddenly made up his mind.</p>

<p>"House here," he said, and led the way along the village street.
He stopped at a house near the far end, and Sherwin and Ellen
climbed the shaky ladder and squeezed through the narrow doorway.
The interior was very dark and smelling vilely of the odors
consequent on lack of ventilation. Sherwin burst a portion of the
thatch of the wall and let in the light.</p>

<p>Lying in a corner, his head supported on a pillow that was
merely a lump of wood, was a man. He was entirely nude, and he lay
flat on his back on the bare, uneven floor. His eyes were closed,
and over the lids trickled two or three tiny streams of blood from
a series of incisions in his forehead. On his breast was a mess of
macerated grass, from which the moisture still oozed. He was a man
of about middle age, as evidenced by the roundness of his limbs;
but his face was drawn and shrunken, as though old age had come to
one portion of his body alone.</p>

<p>Beside him sat three women in grass petticoats. Their hair and
faces were smeared with whitish clay till they looked like a circus
clown that had forgotten to redden his nose and cheeks. One of them
held a bundle that seemed mostly grass-mat and banana-cloth. They
had been moaning softly as Sherwin and Ellen entered, but stopped
as the broken wall let in the light. They looked up blinking, fear
and consternation in the expressions.</p>

<p>Sherwin pushed them aside and, kneeling, examined the man.</p>

<p>"Decidedly feverish," he said. "That's bad. I am afraid its the
rubeola, right enough. The thing has sneaked in somehow. It was
foolish to expect it could be kept out for ever. It will go clean
through the village now."</p>

<p>"But it might not be," Ellen began.</p>

<p>"I hope not, but I don't like the look of this fellow. Even the
natives recognise that he has something seriously wrong with him.
See, they have been cutting his forehead to let out a pain, and
this poultice on his chest indicates that he has been complaining
of being hot. Headache and a temperature are very unfavorable
symptoms."</p>

<p>"But they might only indicate malaria or common influenza,"
Ellen said. "I think you are so anxious about the other thing as to
suspect it where it does not exist."</p>

<p>The man on the floor remained in his coma-like sleep, breathing
heavily and irregularly. As Sherwin stood up again the women
renewed their moaning, and one began stroking the sick man's arm. A
number of faces appeared at the doorway, and from somewhere outside
came an excited whispering.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bundle in the lap of one of the women beside the
sick man moved, and the cry of a child filled the house. Before the
women had time to resist, Ellen picked up the bundle and stripped
its filthy covering. The child was a boy about a year old,
chubby-limbed and scanty-haired. Its tiny fingers wound themselves
in Ellen's blouse, and it buried its small black face with its
tear-reddened eyes in a manner that indicated it recognised in the
girl a protector and a friend.</p>

<p>"Poor little mite," Ellen cooed. "Is oo very sick? Don't oo
cry." She stroked and hugged and petted it, a stream of baby-talk
flowing from her lips. The women looked up uneasily, the faces in
the doorway packed closer, a voice or two murmured threateningly.
But the girl held the sobbing black form tight against the white of
her dress and swayed her body to the chant of her words of comfort,
all else forgotten save the knowledge that here was something in
need of mothering.</p>

<p>She stood in the centre of the house, the light from the hole in
the wall lighting up her face and revealing an expression of
infinite pity. Sherwin's eyes had never seen a sight that made such
a strong appeal to all that was manly in him, and once again the
desire to wind his arms about this girl surged over him. For a full
minute he stared at her; then a movement at his feet attracted his
attention.</p>

<p>The sick man had turned on his side, and, as Sherwin knelt
beside him again, his eyes opened. He started and sat bolt
upright.</p>

<p>"No, no," he screamed, and his arm shot out and pointed at
Ellen. "Puri-puri! Puri-puri! I no like! I no like!" He turned
appealingly to Sherwin. "Taubada, you no let them make puri-puri! I
no want!" His voice shrilled to a high falsetto, in which the
prevailing note was of terrifying, agonising fear.</p>

<p>"No puri-puri," Sherwin said soothingly, pressing him back. "All
good friend for you. You no fright." The sick man, exhausted and
short of breath, lay quiet, but his eyes rolled from side to side
and his lips moved with unuttered entreaty.</p>

<p>One of the women jumped up and snatched the child from Ellen's
arms and pushed her way through the crowd at the doorway and
out.</p>

<p>"Did she think I was going to hurt the little dear?" Ellen asked
wonderingly. "She seemed quite angry. And what did that man mean by
shrieking and pointing at me like that?"</p>

<p>"Natives are queer cattle," Sherwin said. "They get all sorts of
strange ideas into their heads. It's all right. Don't take any
notice."</p>

<p>"What did that man mean by screaming 'puri-puri' at me?" Ellen
asked again.</p>

<p>But Sherwin was saved from the awkwardness of answering by the
sick man coughing&mdash;a nasty, sniffling coughing that seemed to
be almost entirely nasal.</p>

<p>"Catarrh," Sherwin said anxiously. "Rubeola is usually preceded
by it. I don't think there can be any doubt now. What are we to do?
To order complete isolation of this house is useless, for even if I
were obeyed there can be no manner of doubt that other natives are
affected by this time."</p>

<p>He examined the man again. "I'll get some stuff out of the
medicine chest at the station and see that it is taken. Not that
medicine is much good in cases like this without proper nursing and
attention, but it's the best I can do. Let us get out of this."</p>

<p>The crowd at the doorway dispersed at the approach of the pair,
and by the time they reached the ground the natives were scattering
in all directions.</p>

<p>"I can't make them out at all," Ellen remarked, as they reached
the beach. "I verily believe they arc afraid of me! Do I look a
very terrifying sort of person, Mr. Sherwin?"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Not exactly. But the nigs have never seen a
white woman before, you know, and they don't quite know what to
make of you. I did not see anything of Wilson," he added, by way of
diverting the conversation. "I wonder how he puts in the time. I'll
bet he feels it somewhat lonely."</p>

<p>"Only what he deserves," Ellen said shortly. For a time she was
silent, her brows bent thoughtfully. Then she asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done if this epidemic is really here? It seems
criminal that these people should suffer and die if we can assist
them in any way. Is the German measles as fatal as you think? I
thought it was mainly a children's disease, and not so very
dangerous at that."</p>

<p>"That is so in civilisation. But natives go down and out to
complaints that are almost harmless to Europeans. The trouble is
that such complaints are foreign, and the constitutions of the
natives are not able to successfully resist them. No; you will find
this disease a very fatal one before it is wiped out of these
parts."</p>

<p>"All the more reason then that we should bestir ourselves. You
have plenty of medicine and things, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Medicine is not much good; it's nursing and attention that are
required. And isolation of cases. But what's the use of telling the
niggers not to go into houses where there are sick people? They
won't obey. It is their custom to gather beside a sick person and
howl and wail and go on with a whole lot of ceremony. No power
other than that of force will prevent them. Isolation would stop
the spread of the disease quicker than anything, but how it could
be managed I don't know."</p>

<p>Ellen was again silent for a time. Then she said brightly:
"Perhaps we are worrying ourselves for nothing. It may not be
rubeola at all."</p>

<p>But Sherwin was pessimistic. "I wish I could only hope so. But I
am afraid there can be no doubt about it. The next stage will be an
eruption on the man's skin, within the next couple of days, or so.
By that time there will be a score of cases."</p>

<p>For the rest of the day Ellen went about her self-imposed
household duties in a very thoughtful manner. Sherwin wondered what
she had in mind, for he knew she was thinking about the epidemic.
Once or twice he tried to draw her out, but she skilfully dodged
the subject, and it was not until he was enjoying his after-supper
smoke on the verandah that she enlightened him.</p>

<p>The sea-breeze had continued further into the night than had
been its wont for the last few days, and the coconuts rustled as
though their time for sleep had not yet come. The air was filled
with the droning sounds of the night&mdash;the hum of mosquitoes,
the buzz of hard-shelled beetles about the lamp, the long-drawn-out
oo-oop of an owl in the palms. From the natives' quarters came the
sound of Bamu's voice in a subdued chant, and from the village came
the usual beating of a tom-tom. Sherwin was leaning back with his
feet on the railing when Ellen dragged up a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>"I've thought it all out," she said. "And with your help there
should be no difficulty. The three of us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three!" Sherwin interjected.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson has got to help, also. In a case like this we can't
afford to let personal dislikes interfere. Now, here is my plan:
The 'Mokohu' would make an ideal quarantine hospital. She is well
clear of the water and is very roomy. We could put a hundred
patients into her. It won't matter much about beds, for the natives
are not accustomed to them anyway The quarantining and attention
are the main things. I suggest that to-morrow morning we take that
man and child to the schooner and keep them there. I will do the
nursing if you and Mr. Wilson will look out for further patients
and see that none of the healthy people get on board."</p>

<p>"But what if Wilson objects? You will be turning him out of his
shelter."</p>

<p>The line of Ellen's mouth set very firm, and her eyes flashed
brightly in the lamplight.</p>

<p>"He must not object," she said. "If you can't make him see the
idea in a favorable light, I will. Now, what do you think of my
plan'?"</p>

<p>Sherwin hardly knew what to think. The natives would most
certainly object to being taken away from their relatives and
placed in the care of the person whom they regarded as a malignant
witch. They would regard such a course as going straight to their
deaths. It would mean taking the sick people by main force and
without assistance from any of the villagers, for it could be
safely counted upon that not a native would lend a hand. Then,
would Wilson help? Sherwin doubted very much if he would.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered slowly. "It's not as simple as it
sounds."</p>

<p>"Now please don't start making difficulties or finding them,"
Ellen said. "I know it's not a simple plan, but there is a chance
of it doing something for those poor people. Think of that baby!
Even now I can feel its little black body, all hot and trembling,
clinging to me. What mere difficulties should we let stand in the
way of saving, or attempting to save, it&mdash;and fifty like it? I
am sure, if you spoke to the natives and explained things, they
would understand and make no protest to our looking after
them."</p>

<p>Sherwin puffed at his pipe without speaking. He knew how utterly
useless it would be to adopt the course of reasoning with the
natives that Ellen suggested, but the light of an idea was
filtering into his mind. Could he work on their belief in
witchcraft in some way? Would it be possible to undermine the power
of Olpo, the sorcerer? At first the thing seemed impossible and
absurd; then he thought he saw a way by which it could be managed.
He took the pipe from his lips and stared out across the darkness,
his forehead creased with thought.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can manage it?" Ellen asked, watching him
closely.</p>

<p>Sherwin started. "I don't know yet," he said slowly. "I will
try."</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" Ellen exclaimed, clapping her hands. "I knew you
would do all you could. I will speak to Mr. Wilson in the
morning."</p>

<p>For a time they sat silent, each thinking of the work that lay
before them; then the girl rose, and, bidding her companion
good-night, went to her room.</p>

<p>In a minute or two she was back. "Not one of the women are here
to-night," she said. "Not even Lapa. I wonder where they have gone.
Every night up till now they have been in the room waiting for
me."</p>

<p>"I expect they are fooling around in the village," Sherwin said,
a sudden fear entering his heart. "They will be along later
on."</p>

<p>"I expect so," she nodded, and retired for the second time.</p>

<p>Sherwin knocked his pipe out and stood up.</p>

<p>"The women have been told not to come to-night," he said to
himself. "I wonder why? Olpo contemplating mischief?"</p>

<p>He went down the steps to his bunk beneath the house and lay
down. The drumming in the village had ceased, although it was yet
quite early, and Bamu's chanting voice was stilled. There was only
the ripple of the surf, the rustling of the coconuts and the hum of
the mosquitoes. The man on the bunk lay thinking hard. Presently he
slipped his hand under the pillow and brought out a heavy revolver
and buckled it about his waist out of sight.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I had better have my little talk with the
niggers at once," he muttered. "Olpo is bent on an early
manifestation of his powers; those women are not staying away
to-night for an idle reason. It's up to me to get in first."</p>

<p>He swung on to the ground and went up on to the verandah.
Tip-toeing, so as not to arouse Ellen, he went to the table and
turned up the lamp to its fullest.</p>

<p>"They'll see the light and think we are not in bed yet," he
muttered again. "She will be safe till I come back."</p>

<p>Then he left the house and went off in the direction of the
village.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. COUNTER
WITCHCRAFT</h2>

<p>For such an early hour the village was unusually quiet. New
Guinea natives love to while away the first of the night with the
gossip of the day or the lazy chanting of favorite dance-tunes to
the accompaniment of a softly beaten tom-tom. In little groups they
will lounge beneath the palms when the heat of the day is done, and
smoke their bamboo pipes or chew beetlenut with much rattling of
lime-pots. Perhaps after a time the languor of the night influences
some of the old men to recitation of folk-lore; to relate, in
subdued tones that carry an ever-deepening sense of the awesome,
tales of the times when fishes talked and mountains were possessed
of mobility. And men and women and children would drink it all in,
the adults knowing that only by word of mouth can their legendary
history be preserved; the children revelling in the mere
narrative.</p>

<p>But as Sherwin entered the village street there were no groups
beneath the palms, no beating of tom-toms. It almost seemed as
though everybody had gone to bed or that the place was deserted.
But on the verandahs of some of the houses small fires glowed, and
now and then there was a murmur of voices. In the darkness the
houses were mere shapes, hazy and indistinct, their roofs lost in
the welter of drooping palm-fronds. To the white man walking along
the deserted street there was an eerie something in this unusual
quiet that sent a trifle of a shudder through him.</p>

<p>Without stopping, he went straight to the Dubu. In the darkness
there was no break between the black hull of the "Mokohu" and the
front of the meetinghouse. Sherwin climbed the ladder and stood for
a moment on the narrow porch, listening intently. Then he loosened
the revolver in its case beneath his pyjama coat and shouted: "All
you feller come here!"</p>

<p>For several seconds there was no response; then a babel of
shouts arose, and a number of figures carrying torches of bundled
grass came running. As the light of the flares lit up the front of
the Dubu, a dozen men pushed through the doorway. There was little
room on the porch, and Sherwin grasped one of the supporting studs
of the wall to prevent being pushed off. He watched the men as they
came out blinking into the light. Presently he heaved sigh of
relief as the small, withered figure of Olpo appeared. Sherwin
worked his way to the side of the sorcerer, and then into a
position so that both were on the front of the porch in clear view
of the people below. By this time the whole of the villagers were
assembled in front of the Dubu, all whispering excitedly. Sherwin
held up his hand to enjoin silence; then, as the voices died away,
he spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who been say white misi big puri-puri feller?" He went straight
to the point. "Who say she make all trouble for this place?"</p>

<p>He paused, as though waiting an answer, and glanced at the
painted sorcerer by his side. Not a man spoke or moved. All eyes
were turned to the pyjama-clad white man standing on the edge of
the porch. He was their Taubada, their master, their source of
supply of all sorts of goods, and they listened in respectful
silence to what he had to say.</p>

<p>"I savee," Sherwin went on. "I savee what all you feller think.
You all think white misi too much strong puri-puri feller. You all
talk like that. Now who been tell you?" He looked round the crowd
of upturned faces and called two or three names. "Ramps, Meo,
Marai, you feller speak. Who been tell you this thing about white
misi?"</p>

<p>The men shuffled uneasily, and one of them said,
hesitatingly:&mdash;"We no savee. We no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You savee right enough. Come on, tell me."</p>

<p>"Might be you too much wild for we feller. You no like we talk
white misi savee make puri-puri."</p>

<p>"I no wild&mdash;," Sherwin began, when Olpo interrupted with a
flow of impassioned words. The sorcerer had drawn himself very
erect, and he rolled his eyes as he spoke and gesticulated. He
delivered his harangue as though in one breath, and, though the
words tumbled over one another till they seemed nothing more than a
disordered succession of guttural sounds, there was no mistaking
their import. The white man standing beside him knew as well as if
he possessed a full knowledge of the language that Olpo was
denouncing Ellen&mdash;that he was categorically evidencing the
troubles that had befallen the village of late as directly due to
her malignant influence.</p>

<p>The natives listened intently, not a man moving or speaking, and
when the sorcerer's declamatory voice reached a shrill falsetto at
the end, and then stopped dead, there was a long-drawn sigh from a
hundred throats, and the crowd began to surge uneasily.</p>

<p>Sherwin waited till they were somewhat still again. Someone had
started a fire of quick-burning sticks on the sand, and, as the
light flared up, the trader spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Olpo tell you white misi savee make puri-puri. I listen and I
hear him. You feller all believe that thing about white misi?"</p>

<p>The natives, fired by Olpo's impassioned words, immediately
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; we believe."</p>

<p>There was a hum of excitement, and the white man waited till it
died down. Then he said very slowly and deliberately:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Olpo speak that white misi savee make puri-puri he speak
true!"</p>

<p>He waited again, for there was a general exclamation of surprise
that the trader should confess to Ellen being a witch.</p>

<p>"White misi savee make puri-puri very much," he went on
presently, repeating the words in order to give emphasis to the
statement. "I think white misi more big puri-puri feller than
anybody. She is the one big-feller medicine-man."</p>

<p>The natives were distinctly uneasy now, and they crowded to the
foot of the steps threateningly. Sherwin looked down at them
calmly, glancing out of the corner of one eye to see if Olpo was
still beside him.</p>

<p>"More better we kill that puri-puri misi," said a voice in the
crowd. "No good she stop here and kill we feller."</p>

<p>Other voices joined in. Why should they let this witch work her
evil way against them? was the burden of what they said. Especially
now that their Tanbada had told them she was a strong-feller
sorcerer. She must be a very bad witch when their Taubada talked
about her like that.</p>

<p>Sherwin held up his hand again, and the voices subsided slowly.
When all was quiet, he pointed to the sorcerer at his side. "Olpo
is a great puri-puri man," he said. "He savee plenty." There was a
murmur of assent. "But white misi is too much strong puri-puri man.
She savce more thing than Olpo."</p>

<p>He waited for this to sink in. Then:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She no bring sickness, she no make schooner break longa beach,
she no make big sea and big wind. She no do this thing. She good
friend for your people."</p>

<p>"Who been bring this sickness and them other thing?" the voice
asked again.</p>

<p>Sherwin half turned and took a grip of the sorcerer's shoulder.
"Olpo," he said.</p>

<p>Instantly there was uproar. The crowd cried that such a thing
could not be. Olpo was their friend, and they had done nothing to
displease him, anyway. White misi was the one, they shouted, and
they surged forward like a wave about to break.</p>

<p>The sorcerer tried to wriggle himself free of the white man's
grip, a stream of what was clearly invective flowing from his lips.
But Sherwin's grip was tight, and presently Olpo, exhausted and out
of breath, quietened down. Sherwin faced the crowd again, and the
uproar ceased as they saw he was about to speak.</p>

<p>"Olpo been make this sickness," he said. "But white misi is more
strong puri-puri feller than Olpo. She will take the sickness away.
Olpo bring it; white misi take it away."</p>

<p>The sorcerer had got some of his breath back, and he again
addressed the crowd. When he finished, Bamu spoke from the outer
edge of the mob:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He say you no speak true, Taubada. He say white misi no much
strong. He go make puri-puri one-time quick and white misi hurry-up
dead."</p>

<p>"All right," Sherwin said. "We see who more strong."</p>

<p>"He say white misi dead before sun come up," Bamu
volunteered.</p>

<p>"All right, we see," Sherwin repeated. He still kept his grip of
the sorcerer's shoulder. Then, raising his voice so that the
farthest away native could not fail to hear, he said "Olpo say he
more strong than white misi. He no speak true. White misi more
strong than Olpo. She number-one feller. Olpo say he make white
misi dead. Might be white misi make Olpo dead. We look
bye-em-bye."</p>

<p>In the incredulous murmur that followed this statement Sherwin's
quick appreciation of native moods detected a tone of doubt. He
released Olpo and muttered savagely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get now and do your worst. I've succeeded in laying the
foundations for undermining your influence, you damned old
scoundrel. You will have to show what you can do very soon, or your
fame will go up in smoke."</p>

<p>Olpo slid away from the white man and made for the steps, but
Sherwin brought him back.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he said, producing the revolver and prodding the
other to the doorway. "You go in there so that I can get a start."
He brushed the other natives aside and thrust the sorcerer through
the opening. Then, as he went to the head of the steps to descend,
he caught sight of a dark figure moving away from the mast of the
"Mokohu." The distance from the porch of the Dubu to the mast of
the stranded schooner was only a few yards, and, the fire on the
ground flaring up at the moment, the figure moved. Sherwin saw that
it was Wilson.</p>

<p>"He has been standing there all the time," Sherwin said to
himself, as he reached the ground and started off along the beach.
"I was wondering if he was somewhere handy, and dreadfully afraid
he would interfere and spoil things."</p>

<p>The natives clustered round him as he went along, all asking
questions and hanging on his answers. Sherwin took the utmost
advantage of the occasion to further impress upon them the fact
that Ellen, although a witch, was their friend, a powerful friend
who would drive away the sickness. He pointed out the advantages
that would accrue from having such a friend; how if they obeyed her
what a lot she could do for them. It would pay them to keep her
kindly disposed, he hinted darkly. And the natives felt much
impelled to believe him; he was their Taubada and a reliable friend
who had never failed them. Still, they said doubtingly, Olpo was a
great man, and everybody knew what he could do. They did not like
to run counter to his wishes. Did not a man at Kerema die on the
third day after a full moon just as Olpo said he would? Was it not
Olpo who had sent a strange head-sickness to a Lahari woman so that
she threw herself from the top of a coconut-tree and broke her
neck? And who was it brought the rain to bring life to the gardens
when a five months' drought had killed every yam and sweet potato?
And the mighty schools of salawere fish at a time when it seemed
the sea was empty? None other than Olpo. He had prophesied these
things, and how could he know they would come true if he had not
made it so? Truly, Olpo was a very great man and his words were the
words of truth. He had said he had not brought the sickness to
Wallala, and what could they do but believe him?</p>

<p>But Sherwin insisted that Olpo was to blame, and that the white
misi was a greater and more powerful sorcerer. She would take away
the sickness Olpo had brought, he reiterated. When he sent them
back to the village at the gate of the compound, Sherwin
congratulated himself that he had shaken their belief in the powers
of Olpo to some extent, at any rate.</p>

<p>On reaching the house, he went straight up on to the verandah.
The lamp was still burning at its fullest, and he was relieved when
he peeped in the door of the bedroom and saw that Ellen was fast
asleep. The girl was lying on her side, the mosquito-net lifted at
the head for coolness. On a table near the bed was a turned-down
hurricane lamp, with a book stood upright and so placed as to
shield the light from the sleeper's face.</p>

<p>Sherwin turned down the verandah lamp to its lowest and sneaked
away.</p>

<p>"She is lying there so peacefully that it seems horrible to
think of all the lies I have told about her to-night," he said, as
he reached his bunk between the piles of cargo under the house. "I
wonder what she would say if she knew?"</p>

<p>He filled his pipe and lit it. "I hope that fellow Wilson does
not tell her," he muttered. "He heard everything." He stretched
himself out on the bunk and smoked for a few minutes. Then he rose
and twirled the barrel of his revolver to see if it was in perfect
working order.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long it will be before Olpo makes a sign? The old
brute will not lose much time, that's certain. He knows his
reputation is endangered. I won't lie on the bunk&mdash;I might go
to sleep, and that would never do."</p>

<p>He took up a position on the ground against a bale of sacks that
had formed part of the "Mokohu's" cargo. From here he could keep a
close watch on both the front and back steps, and he crouched down,
revolver in hand, watching and waiting. He knew sorcerers possessed
such belief in their powers as to be capable of thinking they could
cause death or injury to a victim merely by means of incantation or
the holding of a ceremony. Many of them possessed a fair working
knowledge of the power of suggestion and by it achieved results.
But the trader was also aware that a sorcerer might not be any too
trustful of such means when the intended victim was a European.
White people were different from natives; they knew too much, and
their heads were not filled with superstition. Other means would be
necessary&mdash;and that was the reason Peter Sherwin kept close
watch of the steps with a revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>The long hours passed slowly, and nothing happened out of the
way. Once Sherwin thought he heard a footstep approaching, but on
going to see he found nothing. Once or twice he walked round the
house to relieve the cramp of his muscles.</p>

<p>"It might well be that I am acting the fool," he said to
himself, shortly after the moon rose. "It would be a very daring
thing for Olpo to come here and try anything. He knows I will be on
the lookout, and that I would knock his head off if he were
caught."</p>

<p>But he did not relax his vigil for all that, although his tired
frame called out for sleep, and he had to walk up and down to keep
awake.</p>

<p>About two in the morning a strange restlessness came over him.
He wondered if Ellen were all right, and he was anxious to make
sure. He stood still and listened as he had done a hundred times
before, but there were no souuds save the ripple of the surf and
the rustling of the coconuts. Satisfied that it would be safe to go
up on the verandah, he slipped up the front steps and went to the
girl's room. It meant leaving the back steps out of sight for the
time that it took to reach the verandah, but the moonlight was
bright and there was no sign of anybody about.</p>

<p>The moon was flooding the doorway of the room with soft white
light that made the thatch of the walls glisten as though silvered.
Sherwin went into the room and saw that Ellen was still in the same
position, the light of the turned-down lamp showing that she was
breathing easily and regularly, the book still shading her face.
Satisfied as to her safety for the time-being, he turned to tip-toe
out.</p>

<p>The next moment he dodged behind the table and hid in the shadow
of the book. For, standing in the doorway, his withered form
outlined against the background of moonlight, was Olpo.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="im4" id="im4"></a><img src=

</p>

<p class="caption">The next moment he dodged behind the table and
hid in the shadow of a book.

<p>He was standing perfectly still, and
his hands were raised as though in benediction. For a full minute
he stood thus then, with a gliding, snaky movement, he began to
advance into the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. OLPO MAKES AN
ATTEMPT</h2>

<p>In the centre of the room the sorcerer stopped. The lamplight
was sufficiently strong to illuminate the front of his body and
reveal his markings and ornaments. The mau crouched in the shadow
at the head of the bed saw that he had made himself up specially
for the occasion. He was wearing the full insignia of his art. His
hair was plastered into an array of tapered points which stood out
from his head in all directions like a bunch of monstrous bristles.
From his ears to his shoulders drooped strings of small beads and
dog's-teeth, and his cheeks were streaked red on a background of
white. In the loop of his nose was a hoop carved from a single
shell. Suspended from his neck, so that it hung over one breast,
was the dagger of cassowary-bone. On the other side was a human
hand that had been severed close to the wrist. It was a small,
withered thing, with half-clasped fingers, and here and there the
dirty-white of a knuckle-bone showing through the smoke-dried skin.
The sorcerer's arms were beribboned with strips of red calico, and
his legs were festooned with circlets of small brown beans. He was
entirely uude, and the whole of his body was smeared with colored
earth.</p>

<p>For a full minute he stood perfectly still with raised arms in
the centre of the room, and the white man, watching with straining
eyes, silently drew his revolver and held it in readiness. The
sleeping girl made no movement.</p>

<p>Presently Olpo lowered his arms and raised himself on his toes.
Then he began to turn round and rouud, slowly at first, but with
increasing speed. He moved absolutely without sound, his ornaments
being fixed in some way to prevent their rattling. As his twirling
increased he raised his arms to the right-angled position, lowering
them a little from time to time as though in regulation of his
speed, in the manner of the governor of a steam-engine. Sherwin
likened him to some sort of fantastic toe-dancer, and wondered at
the agility of such an old and feeble-looking man.</p>

<p>After a time the whirling apparition slowed down and finally
stopped. For a moment he stood erect, facing the head of the bed.
Sherwin steadied the revolver against the edge of the table and
took careful aim at the hand suspended over the sorcerer's left
breast. The range was about five yards and a miss impossible. With
his finger pressing the trigger so that the hammer was on the point
of rising, Sherwin waited.</p>

<p>Olpo began the second part of his performance by slowly raising
his hands high above his head, palms inward, the fiugers bent like
a grisly's claws. Then he as slowly lowered them to his sides and
raised them again. He repeated the movement a dozen times, and
every time the hands neared the plastered hair Sherwin pressed the
trigger just a little bit more. It was a favorite sorcerer's trick
to carry a small, but very venomous, snake in a bamboo tube hidden
in the hair to throw at the victim. The snakes were trained to
return to their owners on the completion of their task, and the
victim would be found dead, with nothing to show what killed him.
The bite of the snake was such a tiny thing as to escape casual
notice, and the sorcerer's reputation for killing his victims
without leaving a mark would go up by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>Sherwin was taking no chances of Olpo working the snake trick.
He was firmly resolved that if the sorcerer's hands as much as
touched his hair to drop him on the instant. But the claw-like
fingers went up and down without going too near the plastered head,
and the white man heaved a sigh of relief when they stopped and the
sorcerer turned and made towards the door.</p>

<p>But at the door the painted figure stopped and again faced the
bed. He raised his right arm till it stood straight before him,
still and rigid as iron, with a talon-like forefinger pointing. For
a moment he stood thus; then he began to advance with the gliding,
snaky movement he had used at first. It was a sinuous creep, in
which the locomotor muscles seemed to move of their own volition.
It was not suggestive of stealth. The white man in the shadow at
the head of the bed likened it to the advance of some horrible,
slimy creature of the ocean depths approaching its prey fully
confident of its power. Sherwin felt a' curious sense of
fascination steal over him as he watched. The sorcerer's figure was
directly between him and the moonlit doorway, and every detail of
the creeping devil's outline showed sharp and clear. Sherwin caught
himself comparing the peaks of twisted hair to bundles of spears
standing points up. He started and took a tighter hold of the
revolver. Had Olpo some power or knowledge of mesmerism? he asked
himself. He would need to be careful. He kept his eyes on the
outstretched finger. It was a very long finger, and as it
approached the lamp he could see that it was corneous, and that the
yellow nail hung long and curved like a parrot's beak.</p>

<p>The night was very still, the ripple of the surf being hardly
heard in the room. The wind had died down, and it seemed as if the
mosquitoes had fled from the presence of witchcraft. The silence
wrapped Sherwin like a blanket. He felt it was smothering him, and
he wanted to cry aloud. Strange influences were at work on him. He
shivered, and a drop or two of moisture came out on his brow. His
eyes seemed unable to leave the slowly advancing finger, it was
half-way across the room now, and the face of the man behind it was
set hard in an expression that was Satanic. Sherwin managed to
glance at the glittering eyes, but the finger quickly attracted his
attention again.</p>

<p>Should he awaken Ellen? The question had raced through his brain
a dozen times in as many seconds. She would probably die of fright,
he reflected, if she were to be rudely awakened from a quiet sleep
to see the creeping apparition and its pointing finger bearing down
on her. Alternatively, should he shoot the sorcerer? The sound of a
shot so close to her head would give her as big a fright. Sherwin
decided to wait a little longer.</p>

<p>Olpo was very close now, and Sherwin saw that the man's face was
screwed up so that the eyes were merely narrow slits, through which
a section of the pupils burnt like coals. The finger was only about
two feet from Ellen's face. The girl began to stir uneasily, and,
as the finger moved closer and closer, her lips moved.</p>

<p>Sherwin decided the thing had gone far enough. He shifted the
revolver to the other hand, so as to allow him the more easily to
grasp the sorcerer's arm. He still kept the muzzle of the revolver
up at the painted body above him. Then, just as he reached out for
the sorcerer's arm, Olpo looked from the sleeping girl's eyes
straight down at him and the steel muzzle aimed at his heart. Like
a flash he straightened his bent body, turned, and, before the
white could do anything to stop him, was across the floor and
through the doorway.</p>

<p>Sherwin felt inclined to laugh. His relief was so great that the
reaction almost unbalanced him. He seemed to have been hours
watching the sorcerer performing the rites of his office, but he
knew by the position of the moon shadows on the verandah that he
had not been more than a few minutes in the room. They were a
crowded few minutes.</p>

<p>He glanced at Ellen, who was sleeping quietly again, and then he
crept out. He went to the other room and took out a bottle of
brandy and poured some into a glass, which he took out on to the
verandah.</p>

<p>"The old devil!" he muttered, drinking off the spirit. "He is
more of a power than I thought. I wonder what was the end he had in
view?" He searched for and found some packets of cigarettes, and
sat down on one of the verandah bunks and smoked.</p>

<p>"I declare I am more shaken than I thought would be possible,"
he said to himself. "No wonder the niggers are frightened of him. I
will have a tough job in proving Ellen a more powerful sorcerer
than Mr. Olpo. But what a devil of a fright the old fiend got when
he looked down into my face and saw the revolver pointed at him!"
He laughed and stretched himself on the bunk.</p>

<p>He did not deem it wise to sleep under the house after such an
experience. The sorcerer might return later on, and, as he had
managed to get into the house without being seen once, he might do
it again. Sherwin carried the stretcher into a position from where
he could see the door of the bedroom, and from theu on till
daylight he lay and smoked one cigarette after another.</p>

<p>The first of the grey light of the new day was spreading over
the eastern sky when a footstep caused Sherwin to get up and go
round the corner of the verandah. It was Bamu, and the old native's
face wore an expression of mingled sorrow and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well, what's matter?" Sherwin asked, softly, so as not to
disturb Ellen.</p>

<p>"White misi?" Bamu breathed.</p>

<p>"What about her?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she&mdash;she all right?"</p>

<p>Sherwin nodded and smiled. "Of course. She all right number one
feller."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she no dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead! No! Who can make dead?"</p>

<p>"Olpo say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sherwin infused as much contempt as possible into his voice.
"Olpo no can do thing like that. He no savee nothing." He laughed
quietly. "White misi too much strong feller for Olpo."</p>

<p>But Bamu doubted still. He wanted the evidence of his own eyes
to convince him that white misi still lived.</p>

<p>"That woman, Lapa, too," he added, pointing to the ground. "She
want look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Sherwin," Ellen's voice interrupted, and the
girl herself appeared. She glanced at the tumbled blanket and
creased pillow on the stretcher. "How did you sleep? I see you have
repented of your decisiou to camp in the uncomfortable place under
the house."</p>

<p>At the appearance of Ellen, Bamu immediately went to the steps
and spoke to somebody on the ground.</p>

<p>"Too many mosquitoes down there," Sherwin lied. "How did you
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Not so badly. But I had a horrible dream. It was a dreadful
thing. I thought somebody kept threatening to drive a spear into
me, pushing it closer and closer till it almost touched my
eyes."</p>

<p>"Did you waken?" Sherwin watched her closely.</p>

<p>"No; which is rather strange, for usually when I have dreams of
a horrible sort and as vivid as this one was, I wake up in a
shiver."</p>

<p>Bamu, followed by Lapa, came along the verandah. The young
native women went to Ellen and touched her arm and back. "You no
sick?" she asked.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at her surprisedly. "I am not sick a little bit,"
she said.</p>

<p>Lapa sighed and looked up into the white girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"Me too much glad," she said simply. Then, without a further
word, she went into the bedroom, and those on the verandah could
hear her working at tidyiug up the place.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a curious character?" Ellen asked. "She seemed quite
relieved to see me. What happened that she and the other women did
not sleep here last night?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they got to yarning in the village till it was so
late that they were afraid to disturb you," Sherwin put her off.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Bamu going along the beach in
the direction of the village.</p>

<p>It was not long before natives began to dribble up from the
village, and when Ellen and Sherwin sat down to breakfast there
were curious black faces peeping at them from all over the
compound. One or two bolder spirits climbed the verandah and
tip-toed to the corner and peeped round.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with the natives this morning'?"
Ellen asked. "Look at them through the blind there. They are
looking up here. What is wrong?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing wrong," Sherwin said. "They are probably
waiting to see me on trading business."</p>

<p>"They never came so early in the morning before," the girl said,
suspiciously; "or in such numbers, either."</p>

<p>"They take silly fits sometimes. Don't be alarmed; everything is
all right."</p>

<p>"I know they don't mean mischief." Ellen said. "I am not
afraid."</p>

<p>After breakfast the trader invited the girl to the
storeroom.</p>

<p>"I am going to make some presents," he explained. "I give the
best workers&mdash;the people who supply the most coconuts, and so
forth&mdash;a few things from the store occasionally."</p>

<p>"How good you are to them!" Ellen exclaimed, as they left the
house.</p>

<p>"Purely a matter of business," Sherwin said. "It sets them
seeing who can supply me with the most stuff."</p>

<p>He opened the door and they went inside. Sherwin made a
collection of leather body-belts, jew's-harps, hand-mirrors and
other things, and carried them outside. He called to the natives
watching from a little distance to approach, and as they came he
said to Ellen in a careless tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would please them immensely if you distributed the presents.
It doesn't matter to whom you give any particular item; they are
all good workers."</p>

<p>To his delight, she jumped at the idea. "That will be great,"
she said, clapping her hands. "I have wanted to give the poor
things something ever since I came."</p>

<p>The natives formed a half-circle about the door.</p>

<p>There were about thirty of them, men and women and a sprinkling
of children. Others were coming along the beach.</p>

<p>"White misi want to show she good friend belong all you feller,"
Sherwin said, speaking loudly so that all should hear. "She want to
give you present. You all see her here. You look good, now." He
paused. Then: "You can all see she all right; she number one."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" Ellen whispered.</p>

<p>"I am merely explaining that it is you who is making the
presents," the trader answered hurriedly. Before she could ask for
a more satisfactory answer, he was again addressing the
natives:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She very good friend for you. She give you all kind of thing,
and bye-em-bye she make sickness go 'way from village. You feller
believe that?"</p>

<p>Two or three voices answered affirmatively, and Sherwin signed
to Ellen to begin handing out the presents. He made each man and
woman come up in turn and take his gift from the white girl's
hands. One or two showed traces of fear, but the majority were
almost reverential. When each had received something, there were
still a few mirrors and jew's-harps at Ellen's feet. She looked at
Sherwin.</p>

<p>"The kiddies?" she asked, and, on the trader nodding, she picked
the things up and pressed them on the children.</p>

<p>The immediate result was that the youngsters pressed about her,
some clinging to her dress, others taking her hand and stroking the
white skin. Their elders looked on contentedly, and made no attempt
at taking the children away.</p>

<p>Sherwin smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"They've seen her alive and well, and they know by the presents
that she is well-disposed towards them. Olpo, your cake is
dough!"</p>

<p>He drove the crowd away at last, and as the pair returned to the
house Ellen said "Doesn't a little kindness go a long way?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. He would have liked to tell her what a
mighty long way it was going in this particular instance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. WILSON COMPLIES</h2>

<p>"I am anxious to see how the sick man and that dear little baby
are getting on," Ellen said a little later. She was putting on her
panama, the native girl, Lapa, watching with wide opened eyes.
"There might be fresh cases, too."</p>

<p>Sherwin was standing in the doorway of the room. "Come on,
then," he invited. "I had just come to tell you I was going to the
village. This is to be our busy day; we have to get our quarantine
station ready."</p>

<p>"I hope Mr. Wilsou does not make too much bother about giving up
the ship," Ellen said, putting the final touches to the position of
her hat. "I think, though, that when I explain the danger to the
natives he will see the value of my idea and be reasonable. Why,
there could be no better place than the ship for isolating the
sick! Once on board, they would have no hope of escaping, and the
others could not get in contact with them without our permission.
We could never attain such complete isolation with a house."</p>

<p>"No; you are right. The ship is the thing." Then, as the girl
signified her readiness to depart, the trader led the way to the
steps and helped her to the ground. Lapa followed, and Sherwin,
seeing she wanted to ask something, turned to her.</p>

<p>"Me come?" Lapa asked.</p>

<p>"What for you want come?"</p>

<p>The native girl looked at her mistress. "I want stand-by
close-to white misi," she said, simply, and Sherwin nodded.</p>

<p>"Lapa has taken quite a fancy to you," he said to Ellen, as they
started off. "She is showiug a great deal of affection."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have bewitched her," Ellen laughed. "Anyway, I am
glad I have made a good impression."</p>

<p>"You have made more than a good impression on me, I am afraid,"
Sherwin thought. She had got a little in front on the path that
wound through the coconuts, and the man looked steadily at her
slight figure with the sunlight playing in the hair that peeped
from beneath her hat. It struck him that there was something
strangely unreal in the fact that this girl&mdash;a real white
girl, with just the style of face and figure and the right tint of
hair that he had always loved&mdash;should be there in living
reality before him. And in his keeping and care! It was wonderful
that such a thing could happen to an isolated trader like him,
surrounded by ignorant savages. She, the first white woman he had
seen for years, was just the type that had always appealed to him!
It did occur to him that the appearance of almost any white woman
would have been pleasing to his eyes&mdash;eyes that had so long
starved for sight of a female of his kind. Also he was aware that
long exile was liable to automatically adjust his appreciations.
But he put the thought from him.</p>

<p>"I am also afraid that Lapa is not the only one bewitched," he
said to himself. Then he pulled up the trend of his thoughts with a
jerk. There was more pressing business on hand than merely
contemplating on the pleasure that this white girl gave him. He had
made up his mind to prevent Ellen speaking to Wilson about the use
of the schooner, and so giving the mate an opportunity of telling
her how the natives accused her of being a witch. Wilson had heard
and seen all that had passed the night before, when the trader and
the sorcerer stood on the porch of the Duhu, and it might well be
that he would blurt out an account of the occurrence.</p>

<p>"I think it would be as well if I interviewed Wilson," Sherwin
said, as they went along the beach. "After what has passed, it
would be rather painful for you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," Ellen said, looking at him. "Put the case strougly,
won't you? We can't allow these natives to suffer and die just
because Mr. Wilson objects to our using the ship."</p>

<p>Natives flocked round as they neared the village. Many walked
backwards in front of the pair, gazing at Ellen and making clicking
noises of wonderment with their teeth. Others followed behind,
whispering awesomely. Lapa began talking rapidly in her own
language, from time to time indicatiug Ellen with a side movement
of her head. Sherwin anticipated Ellen's query as to the meaning of
it all.</p>

<p>"They are talking about the presents you gave them," he said.
"They regard you as being their great friend."</p>

<p>"How grateful they are for such a small thing! But it's you they
ought to be grateful to; the things were yours, not mine." She
beckoned one of the children&mdash;a little toddler with a rounded
stomach and big eyes. The child went to her at once and placed its
fist in her outstretched hand. Immediately there was a scramble for
her other hand. Sherwin made as though to drive them off.</p>

<p>"Let them come with me," Ellen said, and, with the children
clinging to her hands and arms, she turned into the village.</p>

<p>"You see Mr. Wilson," she said. "I'll have a look at Bamu's
cousin and the child and see if there are any more sick."</p>

<p>Sherwin hesitated. He was not sure that it was altogether safe
to allow the girl to go into the village by herself&mdash;Olpo
might be about and take advantage of her being unprotected to try
some more of his tricks. He stood watching her going up along the
street, and the friendliness of the natives reassured him. They
surrounded the girl like a guard of honor.</p>

<p>Resolving to return as quickly as he could, he hurried to the
schooner and scrambled on board. He found Wilson in the cabin
reading. The mate looked up quickly as the trader's form appeared
in the entrance, and he put down his book and stood up.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>Sherwin flung himself down the steps and faced him.</p>

<p>"The epidemic is here," he said, going straight to the point.
"It won't be long before there are scores of cases."</p>

<p>"So I gathered from your remarks last night," said Wilson. "Is
Miss Russell quite well?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is at her suggestion I have come to you. She is much
concerned about the effects of this disease, and suggested that we
should use the schooner as an isolation hospital."</p>

<p>Wilson did not answer immediately. He looked keenly at the
trader, his eyes narrowing to mere slits. Sherwin glanced at the
bunk and saw that the book the man had been reading was a treatise
on Navigation. And a wave of pity came over him at the thought that
this man had been trying to while away the time with such a
dry-as-dust subject. He determined to supply him with some books
and magazines from the station.</p>

<p>"And what about me?" Wilson asked presently.</p>

<p>"See here," Sherwin said abruptly. "Don't you think you are
acting the goat by going on like this? You must know you are in the
wrong when you speak of Miss Russell. Why not apologise to the lady
and let us all be friends again?"</p>

<p>Wilson flushed. "We will not talk about that, please," he said
coldly. "About the use of the schooner, as it is Miss Russell's
suggestion, I would prefer to discuss the matter with her herself."
He spoke very deliberately and slowly. Sherwin looked at him
intently. There was something about the man he did not understand.
Sherwin noticed that his eyes brighteued at the mention of Ellen
and it struck him that his attitude was not that of a mau disgusted
with the girl. The trader wondered was Wilson jealous and planning
a means of getting even.</p>

<p>"You would not tell her what you heard last night?" he said
anxiously.</p>

<p>"About the natives accusing her of witchcraft?" The mate's tone
was angered. "That would be a fool thing to do." He stopped and
breathed heavily. "The fright might kill her," he breathed. "Why
speak to her at all about using the schooner? You have heard all
thore is to hear from me."</p>

<p>But Wilson repeated he preferred to see Ellen about the matter
personally, and the trader, seeing he was not to be gainsaid, gave
in. "You will find her in the village," he said, makiug up the
steps to the deck.</p>

<p>Wilson jumped up after him. "In the village! Alone! Why the
devil did you leave her when you knew that that old fiend of a
sorcerer is just waiting for such a chance? By God, Sherwin, I
thought you would take care of her!" He ran to the bow and, without
bothering with the hanging ladder, sprang down on to the sand. Then
he tore up through the coconuts and along the village street.</p>

<p>Sherwiu stared astonished.</p>

<p>"Well I'm damned!" he exclaimed, after awhile. Then, slowly and
thoughtfully, he left the vessel.</p>

<p>As he turued the corner of the Dubu and came into full view of
the street, he saw Ellen and Wilsou standing beside one of the
houses, the mate keeping the circle of curious natives off with
occasional gestures. The heads of the pair were beut in close
converse and presently they shook hands. Ellen looked up suddeuly
and saw the trader approaching. She came running, clapping her
hands.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mr. Shermin," she cried. "Mr. Wilson thinks my
plan a very good one. And he is going to help us with the sick
natives, too. Isn't it just splendid?"</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled. Her cheeks were flushed, and her voice was
pleasurably excited. She seemed to radiate happiness. Sherwin felt
decidedly uncomfortable. It annoyed him that a few words of
Wilson's should delight the girl so.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson will live on the schooner just the same," Ellen
rattled on. "He will be able to keep a watch at night that none of
the patients try to escape. I'm so glad things have worked out so
well, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Sherwin answered curtly and somewhat ungraciously. "Did
you find or hear of any more sick natives?"</p>

<p>"No. And I have not even been in to see the man and child. Those
women and children would not let me leave them. I believe they
almost worship me."</p>

<p>"Let us go now," said Sherwin. "Where is Wilson going with those
men?" He pointed to where a dozen men were following the mate to
the beach.</p>

<p>"He is going to make a start at fixing up the inside of the
schooner at once," Ellen informed him. "Clean up the hold and so
on. This is the house, isn't it?"</p>

<p>They went up the ladder and pushed through the doorway. The
women who had been sitting by the sick man yesterday were still
there. From their appearance and position there was nothing to
suggest they had ever moved. Ellen saw the baby in the woman's lap,
and she took and held it without protest from its mother.</p>

<p>Sherwin knelt beside the man. He was gasping and sniffling, and
the trader found that his temperature was very high.</p>

<p>"This man will have to be taken to the schooner as soon as
possible," lie said, rising. "He is in a bad way. How's the
baby?"</p>

<p>Ellen looked down at the tiny form in her arms. "Very ill, I am
afraid," she said. "I can feel its poor little body burning like
fire. We will take both of them as soon as the vessel is ready."
She returned the child to its mother, and they left the house,
Ellen remarking as they reached the ground:&mdash;"It's a wonder
there are not more cases."</p>

<p>"There will be soon enough," the trader said grimly. "Now, if
you will go back to the station and see what the medicine chest
holds in the way of fever-reducing drugs, I'll go through the
village on the hunt for sick folk. There is a book of instructions
in the chest."</p>

<p>She went at once, Lapa a yard behind her. "Now's my chance to
explain the advantages of listeniug to the white misi's advice,"
Sherwin muttered. "She will be quite safe at the station."</p>

<p align="center"><a name="im1" id="im1"></a><img src=
"1900891h-images/Image-1.jpg" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">She went at once, Lapa a yard behind her.</p>

<p>He went to the Dubu and mounted to the porch, a hundred natives
assembling on the ground beneath. Sherwin entered the Dubu and
found Olpo sleeping in a cubicle at the far end. Without disturbing
him, he crept out. "I know where you are, at any rate," he said to
himself. Then he spoke to the people below. Now that Ellen was not
there to listen he was able to speak more fully than he had done at
the door of the storeroom. He told how the threats of Olpo had
failed to materialise, and pointed out that the white misi still
lived and was well, despite the threats of the most powerful
sorcerer in three districts. They had seen her with their own eyes
and taken presents from her own hands. Was that not proof? Could
there be any doubt about white misi's power of resisting inferior
magic?</p>

<p>The natives shouted and clicked their teeth. The white misi was
truly a wonderful sorcerer, they cried, and she was their friend,
and they were glad. They wanted no more proof.</p>

<p>Then Sherwin came to the root of his discourse:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This had sickness come, but if you feller listen to white misi
it go 'way one-time quick. White misi tell me to tell you feller
that all sick man and sick woman and sick piccaninny must go stop
longa schooner, and white misi make well." He repeated it several
times, and the crowd shouted they would listen to the wisdom of
white misi. They were quite enthusiastic about it, and when Sherwin
descended to the ground again, they crowded about him with
assurances of their desire to please Ellen by obeying her
wishes.</p>

<p>Satisfied at the knowledge of a good work well done, he went
aboard the schooner and found the mate at work in the main hold
with the natives.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did not raise any objections, and are willing to
lend a hand," said the trader.</p>

<p>"Why should I object?" Wilson looked up at the man on the deck
above him. "You did not expect that I should see those poor devils
die just for the want of a little attention, did you? You can trot
your first patients along immediately after lunch." He gave his
attention to the natives shifting the dunnage-planks, and Sherwin
left.</p>

<p>Somehow he was feeling depressed. It was a sensation almost
foreign to his nature; his life had been for many years a far too
busy one for time for moody fits. He had never felt like this
before, for beside the depression, there was a sensation of
irritation. Yet everything had gone off as well as, and better
than, he could have wished. He had worked the natives round to his
way of thinking, the power of Olpo's influence had been heavily
discounted, the schooner was being turned into an isolation
hospital. There was nothiug to grumble about.</p>

<p>As the trader went along the beach to the station the brightness
left his eyes and his face took on an expression that was almost
sullen. At the gate of the compound he stopped and looked back
towards the stern of the "Mokohu," showing round the point of the
beach. He was beginning to discover what was wrong with him. A
light was breaking in on him. He flushed hotly, trembled and shook
his fist at the schooner's stern.</p>

<p>"Damn you, Wilson," he muttered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. THE
SCHOONER-HOSPITAL</h2>

<p>That afternoon Bamu's cousin and his small son were taken to the
schooner. The villagers raised no objections. Some of them
volunteered to help carry the sick man, but Sherwin, fearing that
such contact would accelerate the spread of the infection,
transported him in his own arms, while Ellen took the child. There
was no appearance of Olpo, and on the trader making enquiries he
learnt that the sorcerer had not been out of the Dubu all day.</p>

<p>Wilson had arranged a kind of platform down either side of the
"Mokohu's" main hold. They were crude affairs of planks of odd
lengths and varied thicknesses, supported on oil-drums and empty
cases. Several layers of coconut-fronds were spread on top, and
here and there a grass-mat or cloth of banaua-fibre. Through the
open hatch came abundance of light, and the mate had seen to it
that there was no bilge-water lying stagnant beneath the floor and
that the place smelt sweet and clean.</p>

<p>Sherwin laid the sick man on the ready-made bunk and covered him
with a blanket from the stock in the storeroom at the station.
Ellen placed the baby some little distauce away and made it
comfortable. She expressed her delight at the way Wilson had
arranged the place. "You have done very well, in deed, Mr. Wilson.
We could easily accommodate forty patients. I am very pleased." She
smiled at the mate.</p>

<p>"It's a very rough affair, I am afraid," Wilson said. "We have
not the things to make a proper job of it. Coconut-leaves for
mattresses and not a sheet or pillow in the place! What would
Sydney people say to a hospital like this?"</p>

<p>"It does not matter in the least what they would say," Ellen
said, cheerfully. "We are doing the best we can. It will serve our
purpose of isolation."</p>

<p>Sherwin had brought a number of medicines from the station, and
Ellen administered a febrifuge to the sick man. She made him as
comfortable as possible, and soothed the child when it burst into
fits of fretful crying. For an hour at a time she sat on the bunk
with the black morsel in her arms, rocking it and cooing words of
comfort. She set Wilson and Sherwin re-arranging the fronds and
mats so as to render their condition more comfortable. She had them
heat condensed milk on the primus stove in the cabin and bring it
to her for the child. She set them a dozen minor tasks. And they
obeyed quickly and willingly, for they realised that this slip of a
girl had taken charge of matters. Ellen showed that this business
was her province, and the two men bowed to her superior right. Each
watched her with unconcealed admiration. Each recognised and
appreciated the sympathy and loving kindness she bestowed upon the
two invalids in her care. Sherwin felt absurdly envious of the
dirty, black-skinned savage who was Bamu's cousin.</p>

<p>Wilson and Sherwin spoke to one another never more than was
necessary. Sherwin was distinctly conscious of a spirit between
them that was anything but friendly. And Wilson made no advances to
dispel it. At times it made the trader's blood boil to think that
the mate had not apologised to him for his conduct and the things
he had said and hinted, and he felt like taking him aside and
having it out. But Ellen's change of attitude deterred him. The
girl had most emphatically stated she did not wish to see or speak
to Wilson again; now she was apparently as friendly with him as
ever. It seemed rather extraordinary to Sherwin, and he worried
about it and at last put it down to the vagaries of the feminine
mind. He had read about such things.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the sick man's wives came to the beach
beside the schooner and called the trader. He went up on deck, and
they begged to be allowed on board. They wanted, they said, to sit
beside their husband; the mother of the child cried to have her
baby. Sherwin was hard put to it to convince them that the invalids
were safe in the care of the white misi, and that they would soon
be well, but he managed it at last, and the women went away.</p>

<p>"That is going to be our main trouble," he said to Ellen on
going below again. "The niggers can't bear to leave their sick.
They want to wail and make a fuss at the bedside and apply all
sorts of foolish remedies."</p>

<p>Ellen's mouth set firm. "They are not to come, that's all. I
look to you and Mr. Wilson to see that no healthy native sets foot
on this vessel. Will you attend to that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," both answered together.</p>

<p>At sundown Ellen declared her determination to stay aboard the
schooner all night.</p>

<p>"Will you bring my things from the station, Mr. Sherwin? My
patients may want me during the night."</p>

<p>Sherwin disliked the idea immensely. "You will be very
uncomfortable here," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"What does that matter? I will be all right. At any time now
there may be a score of cases, and I want to be on hand. Please
don't object&mdash;it won't be of any use, anyway; I'm
determined."</p>

<p>Sherwin was much averse to leaving her so close to the Dubu, and
the sorcerer bent on revenge. He could not leave her unprotected
save for the presence of Wilson, who was a stranger&mdash;a
new-chum to the country and the ways of the natives. He glanced at
Wilson. Besides...</p>

<p>"In that case," he said deliberately, "I am cam, ing here,
too."</p>

<p>"You will please yourself about that, of course," Ellen said
coldly.</p>

<p>Sherwin left for the station at once. It was almost dark when he
returned with a half-dozen natives carrying blankets, food-stuffs
and Ellen's belongings. He and Wilson hoisted the things on board
by means of ropes, and carried them into the hold. Ellen took some
of the food-items and retired to the cabin. Presently she called
the others and they found an appetising meal set out on the table
beneath a swinging lamp. It was the first decent meal Wilson had
tasted for some days, and he made no secret of his
appreciation.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing is enough to make any man swear off
'batching' for keeps," he said once, and Sherwin, happening to
glance at Ellen, saw the color mount to her cheeks and her eyes
sparkle. He saw her smile into Wilson's face and bow graciously. A
wave of anger swept over him. His heart raced and the veins of his
forehead throbbed. He had never thought the girl would treat so
kindly the man of whom she had spoken so vehemently. It angered him
that his belief in her earnestness should have been misplaced. It
angered him that she should accept compliments from one who had so
grossly insulted her.</p>

<p>With an effort Sherwin forced an appearance of seeming calm, but
long before the others were finished, he made an excuse and went up
on deck.</p>

<p>The night was very still. The quiet was conducive to thought and
retrospection. Sherwin paced the deck, thinking. His mind was a
welter of confused impressions. He was trying to reconcile Ellen's
behaviour with her previous anger. He was jealous of Wilson. He was
disappointed in Eller After a time he cooled down and attained a
clearer perspective. And for the first time it came home to him
with terrific force that this girl was very necessary to him. All
his manhood cried aloud for her. He loved her. He knew it beyond
doubt, and his heart sang her name. He loved her despite her
vagaries and weakness. The knowledge drove away his anger against
her, dispelled his disappointment, and left him firmly resolved to
wiu her. It also left him jealous of Wilson.</p>

<p>And his jealousy was destined to be fiercely fanned that night.
Ellen seemed to be favoring Wilsou very particularly. It was the
mate she consulted about various little incidents as the night wore
on, it was he whom she asked to call her if she were needed when
the time came when she lay down for an hour or two's rest. Not that
she ignored the trader; she spoke to him frequently and always with
accustomed courtesy; but Sherwin sensed a difference. It made him
all the more determined in his resolve.</p>

<p>The two men had arranged to take watches by turns. Sherwin took
the first, Wilson sleeping on the deck beside the top of the cabin,
to be called at midnight. For the first hour, Sherwin walked up and
down, then he sat down by the stump of the mainmast and smoked pipe
after pipe.</p>

<p>The land-breeze had come up a couple of hours after sun-down,
and the night was delightfully cool. The black velvet of the sky
was besprinkled with a million diamonds that reflected blue-white
points of light in the sea. The high tide reached as far as the
schooner's quarter, lapping her sides gently. The front of the Dubu
stood black and dismal at the end of the broken bowsprit, a huge,
somewhat uneven triaugle leaning a trifle out of the perpendicular.
Sherwin looked at it and wondered what Olpo was doing. There was no
gleam of firelight from the building, but the watching mau knew
that that did not indicate the people inside were asleep.</p>

<p>From the other end of the village came the slow, soft wailing of
one of Bamu's cousin's wives, and from the river at the back came
the voices of chorusing frogs.</p>

<p>Sherwin estimated the time as being near midnight, and was on
the poiut of rising to call Wilson to take his watch, when a
woman's voice in high-pitched falsetto ripped the quietness. It was
a wail that the higher it rose indicated deeper despair, a harsh,
grating howl that rasped the nerves like the sound of an unoiled
wheel. Before it had reached its topmost note, another voice joined
in, then another, and another, till there was a score or more. The
steady beat of a tom-tom sounded and the lights of flare-ups
appeared amongst the coconuts. Wilson had been awakened at the
voice of the first woman, and he and Sherwin stood looking and
listening for moment.</p>

<p>"What the dickens is the matter?" Wilson asked. "It sounds like
Sheol broken loose."</p>

<p>Ellen appeared beside them, her hair hanging loose.</p>

<p>"There's no danger," Sherwin assured her. "I don't quite know
what is wrong, but we shall soon know; I see lights coming this
way."</p>

<p>A dozen men crowded to the vessel's side, all chattering and
looking up at the three whites on the deck above them. In the light
of the flaring torches they looked a ghastly assemblage.</p>

<p>Sherwin quietened them with a gesture, and a man in the centre
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One feller dead. He dead jus' now."</p>

<p>"What's matter he dead?" Sherwin asked. "I no hear about anybody
been sick."</p>

<p>There was a little silence, then the native answered
hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He been sick one week now. He been catch plenty sore longa
face."</p>

<p>"The rash!" Sherwin and Ellen ejaculated together.</p>

<p>"What's matter nobody tell me that man been sick before?" the
trader asked angrily. "I been give order that when anybody sick
somebody must tell me. Who been make this 'nother kind
fashion?"</p>

<p>He glared down at the up-turned faces, and the natives shuffled
uneasily.</p>

<p>"We too much fright for Olpo," said one. "That feller say no
good we tell you."</p>

<p>"We think that sickness too much strong," said another.</p>

<p>Ellen touched Sherwin's arm.</p>

<p>"The first thing is to get that man buried," she said. "Then to
find out if there are any more sick in the house. Never mind just
now about your orders being disobeyed."</p>

<p>"I'll go at once." Sherwin went to the bow and down on to the
beach. The natives took him straight to the house of the dead man.
A crowd was wailing in front of, and around, the place, and from
the interior came an intoned chant. Sherwin brushed the crowd aside
and climbed the ladder and squeezed through the doorway.</p>

<p>By the light of a small fire of dry twigs that burnt in the
centre of the floor he saw a dozen men and women huddled about the
dead man. They beat their hands against their thighs and moaned
dismally, not one looking up or taking the least notice of the
trader's entrance. Sherwin pushed in between two of the women and
examined the dead man. He was a youth in the early twenties, and
his naked body was smeared from neck to heels with clay and
macerated herbs. His eyes were wide open and staring and one of his
arms was doubled under his head as though for a pillow.</p>

<p>Sherwin struck a match and looked closely at the face and head.
Close in to the roots of the hair of the forehead and about the
neck were numbers of tiny red spots, irregular-shaped and
elevated.</p>

<p>"The eruption!" he exclaimed. "There can be no doubt about it
now."</p>

<p>He shouted to the wailing natives to cease their noise, and
presently their voices trailed off into silence. He questioned them
as to how long the man had been sick, and why the case had not been
reported to him before. One of the women answered to the effect
that the dead man was her son, and that he had been stricken four
days ago, and that Olpo had impressed upon her the futility, the
danger, of telling the trader about it. Olpo had told her that the
illness was the white misi's doing, and that Sherwin was aiding and
abetting her. There was much more to the same effect, and Sherwin
waited patiently till she had finished. Then he went all over the
ground he had traversed so often in the last day or two. The dead
man at his feet was a powerful argument in his favor, and it was
not long before it was evident that the mother and the others were
being convinced that Olpo's denunciation of Ellen was false. Olpo
had said he would save the man, but, lo! the man was dead. There
was no getting away from that. Olpo's powers were failing him.
Obviously it was rank foolishness to trust to such a sorcerer, a
sorcerer who did not carry out his promises. How much better was it
to hearken to the white misi who was their friend and
unfailing?</p>

<p>The women nodded, and the men grunted agreement. 'They had been
foolish, they said, but in future they would listen to the words of
the white misi. They had always had doubts about Olpo's
friendliness, anyway, and it might well be that he had deliberately
caused the death of this man.</p>

<p>Sherwin won them round&mdash;these sticklers for the old order,
these people who had disregarded their fellow tribesmen's
statements and belief of the greatness of the power of the strange
white woman as compared with that of Olpo&mdash;and when he ordered
the immediate burial of the dead man, they hardly demurred. Not
that they were pleased with having to part with their beloved dead
so soon&mdash;there are all sorts of ceremonies connected with a
death that natives are fain to dispense with&mdash;but it was the
white misi's order, and that was enough.</p>

<p>A hole was scratched in the sand at the back of the village, the
dead man was slid into it, coffinless and unclothed, and the sand
heaped over him. Sher win returned to the schooner, leaving the
women and others seated about the grave, the mournful chanting of
the mother bewailing her lost son sounding in his ears.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. SHERWIN IS
UNEASY</h2>

<p>At daylight it was evinced that the villagers were deeply
impressed by the death of their tribesman and the failure of Olpo
to save him. Of their own accord they brought four patients to the
schooner&mdash;two men and two women&mdash;husband and wife in each
case. One pair had been ill for four days and were in the eruptive
stage; the others exhibited febrile symptoms only.</p>

<p>While Ellen and Wilson arranged them on the bunks in the hold,
Sherwin questioned the natives as to whether there were any more
unreported cases. But the villagers insisted there were none, and
they promised to bring to the vessel without delay any fresh cases
that should occur.</p>

<p>The three Europeans had breakfast in the cabin, Ellen having
managed to turn out a meal that was remarkably good when the
limited means at her disposal were considered. Sherwin watched her
at the coffee-pot end of the table with eyes that drank in the
freshness of her appearance, that admired her easy grace and
coolness in an unusual situation. She talked on general topics in
the most matter of fact way, and discussed matters in connection
with the epidemic. "I am afraid it is all up with Bamu's cousin,"
she said once. "He seems very low, and I doubt if he is conscious.
He is not a young man, and I suppose his chance of recovery is
limited to that extent. Does it not seem criminal that these people
should die like this in an age when medical science has reached
such a pitch?"</p>

<p>"To all intents and purposes it is the stone age here," Sherwin
said. "You can't have the benefits of civilisation and simple
freedom, too. Like everything else worth having, it has to be paid
for. Doing without is part of the price." He shrugged his shoulders
expressively.</p>

<p>Ellen looked at him thoughtfully for a moment, made as though to
speak and then thought better of it. For a time there was sileuce,
then Wilson said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's a pity we could not bring the contacts on board, also. Our
efforts will be seriously discounted by their being at large to
spread the disease."</p>

<p>"We would need a dozen schooners if we did that," Sherwin said.
"It would mean isolating the whole village."</p>

<p>Ellen put down her knife and fork and sighed. "I thought of
that," she said, "and it's worrying me dreadfully. But what can we
do? If we do what we can for the actually sick, it's our
utmost."</p>

<p>"As it is, the schooner will soon be filled up," Sherwin
remarked, glumly. "There will be dozens of cases soon. The whole
business looks to me a hopeless proposition, if not a foolish
one."</p>

<p>"It is nothing of the kind!" Ellen's tone was very sharp. "And
even if it is, cau you suggest anything better?"</p>

<p>"There are six hundred natives in the village&mdash;" Sherwin
begau, but the girl interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Why try making difficulties? It does not help, and things are
bad enough as it is. What we are doing seems the best way, the only
way, we can assist these people, and I am determined to do al' I
can for them. Isn't that the proper thing, Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," the mate answered readily, and Sherwin
muttered beneath his breath:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He agrees with her&mdash;naturally." And from then on till the
end of the meal he was silent.</p>

<p>Three more cases arrived during the moruing&mdash;two youths and
a girl. One of the youths was in a very bad way and delirious. He
struggled with his bearers, scratchiug and biting so that they had
the greatest trouble to get him to the vessel's side. Wilson and
Sherwin managed to get him aboard and down into the hold. But soon
after he was laid on the bunk, his false strength left him, and he
quietened down. Ellen looked at him alarmingly.</p>

<p>"He has a very high temperature," she said, laying her hand on
his forehead. "He is the worst case we have, so far."</p>

<p>The youth was breathiug heavily and jerkily. He opened his eyes
from time to time and looked around unseeingly. He muttered and
coughed&mdash;the catarrhal cough that Sherwin had noted in the
case of Bamu's cousin.</p>

<p>"How long has he been sick?" Ellen asked.</p>

<p>"The men who brought him said he was only stricken an hour ago,"
Sherwiu answered. "It's the way with some of them; they go down as
suddenly as though poleaxed. There will be plenty like him
bye-and-bye."</p>

<p>The increased number of patients meant more work for the three
whites, and twice during the day did Sherwin take some natives to
the station for further supplies of medicines, food, and other
necessaries. He sent a striug of women to bring water from the
river, and as they passed up the long bamboos they used for
buckets, he emptied them into the ship's tank. He purchased
quantities of drinking-coconuts, the "water" of which has virtues
as a febrifuge, fresh fish, yams, bananas, sweet-potatoes, and
other foods. A quantity of firewood was passed on board for a rude
fireplace the trader and Wilson had constructed of opened-out
oil-drums on the deck; the demands on the primus stove having grown
too heavy. By means of an ingenious arrangement of poles and ropes
they contrived to erect an awning over the after deck, and here was
placed the cabin table and stools.</p>

<p>Ellen thanked them both very prettily.</p>

<p>"That is a great improvement; when we want a breath of fresh
air, we shall be protected from the blazing sunlight. Do you think
we can stand a siege, now, Mr. Wilson?"</p>

<p>Sherwin swallowed hard. Why had she addressed such a question to
the mate? he asked himself, angrily. Wilson was a willing worker
and had helped a lot, but he was a new-chum, while the trader was
experienced. It struck Sherwin that he was acting very much like a
spoilt child, and he reproved himself accordingly. Still...</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't know much about it," Wilson answered. "But
it looks to me that if the whole village were to sicken, we could
manage to look after a shipful of patients without outside aid for
a time. Sherwin could tell you better than I, however."</p>

<p>"We could feed fifty for a month," Sherwin said curtly in answer
to the question expressed in Ellen's look.</p>

<p>"Thank you," the girl said, turning away and going below.</p>

<p>The rubeola was getting a hold on the village very rapidly.
Eight patients arrived in one hour during the afternoon, and at
sundown there were nineteen forms huddled and stretched on the
bunks. Ellen had placed the males along one side of the ship and
the females on the other. She hung several hurricane lamps, of
which there had been plenty in the "Mokohu's" cargo, along the
centre, and their half-light seemed to accentuate the unhealthy
flush of the two rows of black faces and bodies.</p>

<p>Ellen worked hard, running from one to another with food;
soothing and comforting; forcing medicine down unwilling throats.
The two men helped her right royally, but they were glad when an
opportunity offered to get up on deck out of that atmosphere of
moans, sobs, and the smell of heated black bodies. But Ellen never
seemed to require a rest. She was never still, and the perspiration
streamed down her cheeks. Her blouse was wet through and stained
with the clay from the bodies of the children she nursed. Sherwin
went to her once as the night wore on and pressed her to go to lie
down, if only for an hour. But she refused.</p>

<p>After midnight he went to her again. Wilson was asleep under the
awning, tired out, and Sherwin had decided to let him have auother
hour before calling him to take his watch. The trader had no wish
to sleep; the night was fine and he was content to walk the deck
and be ready to help the girl who worked below.</p>

<p>She looked up from beside a young girl who was tossiug
restlessly as Sherwin went down the ladder. He saw that her face
was drawn, and her eyes heavy from lack of sleep. Without speaking,
he put his arm around her and drew her towards the cabin. To his
surprise she did not resent his action or resist. Her head fell on
to his shoulder and without speaking, she allowed him to take her
through the doorway in the bulkhead and place her on her bunk. She
fell asleep almost as soon as her head touched the pillow. For a
few moments Sherwin stood looking at her, at her tired face, across
which strayed a wisp or two of hair that had come adrift, at the
steady rise and fall of her breast that told of deep sound sleep.
Then he went back into the hold and walked along the centre of the
two rows of patients.</p>

<p>On the necks and faces of one or two the first of the rash was
making an appearauce. Some lay quietly as though in healthy sleep,
others moaned and tossed and muttered disjointedly. One youug woman
sat up, and looked at him with rounded eyes and begged for water in
a voice that was scarce above a whisper. She drained the pannikin
the white mau gave her and, in obedience to his coaxing, lay down
again and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>On the beach outside, right round the schooner were scores of
natives chanting softly. Their mournful notes sounded clearly in
the hold, softened, but none the less distinct. These people were
relatives and friends who had come as close as they dared and could
to their sick. Sherwin sat down beneath the square opening of the
hatch and lit his pipe. The moaning and sobbing cries of the
patients, the expression of grief by those outside, the spirit of
death that hung over the place like a threatening cloud, tangible
and real, these things depressed him. He felt that all Ellen's
efforts would avail for little. They had but a meagre supply of
medicines, and no hospital appurtenances at all. Noue of them knew
much about the disease or how to treat it. And the number of
patients would increase rapidly each day. Soon there would be
dozens of deaths, and the natives would begin to lose faith in the
power of the white misi to save them. They would revert to the
belief in their own sorcerers. The position looked very black to
the man sitting in the dim-lighted hold amidst the fretful crying
of the sick. It looked hopeless. And thoughts of Ellen's attitude
towards Wilson did not cheer him any. His mind was filled with
black jealousy. He thrilled at the thought that she had allowed him
to put his arm around her, that she had let her head fall upon his
shoulder as he took her to her bunk. Then cold reason dispelled the
ray of sunlight as it told him that she had been so tired she
hardly knew what she was doing.</p>

<p>The effect of it all was to render the trader very miserable,
irritable and ill at ease. The time passed, but he did not heed it,
and it was not till the first of the moonbeams to reach the opening
of the hatch streaked the floor of the hold that he realised it was
getting near daylight. He made another round of the patients and
then went up on deck to call Wilson.</p>

<p>The natives on the beach were crouching beside small fires on
the sand. In the moonlight their clay-plastered bodies looked
ghastly, the markings on their faces giving almost fiendish
expressions. As Sherwin appeared, they spoke one to another and
held out their hands in supplication. They murmured entreaties for
the giving back of their sick. Sherwin quietened them as well as he
could without arousing Ellen, then he went aft, to where Wilson
slept under the awning. As he stooped to awaken the man, he glanced
at the opening of the cabin. The curtain was drawn to one side, and
there was an unobstructed view of the whole interior. The lamp
hanging from the roof was turned half-down, but there was
sufficient light to show that the place was empty. Ellen was not
there!</p>

<p>Leaving the mate still sleeping, Sherwin jumped down the steps
into the cabin and dashed through the door in the bulkhead into the
hold. He ran along' the full lengths of the two rows of bunks, some
of the patients calling to him for water as he went. He took no
notice of them. Ten seconds later he was on deck again, shaking
Wilson roughly.</p>

<p>"Ellen," he said, as the mate sat up blinking, "Ellen is not on
the ship!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. IN THE DUBU</h2>

<p>Wilson sprang to his feet and the two men ran along the deck and
scrambled over the bowsprit on to the porch of the Dubu. The same
thought was in the mind of each. Neither spoke. And the fears that
kept them silent caused them to halt when they pushed through the
doorway and looked down the tong passage between the cubicles.</p>

<p>At the far end a half-dozen painted chiefs were sitting in a
circle on their haunches, each with a small flare of resinous wood
in his hand. The light illumined the clay-markings of their faces
and bodies and the bows and arrows, grotesque dancing-masks and
skulls on sticks standing against the walls. One chief wore through
his nose a boar's tusk that formed a complete circle on each side
of his face, another was so beribboned with colored plaited-grass
streamers and covered with shell and dog's-teeth ornaments that the
outline of his body was lost.</p>

<p>For a moment the white men stood staring. Then each gasped as he
saw that in the centre of the circle Ellen was kneeling. The white
of her dress, the glint of her hair, her pale, pure skin, seemed
strangely unreal in that setting of savagery and superstition. She
seemed so frail, so delicate, so fairy-like kneeling in that
terrible circle, surrounded by the insignia of sorcery in the
depths of the one place in the village that no woman may enter and
live to come out of, as to seem a creature from another world.</p>

<p>Wilson and Sherwin tore along the corridor and thrust a sector
of the circle aside. Then, in obedience to Ellen's request, they
paused.</p>

<p>"The poor old chap is very ill," she said. "I think he is about
done for." She reached out and touched the face of a man stretched
out on the floor beside her&mdash;an old, withered man, with a
human hand slung round his neck.</p>

<p>"Olpo!" Sherwin exclaimed.</p>

<p>"One of these men came for me some hours ago," Ellen went on,
pointing to the squatted chiefs. "He must have tip-toed into the
cabin, for I suddenly awoke to find him bendiug over me. He gave me
an awful fright at first, and when I was about to call one of you,
he signed to me to be silent. Then lie went on with further signs
to indicate he wanted me to go with him to see somebody who was
sick."</p>

<p>"You should have called us," Wilson said.</p>

<p>"The man seemed to have a most violent objection to my doing
that. He intimated most clearly that it was I he wanted, and that
no one else would do. So, I got up and followed him&mdash;and here
I am," she ended, simply.</p>

<p>Sherwin had grasped the situation at once. The reason of Olpo's
non-appearance out of the Dubu for the last day or two was that he
was stricken by the epidemic himself. No doubt all sorts of charms
and incantations had been tried by his colleagues, but as the
patient became worse instead of better they became alarmed and
decided to send for the white misi, of whose power they had heard
such a lot. Besides, was it not known that Olpo had failed to kill
the strange witch, and had she not promised through the mouthpiece
of the trader that she might kill Olpo instead? Undoubtedly the
white misi was the more powerful sorcerer, and it was due to her
machinations that Olpo was stricken. What better could they do than
bring the white misi to remove the sickness she had brought to
their chief? All this passed through Sherwin's mind in a flash. He
reached down and took Ellen's arm.</p>

<p>"Come out of this," he said. "You can do no good."</p>

<p>Ellen pulled her arm away. "Perhaps not," she said, a trifle
angrily. "But it may be that I can soothe his last hours. He is
only a poor old savage, but none the less a human being."</p>

<p>"But you don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to understand. Here is a dying man&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped as a strange sound came from outside&mdash;sounds as
of hurried feet and whispering voices.</p>

<p>"What is that?" the girl asked. "Will you please look?"</p>

<p>The circle of chiefs had heard it, too. One or two rose and went
along the corridor to the doorway. The others looked at Ellen and
Olpo with eyes that still patiently awaited some manifestation of
the girl's power.</p>

<p>Sherwin picked up Olpo and slung him across his shoulder like a
bag of chaff.</p>

<p>"Come on, Miss Russell," he said, making up the corridor, "We
won't leave you. We will take this man on board the schooner and
look after him there. You stand by her, Wilson."</p>

<p>The seated chiefs had arisen quickly as Sherwin picked up the
sick man. Olpo, their big chief, was being taken away from them.
For a moment they looked ugly. Wilson swung Ellen in front of him
and kept her in that position till they reached the doorway.</p>

<p>"Look!" Sherwin exclaimed, as they got out on the porch and
looked down the deck of the schooner, bright and clear in the
moonlight. "The crowd on the beach saw us come in here and took
advantage of our absence to get aboard and try taking their sick
friends ashore!"</p>

<p>About the deck numbers of natives moved about. Some were helping
the sick out of the hatch, others assisted them over the rail to
the beach.</p>

<p>"Oh, the poor silly creatures!" Ellen cried. "All our work will
be undone now. Oh, what a shame! It's enough to break one's heart.
And we were doing so well, too!"</p>

<p>The tide was about the schooner's quarters, and in the knee-deep
water four or five men were placing the bodies of some of the
patients, rolling them over and over and splashing.</p>

<p>"They do that to reduce the fever," Sherwin said. "They think
the water will quench the fire that is eating up the bodies of
their friends."</p>

<p>Ellen almost sobbed. "Cau't you do something to stop them? That
is the worst thing they could do. Stop them, Mr. Sherwin! Stop
them, or not one will survive!"</p>

<p>The natives had been too preoccupied to notice the group on the
porch of the Dubu, but when Sherwin took Olpo in his arms again and
shouted, they at once stopped and looked up.</p>

<p>"What's matter you feller do like that?" the trader roared.
"What kind fashion this?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and one or two began to slink away.</p>

<p>"White misi proper wild," Sherwin went on. "Might be plenty
feller dead now."</p>

<p>He lifted Olpo high in the air so that all could see.</p>

<p>"You look! Olpo! Close-up he dead! He no been listen to white
misi."</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment rippled up from the beach. Olpo nearly
dead, and the white misi alive! They had seen Ellen follow the
chief into the Dubu and at once concluded that she had fallen a
victim to Olpo's wiles. And even if the most powerful sorcerer for
miles around were not waiting for her in the gloom, no woman could
enter a Dubu and leave it alive. After they had seen Ellen enter
the building the relatives and friends were convinced that that was
the last of the white misi, and as soon as Sherwin and Wilson had
followed her and the coast was clear, they clambered aboard and
began the removal of their sick. It would be Olpo they would have t
fear now.</p>

<p>Yet, here was this strange woman alive and apparently unharmed,
and Olpo nearly dead! It seemed unbelievable, and one or two
suspicious voices mut tered that perhaps it was a trick. Sherwin
heard them. He turned to one of the chiefs behiud him, and placed
the sorcerer in his arms. Instantly, the chief cried out in a
high-pitched voice, and the others began to wail.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with these men?" Ellen asked wonderingly. The
trader took her by the arm and helped her across the splintered
wood and tangled gear of the bowsprit. Wilson followed, and it was
not until they stood on the schooner's deck that Sherwin answered
the girl's question.</p>

<p>"Olpo is dead," he said softly. "He died while I was talking. He
was already stiffening when I gave him to that chief."</p>

<p>Ellen said nothing, but hurried to the hatchway. "The nigs will
be convinced now," Sherwin said to Wilson, as they watched the girl
descend into the hold. "There will be no more trouble. All hands
will obey readily enough from this on."</p>

<p>"And she won't know the reason of it," Wilson said. "Ought we to
tell her?"</p>

<p>"Some day, perhaps. Certainly not uow. She might not approve of
what I did."</p>

<p>Wilson nodded and moved away. This was the longest conversation
that had taken place between the two men since they had been on the
schooner, and the dislike each felt for the other was momentarily
forgotten. Only something connected with the interest of Ellen
could have induced the trader to talk with Wilson at all, and he
sensed it that the other felt the same way.</p>

<p>There was not much difficulty in getting the natives to bring
the patients back to the schooner. The news of Olpo's death was all
over the village, and voices were chanting and tom-toms
beating&mdash;but softly&mdash;as though the mourners were afraid
of Ellen's wrath that they should bewail the death of her
enemy.</p>

<p>The effects of the removal of the sick and their immersion in
the sea were only too plainly visible, Every patient was decidedly
worse, and shortly after daylight there were three deaths. One of
these was the baby son of Bamu's cousin. Ellen felt its loss very
much.</p>

<p>"It was such a dear little thing," she said. "I just loved to
feel its tiny fingers gripping mine. It was doing so well, too. If
those silly creatures had not taken it away and dipped it in the
water, I am sure it would have lived. Why did not you men, or one
of you, stay here and watch them? I was safe enough."</p>

<p>Neither Sherwin nor Wilson knew what to answer. They could not
tell her about the reputation for sorcery Sherwin had manufactured
and sustained for her. The trader knew she would not understand and
would probably regard the whole thing as foolishness.</p>

<p>"We felt bound to make a search for you as soon as we found you
were missing," Wilson said. "This is not exactly civilisation, you
know, with policemen, street-lamps, and other safeguards
everywhere." But the extenuation did not satisfy her.</p>

<p>"I think you were both very foolish," she said. "I would trust
these natives will my life. They dress themselves up strangely, and
have all manner of queer customs, but they would not dream of hurt
ing me; they know I am their friend. The fact that that old chief
sent for me is proof."</p>

<p>None of them felt in a very cheerful mood when they sat down to
breakfast, neither did they improve as the day went on. During the
morning there were four more deaths, amongst them Bamu's cousin and
the young man who had given his bearers such trouble. Two died in
the afternoon, bringing the deaths for the day up to nine. Numbers
of sick were brought from the village, new arrivals coming in till
well on in the night.</p>

<p>Sherwin lost no opportunity of impressing the villagers with the
fact that if they had not interfered with the sick people on the
schooner there would have been no deaths. It was not quite true,
perhaps, for some would have died in any case, but it was a
powerful argument in favor of obedience of the white misi's
commands. The people brought their sick and carried away their dead
for burial, more or less uncomplainingly, firmly conviuced by
recent events that their only hope lay in the hands of the strange
witch that had been thrust upon them from the sea.</p>

<p>And Sherwin, watching, wondered what Ellen would say if she
knew.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. ELLEN BREAKS
DOWN</h2>

<p>The epidemic travelled quickly through the village. By the
fourth day the number of sick had increased to the extent of
filling the schooner's hold. To accommodate the surplus, Wilson and
Sherwin, at Ellen's suggestion, erected make-shift awnings of
sail-cloth and sacking over the full length of the deck, and made
up rude bunks on the hard boards. Fortunately, the weather held
fine. There was no rain, and the air was cooled by the south-east
trade which blew up with unfailing regularity each day, and gave
place to the land-breeze at night.</p>

<p>The natives brought their sick readily enough. But it was more
of fear of offending the white misi than belief she was their
friend that governed their action. She had willed that the stricken
should be given into her hands; and they obeyed the commands of she
who had destroyed Olpo, the powerful sorcerer. But Ellen, knowing
nothing of this, thought otherwise.</p>

<p>"Isn't it grand to see how they trust in us?" she said, one day.
"They recognise I am their good friend, and that their methods of
looking after the sick are worse than useless. As soon as a native
takes ill now they bring him here. No more crouchiug beside the
sick man in a musty grass-house and wailing and chanting and
disturbing him generally. They bring him here at once. It is
marvellous!"</p>

<p>"Revolutionary," Wilson said, with a glance at Sherwin.</p>

<p>"I thought native customs were too iugrained to render such a
change easy," Ellen went on. "You told me so yourself, Mr. Sherwin.
Yet, except for that night when the old chief died, we have had
little trouble to make them give up their old ideas and accept the
new. It shows they have a quick appreciation of what is really best
for them."</p>

<p>It was hard, grinding work for the three whites couped up on
that vessel of sickness and death. They allowed no healthy natives
on board and, consequently, multifarious duties fell to their lot.
Many of them were disagreeable, repulsive, but they worked
uncomplainingly. The two men assisted Ellen during the day and took
watches in turn at night, and Ellen was not backward in urging them
on when they seemed inclined to falter, and in thanking them for
work well done. The two men were open rivals for the girl's favors
now, each watching the other as a cat watches a mouse. Once or
twice they almost came to blows, for their nerves were frayed by
the sights they continually witnessed amongst the sick, their tired
muscles insufficiently rested. Sherwin, in addition, was
continually irritated by the knowledge that Ellen had gone back
upon her expressed dislike of Wilson. The man had insulted her most
grossly, she had resented it, yet here she was on quite friendly
terms with him, Indeed, she favored him more than the trader.
Sherwin guessed Wilson had apologised and begged forgiveness, and
the thought that it had been readily granted gave no surcease to
his troubled mind.</p>

<p>Despite the unceasing toil of their nurses, some of the natives
died.</p>

<p>"We could not expect to save them all," Ellen said, when Sherwin
commented on this. "That would have been impossible, situated as we
are. But we have saved a lot." She smiled wanly, "Is not that
something to be proud of?"</p>

<p>The following day a dozen men and women and a cluster of
children were sent ashore to their waitiug friends and relatives.
They were all thin and anaemic-looking, and some staggered from
weakness. But the fever was out of their blood, and the last
vestiges of the rash were gone. That night the chanting in the
village took on a less mournful note, and the tom-toms' beat was
brisker. From one house came the sound of a joy-song, the
almost-lilting voices having nothing of the grief-throb and
despairing falsetto that had floated up through the palms every
night for three weeks past.</p>

<p>Sick were brought to the schooner every day, but the number was
quickly decreasing. The departures soon exceeded the arrivals and
the joy-song spread to a score of houses. At intervals the dead
were mourned, but the gladsome note was the more insistent.</p>

<p>The villagers took to congregatiug on the beach about the
schooner, squatting on their heels in the blazing sunshine,
watching the deck expectantly. Whenever Ellen appeared, they
clapped their hands and made clicking noises with their teeth,
their faces wreathing in smiles. Sometimes one or another
spoke.</p>

<p>"They are thanking you," Sherwin explained to Ellen on one
occasion. "They say you are wonderful, I don't understand their
words, but the attitudes and expressions are plain enough."</p>

<p>"I knew they were grateful," Ellen said softly. "I am so glad we
have succeeded as well as we have."</p>

<p>By the end of the fourth week of the outbreak, there were only a
dozen patients on board the schooner, and none of them serious. The
end of the long hours of nursing, of hard, unending toil and nights
of broken sleep, was in sight, and Ellen sighed the relief she
felt.</p>

<p>"Two or three days now, and there won't be a single ease. It's
been a long struggle and a hard one. I don't know how I should have
got on without you two men."</p>

<p>She and Sherwin were sitting on the top of the cabin house
beneath the awning. Wilson was somewhere below. The natives on the
beach were looking up as usual, whispering amongst themselves, and
pointing Ellen out to the smaller children playing in the sand. For
the first time in some days, Sherwin was able to get a good look at
this girl who had worked so hard to save the lives of the ignorant,
filthy savages he knew so well. It was with something of a shock
that he realised to what extent the strain had told upon her. Her
cheeks were sunken and there were dark rings about her eyes. The
wonted freshness of her skin was gone or wilted as though from
disease. She was absolutely colorless, Her shoulders drooped. She
sat leaning against the broken stump of the mainmast as though glad
of the support and ready to fall asleep. It was a picture of a
tired-out girl that met Sherwin's eyes, a girl so utterly worn-out
as to be almost physically helpless.</p>

<p>"And the natives don't know how they would have got along
without you," Sherwin murmured. "You were our inspiration and
theirs."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I will not be sorry when I cap leave here and go
back to the station," she said, looking at him. He saw here eyes
were bright, that despite her physical weakness, the spirit burned
strong within her. "I am just longing for peace and quietness."</p>

<p>Sherwin jumped up. "You can have it now. There is no need for
you to stay on board here any longer. The remaining natives will be
all right in Wilson's care. Let me take you to the station at
once."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not yet, please. I am going to see this through to the very
end. Now, I think I will lie down in the cabin for awhile, if you
don't mind."</p>

<p>He helped her to rise and assisted her down the steps. As he
turned to go back on deck, she smiled at him. It was merely a smile
of thanks, but, somehow, it made Sherwin tremble and thrill. The
memory of that smile lived vividly in his memory for the rest of
the day, and at night his sleep was punctuated by a series of
dreams in which the chief phenomenon was a tired-out Ellen smiling
into his eyes.</p>

<p>Sherwin had kept a rough record of the number of cases. There
had been one hundred and eighty altogether, and with three
exceptions all these had been brought on board the schooner. Out of
this number, twenty-eight had died, eleven of them children, of
ages ranging from a few months to twelve years. The rest had been
adults of both sexes. All these had been buried in the sand at the
side of the Dubu in the native fashion&mdash;upright in a narrow
hole deep enough to allow the head to be covered to a depth of
about a foot. The sand was heaped above each grave in a small
conical mound surmounted by conch shells.</p>

<p>On the day before the last of the patients were ready to leave
the vessel, Ellen asked Sherwin for his record. She looked at it,
and then at the rows of shells dully white in the sunlight. She hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Only for you there would have been five times as many," Sherwin
said, endeavoring to comfort her. "Don't think about them."</p>

<p>"How can I help thinking about them? I can see those poor little
children now, hear their baby voices calling and crying," She
stared at the trader, dry-eyed and wildly. Her voice was harsh and
choking as though from the unshed tears.</p>

<p>Sherwin jumped towards her, calling Wilson as he did. The mate
came running from below, just as Ellen fell limply into the
trader's arms.</p>

<p>"I'll take her to the station at once," Sherwin said. "She might
be seriously ill after all this."</p>

<p>But Wilson had other views. "Why can't she stay here? I will
look after her. She told me she did not want to go away till the
last of the sick were well."</p>

<p>"Stand aside!" Sherwin roared. "I'm taking her out of this!" He
strode along the deck with his burden, climbed down the ladder,
which was immediately held stiff by natives on the beach, and set
off for the station.</p>

<p>"My dear! My dear!" he whispered into her hair in an agony of
heart. Unheeding of the watching natives, he bent forward and
kissed her head, It was the lightest, softest, gentlest kiss in the
world, but it seemed as though the girl sensed or felt it, for she
moved slightly and seemed to snuggle closer in the man's enfolding
arms.</p>

<p>Bamu, Lapa, and other natives came running as he approached the
station. Sherwin ordered Lapa to return at once and make Ellen's
bed ready. The native girl went right up to him and touched Ellen's
arm and stroked her hair.</p>

<p>"Bed all ready," she murmured. "Bed been ready long time. I been
wait, wait, wait for white misi come hack."</p>

<p>The women begged for the privilege of carrying Ellen, but
Sherwin roughly ordered them out of his way, and, with an air that
expressed more than a hint of pride, went through the coconuts, up
the steps of the house, and laid his burden on the bed.</p>

<p>The women were at his heels, and he gave them a few terse
instructions, and left the room.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later he was back. Lapa met him at the door.</p>

<p>"She sleep strong feller," she whispered, pointing to Ellen
lying comfortably under the blankets. "You no wake white misi!"</p>

<p>"They worship her!" Sherwin said to himself, as he turned away
after a long look at the tired, sleeping face beneath the
mosquito-net. "They call her a witch!" He felt for his pipe and
placed it between his lips, "For once they are right. She is a
witch&mdash;and I am one of her victims!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. THE THANKS-DANCE</h2>

<p>Ellen slept the rouud of the clock, but it was not till another
day had passed that she got up, dressed and went out on to the
verandah. Her appearance was greatly improved; the look of
tiredness was gone; some of the bloom had returned to her cheeks.
She greeted Sherwin cheerfully and enquired about the epidemic.</p>

<p>"Not a case in the whole village," the trader answered. "The
last patient left the schooner yesterday. Are you quite
recovered?"</p>

<p>"There was nothing much wrong with me," Ellen laughed. "I was
only tired out. It was very good of you to bring me here." She
looked straight at him, a twinkle in her eyes. Sherwin guessed that
Lapa or one of the other women might have told her that he had
carried her from the schooner, but the twinkle caused him to
suspect that she had not been as unconscious as he had thought.
What if she knew about that kiss! Sherwin felt himself blushing
like a school-girl, and it was with a mighty effort that he
answered in a tone he fondly thought seemed careless:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was nothing. Nothing at all. Ouly what anyone would have
done." He hesitated, looked at her sharply, and then
asked:&mdash;"Do you remember being brought here?"</p>

<p>Again Ellen's eyes twinkled, and a smile flickered about the
corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>"It is mostly all rather hazy and indistinct," she said, "But I
remember some of it all right." She turned quickly to the railiug
and pulled aside the blind. "What a lot of natives there are about!
Some of them are our old patients!"</p>

<p>Sherwin jumped at this opportunity to change the
conversation,</p>

<p>"They have been coming from the village in scores all the time
you were in bed," he said. "Each time Lapa or one of the other
women left the house, she was besieged with questions as to your
welfare."</p>

<p>Ellen looked steadily at the natives clustered about the house
and amongst the palms. The word had gone round that she was at the
railing, and men and women and children formed an excited
half-circle on the sand.</p>

<p>"They almost worship me!" Elleu exclaimed softly, and the trader
saw her eyes were moist. "It thrills me." She waved her hand in
greeting, and the villagers, with one accord, shouted their
joy.</p>

<p>"Naturally, they worship you," Sherwiu said. "You saved their
lives and they are thankful. I heard they were going to have a big
feast and dance in your honor."</p>

<p>Ellen had not asked after Wilson, Sherwiu was secretly satisfied
at this, and as the day wore on and she did not mention the mate's
name, he felt that her dislike for the man had returned in full. He
fervently hoped it was so, and that she would never speak of him
again. But he wanted to discover the reason of her change of
attitude to the mate on the schooner, and at supper he made a
tentative advance.</p>

<p>"Wilson has been here half-a-dozen times asking for you," he
said, slowly. "He seemed very anxious about you."</p>

<p>The news did not seem to affect the girl to any extent.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" she asked indifferently, and went on with her
meal.</p>

<p>"He was here last night, and again this morning before you were
awake."</p>

<p>Ellen poured out the tea, and passed Sherwin a cup.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" she said, coldly "The natives will have told him by
this that you are up and about," Sherwin persisted. "He will be
pleased."</p>

<p>"I daresay."</p>

<p>Sherwin gave it up at last. Evidently, Ellen was not to be drawn
on the subject of Wilson. Sherwin was delighted at her
indifference; yet he was somewhat irritated by her changes of
attitude towards the mate. The girl puzzled him, but he saw that it
was no use trying to worry causes and effects from her for the
preseut, at least.</p>

<p>Shortly after supper, Bamu appeared on the verandah.</p>

<p>"All ready now, Taubada," he said,</p>

<p>"What's all ready?"</p>

<p>"Big dance. White misi come?"</p>

<p>Ellen threw down the illustrated magazine she was reading and
looked up.</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked, "Are there more sick,"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sherwin. "The people want you to go to the village
to witness the festivities in connection with the rejoicing that
the epidemic is over."</p>

<p>Ellen jumped up, "Of course I will go. It will be great to see
the poor things expressing their joy." She ran into the bedroom and
returned a minute later with her sandshoes on.</p>

<p>"Come on, Mr. Sherwin," she invited. "You must come, too. You
are as responsible for the success of our efforts as I am."</p>

<p>The whole of the station natives accompanied them along the
beach. Others from the village came along to meet them, so that the
two whites entered the village with a following a hundred
strong.</p>

<p>The sun had been gone an hour, and it being the period between
the last of the south-east for the day, and the first of the
land-breeze, the air was very still. The lower fronds of the
coconuts drooped motionless, the topmost standing straight up
against the background of stars. The tide was well up, the foremost
of the tiny waves lapping the ends of the trailing convolvulus
vines.</p>

<p>A score of fires ranged down the centre of the village street.
Their light reflected on the fronts of the houses till the
grey-brown thatch gleamed and glistened, and it shone through the
tall, cylindrical boles of the coconuts in a manner that streaked
and crossed the ground with shadows. The natives were assembled in
little groups beside the fires, all talking and laughing, The women
were decked out in gala dress. In their hair were croton leaves and
flowers of the flaming hibiscus, and from their ears hung long
strings of dog's-teeth and small cowrie shells. Their breasts were
cris-crossed with flower-chains. On their arms were toyya shells,
bracelets, grass-circlets, and bands of red berries. They wore the
most gorgeous of the neck-to-knee petticoats in their possession,
some three or four, one above the other. Most of the men were
painted and smeared with ochre. Many of them wore bean-armlets and
anklets, some had feathers in their hair. But the number of the men
was few compared to that of the women.</p>

<p>Ellen, noticing this, asked her companion the reason. But before
Sherwin could reply a tom-tom at a fire further along the street
sounded a single note. Instantly a score of others burst into a
quick tattoo, and for a full minute rattled a time that was almost
martial, Then, as though in response to a conductor's baton, they
eased down into a slow, steady beat&mdash;a full-toned, throbbing
pulse, rhythmic and deep.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned towards the further end of the street, and
presently there was a murmur of long-drawn "oo-oohs" from the
people beside the fires. Coming down the street, on each side of
the row of fires, were four lines of men wearing enormous dancing
masks and head-dresses. They lifted their feet high in their
advance, prancing like a high-spirited horse, shaking their
head-gear and rattling the strings of beans about their wrists and
ankles. Half a step at a time they advanced, sometimes bowing till
their bodies were doubled, at others stamping hard on the sand with
their naked feet.</p>

<p>The joy-song burst from five hundred throats at their
appearance, the movements of the dancers in perfect time to the
singing and the throbbing of the drums.</p>

<p>It was Bamu who volunteered a translation of the words of the
joy-song:&mdash;</p>

<p>"They say:&mdash;'White misi good friend for us. White misi good
friend for us. We like white misi too much al'gether.'"</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound very poetical," Sherwin said, with a laugh.
"It doesn't rhyme, or anything." Ellen grasped his arm and held
it.</p>

<p>"Please don't," she said. Her tone was low, but the man heard
her above the noise. "I am almost crying."</p>

<p>A clear space had been left in front of the trader and the girl,
and as the dancers approached it the leading man of each line fell
back and worked his way to the rear. Then the four lines pranced
backwards for half the length of the street, and commenced the
advance again. As they neared the clear space, the new leaders fell
back in their turn, and again the lines went backwards. When this
had been repeated three or four times, Sherwin knew that this
particular dance would not finish till each eight of the whole
hundred had occupied the leading position. He turned to the girl at
his side. "They will keep this up all night," he said. "I am afraid
it will give you a headache. Shall we return to the station?"</p>

<p>Ellen shook her head, "And disappoint these people? That would
be cruel. I am enjoying it, anyway."</p>

<p>The singing and dancing continued far into the night. Pigs were
killed and roasted on the fires, and great piles of cooked yams,
sweet-potatoes, and other vegetables were handed round. A log had
been brought for Ellen and Sherwin to sit on, and it was so placed
that the girl could have the bole of a coconut palm to support her
back. Two or three times, Sherwin pressed her to return to the
station, but she refused.</p>

<p>"You go, if you like," she said once. "I will be all right
here."</p>

<p>"If you stay, I stay," Sherwin said firmly. Ellen made no
reply.</p>

<p>About midnight, the dancers and singers rested for a time, and
during the spell of quiet, Ellen jumped up and pointed.</p>

<p>"There is Mr. Wilson coming! I wonder he was not here before,
Perhaps he was waiting till the noise ceased so that we could
talk."</p>

<p>Sherwin looked at her wonderingly, A strange emotion seemed to
hold her in its grip. Her fingers clenched and unclenched
spasmodically, her body trembled. The trader was about to ask her
if she were ill, when, with an abrupt "Excuse me," she left him and
went to meet the mate.</p>

<p>Astonished, Sherwin saw her stop Wilson and hold him in earnest
conversation. He would have given all he possessed to have heard
what she was saying, but the pair were too far off for him to
hear.</p>

<p>The tom-toms were throbbing out the overture of the next dance,
when the girl returned. Wilson was walking slowly through the palms
in the direction of the schooner. Sherwin saw that Ellen's eyes
were very bright, and that the line of her mouth was tight and
firm.</p>

<p>"We will go home now, if you don't mind, Mr. Sherwin," she
said.</p>

<p>He rose at once, told Bamu to tell the villagers that the white
misi was tired and would go to bed, and he and the girl went on to
the beach and along to the station. All the way Ellen said not one
word till she reached the door of her room, when she bid the trader
a curt good-night. But, while Sherwin had respected her silence, he
did not fail to notice an air of triumph in her bearing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX. AN EXPLANATION</h2>

<p>At daylight Sherwin was awakened by Bamu shaking him gently and
saying "Boat come! Boat come!"</p>

<p>Sherwin rose at once. Half-a-mile from the mouth of the river
was a big topsail cutter. There was not a breath of wind, and the
vessel's sails hung flat and motionless. She rolled and swung,
easily and idly, to the light swell.</p>

<p>"Lapa say Captain belong 'Mokohu' there," said Bamu. "She got
good eye for look long way. She been go tell white misi."</p>

<p>From the village came a long-sustained "Sail-oh!" The beach was
dotted with figures hurrying to the station.</p>

<p>"All to much sorry white misi mus' go 'way," Bamu murmured. "I
think al'ogether make one big cry bye-em-bye." He looked up at the
white man. "I think you too much sorry, too?"</p>

<p>"Sorry?" Sherwin said to himself, turning away. "The place will
be unbearable when she is gone. I think I'll take a trip to
'Moresby, or somewhere."</p>

<p>He went into the compound and sat down on a fallen palm to watch
the vessel that was waiting for wind to make the river entrance. In
the fast-strengthening light one or two white-clad figures were
visible on the after-deck, but the distance was too great for white
eyes to distinguish forms and faces. Sherwin watched, depressed and
miserable.</p>

<p>The sun was peeping over the edge of the clean-cut horizon and
streaking the smooth surface of the sea with ever-broadening paths
of shining gold, when Ellen appeared. She looked at the cutter, bid
the trader good-morning, and sat down beside him on the
palm-trunk.</p>

<p>"Lapa has been telling me things," she said presently. "I had
something of a suspicion before, but now I know."</p>

<p>"Know what?" the man asked, half guessing what she meant.</p>

<p>"That the natives believe me to be a witch. And, oh, I think it
was just wonderful the way you worked it&mdash;facing all these
chiefs and others by yourself. Lapa dropped a word or two last
night that set me on the right track, and I made it my business to
worm the whole thing out of her."</p>

<p>"Then you are not annoyed?"</p>

<p>"Annoyed! Why should I be annoyed? You did it in the interest of
the natives. I am very pleased, indeed."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, then hesitatingly, she said, in a low
tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have a confession to make. My motives were not as wholly
disinterested as yours. Please don't think me a horrible
creature."</p>

<p>"I could never do that," he assured her.</p>

<p>She looked at him rather anxiously, as though uncertain that he
would not think hardly of her.</p>

<p>"It was not altogether because I wanted to obtain Mr. Wilson's
assistance with the sick people that I was nice to him. I had
another reason."</p>

<p>Sherwin's heart went cold, and the sense of depression
deepened.</p>

<p>"Yes," he managed to say. "And the reason?''</p>

<p>"A man would think it a most absurdly feminine one. It
was&mdash;it was revenge." She went on with sudden decision. "I
wanted to pay him out for what he said&mdash;. So, I allowed him to
think I had forgiven him and accepted his apology. I made it appear
I was willing to resume the relationship we enjoyed on the run
across from Thursday Island." She paused. "Men like him, with minds
like his, are not hard to manage when a woman sets out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And last night you told him the truth?" Sherwin
interrupted.</p>

<p>"I wanted to stay on the schooner till the very last and tell
him as I was leaving," she said. "But my plan of a dramatic ending
was upset by my breakdown. I thought he would show up last night,
and I was determined to wait till he did."</p>

<p>"He must have got a shock."</p>

<p>"I am not a bit sorry for him. Do you think it was horrible of
me? The plan worked two ways, you know; it meant our gaining his
help. If he had been nasty we could not have had the use of the
schooner."</p>

<p>The trader did not answer. His blood was racing feverishly. His
mind was in a whirl. Nothing was clear save the knowledge that
Wilson was nothing to Ellen. The first of the wind rustled the
coconut-fronds, and the cutter's sails filled, and her nose swung
for the river-bar. But he did not notice it. It was not until a
wisp of the girl's hair brushed his cheek, and he felt her hand on
his arm that he managed to collect himself.</p>

<p>"Please, please don't say you think badly of me for it," Ellen
was saying entreatingly. Her face was very close to his. Their
shoulders touched. He half-turned and looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ellen!" he whispered hoarsely. The next moment his arms were
about her, and her face was buried in his coat.</p>

<p>A number of natives were standing about, watching curiously. The
pair on the palm-trunk did not heed them. Even the sight of Wilson
striding through the compound to the river-beach to meet the cutter
now swinging in to the bank did not disturb them.</p>

<p>"The natives believe you to be a witch. I think you
are&mdash;you have bewitched me."</p>

<p>"Peter!" She raised her face to his. For a time there was
silence, and the natives began to slip away. "...I will go with you
as far as Moresby...and when you have finished your visit to your
brother, I will...meet you there..."</p>

<p>"...We will honeymoon 'down south' somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a whale for keeping promises, Sherwin," boomed a jovial
voice.</p>

<p>The pair sprang apart. Captain Morton was coming through the
palms from the river, where the cutter nestled against the bank.
"You've made her happy, all right."</p>
