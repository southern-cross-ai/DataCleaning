<h1 align="center"><b>Corporal Bob</b>
</h1>

<h3 align="center"><b>by</b><br>
<b>Frank L. Packard</b>
</h3>

<p align="center">From <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>, April 1906</p>

<p>Corporal Bob Marston, Northwest Mounted Police, shuffled the
greasy cards wearily, and laid them perfunctorily in little piles
on the table before him. Then he swept them petulantly into a
confused heap. He had played solitaire for two weeks, and the
diversion had lost its attraction. The strain of the situation was
getting on his nerves.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and walked to the single window that
the hut boasted. From the lean-to behind the little shanty came the
mournful whine of the sledge dogs. He gazed drearily out on the
endless plain of white. As far as his eye could reach there was
nothing to vary the monotonous miles of snow, save here and there a
cluster of gaunt, naked trees.</p>

<p>"Bob!"</p>

<p>Marston turned from the window to the corner where Jack Evans
lay tossing restlessly on his bunk. He raised the sufferer's head
awkwardly, and poured a few drops between the parched lips.</p>

<p>"Well, old chap?" he asked.</p>

<p>Evans' eyes opened to rest curiously for a moment on Bob's face,
then he whispered feebly:</p>

<p>"Been pretty bad, ain't I?"</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"Yep," he said tersely. "Better now, though."</p>

<p>Evans closed his eyes an instant; the light hurt them.</p>

<p>"How's the grub?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Grub? Grub's all right&mdash;lots of it," replied Bob shortly,
turning his back to Evans under pretense of lighting his pipe.
Conscious that the sick man's eyes were on him, Bob crossed the
room and began to poke the pitifully inadequate fire into a
cheerier blaze.</p>

<p>"That," said Evans, slowly and deliberately, "is a darned
lie!"</p>

<p>The stick in Bob's hand dropped with a crash to the floor.</p>

<p>"It ain't no use," continued Evans, "tryin' ter bluff me. Ye're
a good feller, Bob, an' white clean through; but I ain't been so
sick but what I know it's two week er more I been on this here
bunk, an' the day afore I was taken down we was plannin' ter strike
fer the fort. 'Cause why? 'Cause thar warn't only a week's grub
left. Thet's why!"</p>

<p>Corporal Marston squinted at him a minute through the immense
puffs of smoke he was emitting.</p>

<p>"You know too blamed much for your own good, you do," he
growled.</p>

<p>"Thet ain't all neither," resumed the sick man, nervously
plucking the fluffs of the coarse blanket. "The heavy storms air
a-comin' on, wuss'n the one thet ketched us. 'Twouldn't hev been no
easy job ter make the fort a week ago. Every day makes it wuss,
dogs gettin' weaker an' weaker, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snarled Bob. Every nerve in his body seemed to jangle
discordantly. He passed his hands over his eyes in an effort to
still the violent throbbing in his head. Desperately he pulled
himself together, knocked the ashes from his pipe, placed it
carefully in his pocket, and marched over to the bed. "You shut
up!" he repeated peremptorily, his hands stuck deep in his trousers
pockets. "I'm in command of this expedition. All you've got to do
is obey orders."</p>

<p>A little red flush of resentment tingled the pale, drawn
features.</p>

<p>"I'm no chicken at this business," said Evans querulously. "Ten
years I've been on duty in this God-forsaken country. Yer talk's
jest baby talk, so it is. Don't ye think I know," he cried, his
voice rising stronger in emotion, "thet it's sure death ter stay
anuther day? I can't go, so I got ter cash in; but yer stayin'
don't help none. You hike out fer the fort while you got the
strength left. What's the use uv yer goin' down an' out jest 'cause
<i>I</i> hev ter?"</p>

<p>Bob's lips twitched nervously.</p>

<p>"I ought to feel like smashing you for that," he said with
painful slowness, "only you're sick&mdash;and&mdash;somehow, I
guess I'm kind of out of sorts."</p>

<p>Neither of the men spoke for a time that seemed ages to them
both. Finally, Evans raised himself painfully on his elbow.</p>

<p>"I'm in dead earnest, Bob, an' I'm goin' ter hev my say. I seen
you kiss thet photergraph last night when you thought I was asleep.
I ain't got a soul in all the world what cares a cuss about me. I
ain't sayin' but it's my own fault; thet's neither 'ere ner thar.
'Tain't fittin' fer you ter stay. It's murder, thet's what it
is&mdash;jest murder! An' I ain't a-goin' ter hev it on my
conscience. An', so help me God," he finished solemnly, "ye're
a-goin' ter make tracks!"</p>

<p>Bob moistened his lips with his tongue as he leaned over the
bunk.</p>

<p>"There'll be a search party after us in a day or so," he said
thickly.</p>

<p>"Search party nothin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Bob's hand closed over the other's mouth. He turned Evans
over with his face to the wall, and drew the coverings up around
him.</p>

<p>"Go to sleep," he commanded sharply. "Maybe I'll go out by and
by and try for a shot."</p>

<p>He took his gun from the corner, drew the chair up to the table,
and began to polish an already spotless barrel. After a time his
exertions relaxed, and the gun was allowed to slip gradually to the
ground. He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees, his chin
resting in his hands, his eyes staring hard before him.</p>

<p>Once or twice he moved, shifting his position restlessly. He
groaned aloud in anguish, then started with a guilty glance toward
the corner. The figure on the bed was motionless.</p>

<p>Bob hitched his chair around until he faced the door with his
back to the bunk. His hand stole into his pocket. He took out a
photograph and laid it reverently on his knee. The eyes that looked
into his seemed pleading with him to come back. He shook his head
sadly as he lifted the picture to his lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary!" The words welled up from the heart of the man with
its immensity of yearning; the lips that scarcely moved to form
them trembled piteously. His head sank down again between bowed
shoulders. "My Mary!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he straightened up, his hands clenched tight in fierce
resentment. What was this sick thing on the bed that it should
stand between them? What claim had it to interpose? What jibing
mockery was this that held him back from the craving that racked
his very soul? Duty! The thought loomed up unbidden. What was duty
to him? A morbid sentiment&mdash;and how chimerical! Everything was
chimerical!</p>

<p>He drew his hand peevishly over his face; the photograph fell
unheeded to the floor. His bloodshot eyes fastened themselves on
the fur mat that hung before the little doorway leading to the
dogs' quarters. Slowly he rose to his feet, and on tiptoe began to
cross the room toward it, his hands stretched out before him like
one groping in the dark. His face, sullenly averted from the sick
man's corner, was drawn and haggard, ashy white with the workings
of his reeling brain. Trembling as with the ague, he pushed aside
the mat and let it fall behind him; then he paused to wipe the
great beads of sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with me?" he muttered plaintively. "It's a square
deal. The fool suggested it himself; I'd never have thought of it
if he hadn't. Lie down, confound you!" he snarled, with a vicious
kick at the dogs that whined around him.</p>

<p>They huddled back into the corner, crouching in fear before this
new master whom they did not know. Bob stooped and hauled the sled
into the middle of the shed. He began to fumble with the gear.</p>

<p>"There's more harness than I want," he babbled, with a curious
chuckle. "Didn't bring any spare ones either; there must be more
dogs somewhere." He commenced to count them.
"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four; where's the others? Dead. Of
course they're dead! Knew it before, only I must have
forgotten."</p>

<p>He sat down on the sled and began to tell off the details on his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Four dogs&mdash;two hundred miles&mdash;no
rations&mdash;Mary?"</p>

<p>There was a note of interrogation in the last word. Who was
Mary? Yes, he remembered now&mdash;there had been a picture, hadn't
there? He felt in his pockets. Well, it didn't matter, he must have
lost it. Nothing mattered! He was going away from this hell of
torment, away from&mdash;</p>

<p>He bounded to his feet, shivering in every limb. What was that?
Stealthily he edged toward the doorway, and cautiously lifted a
corner of the rug to peer through into the room beyond. His eyes
mechanically followed Evans' movements, as from the floor, where he
had fallen in an effort to leave his bunk, the sick man slowly and
painfully pulled himself to his knees, swaying to and fro as he
clutched desperately for support.</p>

<p>There was a moment's quiet as Evans steadied himself; then Bob
started nervously. The slow, faltering words seemed to reach him
from some great distance.</p>

<p>"I ain't never prayed afore, God," was the piteous confession,
"an' I ain't no kind uv right ter now; but seems's if I'd orter.
You know how 'tis, God, an' how on account uv me Bob's figurin' ter
stick it out. 'Taint't fit ner proper fer me what has nary chick
ner child ter stand atween him an' her. Oh, God! I don't know how
ter pray, but thar ain't no call fer Bob ter die!"</p>

<p>Evans' voice broke with a half sob as he fumbled for his words.
Bob stirred uneasily. A faint glimmer of reason had come to him,
and he understood that Evans was praying&mdash;praying that he,
Bob, shouldn't die. Well, he wasn't going to die. He was going
away. He'd almost forgotten that. He was going away.</p>

<p>Evans' voice was firmer as he continued:</p>

<p>"An' so, God, thar ain't no other thing fer me ter do." His hand
groped beneath the blanket. "Jest make me man enough ter
&mdash;"</p>

<p>Like a flash Bob's awakening came in all its bitterness. With a
cry he dashed across the room and knocked up Evans' hand. The
bullet buried itself harmlessly in the rafters above their
heads.</p>

<p>Evans staggered slowly to his feet. Between them, on the floor,
lay the still smoking revolver. The sick man's glance, half
defiant, half wistful, rested for an instant on Bob's face; then he
pitched forward in a deathlike swoon.</p>

<p>Bob caught him as he fell, and lifted him tenderly back into the
bunk. The room seemed stifling hot. He staggered blindly to the
door, wrenched it open, and sank bareheaded upon his knees in the
snow.</p>

<p>For a moment he stayed there motionless; then, sobbing like a
little child, he poured forth the bitter weight of shame that bowed
him down. And as he prayed, in the distance, faintly borne to him
by the wind, came the yelping of a pack of dogs&mdash;the crack of
whips&mdash;the sound of a human voice.</p>
