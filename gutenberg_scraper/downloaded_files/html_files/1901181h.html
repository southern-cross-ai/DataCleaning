  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheUnraveledMystery"></a>The Unraveled Mystery</b></h2>
  <p align="left">We, meaning thereby society, are frequently in the habit of
    looking at a successful man, and while surveying him, think how fortunate
    he has found life, how chances have opened up to him, and how lucky he has
    been in drawing so many prizes.</p>
  <p align="left">We do not, or we will not, see the blanks which he may have
    also drawn. We look at his success, thinking of our own want of victories,
    shut our eyes to his failures, and envy his good fortune instead of emulating
    his industry. For my part I believe that no position or success comes without
    that personal hard work which is the medium of genius. I never will believe
    in luck.</p>
  <p align="left">When this habit of looking at success and shutting our eyes
    to failure is exercised in reference, not to a single individual, but to
    a body, the danger of coming to a wrong conclusion is very much increased.</p>
  <p align="left">This argument is very potent in its application to the work
    of the detective. Because there are many capital cases on record in which
    the detective has been the mainspring, people generally come to the conclusion
    that the detective force is made up of individuals of more than the average
    power of intellect and sagacity.</p>
  <p align="left">Just as the successful man in any profession says nothing about
    his failures, and allows his successes to speak for themselves, so the detective
    force experiences no desire to publish its failures, while in reference to
    successes detectives are always ready to supply the reporter with the very
    latest particulars.</p>
  <p align="left">In fact, the public see the right side only of the police embroidery,
    and have no idea what a complication of mistakes and broken threads there
    are on the wrong.</p>
  <p align="left">Nay, indeed, the public in their admiration of the public successes
    of the detective force very generously forget their public failures, which
    in many instances are atrocious.</p>
  <p align="left">To what cause this amiability can be attributed it is perhaps
    impossible to say, but there is a great probability that it arises from the
    fact that the public have generally looked upon the body as a great public
    safeguard&mdash;an association great at preventing crime.</p>
  <p align="left">Be this as it may, it is certain that the detective force is
    certainly as far from perfect as any ordinary legal organization in England.</p>
  <p align="left">But the reader may ask why I commit myself to this statement,
    damaging as it is to my profession.</p>
  <p align="left">My answer is this, that in my recent days such a parliamentary
    inquiry (of a very brief nature, it must be conceded) has been made into
    the uses and customs of the detective force, as must have led the public
    to believe that this power is really a formidable one, as it affects not
    only the criminal world but society in general.</p>
  <p align="left">It had appeared as though the English detectives were in the
    habit of prying into private life, and as though no citizen were free from
    a system of spydom, which if it existed would be intolerable, but which has
    an existence only in imagination.</p>
  <p align="left">It is a great pity that the minister who replied to the inquiry
    should have so faintly shown that the complaint was faint, if not altogether
    groundless.</p>
  <p align="left">I do not suppose the public will believe me with any great
    amount of faith, and simply because I am an interested party; yet I venture
    to assert that the detective forces as a body are weak; that they fail in
    the majority of the cases brought under their supervision; and finally, that
    frequently their most successful cases have been brought to perfection, not
    by their own unaided endeavours so much as by the use of facts, frequently
    stated anonymously, and to which they make no reference in finally giving
    their evidence. This evidence starts from the statement, &ldquo;from information
    I received.&rdquo; Those few words frequently enclose the secret which led
    to all the after operations which the detective deploys in description, and
    without which secret his evidence would never have been given at all.</p>
  <p align="left">The public, especially that public who have experienced any
    pressure of the continental system of police, and who shudder at the remembrance
    of the institution, need have no fear that such a state of things municipal
    can ever exist in England. It could not be attempted as the force is organized,
    and it could not meet with success were the constitution of the detective
    system invigorated, and in its reformed character pressed upon English society,
    for it would be detected at once as unconstitutional, and resented accordingly.</p>
  <p align="left">With these remarks I will to the statement I have to make concerning
    my part, that of a female detective, in the attempt to elucidate a criminal
    mystery which has never been cleared up, which from the mode in which it
    was dealt with, ran little chance of being discovered, and which will now
    never be explained.</p>
  <p align="left">The simple facts of the case, and necessary to be known, are
    these:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">One morning, a Thames boatman found a carpet-bag resting on
    the abutment of an arch of one of the Thames bridges. This treasure-trove
    being opened, was found to contain fragments of a human body&mdash;no head.</p>
  <p align="left">The matter was put into the hands of the police, an inquiry
    was made, and nothing came of it.</p>
  <p align="left">This result was very natural.</p>
  <p align="left">There was little or no intellect exercised in relation to the
    case. Facts were collected, but the deductions that might have been drawn
    from them were not made, simply because the right men were not set to work
    to&mdash;to sort them, if I may be allowed that expression.</p>
  <p align="left">The elucidation, as offered by me at the time, and which was
    in no way acted upon, was due&mdash;I confess it at first starting&mdash;not
    to myself, but to a gentleman who put me in possession of the means of submitting
    my ultimate theory of the case to the proper authorities.</p>
  <p align="left">I was seated one night, studying a simple case enough, but
    which called for some plotting, when a gentleman applied to see me, with
    whom I was quite willing to have an interview, though I did not even remotely
    recognise the name on the card which was sent in to me.</p>
  <p align="left">As of course I am not permitted to publish his name, and as
    a false one would be useless, I will call him Y&mdash;.</p>
  <p align="left">He told me, in a few clear, curt words, very much like those
    of a detective high in office, and who has attained his position by his own
    will, that he knew I was a detective, and wanted to consult with me.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, very well, if I am a detective, you can consult
    with me. You have only yourself to please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He then at once said that he had a theory of the Bridge mystery,
    as he called it and as I will call it, and that he wanted this theory brought
    under the consideration of the people at Scotland Yard.</p>
  <p align="left">So far I was cautious, asking him to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">He did so, and I may say at once that at the end of a minute
    I threw off the reserve I had maintained and became frank and outspoken with
    my visitor.</p>
  <p align="left">I will not here reproduce his words, because if I did so I
    should afterwards have to go through them in order to interpolate my own
    additions, corrections, or excisions.</p>
  <p align="left">It is perhaps sufficient to say that his entire theory was
    based upon grounds relating to his profession as a medical man. Therefore,
    whenever a statement is made in the following narrative which smacks of the
    surgery, the reader may fairly lay its origin to Y&mdash;; while,
    on the other hand, the generality of the conclusions drawn from these facts
    are due to myself.</p>
  <p align="left">I shall therefore put the conversations we had at various times
    in the shape of a perfected history of the whole of them, with the final
    additions and suggestions in their proper places, though they may have occurred
    at the very commencement of the argument.</p>
  <p align="left">As our statement stood, as it was submitted to the authorities,
    so now it is laid before the public, official form and unnecessary details
    alone being excised.</p>
  <p align="left">1. The mutilated fragments did not when placed together form
    anything like an entire body, and the head was wanting.</p>
  <p align="left">The first fact which struck the medical man was this, that
    the dissection had been effected, if not with learning, at least with knowledge.
    The severances were not jagged, and apparently the joints of the body had
    not been guessed at. The knife had been used with some knowledge of anatomy.</p>
  <p align="left">The inference to be drawn from these facts was this, that whoever
    the murderer or homicide might be, either he or an accessory, either at or
    after the fact, was inferentially an educated man, from the simple discovery
    that there was evidence he knew something of a profession (surgery) which
    presupposes education.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, it is an ordinary rule, in cases of murder where there
    are two or more criminals, that these are of a class.</p>
  <p align="left">That is to say, you rarely find educated men (I am referring
    here more generally to England) combine with uneducated men in committing
    crime. It stands evident that criminals in combination presupposes companionship.
    This assertion accepted, or allowed to stand for the sake of argument, it
    then has to be considered that all companionship generally maintains the
    one condition of equality. This generality has gained for itself a proverb,
    a sure evidence of most widely-extended observation, which runs&mdash;&ldquo;Birds
    of a feather flock together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Very well. Now, where do we stand in reference to the Bridge
    case, while accepting or allowing the above suppositions?</p>
  <p align="left">We arrive at this conclusion:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">That the state of the mutilated fragments leads to the belief
    that men of some education were the murderers.</p>
  <p align="left">2. The state of the tissue of the flesh of the mutitilated
    fragments showed that the murder had been committed by the use of the knife.</p>
  <p align="left">This conclusion was very easily arrived at.</p>
  <p align="left">There is no need to inform the public that the blood circulates
    through the whole system of veins and arteries in about three minutes, or
    that nothing will prevent blood from coagulating almost immediately it has
    left the veins. To talk of streams of blood is to speak absurdly.</p>
  <p align="left">If, therefore, an artery is cut, and the heart continues to
    beat for a couple of minutes after the wound is made, the blood will be almost
    pumped out of the body, and the flesh, after death, will in appearance bear
    that relation to ordinary flesh that veal does to ordinary beef&mdash;a similar
    process of bleeding having been gone through with the calf, that of exhausting
    the body of its blood.</p>
  <p align="left">What was the conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the
    fragments showed by their condition that the murdered man had been destroyed
    by the use of the knife?</p>
  <p align="left">The true conclusion stood thus&mdash;that he was murdered by
    foreigners.</p>
  <p align="left">For if we examine a hundred consecutive murders and homicides,
    committed in England by English people, we shall find that the percentage
    of deaths from the use of the knife is so small as barely to call for observation.
    Strangling, beating, poisoning (in a minor degree)&mdash;these are the modes
    of murder adopted in England.</p>
  <p align="left">The conclusion, then, may stand that the murder was committed
    by foreigners.</p>
  <p align="left">I am aware that against both the conclusions at which I have
    arrived it might be urged that educated and uneducated men have been engaged
    in the same crime; and secondly, that murders by the knife are perpetrated
    in England.</p>
  <p align="left">But in all cases of mystery, if they are to be solved at all,
    it is by accepting probabilities as certainties, so far as acting upon them
    is concerned.</p>
  <p align="left">3. There was further evidence than supposition to show that
    the remains were those of a foreigner.</p>
  <p align="left">This evidence is divided into a couple of branches. The first
    depends upon the evidence of the pelves, or hip bones, which formed a portion
    of the fragments; the second upon the evidence of the skin of the fragments.</p>
  <p align="left">First&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">It may be remarked by any one of experience that there is this
    distinctive difference between foreigners and Englishmen, and one which may
    be seen in the Soho district any day&mdash;that while the hips of foreigners
    are wider than those of Englishmen, foreign shoulders are not so broad as
    English; hence it results that while foreigners, by reason of the contrast,
    look generally wider at the hips than shoulders, Englishmen, for the greater
    part, look wider at the shoulders than the hips.</p>
  <p align="left">This distinction can best be observed in contrasting French
    and English, or German and English soldiery. Here you find it so extremely
    evident as not to admit discussion.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, was there any evidence in the fragments to which this
    comparative international argument could apply?</p>
  <p align="left">Yes.</p>
  <p align="left">The medical gentleman who examined the fragments deposed that
    they belonged to a slightly-built man. Then followed this remarkable statement,
    that the hip bones, or pelves, were extremely large.</p>
  <p align="left">The second branch of this evidence, relating to the skin, may
    now be set out.</p>
  <p align="left">The report went on to say that the skin was covered with long,
    strong, straight black hairs.</p>
  <p align="left">Now it is very remarkable that the skin should exhibit those
    appearances which are usually associated with strength, while the report
    distinctly sets out that the fragments belonged to a slightly-built man.</p>
  <p align="left">It strikes the most ordinary thinker at once that his experience
    tells him that slight, weakly made men are generally distinguishable for
    weak and thin hair. Most men at once recognise the force of the poetical
    description of Samson&rsquo;s strength lying in his hair.</p>
  <p align="left">There is, then, surely something contradictory in the slight
    build, and the long, strong black hair, if we judge from our ordinary experience.
    But if we carry our experience beyond the ordinary, if we go into a French
    or Italian eating-house in the Soho district, it will be found that scarcely
    a man is to be found who is destitute of strong hair, for the most part black,
    upon the face. It need not be added that hair thickly growing on the face
    is presumptive proof that the entire skin possesses that faculty, the palms
    of the hands and soles of the feet excepted.*</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">*It should be here again pointed out that it is to the doctor
    that these physiological remarks are to be attributed. </p>
  <p align="left">Now follows another intricate piece of evidence. The hairs
    are stated to be long, black, and strong&mdash;that is to say, black, thick,
    and without any curl in them.</p>
  <p align="left">Any man who, by an hospital experience, has seen many English
    human beings, will agree with me that the body hair here in England is rarely
    black, rarely long, and generally with a tendency to curl.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, go to the French and Italian caf&eacute;s already referred
    to, and it will be found that the beards you shall see are black, very strong,
    and the hairs individually straight.</p>
  <p align="left">The third conclusion stands thus:</p>
  <p align="left">That the bones and skin of the fragments point to their having
    formed a portion of a foreigner rather than an Englishman.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Evidence of the Fragments</b>. The evidence of the fragments, therefore,
    goes problematically to prove that the murdered man was an educated foreigner,
    stabbed to death by one or more educated foreigners.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, what evidence can be offered which can support this theory?</p>
  <p align="left">Much.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first place, the complaints of the French Government
    to England, and the results of those complaints, very evidently show that
    London is the resting-place of many determined foreigners. In fact, it is
    a matter beyond all question, that London has at all times been that sanctuary
    for refugees from which they could not be torn.</p>
  <p align="left">Hence London has always been the centre of foreign exiled disaffection.</p>
  <p align="left">Then if it can be shown that foreign exiled disaffection is
    given to assassination, it stands good that we have here in London foreigners
    who are ready to assassinate.</p>
  <p align="left">Experience shows that this tendency to assassinate on the part
    of foreign malcontents is a common understanding amongst them. There is no
    need to refer to the attempts upon the life of the Emperor of the French,
    upon the life of the father of the late King of Naples&mdash;there is no
    need to point out that in the former cases the would-be assassins have lived
    in London, and have generally set out from London. All required is, to talk
    of tyranny with the next twenty foreigners you may meet, good, bad, and indifferent.
    It will be found that the ordinary theory in reference to a tyrant is, not
    that he shall be overthrown by the will of the people, but by the act of
    assassination.</p>
  <p align="left">This theory is the natural result, possibly, of that absence
    of power in the people which we English possess. We take credit to ourselves
    for abhorring assassination in reference to tyrants; but it should never
    be forgotten that here we have no need of assassination&mdash;the mere will
    of the people (when it is exerted) being quite enough to carry away all opposition.</p>
  <p align="left">Once admit assassination as a valuable aid in destroying tyranny,
    and you recognise by inference its general value as a medium of justice and
    relief.</p>
  <p align="left">Now apply the argument to the treachery of a member of a secret
    society, and you will comprehend the suggestion that the murdered man was
    a member of a secret political society, who was either false, or supposed
    to be false, to the secret society to which he belonged.</p>
  <p align="left">The question now arises&mdash;are there foreign secret societies
    established in London?</p>
  <p align="left">Have they an existence abroad? Unquestionably. Even here in
    open England there are a dozen secret societies of a fellowship-like character&mdash;Masons,
    and Foresters, and Odd Fellows, &amp;c.  &amp;c.</p>
  <p align="left">And if foreigners have secret societies abroad, in spite of
    the police, why not here, where they have perfect liberty to form as many
    secret societies as they like?</p>
  <p align="left">Where has the money come from which has rigged out various
    penniless men, and sent them on the Continent to assassinate this or that
    potentate?</p>
  <p align="left">The inference is good that the money is found by secret societarians.
    Where else could it come from? Exiles personally are not rich; but if twenty
    economical professors save two pounds a-piece in six months, there is forty
    pounds to be applied to a purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">Is there any solid evidence beyond that of the fragments to
    suggest that the murdered man was a foreigner? There is.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first place, the state of those fragments showed that
    death had been recent&mdash;say, within two days.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, was any man missing during those two days who was in any
    way suggestively identifiable with the dead man?</p>
  <p align="left">If so, no application was made to the police.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, if the dead man were an Englishman, and all who knew him
    were not implicated in his death (a most unlikely supposition), it seems
    pretty evident that the discovery of the murder following so swiftly on the
    fact, some clue to the mystery must have been gained.</p>
  <p align="left">Granted the supposed Englishman had no relations in London
    (for it must be accepted as certain that the murder was committed in town,
    it being hardly within the bounds of possibility to suppose that the remains
    were brought into London to hide)&mdash;granted he had no friends, he must
    have had either servants, landlady, or employers. If any of these had existed,
    how certain it is that the publicity of the crime would have been followed
    by some inquiries by some of these people.</p>
  <p align="left">Not one was made.</p>
  <p align="left">Not any evidence was offered to the police that could for a
    moment be looked upon as valuable, although it is not perhaps going too far
    to say that every soul in London who could comprehend the affair had heard
    of and talked it over within twenty-four hours of its discovery, thanks to
    the power and extension of the press.*</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">* I point out as an instance of the late case of poisoning
    a wife and children in a cab. The culprit was discovered within twenty-four
    hours of the publication of the crime, and by several people in no way connected
    with the family in which the catastrophe occured. </p>
  <p align="left">But see how thoroughly this absence of all inquiry will fall
    in with the murdered man having been a foreign refugee resting in this country.</p>
  <p align="left">Firstly&mdash;these refugees lodge together, and make so free
    with each other&rsquo;s lodgings, and visit so frequently and so generally,
    that an English landlady would have some difficulty in telling who was and
    who was not her lodger. It would be most unlikely that she would miss a foreigner
    who had been staying with her foreign lodger some weeks. Hence it might readily
    happen that a man having no locality with which he could be identified, no
    suspicion would be aroused by his absence from any particular place.</p>
  <p align="left">Then see how this supposed poverty of lodging would accord
    with a refugee who, broken down by want, might betray his society in order
    to gain bread, by selling their secrets to his home-police.</p>
  <p align="left">Or, on the other hand, he might be an actual police spy, sent
    by his government to play the refugee and the poverty-stricken wretch, in
    order the better to penetrate the secrets of conspirators.</p>
  <p align="left">Then mark how all chance of recognition is avoided by the absence
    of the head. In disposing of the fragments, and slinging them over the bridge
    by means of a rope, it was intended silently to drop the ugly burden into
    the Thames. The idea of the bag resting on the abutment of the bridge could
    never have entered into the precautionary measures perfected by the murderers,
    and yet the necessity of strict secresy was made wonderfully evident in the
    fact of the head being kept back.</p>
  <p align="left">For what purpose? Probably that the chief actors in the murder
    might be sure of its destruction&mdash;perchance that it might be forwarded
    to the president of a secret society, that the death of the traitor might
    be proved beyond all dispute.</p>
  <p align="left">Another very important line of consideration is the inquiry
    why such a means of disposing of the remains as that taken was adopted. It
    will be remarked that the objectionable process of cutting up the body had
    to be gone through, and that then the dangerous act of carrying or riding
    with a bag of human remains through the streets to the river had to be effected.
    And effected <i>in the night time</i>, when it must be notorious to all parties
    the police are particularly alert in inquiring into the nature of the parcels
    carried past them. It will frequently happen that the police stop and justifiably
    examine heavy packages which they find being carried in the streets during
    the night.</p>
  <p align="left">The encountering of all these enormous risks, to say nothing
    of the fear of interruption during the final act of lowering the carpet-bag,
    all go to presuppose that the murderers were unable to dispose of the body
    in any less hazardous manner.</p>
  <p align="left">What is the mode in which murderers usually seek to hide the
    more awful traces of their guilt in the shape of the murdered man? They generally
    adopt the simplest and safest mode&mdash;hiding under the ground.</p>
  <p align="left">A body buried ten feet in the ground, even though in the close
    cellar of a house, would give no warning of the hidden secret. A body buried
    in quicklime, under similar circumstances, would give no warning, though
    only four or three feet below the surface.</p>
  <p align="left">Burial is the most evident and simplest mode of disposing of
    a dead body. How is it, then, that the murderers in question did not bury,
    and ran a series of frightful risks, which resulted in the discovery of the
    remains?</p>
  <p align="left">The answer is obvious&mdash;they had no means of burial. In
    other words, the murder being done in a house where there was no command
    of the ground floor it was impossible to bury the body, and so it had to
    be disposed of in some other way. The inference therefore, is, that the occupier
    of the place was a lodger&mdash;not a householder.</p>
  <p align="left">Now make inquiries in the Soho district and you will find that
    refugees rarely become householders. Always hoping, perhaps, to return to
    their countries, never possibly desirous of taking any step which shall appear
    to themselves like a settling in a foreign land, it will be found that they
    prefer lodgings, and that the householders in most of the streets frequented
    by this sort of people are either English people or foreigners who do <i>not</i>    belong to the refugee class, such as Swiss (chiefly) and the world of waiters,
    who with their savings have gone into foreign housekeeping.</p>
  <p align="left">I am aware that there is one good objection to this part of
    my scheme, in the remark that the murder might have been committed in a house
    occupied by the murderer or his friends, but that there might be no yard
    attached, or a yard too much exposed, or that the ground-floor was too publicly
    in use to admit of time for the removal of the boards, the replacing of the
    flooring, and the burial of the body.</p>
  <p align="left">However, I beg again to urge the doctrine of probabilities.
    Accepting the theory that it was a murder by foreigners, and not denying
    the statement that foreign refugees, as a rule, rarely become householders,
    the probability is greater that the murderers had no ground in which to bury,
    rather than they had ground at their command, but that circumstances prevented
    them from using it.</p>
  <p align="left">It is true that there is one awkward point in the fact that
    the bridge selected from which to throw their burden was not so near to the
    refugee district as the late Suspension Bridge. At first sight it would appear
    strange that a longer risk should be run by taking the remains to a bridge
    not the nearest to the scene of the murder. But it must be remembered that
    the Suspension Bridge had no recesses, while the actual bridge used has many&mdash;that
    the Suspension Bridge was altogether more open and better lit than the other.
    These suggestions must be taken for what they are worth. I am willing to
    admit that it still remains extraordinary that the attempt to dispose of
    the body should have been made at the more distant of the two bridges, and
    I acknowledge that the apparent advantages of the bridge used over the Suspension
    do not appear to compensate the extra risk incurred.</p>
  <p align="left">Let those who object thoroughly to the whole of this theory,
    advanced to account for a mystery which has never been cleared up&mdash;let
    them make the most of a weak point.</p>
  <p align="left">The probability seems to me that the murdered man was a spy
    amongst men who, holding to the theory of the justice of assassination, very
    necessarily recognised its value in relation to a spy in the pay of a tyrant.
    Nay, to be at once exhaustive in reference to spies, few people will be inclined
    to deny that the spy, whatever the shape he has taken, has always been dealt
    with most implacably.</p>
  <p align="left">The supposition once accepted that the murderers had no power
    of burial, the use of the Thames as a hiding place follows almost as a natural
    consequence. To hide below the water when the earth is not to be opened for
    the purpose of concealment appears to be a very natural thought. In what
    other way could the body be so readily disposable?</p>
  <p align="left">The Thames offered secresy, the risk of carriage was surmountable;
    this means therefore of concealment, though it involved danger to those concerned
    in the work, was far preferable to leaving the remains in the street&mdash;a
    mode which only a madman would adopt.*</p>
  <p align="left" class="note">* Such a mode was exercised a few months since with several
    still-born children. Inquiry was set on foot, and the perpetrator of this
    open mode of disposing of human remains turned out to be a doctor who had
    suffered so much from delirium tremens that he might be called a madman. </p>
  <p align="left">Had the bag not lodged on the abutment of the bridge not one
    hint of the crime, it is evident, would ever have been made public. Or two
    or more may have been concerned in this crime, but they all kept their counsel
    well. Whether this silence was the result of brotherhood or fear it is impossible
    to say&mdash;possibly the latter. The very success of this one murder would
    intimidate any societarian who contemplated betraying his companions.</p>
  <p align="left">There has but to be added to the statement already put before
    the reader, two facts which, however, call for little or no comment.</p>
  <p align="left">1.
    The toll-keeper at one end of the bridge recognised the carpet-bag as a heavy
      one he had lifted over his toll-bar during the night.</p>
  <p align="left">2.
    He stated that he did this kindness for a woman whom he afterwards thought
      must have been a man in woman&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
  <p align="left">I see no value in this evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">1.
    The identification of the bag was of no value.</p>
  <p align="left">2.
    It does not appear that the man remarked upon any peculiarity of the carrier
      of the bag till after its discovery on the bridge abutment. And therefore
      his evidence is not reliable.</p>
  <p align="left">All I have now to do is to put in form the result I drew from
    the above theoretic evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">The result in question may be put thus:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Deduction</b>.&mdash;That a foreign man, of age, but not aging,
    was murdered by stabbing by the members of a secret foreign society of educated
    men which he had betrayed. That this murder was committed by lodgers and
    most probably on some other floor than the basement, and of a house situated
    in the Soho district.</p>
  <p align="left">A copy of this statement now made to the reader, but somewhat
    more abridged and technical was forwarded to the authorities&mdash;but so
    far as I have been able to learn it was never accepted as of any value.</p>
  <p align="left">The inquiry, as all the world knows, failed.</p>
  <p align="left">I do not wonder that it did.</p>
  <p align="left">Left in the hands of English police, who set about their work
    after their ordinary rule, it is evident that if the murder was committed
    by foreigners, in a foreign colony, there was little chance of discovery.</p>
  <p align="left">I believe the chief argument held against me at the time I
    sent in my report ran as follows: that if my supposition to the effect that
    the murdered man was a foreign police spy were correct, the publicity given
    to the discovery of the remains would have led to a communication sooner
    or later from a foreign prefect of police stating that an officer was missing.</p>
  <p align="left">I did not make a reply to the objection, but I could have announced
    that the French police, for instance, are not at all desirous of advertising
    their business, and that a French prefect of police would prefer to lose
    a man, and let the chance of retribution escape, rather than serve justice
    by admitting that a French political spy had been in London.</p>
  <p align="left">The silence of continental police prefects at that time is
    by no means to be accepted as an evidence that they missed no official who
    had been sent to England.</p>
  <p align="left">The case failed&mdash;miserably.</p>
  <p align="left">It could not be otherwise.</p>
  <p align="left">How would French police succeed, set to work in Bethnalgreen
    to catch an English murderer?</p>
  <p align="left">They would fail&mdash;miserably also.</p>
  <p align="left">There can be no question about it, to those who have any knowledge
    of the English police system, and who choose to be candid, that it requires
    more intellect infused into it. Many of the men are extraordinarily acute
    and are able to seize facts as they rise to the surface. But they are unable
    to work out what is below the surface. They work well enough in the light.
    When once they are in the dark, they walk with their hands open, and stretched
    out before them.</p>
  <p align="left">Had foreign lodging-houses, where frequent numbers of foreigners
    assemble, been inquired about, had some few perfectly constitutional searches
    been made, they might have led to the discovery of a fresh blood-stained
    floor&mdash;it being evident that if a spy were fallen upon from behind and
    stabbed, his blood must have reached the ground and written its tale there.</p>
  <p align="left">These blood-stains must still exist if the house in which the
    murder took place has not been burnt down, but I doubt if ever the police
    will make an examination of them at this or any other distance of time, owing
    to the distant date of the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">Experience shows that the chances of discovery of a crime are
    in exact inverse proportion to the time which has elapsed since the murder.
    Roughly it may be stated that if no clew is obtained within a week from the
    discovery of a crime, the chances of hunting down the criminal daily become
    rapidly fewer and fainter.</p>
  <p align="left">Let it not be supposed that I am advocating any change in the
    detective system which would be unconstitutional. Far from it. I am quite
    sure any unconstitutional remodelment of that force would not be suffered
    for any length of time to exist&mdash;as it was proved by that recent parliamentary
    protest against an intolerable excess of duty on the part of the police to
    which I have already referred.</p>
  <p align="left">My argument is, that more intellect should be infused into
    the operation of the police system, that it is impossible routine can always
    be a match for all shapes of crime, and finally that means should be taken
    to avoid so much failure as could be openly recorded of the detective police
    authorities.</p>
  <p align="left">Take in point the case I have been mentioning.</p>
  <p align="left">What evidence have the public ever read or learnt to show that
    any other than ordinary measures were taken to clear up any extraordinary
    crime?</p>
  <p align="left">It is clear that while only ordinary measures are in force
    to detect extraordinary crime, a premium of impunity is offered to the latter
    description of ill-doing, and one which it is just possible is often pocketed.
    Be all that as it may, it is certain the Bridge mystery has never been cleared
    up.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheUnknownWeapon"></a>The Unknown Weapon</b></h2>
  <p align="left">I am about to set out here one of the most remarkable cases
    which have come under my actual observation.</p>
  <p align="left">I will give the particulars, as far as I can, in the form of
    a narrative.</p>
  <p align="left">The scene of the affair lay in a midland county, and on the
    outskirts of a very rustic and retired village, which has at no time come
    before the attention of the world.</p>
  <p align="left">Here are the exact preliminary facts of the case. Of course
    I alter names, for as this case is now to become public, and as the inquiries
    which took place at the time not only ended in disappointment, but by some
    inexplicable means did not arrest the public curiosity, there can be no wisdom
    in covering the names and places with such a thin veil of fiction as will
    allow of the truth being seen below that literary gauze. The names and places
    here used are wholly fictitious, and in no degree represent or shadow out
    the actual personages or localities.</p>
  <p align="left">The mansion at which the mystery which I am about to analyse
    took place was the manor-house. while its occupant, the squire of the district,
    was also the lord of the manor. I will call him Petleigh.</p>
  <p align="left">I may at once state here, though the fact did not come to my
    knowledge till after the catastrophe, that the squire was a thoroughly mean
    man, with but one other passion than the love of money, and that was a greed
    for plate.</p>
  <p align="left">Every man who has lived with his eyes open has come across
    human beings who concentrate within themselves the most wonderful contradictions.
    Here is a man who lives so scampishly that it is a question if ever he earnt
    an honest shilling, and yet he would firmly believe his moral character would
    be lost did he enter a theatre; there is an individual who never sent away
    a creditor or took more than a just commercial discount, while any day in
    the week he may be arrested upon a charge which would make him a scandal
    to his family.</p>
  <p align="left">So with Squire Petleigh. That he was extremely avaricious there
    can be no doubt, while his desire for the possession and display of plate
    was almost a mania.</p>
  <p align="left">His silver was quite a tradition in the county. At every meal&mdash;and
    I have heard the meals at Petleighcote were neither abundant nor succulent&mdash;enough
    plate stood upon the table to pay for the feeding of the poor of the whole
    county for a month. He would eat a mutton chop off silver.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Petleigh was in parliament, and in the season came up to
    town, where he had the smallest and most miserable house ever rented by a
    wealthy county member.</p>
  <p align="left">Avaricious, and therefore illiberal, Petleigh would not keep
    up two establishments; and so, when he came to town for the parliamentary
    season, he brought with him his country establishment, all the servants composing
    which were paid but third-class fares up to town.</p>
  <p align="left">The domestics I am quite sure, from what I learnt, were far
    from satisfactory people; a condition of things which was quite natural,
    seeing that they were not treated well, and were taken on at the lowest possible
    rate of wages.</p>
  <p align="left">The only servitor who remained permanently on the establishment
    was the housekeeper at the manor-house, Mrs. Quinion.</p>
  <p align="left">It was whispered in the neighbourhood that she had been the
    foster-sister (&ldquo;and perhaps more&rdquo;) of the late Mrs. Petleigh;
    and it was stated with sufficient openness, and I am afraid also with some
    general amount of chuckling satisfaction, that the squire had been bitten
    with his lady.</p>
  <p align="left">The truth stood that Petleigh had married the daughter of a
    Liverpool merchant in the great hope of an alliance with her fortune, which
    at the date of her marriage promised to be large. But cotton commerce, even
    twenty-five years ago, was a risky business, and to curtail here particulars
    which are only remotely essential to the absolute comprehension of this narrative,
    he never had a penny with her, and his wife&rsquo;s father, who had led a
    deplorably irregular life, started for America and died there.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Petleigh had but one child, Graham Petleigh, and she died
    when he was about twelve years of age.</p>
  <p align="left">During Mrs. Petleigh&rsquo;s life, the housekeeper at Petleighcote
    was the foster-sister to whom reference has been made. I myself believe that
    it would have been more truthful to call Mrs. Quinion the natural sister
    of the squire&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p align="left">Be that as it may, after the lady&rsquo;s death Mrs. Quinion,
    in a half-conceded, and after an uncomfortable fashion, became in a measure
    the actual mistress of Petleighcote.</p>
  <p align="left">Possibly the squire was aware of a relationship to his wife
    at which I have hinted, and was therefore not unready in recognising that
    it was better she should be in the house than any other woman. For, apart
    from his avariciousness and his mania for the display of plate, I found beyond
    all dispute that he was a man of very estimable judgment.</p>
  <p align="left">Again, Mrs. Quinion fell in with his avaricious humour. She
    shaved down his household expenses, and was herself contented with a very
    moderate remuneration.</p>
  <p align="left">From all I learnt, I came to the conclusion that Petleighcote
    had long been the most uncomfortable house in the county, the display of
    plate only tending to intensify the general barrenness.</p>
  <p align="left">Very few visitors came to the house, and hospitality was unknown;
    yet, notwithstanding these drawbacks, Petleigh stood very well in the county,
    and indeed, on the occasion of one or two charitable collections, he had
    appeared in print with sufficient success.</p>
  <p align="left">Those of my readers who live in the country will comprehend
    the style of the squire&rsquo;s household when I say that he grudged permission
    to shoot rabbits on his ground. Whenever possible, all the year round, specimens
    of that rather tiring food were to be found in Squire Petleigh&rsquo;s larder.
    In fact, I learnt that a young curate who remained a short time at Tram (the
    village), in gentle satire of this cheap system of rations, called Petleighcote
    the &ldquo;Warren.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The son, Graham Petleigh, was brought up in a deplorable style,
    the father being willing to persuade himself, perhaps, that as he had been
    disappointed in his hopes of a fortune with the mother, the son did not call
    for that consideration to which he would have been entitled had the mother
    brought her husband increased riches. It is certain that the boy roughed
    life. All the schooling he got was that which could be afforded by a foundation
    grammar school, which happened fortunately to exist at Tram.</p>
  <p align="left">To this establishment he went sometimes, while at others he
    was off with lads miserably below him in station, upon some expedition which
    was not perhaps, as a rule, so respectable an employment as studying the
    humanities.</p>
  <p align="left">Evidently the boy was shamefully ill-used; for he was neglected.</p>
  <p align="left">By the time he was nineteen or twenty (all these particulars
    I learnt readily after the catastrophe, for the townsfolk were only too eager
    to talk of the unfortunate young man)&mdash;by the time he was nineteen or
    twenty, a score of years of neglect bore their fruit. He was ready, beyond
    any question, for any mad performance. Poaching especially was his delight,
    perhaps in a great measure because he found it profitable; because, to state
    the truth, he was kept totally without money, and to this disadvantage he
    added a second, that of being unable to spread what money he did obtain over
    any expanse of time.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no doubt myself that the depredations on his father&rsquo;s
    estate might have with justice been put to his account, and, from the inquiries
    I made, I am equally free to believe that when any small article of the mass
    of plate about the premises was missing, that the son knew a good deal more
    than was satisfactory of the lost valuables.</p>
  <p align="left">That Mrs. Quinion, the housekeeper, was extremely devoted to
    the young man is certain; but the money she received as wages, and whatever
    private or other means she had, could not cover the demands made upon them
    by young Graham Petleigh, who certainly spent money, though where it came
    from was a matter of very great uncertainty.</p>
  <p align="left">From the portrait I saw of him, he must have been of a daring,
    roving, jovial disposition&mdash;a youngster not inclined to let duty come
    between him and his inclinations; one, in short, who would get more out of
    the world than he would give it.</p>
  <p align="left">The plate was carried up to town each year with the establishment,
    the boxes being under the special guardianship of the butler, who never let
    them out of his sight between the country and town houses. The man, I have
    heard, looked forward to those journeys with absolute fear.</p>
  <p align="left">From what I learnt, I suppose the convoy of plate boxes numbered
    well on towards a score.</p>
  <p align="left">Graham Petleigh sometimes accompanied his father to town, and
    at other times was sent to a relative in Cornwall. I believe it suited father
    and son better that the latter should be packed off to Cornwall in the parliamentary
    season, for in town the lad necessarily became comparatively expensive&mdash;an
    objection in the eyes of the father, while the son found himself in a world
    to which, thanks to the education he had received, he was totally unfitted.</p>
  <p align="left">Young Petleigh&rsquo;s passion was horses, and there was not
    a farmer on the father&rsquo;s estate, or in the neighbourhood of Tram, who
    was not plagued for the loan of this or that horse&mdash;for the young man
    had none of his own.</p>
  <p align="left">On my part, I believe if the youth had no selfrespect, the
    want was in a great measure owing to the father having had not any for his
    son.</p>
  <p align="left">I know I need scarcely add, that when a man is passionately
    fond of horses generally he bets on those quadrupeds.</p>
  <p align="left">It did not call for many inquiries to ascertain that young
    Petleigh had &ldquo;put&rdquo; a good deal of money upon horses, and that,
    as a rule, he had been lucky with them. The young man wanted some excitement,
    some occupation, and he found it in betting. Have I said that after the young
    heir was taken from the school he was allowed to run loose? This was the
    case. I presume the father could not bring his mind to incurring the expense
    of entering his son at some profession.</p>
  <p align="left">Things then at Petleighcote were in this condition; the father
    neglectful and avaricious; the son careless, neglected, and daily slipping
    down the ladder of life; and the housekeeper, Mrs. Quinion, saying nothing,
    doing nothing, but existing, and perhaps showing that she was attached to
    her foster-sister&rsquo;s son. She was a woman of much sound and discriminating
    sense, and it is certain that she expressed herself to the effect that she
    foresaw the young man was being silently, steadfastly, unceasingly ruined.</p>
  <p align="left">All these preliminaries comprehended, I may proceed to the
    action of this narrative.</p>
  <p align="left">It was the 19th of May (the year is unimportant), and early
    in the morning when the discovery was made, by the gardener to Squire Petleigh&mdash;one
    Tom Brown.</p>
  <p align="left">Outside the great hall-door, and huddled together in an extraordinary
    fashion, the gardener, at half-past five in the morning (a Tuesday), found
    lying a human form. And when he came to make an examination, he discovered
    that it was the dead body of the young squire.</p>
  <p align="left">Seizing the handle of the great bell, he quickly sounded an
    alarm, and within a minute the housekeeper herself and the one servant, who
    together numbered the household which slept at Petleighcote when the squire
    was in town, stood on the threshold of the open door.</p>
  <p align="left">The housekeeper was half-dressed, the servant wench was huddled
    up in a petticoat and a blanket.</p>
  <p align="left">The news spread very rapidly, by means of the gardener&rsquo;s
    boy, who, wondering where his master was stopping, came loafing about the
    house, quickly to find the use of his legs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He must have had a fit,&rdquo; said the housekeeper;
    and it was a flying message to that effect carried by the boy into the village,
    which brought the village doctor to the spot in the quickest possible time.</p>
  <p align="left">It was then found that the catastrophe was due to no <i>fit</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">A very slight examination showed that the young squire had
    died from a stab caused by a rough iron barb, the metal shaft of which was
    six inches long, and which still remained in the body.</p>
  <p align="left">At the inquest, the medical man deposed that very great force
    must have been used in thrusting the barb into the body, for one of the ribs
    had been half severed by the act. The stab given, the barb had evidently
    been drawn back with the view of extracting it&mdash;a purpose which had
    failed, the flanges of the barb having fixed themselves firmly in the cartilage
    and tissue about it. It was impossible the deceased could have turned the
    barb against himself in the manner in which it had been used.</p>
  <p align="left">Asked what this barb appeared like, the surgeon was unable
    to reply. He had never seen such a weapon before. He supposed it had been
    fixed in a shaft of wood, from which it had been wrenched by the strength
    with which the barb, after the thrust, had been held by the parts surrounding
    the wound.</p>
  <p align="left">The barb was handed round to the jury, and every man cordially
    agreed with his neighbour that he had never seen anything of the kind before;
    it was equally strange to all of them.</p>
  <p align="left">The squire, who took the catastrophe with great coolness, gave
    evidence to the effect that he had seen his son on the morning previous to
    the discovery of the murder, and about noon&mdash;seventeen and a half hours
    before the catastrophe was discovered. He did not know his son was about
    to leave town, where he had been staying. He added that he had not missed
    the young man; his son was in the habit of being his own master, and going
    where he liked. He could offer no explanation as to why his son had returned
    to the country, or why the materials found upon him were there. He could
    offer no explanation in any way about anything connected with the matter.</p>
  <p align="left">It was said, as a scandal in Tram, that the squire exhibited
    no emotion upon giving his evidence, and that when he sat down after his
    examination he appeared relieved.</p>
  <p align="left">Furthermore, it was intimated that upon being called upon to
    submit to a kind of cross-examination, he appeared to be anxious, and answered
    the few questions guardedly.</p>
  <p align="left">These questions were put by one of the jurymen&mdash;a solicitor&rsquo;s
    clerk (of some acuteness it was evident), who was the Tram oracle.</p>
  <p align="left">It is perhaps necessary for the right understanding of this
    case, that these questions should be here reported, and their answers also.</p>
  <p align="left">They ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think your son died where he was found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have formed no opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think he had been in your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why are you so certain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because had he entered the house, my housekeeper would
    have known of his coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is your housekeeper here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has it been intended that she should be called as a
    witness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think your son attempted to break into your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[The reason for this question I will make apparent shortly.
    By the way, I should, perhaps, here at once explain that I obtained all these
    particulars of the evidence from the county paper.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think your son attempted to break into your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is not my question. Do you think he attempted to
    break into your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You swear that, Mr. Petleigh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[By the way, there was no love lost between the squire and
    the Tram oracle, for the simple reason that not any existed that could be
    spilt.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do swear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think there was anybody in the house he wished
    to visit clandestinely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who were in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Quinion, my housekeeper, and one servant woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is the servant here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What kind of a woman is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really Mr. Mortoun you can see her and judge for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So we can. I am only going to ask one question more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I reserve to myself the decision whether I shall or
    shall not answer it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think you will answer it, Mr. Petleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It remains, sir, to be seen. Put your question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is very simple&mdash;do you intend to offer a reward
    for the discovery of the murderer of your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The squire made no reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have heard my question, Mr. Petleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what is your answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The squire paused for some moments. I should state that I am
    adding the particulars of the inquest I picked up, or detected if you like
    better, to the information afforded by the county paper to which I have already
    referred.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I refuse to reply,&rdquo; said the squire.</p>
  <p align="left">Mortoun thereupon applied to the coroner for his ruling.</p>
  <p align="left">Now it appears evident to me that this juryman had some hidden
    motive in thus questioning the squire. If this were so, I am free to confess
    I never discovered it beyond any question of doubt. I may or I may not have
    hit on his motive. I believe I did.</p>
  <p align="left">It is clear that the question Mr. Mortoun urged was badly put,
    for how could the father decide whether he would offer a reward for the discovery
    of a murderer who did not legally exist till after the finding of the jury?
    And indeed it may furthermore be added that this question had no bearing
    upon the elucidation of the mystery, or at all events it had no apparent
    bearing upon the facts of the catastrophe.</p>
  <p align="left">It is evident that Mr. Mortoun was actuated in all probability
    by one of two motives, both of which were obscure. One might have been an
    attempt really to obtain a clue to the murder, the other might have been
    the endeavour to bring the squire, with whom it has been said he lived bad
    friends, into disrespect with the county.</p>
  <p align="left">The oracle-juryman immediately applied to the coroner, who
    at once admitted that the question was not pertinent, but nevertheless urged
    the squire as the question had been put to answer it.</p>
  <p align="left">It is evident that the coroner saw the awkward position in
    which the squire was placed, and spoke as he did in order to enable the squire
    to come out of the difficulty in the least objectionable manner.</p>
  <p align="left">But as I have said, Mr. Petleigh, all his incongruities and
    faults apart, was a clear-seeing man of a good and clear mind. As I saw the
    want of consistency in the question, as I read it, so he must have remarked
    the same failure when it was addressed to him.</p>
  <p align="left">For after patiently hearing the coroner to the end of his remarks,
    Petleigh said, quietly,&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How can I say I will offer a reward for the discovery
    of certain murderers when the jury have not yet returned a verdict of murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But supposing the jury do return such a verdict?&rdquo; asked
    Mortoun.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why then it will be time for you to ask your question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I learnt that the juryman smiled as he bowed and said he was
    satisfied.</p>
  <p align="left">It appears to me that at that point Mr. Mortoun must have either
    gained that information which fitted in with his theory, or, accepting the
    lower motive for his question, that he felt he had now sufficiently damaged
    the squire in the opinion of the county. For the reporters were at work,
    and every soul present knew that not a word said would escape publication
    in the county paper.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Mortoun however was to be worsted within the space of a
    minute.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you ceased questioning me, gentlemen?&rdquo;  asked
    the squire.</p>
  <p align="left">The coroner bowed, it appeared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued the squire, &ldquo;before I sit
    down&mdash;and you will allow me to remain in the room until the inquiry
    is terminated&mdash;I will state that of my own free will which I would not
    submit to make public upon an illegal and a totally uncalled-for attempt
    at compulsion. Should the jury bring in a verdict of murder against unknown
    persons, I shall <i>not</i> offer a reward for the discovery of those alleged murderers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the coroner, who I learnt afterwards
    admitted that the question was utterly unpardonable.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Squire Petleigh, &ldquo;it is quite
    my opinion that no <i>murder</i> has been committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">According to the newspaper report these words were followed
    by &ldquo;sensation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No murder?&rdquo; said the coroner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; the death of the deceased was, I am sure, an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What makes you think that, Mr. Petleigh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The nature of the death. Murders are not committed,
    I should think, in any such extraordinary manner as that by which my son
    came to his end. I have no more to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says the report, &ldquo;the squire took
    his seat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The next witness called&mdash;the gardener who had discovered
    the body had already been heard, and simply testified to the finding of the
    body&mdash;was Margaret Quinion, the housekeeper.</p>
  <p align="left">Her depositions were totally valueless from my point of view,
    that of the death of the young squire. She stated simply that she had gone
    to bed at the usual time (about ten) on the previous night, and that Dinah
    Yarton retired just previously, and to the same room. She heard no noise
    during the night, was disturbed in no way whatever until the alarm was given
    by the gardener.</p>
  <p align="left">In her turn Mrs. Quinion was now questioned by the solicitor&rsquo;s
    clerk, Mr. Mortoun.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you and this&mdash;what is her name?&mdash;Dinah
    Yarton; do you and she sleep alone at Petleighcote?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;when the family is away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you not afraid to do so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why should I be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;most women are afraid to sleep in large lonely
    houses by themselves. Are you not afraid of burglars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Simply because burglars would find so little at Petleighcote
    to steal that they would be very foolish to break into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But there is a good deal of plate in the house&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It all goes up to town with Mr. Petleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Every ounce&mdash;as a rule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say the girl sleeps in your room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is she an attractive girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is she unattractive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will have an opportunity of judging, for she will
    be called as a witness, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh; you don&rsquo;t think, do you, that there was anything
    between this young person and your young master?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Between Dinah and young Mr. Petleigh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think there could hardly be any affair between them,
    for [here she smiled] they have never seen each other&mdash;the girl having
    come to Petleighcote from the next county only three weeks since, and three
    months after the family had gone to town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh; pray have you not expected your master&rsquo;s son
    home recently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have not expected young Mr. Petleigh home recently&mdash;he
    never comes home when the family is away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he not in the habit of coming to Petleighcote unexpectedly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know that for a fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know that for a fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was the deceased kept without money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know nothing of the money arrangements between the
    father and son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;do you know that often he wanted money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really&mdash;I decline to answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;did he borrow money habitually from you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I decline also to answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say you heard nothing in the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did you do when you were alarmed by the gardener
    in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am at a loss to understand your question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is very plain, nevertheless. What was your first
    act after hearing the catastrophe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[After some consideration.] &ldquo;It is really almost impossible,
    I should say, upon such terrible occasions as was that, to be able distinctly
    to say what is one&rsquo;s first act or words, but I believe the first thing
    I did, or the first I remember, was to look after Dinah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And why could she not look after herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Simply because she had fallen into a sort of epileptic
    fit&mdash;to which she is subject&mdash;upon seeing the body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you can throw no light upon this mysterious affair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No light: all I know of it was the recognition of the
    body of Mr. Petleigh, junior, in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The girl Dinah Yarton was now called, but no sooner did the
    unfortunate young woman, waiting in the hall of the publichouse at which
    the inquest was held, hear her name, than she swooped into a fit which totally
    precluded her from giving any evidence &ldquo;except,&rdquo; as the county
    paper facetiously remarked, &ldquo;the proof by her screams that her lungs
    were in a very enviable condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She will soon recover,&rdquo; said Mrs. Quinion, &ldquo;and
    will be able to give what evidence she can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what will that be, Mrs. Quinion?&rdquo; asked the
    solicitor&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am not able to say, Mr. Mortoun,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p align="left">The next witness called (and here as an old police-constable
    I may remark upon the unbusiness-like way in which the witnesses were arranged)&mdash;the
    next witness called was the doctor.</p>
  <p align="left">His evidence was as follows, omitting the purely professional
    points. &ldquo;I was called to the deceased on Tuesday morning, at near upon
    six in the morning. I recognized the body as that of Mr. Petleigh junior.
    Life was quite extinct. He had been dead about seven or eight hours, as well
    as I could judge. That would bring his death about ten or eleven on the previous
    night. Death had been caused by a stab, which had penetrated the left lung.
    The deceased had bled inwardly. The instrument which had caused death had
    remained in the wound, and stopped what little effusion of blood there would
    otherwise have been. Deceased literally died from suffocation, the blood
    leaking into the lungs and filling them. All the other organs of the body
    were in a healthy condition. The instrument by which death was produced is
    one with which I have no acquaintance. It is a kind of iron arrow, very roughly
    made, and with a shaft. It must have been fixed in some kind of handle when
    it was used, and which must have yielded and loosed the barb when an attempt
    was made to withdraw it&mdash;an attempt which had been made, because I found
    that one of the flanges of the arrow had caught behind a rib. I repeat that
    I am totally unacquainted with the instrument with which death was effected.
    It is remarkably coarse and rough. The deceased might have lived a quarter
    of a minute after the wound had been inflicted. He would not in all probability
    have called out. There is no evidence of the least struggle having taken
    place&mdash;not a particle of evidence can I find to show that the deceased
    had exhibited even any knowledge of danger. And yet, nevertheless, supposing
    the deceased not to have been asleep at the time of the murder, for murder
    it undoubtedly was, or manslaughter, he must have seen his assailant, who,
    from the position of the weapon, must have been more before than behind him.
    Assuredly the death was the result of either murder or accident, and not
    the result of suicide, because I will stake my professional reputation that
    it would be quite impossible for any man to thrust such an instrument into
    his body with such a force as in this case has been used, as is proved by
    the cutting of a true bone-formed rib. Nor could a suicide, under such circumstances
    as those of the present catastrophe, have thrust the dart in the direction
    which this took. To sum up, it is my opinion that the deceased was murdered
    without, on his part, any knowledge of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Mortoun cross-examined the doctor:</p>
  <p align="left">To this gentleman&rsquo;s inquiries he answered willingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you think, Dr. Pitcherley, that no blood flowed externally?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of that I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There were no marks of blood on the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then the inference stands that no blood stained the
    place of the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then the body may have been brought an immense way,
    and no spots of blood would form a clue to the road?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it your impression that the murder was committed
    far away from the spot, or near the place where the body was found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This question is one which it is quite out of my power
    to answer, Mr. Mortoun, my duty here being to give evidence as to my being
    called to the deceased, and as to the cause of death. But I need not tell
    you that I have formed my own theory of the catastrophe, and if the jury
    desire to have it, I am ready to offer it for their consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here there was a consultation, from which it resulted that
    the jury expressed themselves very desirous of obtaining the doctor&rsquo;s
    impression.</p>
  <p align="left">[I have no doubt the following words led the jury to their
    decision.]</p>
  <p align="left">The medical gentleman said:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is my impression that this death resulted out of
    a poaching&mdash;I will not say affray&mdash;but accident. It is thoroughly
    well-known in these districts, and at such a juncture as the present I need
    feel no false delicacy, Mr. Petleigh, in making this statement, that young
    Petleigh was much given to poaching. I believe that he and his companions
    were out poaching&mdash;I myself on two separate occasions, being called
    out to nightcases, saw the young gentleman under very suspicious circumstances&mdash;and
    that one of the party was armed with the weapon which caused the death, and
    which may have been carried at the end of such a heavy stick as is frequently
    used for flinging at rabbits. I suppose that by some frightful accident&mdash;we
    all know how dreadful are the surgical accidents which frequently arise when
    weapons are in use&mdash;the young man was wounded mortally, and so died,
    after the frightened companion had hurriedly attempted to withdraw the arrow,
    only to leave the barb sticking in the body and hooked behind a rib, while
    the force used in the resistance of the bone caused the weapon to part company
    from the haft. The discovery of the body outside the father&rsquo;s house
    can then readily be accounted for. His companions knowing who he was, and
    dreading their identification with an act which could but result in their
    own condemnation of character, carried the body to the threshold of his father&rsquo;s
    house, and there left it. This,&rdquo; the doctor concluded, &ldquo;appears
    to me the most rational mode I can find of accounting for the circumstances
    of this remarkable and deplorable case. I apologize to Mr. Petleigh for the
    slur to which I may have committed myself in referring to the character of
    that gentleman&rsquo;s son, the deceased, but my excuse must rest in this
    fact, that where a crime or catastrophe is so obscure that the criminal,
    or guilty person, may be in one of many directions, it is but just to narrow
    the circle of inquiry as much as possible, in order to avoid the resting
    of suspicion upon the greater number of individuals. If, however, any one
    can suggest a more lucid explanation of the catastrophe than mine, I shall
    indeed be glad to admit I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[There can be little question, I repeat, that Dr. Pitcherley&rsquo;s
    analysis fitted in very satisfactorily and plausibly with the facts of the
    case.]</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Mortoun asked Dr. Pitcherley no more questions.</p>
  <p align="left">The next witness called was the police-constable of Tram, a
    stupid, hopeless dolt, as I found to my cost, who was good at a rustic public-house
    row, but who as a detective was not worth my dog Dart.</p>
  <p align="left">It appeared that he gave his flat evidence with a stupidity
    which called even for the rebuke of the coroner.</p>
  <p align="left">All he could say was, that he was called, and that he went,
    and that he saw whose body it &ldquo;be&rsquo;d.&rdquo; That was &ldquo;arl&rdquo; he
    could say.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Mortoun took him in hand, but even he could do nothing
    with the man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had many persons been on the spot where the body was
    found before he arrived?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoy, &rsquo;cos Toom Broown, the gard&rsquo;ner, coomed
    t&rsquo;him at wuncet, and &rsquo;cos Toom Broown coomed t&rsquo;him furst, &rsquo;cas
    he&rsquo;s cot wur furst coomed too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was so, as I found when I went down to Tram. The gardener,
    Brown, panic-stricken, after calling to, and obtaining the attention of the
    housekeeper, had rushed off to the village for that needless help which all
    panic-stricken people will seek, and the constable&rsquo;s cottage happening
    to be the first dwelling he reached the constable obtained the first alarm.
    Now, had the case been conducted properly, the constable being the first
    man to get the alarm, would have obtained such evidence as would at once
    have put the detectives on the right scent.</p>
  <p align="left">The first two questions put by the lawyerlike juryman showed
    that he saw how important the evidence might have been which this witness,
    Joseph Higgins by name, should have given had he but known his business.</p>
  <p align="left">The first question was&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It had rained, hadn&rsquo;t it, on the Monday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[That previous to the catastrophe.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ye-es t&rsquo;had rained,&rdquo; Higgins replied.</p>
  <p align="left">Then followed this important question:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were on the spot one of the very first. Did you
    notice if there were any footsteps about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It appears to me very clear that Mr. Mortoun was here following
    up the theory of the catastrophe offered by the doctor. It would be clear
    that if several poaching companions had carried the young squire, after death,
    to the hall-door, that, as rain had fallen during the night, there would
    inevitably be many boot-marks on the soft ground.</p>
  <p align="left">This question put, the witness asked, &ldquo;Wh-a-at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The question was repeated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;ah didn&rsquo;t see noa
    foot ma-arks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you look for any?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa; ah didn&rsquo;t look for any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know your business,&rdquo; said
    Mr. Mortoun.</p>
  <p align="left">And the juryman was right; for I may tell the reader that boot-marks
    have sent more men to the gallows, as parts of circumstantial evidence, than
    any other proof whatever; indeed, the evidence of the boot-mark is terrible.
    A nail fallen out, or two or three put very close together, a broken nail,
    or all the nails perfect, have, times out of number, identified the boot
    of the suspected man with the boot-mark near the murdered, and has been the
    first link of the chain of evidence which has dragged a murderer to the gallows,
    or a minor felon to the hulks.</p>
  <p align="left">Indeed, if I were advising evildoers on the best means of avoiding
    detection, I would say by all means take a second pair of boots in your pocket,
    and when you near the scene of your work change those you have on for those
    you have in your pocket, and do your wickedness in these latter; flee from
    the scene in these latter, and when you have &ldquo;made&rdquo; some distance,
    why return to your other boots, and carefully hide the tell-tale pair. Then
    the boots you wear will rather be a proof of your innocence than presumable
    evidence of your guilt.</p>
  <p align="left">Nor let any one be shocked at this public advice to rascals;
    for I flatter myself I have a counter-mode of foiling such a felonious arrangement
    as this one of two pairs of boots. And as I have disseminated the mode amongst
    the police, any attempt to put the suggestions I have offered actually into
    action, would be attended with greater chances of detection than would be
    incurred by running the ordinary risk.</p>
  <p align="left">To return to the subject in hand.</p>
  <p align="left">The constable of Tram, the only human being in the town, Mortoun
    apart perhaps, who should have known, in the ordinary course of his duty,
    the value of every footmark near the dead body, had totally neglected a precaution
    which, had he observed it, must have led to a discovery (and an immediate
    one), which in consequence of his dullness was never publicly made.</p>
  <p align="left">Nothing could be more certain than this, that what is called
    foot-mark evidence was totally wanting.</p>
  <p align="left">The constable taking no observations, not the cutest detective
    in existence could have obtained any evidence of this character, for the
    news of the catastrophe spreading, as news only spreads in villages, the
    rustics tramped up in scores, and so obliterated what footmarks might have
    existed.</p>
  <p align="left">To be brief, Mr. Josh. Higgins could give no evidence worth
    hearing.</p>
  <p align="left">And now the only depositions which remained to be given were
    those of Dinah Yarton.</p>
  <p align="left">She came into court &ldquo;much reduced,&rdquo; said the paper
    from which I gain these particulars, &ldquo;from the effects of the succession
    of fits which she had fallen into and struggled out of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She was so stupid that every question had to be repeated in
    half-a-dozen shapes before she could offer a single reply. It took four inquiries
    to get at her name, three to know where she lived, five to know what she
    was; while the coroner and the jury, after a score of questions, gave over
    trying to ascertain whether she knew the nature of an oath. However, as she
    stated that she was quite sure she would go to a &ldquo;bad place&rdquo; if
    she did not speak the truth, she was declared to be a perfectly competent
    witness, and I have no doubt she was badgered accordingly.</p>
  <p align="left">And as Mr. Mortoun got more particulars out of her than all
    the rest of the questioners put together, perhaps it will not be amiss, as
    upon her evidence turned the whole of my actions so far as I was concerned,
    to give that gentleman&rsquo;s questions and her answers in full, precisely
    as they were quoted in the greedy county paper, which doubtless looked upon
    the whole case as a publishing godsend, the proprietors heartily wishing
    that the inquest might be adjourned a score of times for further evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well now, Dinah,&rdquo; said Mr. Mortoun, &ldquo;what
    time did you go to bed on Monday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[The answers were generally got after much hammering in on
    the part of the inquirist. I will simply return them at once as ultimately
    given.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you go to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa&mdash;Ise didunt goa to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Caize Ise couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ise wur thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Arl manner o&rsquo; thing&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell us one of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[No answer&mdash;except symptoms of another <i>fit</i>.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tut&mdash;tut! Well, did you go to sleep at last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ise did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, when did you wake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ise woke when missus ca&rsquo;d I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doant know clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it daylight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es, it wur day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you wake during the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es, wuncet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doant knaw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you think you heard anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoy, it movin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What was moving?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoy, the box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Box&mdash;tut, tut,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;answer
    me properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now here he raised his voice, and I have no doubt Dinah had
    to thank the jury man for the return of her fits.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you hear?&mdash;Answer me properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When you woke up did you hear any noise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you thought you heard a noise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es, in the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tut, tut. Never mind the box&mdash;where was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ter box? In t&rsquo; hall!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No&mdash;no, the noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In t&rsquo; hall, zur!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&mdash;the noise was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa, zur, ter box.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There, my good girl,&rdquo; says the Tram oracle,  &ldquo;never
    mind the box, I want you to think of this&mdash;did you hear any noise <i>outside
    the house?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you said you heard a noise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, zur, I didunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, but you said you thought you heard a noise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In ter box&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here, said the county paper, the lawyer, striking his hand
    on the table before him, continued&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Speak of the box once more, my girl, and to prison you
    go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Prizun!&rdquo; says the luckless witness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, jail and bread and water!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And thereupon the unhappy witness without any further remarks
    plunged into a fit, and had to be carried out, battling with that strength
    which convulsions appear to bring with them, and in the arms of three men,
    who had quite their work to do to keep her moderately quiet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the coroner,  &ldquo;that
    this witness is material. In the first place, it seems doubtful to me whether
    she is capable of giving evidence; and, in the second, I believe she has
    little evidence to give&mdash;so little that I doubt the policy of adjourning
    the inquest till her recovery. It appears to me that it would be cruelty
    to force this poor young woman again into the position she has just endured,
    unless you are satisfied that she is a material witness. I think she has
    said enough to show that she is not. It appears certain, from her own statement,
    that she retired to rest with Mrs. Quinion, and knows nothing more of what
    occurred till the housekeeper awoke her in the morning, after she herself
    had received the alarm. I suggest, therefore, that what evidence she could
    give is included in that already before the jury, and given by the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The jury coincided in the remarks made by the coroner, Mr.
    Mortoun, however, adding that he was at a loss to comprehend the girl&rsquo;s
    frequent reference to the box. Perhaps Mrs. Quinion could help to elucidate
    the mystery.</p>
  <p align="left">The housekeeper immediately rose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Quinion,&rdquo; said Mr. Mortoun, &ldquo;can you
    give any explanation as to what the young person meant by referring to a
    box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are of course boxes at Petleighcote?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Beyond all question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Any box in particular?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No box in particular.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No box which is spoken of as <i>the</i> box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The girl said it was in the hall. Is there a box in
    the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, several.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is a clog and boot box, a box on the table in
    which letters for the post are placed when the family is at home, and from
    which they are removed every day at four; and also a box fixed to the wall,
    the use of which I have never been able to discover, and of the removal of
    which I have several times spoken to Mr. Petleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How large is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About a foot-and-a-half square and three feet deep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Locked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, the flap is always open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has the young woman ever betrayed any fear of this box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have no idea to what box in the hall she referred
    in her evidence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the least idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you consider the young woman weak in her head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is decidedly not of strong intellect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you suppose this box idea a mere fancy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And a recent one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I never heard her refer to a box before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The paper whence I take my evidence describes Mrs. Quinion
    as a woman of very great self-possession, who gave what she had to say with
    perfect calmness and slowness of speech.</p>
  <p align="left">This being all the evidence, the coroner was about to sum up,
    when the Constable Higgins remembered that he had forgotten something, and
    came forward in a great hurry to repair his error.</p>
  <p align="left">He had not produced the articles found on the deceased.</p>
  <p align="left">These articles were a key and a <i>black crape mask</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">The squire being recalled, and the key shown to him, he identified
    the key as (he believed) one of his &ldquo;household keys.&rdquo; It was
    of no particular value, and it did not matter if it remained in the hands
    of the police.</p>
  <p align="left">The report continued: &ldquo;The key is now in the custody
    of the constable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With regard to the crape mask the squire could offer no explanation
    concerning it.</p>
  <p align="left">The coroner then proceeded to sum up, and in doing so he paid
    many well-termed compliments to the doctor for that gentleman&rsquo;s view
    of the matter (which I have no doubt threw off all interest in the matter
    on the part of the public, and slackened the watchfulness of the detective
    force, many of whom, though very clever, are equally simple, and accept a
    plain and straight-forward statement with extreme willingness)&mdash;and
    urged that the discovery of the black crape mask appeared to be very much
    like corroborative proof of the doctor&rsquo;s suggestion. &ldquo;The young
    man,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;would, if poaching, be exceedingly desirous
    of hiding his face, considering his position in the county, and then the
    finding of this black crape mask upon the body would, if the poaching explanation
    were accepted, be a very natural discovery. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And then the coroner proceeded to explain to the jury that
    they had to decide not upon suppositions but facts. They might all be convinced
    that Dr. Pitcherley&rsquo;s explanation was the true one, but in law it could
    not be accepted. Their verdict must be in accordance with facts, and the
    simple facts of the case were these:&mdash;A man was found dead, and the
    causes of his death were such that it was impossible to believe that the
    deceased had been guilty of suicide. They would therefore under the circumstances
    feel it was their duty to return an open verdict of murder.</p>
  <p align="left">The jury did not retire, but at the expiration of a consultation
    of three minutes, in which (I learnt) the foreman, Mr. Mortoun, had all the
    talking to himself, the jury gave in a verdict of wilful murder against some
    person or persons unknown.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus ended the inquest.</p>
  <p align="left">And I have little hesitation in saying it was one of the weakest
    inquiries of that kind which had ever taken place. It was characterized by
    no order, no comprehension, no common sense.</p>
  <p align="left">The facts of the case made some little stir, but the plausible
    explanations offered by the doctor, and the several coinciding circumstances,
    deprived the affair of much of its interest, both to the public and the detective
    force; to the former, because they had little room for ordinary conjecture;
    to the latter, because I need not say the general, the chief motive power
    in the detective is gain, and here the probabilities of profit were almost
    annihilated by the possibility that a true explanation of the facts of this
    affair had been offered, while it was such as promised little hope of substantial
    reward.</p>
  <p align="left">But the mere fact of my here writing this narrative will be
    sufficient to show that <i>I</i> did not coincide with the general view taken of
    the business.</p>
  <p align="left">That I was right the following pages will I think prove.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course the Government offered the usual reward, &pound;100,
    of which proclamation is published in all cases of death where presumably
    foul play has taken place.</p>
  <p align="left">But it was not the ordinary reward which tempted me to choose
    this case for investigation. It was several peculiar circumstances which
    attracted me.</p>
  <p align="left">They were as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">1. Why did the father refuse to offer a reward?</p>
  <p align="left">2. Why did the deceased have one of the household keys with
    him at the time of his death, and how came he to have it at all?</p>
  <p align="left">3. What did the box mean?</p>
  <p align="left">1. It seemed to me that the refusal by the father to offer
    a reward must arise from one of three sources. Either he did not believe
    a murder had been committed, and therefore felt the offer was needless; or
    he knew murder was committed, and did not wish to accelerate the action of
    the police; or, thirdly, whether he believed or disbelieved in the murder,
    knew or did not know it to be a murder, that he was too sordid to offer a
    reward by the payment of which he would lose without gaining any corresponding
    benefit.</p>
  <p align="left">2. How came the deceased to have one of the keys of his father&rsquo;s
    establishment in his pocket? Such a possession was extremely unusual, and
    more inexplicable. How came he to possess it? Why did he possess it? What
    was he going to do with it?</p>
  <p align="left">3. What did the box mean? Did the unhappy girl Dinah Yarton
    refer to any ordinary or extraordinary box? It appeared to me that if she
    referred to any ordinary box it must be an ordinary box under extraordinary
    circumstances. But fools have very rarely any imagination, and knowing this
    I was not disposed to accredit Dinah with any ability to invest the box ordinary
    with any extraordinary attributes. And then remembering that there was nobody
    in the house to play tricks with her but a grave housekeeper who would not
    be given to that kind of thing, I came to the conclusion that the box in
    question was an extraordinary box. &ldquo;<i>It was in the hall</i>.&rdquo; Now
    if the box were no familiar box, and it was in the hall, the inference stood
    that it had just arrived there. Did I at this time associate the box intimately
    with the case? I think not.</p>
  <p align="left">At all events I determined to go down to Tram and investigate
    the case, and as with us detectives action is as nearly simultaneous with
    determination to act as it can be, I need not say that, making up my mind
    to visit Tram, I was soon nearing that station by the first train which started
    after I had so determined.</p>
  <p align="left">Going down I arranged mentally the process with which I was
    to go through.</p>
  <p align="left">Firstly, I must see the constable.</p>
  <p align="left">Secondly, I must talk to the girl Dinah.</p>
  <p align="left">Thirdly, I must examine the place of the murder.</p>
  <p align="left">All this would be easy work.</p>
  <p align="left">But what followed would be more difficult.</p>
  <p align="left">This was to apply what I should discover to any persons whom
    my discoveries might implicate, and see what I could make of it all.</p>
  <p align="left">Arrived at Tram at once I found out the constable, and I am
    constrained to say&mdash;a greater fool I never indeed did meet.</p>
  <p align="left">He was too stupid to be anything else than utterly, though
    idiotically, honest.</p>
  <p align="left">Under my corkscrew-like qualities as a detective he had no
    more chance than a tender young cork with a corkscrew proper. I believe that
    to the end of the chapter he never comprehended that I was a detective. His
    mind could not grasp the idea of a police officer in petticoats.</p>
  <p align="left">I questioned him as the shortest way of managing him, smoothing
    his suspicions and his English with shillings of the coin of this realm.</p>
  <p align="left">Directly I came face to face with him I knew what I had to
    do. I had simply to question him. And here I set out my questions and his
    answers as closely as I can recollect them, together with a narrative of
    the actions which resulted out of both.</p>
  <p align="left">I told him at once I was curious to know all I could about
    the affair; and as I illustrated this statement with the exhibition of the
    first shilling, in a moment I had the opportunity of seeing every tooth he
    had in his head&mdash;thirty-two. Not one was missing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There was found on the body a key and a mask&mdash;where
    are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;War be they&mdash;why, in my box, sin&rsquo; I be coonstubble!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you show them me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, Ise show they ye!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And thereupon he went to a box in the corner of the room, and
    unlocked it solemnly.</p>
  <p align="left">As the constable of Tram it was perfectly natural that he should
    keep possession of these objects, since a verdict of wilful murder had been
    given, and at any time, therefore, inquiries might have to be made.</p>
  <p align="left">From this box he took out a bundle; this opened, a suit of
    clothes came to view, and from the middle of these he produced a key and
    a mask.</p>
  <p align="left">I examined the key first. It was a well-made&mdash;a beautifully-made
    key, and very complicated. We constables learn in the course of our experience
    a good deal about keys, and therefore I saw at a glance that it was the key
    to a complicated and more than ordinarily valuable lock.</p>
  <p align="left">On the highly-polished loop of the key a carefully cut number
    was engraved&mdash;No. 13.</p>
  <p align="left">Beyond all question this key was no ordinary key to an ordinary
    lock.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, extraordinary locks and keys guard extraordinary treasures.</p>
  <p align="left">The first inference I arrived at, therefore, from my interview
    with the Tram constable was this&mdash;that the key found upon the body opened
    a lock put upon something valuable.</p>
  <p align="left">Then I examined the mask.</p>
  <p align="left">It was of black crape, stretched upon silver wire. I had never
    seen anything like it before, although as a detective I had been much mixed
    up with people who wore masks, both at masquerades and on other occasions
    even less satisfactory.</p>
  <p align="left">I therefore inferred that the mask was of foreign manufacture.</p>
  <p align="left">[I learnt ultimately that I was right, and no great credit
    to me either, for that which is not white may fairly be guessed to be of
    some other colour. The mask was what is called abroad a <i>masque de luxe</i>, a
    mask which, while it changes the countenance sufficiently to prevent recognition,
    is made so delicately that the material, crape, admits of free perspiration&mdash;a
    condition which inferior masks will not admit.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Anything else found on the body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No skeleton keys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa; on&rsquo;y wan key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So, if the constable were right, and <i>if the body had remained
    as it fell</i>, when found by the gardener, Brown, the only materials found were
    a key and mask.</p>
  <p align="left">But, surely, there was something else in the pockets.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was there no purse found?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa; noa poorse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ooh, &rsquo;ees; thar war a kerchiefer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He went immediately to the bundle.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are these the clothes in which he was found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ees, they be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So far, so good, I felt.</p>
  <p align="left">The constable, stupid and honest as he appeared, and as he
    existed, was very suspicious, and therefore I felt that he had to be managed
    most carefully.</p>
  <p align="left">Having hooked the handkerchief out from some recess in the
    bundle with the flattest forefinger I think I ever remarked, he handed it
    to me.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a woman&rsquo;s handkerchief.</p>
  <p align="left">It was new; had apparently never been used; there was no crease
    nor dirt upon it, as there would have been had it been carried long in the
    pocket; and it was marked in the corner  &ldquo;Freddy&rdquo;&mdash;undoubtedly
    the diminution for Frederica.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was the &lsquo;kerchiefer,&rsquo;&rdquo; I asked, using
    the word the constable had used&mdash;&ldquo;was it wrapped in anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What pocket was it in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa poockut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was it, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In&rsquo;s weskit, agin&rsquo;s hart, an&rsquo; joost
    aboove th&rsquo;  ole made in &rsquo;um.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now, what was the inference of the handkerchief.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a woman&rsquo;s; it was not soiled; it had not been
    worn long; it was thrust in his breast; it was marked.</p>
  <p align="left">The inference stood thus:</p>
  <p align="left">This handkerchief belonged to a woman, in all probability young,
    whose Christian name was Frederica; as it was not soiled, and as it was not
    blackened by wear, it had recently been given to, or taken, by him; and as
    the handkerchief was found in the breast of his shirt, it appeared to have
    been looked upon with favour. Suppose then we say that it was a gift by a
    young woman to the deceased about the time when he was setting out on his
    expedition?</p>
  <p align="left">Now, the deceased had left London within eighteen hours of
    his death; had the handkerchief been given him in London or after he left
    town?</p>
  <p align="left">Again, had the mask anything to do with this woman?</p>
  <p align="left">Taking it up again and re-examining it, the delicacy of the
    fabric struck me more than before, and raising it close to my eyes to make
    a still narrower examination I found that it was scented.</p>
  <p align="left">The inference stood, upon the whole, that this mask had belonged
    to a woman.</p>
  <p align="left">Again I began to question Joseph Higgins, constable.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should be glad to look at the clothes,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lard, thee may look,&rdquo; said the constable.</p>
  <p align="left">They were an ordinary suit of clothes, such as a middle-class
    man would wear of a morning, but not so good or fashionable as one might
    have expected to find in wear by the son of a wealthy squire.</p>
  <p align="left">[This apparent incongruity was soon explained away by my learning,
    as I did in the evening of my arrival, that the squire was mean and even
    parsimonious.]</p>
  <p align="left">There was nothing in the pockets, but my attention was called
    to the <i>fluffy</i> state of the cloth, which was a dark grey, and which therefore
    in a great measure hid this fluffiness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have not been taking care of these clothes, I am
    afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They be joost as they coomed arf him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, was all this fluff about the cloth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yoa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[Yoa was a new version of &ldquo;e-es,&rdquo; and both meant  &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They look as though they had been rolled about a bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The clothes in question were stained on their under side with
    gravel-marks, and they were still damp on these parts.</p>
  <p align="left">The remarking of this fact, recalled to my mind something which
    came out at the inquest, and which now I remembered and kept in mind while
    examining the state of the clothes.</p>
  <p align="left">On the Monday night, as the body was discovered on the Tuesday
    morning, it had rained.</p>
  <p align="left">Now the clothes were not damp all over, for the fluff was quite
    wavy, and flew about in the air. It was necessary to know what time it left
    off raining on the Monday night, or Tuesday morning.</p>
  <p align="left">It was very evident that the clothes had not been exposed to
    rain between the time of their obtaining the fluffiness and the discovery
    of the body. Therefore ascertain at what hour the rain ceased, and I had
    the space of time (the hour at which the body was discovered being half-past
    five) within which the body had been deposited.</p>
  <p align="left">The constable knew nothing about the rain, and I believe it
    was at this point, in spite of the shillings, that the officer began to show
    rustic signs of impatience.</p>
  <p align="left">I may add here that I found the rain had only ceased at three
    o&rsquo;clock on the Tuesday morning. It was therefore clear that the body
    had been deposited between three and half-past five&mdash;<i>two hours and
    a-half</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">This discovery I made that same evening of my landlady, a most
    useful person.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, does it not strike the reader that three o&rsquo;clock
    on a May morning, and when the morning had almost come, was an extraordinarily
    late hour at which to be poaching?</p>
  <p align="left">This indisputable fact, taken into consideration with the needlessness
    of the mask (for poachers do not wear masks), and the state of the clothes,
    to say nothing of the kind of clothes found on the deceased, led me to throw
    over Mr. Martoun&rsquo;s theory that the young squire had met his death in
    a poaching affray, or rather while out on a poaching expedition.</p>
  <p align="left">I took a little of the fluff from the clothes and carefully
    put it away in my pocket-book.</p>
  <p align="left">The last thing I examined was the barb which had caused the
    death.</p>
  <p align="left">And here I admit I was utterly foiled&mdash;completely, positively
    foiled. I had never seen anything of the kind before&mdash;never.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a very coarse iron barb, shaped something like a queen&rsquo;s
    broad arrow, only that the flanges widened from their point, so that each
    appeared in shape like the blade of a much-worn penknife. The shaft was irregular
    and perhaps even coarser than the rest of the work. The weapon was made of
    very poor iron, for I turned its point by driving it, not by any means heavily,
    against the frame of the window&mdash;to the intense disgust of the constable,
    whose exclamation, I remember thoroughly well, was &ldquo;Woa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now what did I gain by my visit to the constable? This series
    of suppositions:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">That the deceased was placed where he was found between three
    and half-past five a.m. on the Tuesday; that he was not killed from any result
    of a poaching expedition; and that he had visited a youngish woman named
    Frederica a few hours before death, and of whom he had received a handkerchief
    and possibly a mask.</p>
  <p align="left">The only troublesome point was the key, which, by the way,
    had been found in a small fob-pocket in the waist of the coat.</p>
  <p align="left">While taking my tea at the inn at which I had set down, I need
    not say I asked plenty of questions, and hearing a Mrs. Green frequently
    referred to, I surmised she was a busybody, and getting her address, as that
    of a pleasant body who let lodgings, I may at once add that that night I
    slept in the best room of the pleasant body&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p align="left">She was the most incorrigible talker ever I encountered. Nor
    was she devoid of sharpness; indeed, with more circumspection than she possessed,
    or let me say, with ordinary circumspection, she would have made a good ordinary
    police-officer, and had she possessed that qualification I might have done
    something for her. As it was the idea could not be entertained for any part
    of a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">She was wonderful, this Mrs. Green.</p>
  <p align="left">You only had to put a question on any point, and she abandoned
    the subject in which she had been indulging, and sped away on a totally new
    tack.</p>
  <p align="left">She was ravenous to talk of the murder; for it was her foregone
    conclusion that murder had been committed.</p>
  <p align="left">In a few words, all the information afforded to this point,
    which has not arisen out of my own seeking, or came by copy from the county
    newspaper (and much of that information which is to follow) all proceeded
    from the same gushing source&mdash;Mrs. Green.</p>
  <p align="left">All I had to do was to put another question when I thought
    we had exhausted the previous one, and away she went again at score, and
    so we continued from seven to eleven. It was half-past eight for nine before
    she cleared away the long-since cold and sloppy tea things.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what has become of Mrs. Quinion?&rdquo; I asked,
    in the course of this to me valuable entertainment on the part of Mrs. Green,
    throughout the whole of which she never asked me my business in these parts
    (though I felt quite sure so perfect a busybody was dying to know my affairs),
    because any inquiry would have called for a reply, and this was what she
    could not endure while I was willing to listen to her. Hence she chose the
    less of two evils.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what became of the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What gal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dinah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dinah Yarton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I believe that <i>was</i> her name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless &rsquo;ee! it&rsquo;s as good and as
    long as a blessed big book to tell &rsquo;ee all about Dinah Yarton. She
    left two days after, and they not having a bed for she at the Lamb and Flag,
    and I having a bed, her came here&mdash;the Lamb and Flag people always sending
    me their over beds, bless  &rsquo;em, bless &rsquo;ee! and that&rsquo;s how
    I comes to know arl about it, bless &rsquo;ee, and the big box!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[The box&mdash;now this was certainly what I did want Mrs.
    Green to come to. The reader will remember that I laid some stress upon the
    girl&rsquo;s frequent reference to the trunk.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bless &rsquo;ee! the big box caused arl the row, because
    Mrs. Quinion said she were a fool to have been frightened by a big box; but
    so Dinah would be, and so her did, being probable in the nex&rsquo; county
    at this time, at Little Pocklington, where her mother lives making lace,
    and her father a farmer, and where her was born&mdash;Dinah, and not her
    mother&mdash;on the 1st o&rsquo;April, 1835, being now twenty years old.
    What art thee doing? bless &rsquo;ee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[I was making a note of Little Pocklington.]</p>
  <p align="left">Nor will I here make any further verbatim notes of Mrs. Green&rsquo;s
    remarks, but use them as they are required in my own way, and as in actuality
    really I did turn them to account.</p>
  <p align="left">I determined to see the girl at once; that is, after I had
    had a night&rsquo;s rest. And therefore next morning, after carefully seeing
    my box and bag were locked, I made a quick breakfast, and sallied out. Reaching
    the station, there was Mrs. Green. She had obviously got the start of me
    by crossing Goose Green fields, as in fact she told me.</p>
  <p align="left">She said she thought I must have dropped that, and had come
    to see.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rdquo; was a purse so old that it was a curiosity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bless &rsquo;ee!&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t
    yourn? Odd, beant it? But, bless &rsquo;ee! ye&rsquo;ll have to wait an hour
    for a train. There beant a train to anywhere for arl an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take a walk,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shall I come, and tark pleasant to &rsquo;ee?&rdquo; asked
    Mrs. Green.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some business
    to transact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I had an hour to spare, and remembering that I had seen the
    things at Higgins&rsquo;s by a failing evening light, I thought I would again
    visit that worthy, and make a second inspection.</p>
  <p align="left">It was perhaps well I did so.</p>
  <p align="left">Not that I discovered anything of further importance, but the
    atom of novelty of which I made myself master, helped to confirm me in my
    belief that the deceased had visited a young woman, probably a lady, a very
    short time before his death.</p>
  <p align="left">Higgins, a saddler by trade, was not at all delighted at my
    re-appearance, and really I was afraid I should have to state what I was
    in order to get my way, and then civilly bully him into secrecy. But happily
    his belief in me as a mild mad woman overcame his surliness, and so with
    the help of a few more shillings I examined once more the clothes found on
    the unfortunate young squire.</p>
  <p align="left">And now, in the full blazing spring morning sunlight, I saw
    what had missed my view on the previous evening. This was nothing less than
    a bright crimson scrap of silk braid, such as ladies use in prosecuting their
    embroidery studies.</p>
  <p align="left">This bit of braid had been wound round and round a breast button,
    and then tied in a natty bow at the top.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She is a lady,&rdquo; I thought; &ldquo;and she was
    resting her head against his breast when she tied that bit of braid there.
    She is innocent, I should think, or she never would have done such a childish
    action as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Higgins put away the dead youth&rsquo;s clothes with a discontented
    air.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look ye yere&mdash;do&rsquo;ee think ye&rsquo;l want &rsquo;em
    wuncet more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wull, if ee do, &rsquo;ee wunt have &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; I said, and went back to the station.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course there was Mrs. Green on the watch, though in the
    morning I had seen about the house symptoms of the day being devoted to what
    I have heard comic Londoners describe as &ldquo;a water party&rdquo;&mdash;in
    other words, a grand wash.</p>
  <p align="left">That wash Mrs. Green had deserted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bless &rsquo;ee, I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; for a dear
    fren!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, indeed, Mrs. Green.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Shall I take ticket for &rsquo;ee, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, if you like. Take it for Stokeley,&rdquo; said
    I.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Four mile away,&rdquo; says Mrs. Green. &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve</i>    got a fren&rsquo; at Stokeley. I wounds if your fren&rsquo; be <i>my</i> fren&rsquo;!
    Who <i>be</i> your fren&rsquo;, bless &rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Blotchley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, her as lives near th&rsquo; peump?&rdquo; (pump)</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know <i>she</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It seemed to me Mrs. Green was awed&mdash;I never learnt by
    what, because as I never knew Mrs. Blotchley, and dropped upon her name by
    chance, and indeed never visited Stokeley, why Green had all the benefit
    of the discovery.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And, Mrs. Green, if I am not home by nine, do not sit
    up for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&mdash;goin&rsquo; maybe to sleep at <i>her</i> hoose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And as Mrs. Green here dropped me a curtsey I have remained
    under the impression that Mrs. B. was a lady of consequence whose grandeur
    Mrs. Green saw reflected upon me.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no doubt the information she put at once in circulation
    helped to screen the actual purpose for which I had arrived at Tram from
    leaking out.</p>
  <p align="left">When the train reached Stokeley I procured another ticket on
    to Little Pocklington, and reached that town about two in the afternoon.
    It was not more than sixty miles from Tram.</p>
  <p align="left">The father of this Dinah Yarton was one of those small few-acre
    farmers who throughout the country are gradually but as certainly vanishing.</p>
  <p align="left">I may perhaps at once say that the poor girl Dinah had no less
    than three fits over the cross-examination to which I submitted her, and
    here (to the honour of rustic human nature) let it be recorded that actually
    I had to use my last resource, and show myself to be a police-officer, by
    the production of my warrant in the presence of the Little Pocklington constable,
    who was brought into the affair, before I could overcome the objections of
    the girl&rsquo;s father. He with much justifiable reason urged that the &ldquo;darned&rdquo; business
    had already half-killed his wench, and he would be  &ldquo;darned&rdquo; if
    I should altogether send her out of the &ldquo;warld.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As I have said, the unhappy girl had three fits, and I have
    no doubt the family were heartily glad when I had turned my back upon the
    premises.</p>
  <p align="left">The unhappy young woman had to make twenty struggles before
    she could find one reply.</p>
  <p align="left">Here I need not repeat her evidence to that point past which
    it was not carried when she stood before the coroner and jury, but I will
    commence from that point.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dinah,&rdquo; I inquired in a quiet tone, and I believe
    the fussiness betrayed by the girl&rsquo;s mother tended as much to the fits
    as the girl&rsquo;s own nervousness&mdash;&ldquo;Dinah, what was all that
    about the big box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Darn the box,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>
  <p align="left">And here it was that the unfortunate girl took her second fit.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There, she&rsquo;s killed my Dinah now,&rdquo; said
    the old woman, and it must be confessed Dinah was horribly convulsed, and
    indeed looked frightful in the extreme. The poor creature was quite an hour
    fighting with the fit, and when she came to and opened her eyes, the first
    object they met made her shut them again, for that object was myself.</p>
  <p align="left">However, I had my duty to perform, and therein lies the excuse
    for my torture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&mdash;oh&mdash;o-o-oh wha-at did thee say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the big box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.&rdquo; [This was the mode in those parts of
    saying &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In th&rsquo; hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How long had it been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sin&rsquo; the day afore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did they come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They coomed in a great big waggoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And did they bring the box in the waggon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yoa.&rdquo; [This already I knew meant &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And they left the box at the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yoa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoa?&rdquo; [This I guessed meant &ldquo;What.&rdquo;]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Zed box wur for squoire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did they both carry it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yoa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Carefool loike.&rdquo; [Here there were symptoms of
    another convulsion.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What became of the big box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did they come for it again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it there now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then it went away again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yoa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You did not see it taken away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Noa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then how do you know it is not there now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doa noa.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But you say it is not at the hall&mdash;how do you know
    that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Quanyan (Quinion) told I men had been for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d been garne to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it there the next morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was it there the morning when they found the young squire
    dead outside the door?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And now &ldquo;Diney,&rdquo; as her mother called her, plunged
    into the third fit, and in the early throes of that convulsion I was forced
    to leave her, for her father, an honest fellow, told me to leave his house, &ldquo;arficer
    or no arficer,&rdquo; and that if I did not do so he would give me what he
    called a &ldquo;sta-a-art.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Under the circumstances I thought that perhaps it was wise
    to go, and did depart accordingly.</p>
  <p align="left">That night I remained in Little Pocklington in the hope, in
    which I was so grievously disappointed, of discovering further particulars
    which the girl might have divulged to her companions. But in the first place
    Diney had no companions, and in the second all attempts to draw people out,
    for the case had been copied into that county paper which held sway at Little
    Pocklington, all attempts signally failed.</p>
  <p align="left">Upon my return to Tram, Mrs. Green received me with all the
    honours, clearly as a person who had visited Mrs. Blotchley, and I noticed
    that the parlour fire-place was decorated with a new stove-ornament in paper
    of a fiery and flaring description.</p>
  <p align="left">I thanked Mrs. Green, and in answer to that lady&rsquo;s inquiries
    I was happy to say Mrs. Blotchley was well&mdash;except a slight cold. Yes,
    I had slept there. What did I have for dinner at Mrs. Blotchley&rsquo;s?
    Well, really I had forgotten. &ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; said Mrs. Green, &ldquo;&rsquo;ow
    unfortnet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">After seeing &ldquo;Diney,&rdquo; and in coming home by the
    train (and indeed I can always think well while travelling), I turned over
    all that I had pinched out of Dinah Yarton in reference to the big box.</p>
  <p align="left">Did that box, or did it not, in any way relate to the death?</p>
  <p align="left">It was large; it had been carried by two men; and according
    to Dinah&rsquo;s information it had been removed again from the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">At all events I must find out what the box meant.</p>
  <p align="left">The whole affair was still so warm&mdash;not much more than
    a fortnight had passed since the occurrence&mdash;that I still felt sure
    all particulars about that date which had been noticed would be remembered.</p>
  <p align="left">I set Mrs. Green to work, for nobody could better suit my purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Green, can you find out whether any strange carrier&rsquo;s
    cart or waggon, containing a very big box, was seen in Tram on the Monday,
    and the day before young Mr. Petleigh&rsquo;s body was found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I saw happiness in Mrs. Green&rsquo;s face; and having thus
    set her to work, I put myself in the best order, and went up to Petleighcote
    Hall.</p>
  <p align="left">The door was opened (with suspicious slowness) by a servant-woman,
    who closed it again before she took my message and a card to Mrs. Quinion.
    The message consisted of a statement that I had come after the character
    of a servant.</p>
  <p align="left">A few moments passed, and I was introduced into the housekeeper&rsquo;s
    presence.</p>
  <p align="left">I found her a calm-looking, fine, portly woman, with much quiet
    determination in her countenance. She was by no means badly featured.</p>
  <p align="left">She was quite self-possessed.</p>
  <p align="left">The following conversation took place between us. The reader
    will see that not the least reference was made by me to the real object of
    my visit&mdash;the prosecution of an inquiry as to the mode by which young
    Mr. Petleigh had met his death. And if the reader complains that there is
    much falsity in what I state, I would urge that as evil-doing is a kind of
    lie levelled at society, if it is to be conquered it must be met on the side
    of society, through its employes, by similar false action.</p>
  <p align="left">Here is the conversation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs. Quinion, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, as I am usually termed&mdash;but let that pass.
    You wish to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes; I have called about the character of a servant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was passing through Tram, where I shall remain some
    days, on my way from town to York, and I thought it would be wise to make
    a personal inquiry, which I find much the best plan in all affairs relating
    to my servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A capital plan; but as you came from town, why did you
    not apply to the town housekeeper, since I have no doubt you take the young
    person from the town house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is the difficulty. I should take the young person,
    if her character were to answer, from a sort of charity. She has never been
    in town, and here&rsquo;s my doubt. However, if you give me any hope of the
    young person&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dinah&mdash;Dinah&mdash;you will allow me to refer to
    my pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take that trouble,&rdquo; said she, and
    I thought she looked pale; but her pallor might have been owing, I thought
    at the time, to the deep mourning she was wearing; &ldquo;you mean Dinah
    Yarton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yarton&mdash;that is the name. Do you think she will
    suit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Much depends upon what she is wanted for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An under nurserymaid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your own family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, dear no&mdash;a sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[She asked this question most calmly.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No&mdash;abroad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Abroad?&rdquo; and I remarked that she uttered the word
    with an energy which, though faint in itself, spoke volumes when compared
    with her previous serenity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;my sister&rsquo;s family
    are about leaving England for Italy, where they will remain for years. Do
    you think this girl would do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. She is not very bright, it is true,
    but she is wonderfully clean, honest, and extremely fond of children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Now, it struck me then and there that the experience of the
    housekeeper at childless Petleighcote as to Dinah&rsquo;s love of children
    must have been extremely limited.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What I most liked in Dinah,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Quinion, &ldquo;was
    her frankness and trustworthiness. There can be no doubt of her gentleness
    with children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May I ask why you parted with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She left me of her own free will. We had, two or three
    weeks since, a very sad affair here. It operated much upon her; she wished
    to get away from the place; and indeed I was glad she determined to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has she good health?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very fair health.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Not a word about the fits.</p>
  <p align="left">It struck me Mrs. Quinion relished the idea of Dinah Yarton&rsquo;s
    going abroad.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think I will recommend her to my sister. She tells
    me she would have no objection to go abroad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! you have seen her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the day before yesterday, and before leaving
    for town, whence I came here. I will recommend the girl. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good morning, ma&rsquo;am; but before you go, will you
    allow me to take the liberty of asking you, since you are from London, if
    you can recommend me a town servant, or at all events a young person who
    comes from a distance. When the family is away I require only one servant
    here, and I am not able to obtain this one now that the hall has got amongst
    the scandal-mongers, owing to the catastrophe to which I have already referred.
    The young person I have with me is intolerable; she has only been here four
    days, and I am quite sure she must not remain fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I think I can recommend you a young person, strong
    and willing to please, and who only left my sister&rsquo;s household on the
    score of followers. Shall I write to my sister&rsquo;s housekeeper and see
    what is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should be most obliged,&rdquo; said Mrs. Quinion;  &ldquo;but
    where may I address a letter to you in event of my having to write?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I shall remain at Tram
    quite a week. I have received a telegraphic message which makes my journey
    to the north needless; and as I have met here in Tram with a person who is
    a friend of an humble friend of mine, I am in no hurry to quit the place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed! may I ask who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old Mrs. Green, at the corner of the Market Place, and
    her friend is Mrs. Blotchley of Stokeley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, thank you. I know neither party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I may possibly see you again,&rdquo; I continued.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Most obliged,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Quinion; &ldquo;shall
    be most happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She returned the salute, and there was an end of the visit.</p>
  <p align="left">And then it came about that upon returning to the house of
    old Mrs. Green, I said in the most innocent manner in the world, and in order
    to make all my acts and words in the place as consistent as possible, for
    in a small country town if you do not do your falsehood deftly you will very
    quickly be discovered&mdash;I said to that willing gossip&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Green, I find you are a friend of Mrs. Blotchley
    of Stokeley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;E-es,&rdquo; she said in a startled manner, &ldquo;Ise
    her fren&rsquo;, bless &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m gratified to hear it, for as her friend
    you are mine, Mrs. Green.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And here I took her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">No wonder after our interview was over that she went out in
    her best bonnet, though it was only Wednesday. I felt sure it was quite out
    of honour to Mrs. Blotchley and her friend, who had claimed her friendship,
    and the history of which she was taking out to tea with her.</p>
  <p align="left">Of the interview with Mrs. Green I must say a few words, and
    in her own expressions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Green, have you heard of any unusual cart
    having been seen in Tram on the day before Mr. Petleigh was found dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lardy, lardy, e-es,&rdquo; said Mrs. Green; &ldquo;but
    bless &rsquo;ee, whaty want to know for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I want to know if it was Mrs. Blotchley&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s
    cart, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Des say it war. I&rsquo;ve been arl over toon speering
    aboot that waggoon. I went to Jones the baker, and Willmott, who married
    Mary Sprinters&mdash;which wur on&rsquo;y fair; the grocer, an&rsquo; him
    knowed nought about it; an&rsquo; the bootcher in froont street, and bootcher
    in back street; and Mrs. Macnab, her as mangles, and no noos, bless &rsquo;ee,
    not even of Tom Hatt the milkman, but, lardy, lardy! when Ise tarking for
    a fren&rsquo; o&rsquo; my fren&rsquo;s Ise tark till never. &rsquo;Twur draper
    told I arl aboot the ca-art.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said, I am afraid too eagerly for a detective
    who knew her business thoroughly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, draper White wur oot for stroll loike, an&rsquo;  looking
    about past turning to the harl (hall), and then he sees coming aloong a cart
    him guessed wur coming to him&rsquo;s shop; but, bless &rsquo;ee, &rsquo;twarnt
    comin&rsquo; to his shop at arl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was it going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why the cart turned roight arf to harl, and that moost
    ha&rsquo; been wher they cart went to; and, bless &rsquo;ee, that&rsquo;s
    arl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then Mrs. Green, talking like machinery to the very threshold,
    went, and I guess put on her new bonnet instanter, for she wore it before
    she went out, and when she brought in my chop and potatoes.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile I was ruminating the news of the box, if I may be
    allowed the figure, and piecing it together.</p>
  <p align="left">It was pretty clear to me that a box had been taken to the
    hall, for the evidence of the girl Dinah and that which Mrs. Green brought
    together coincided in supporting a supposition to that effect.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl said a big box (which must have been large, seeing
    it took two men to carry it) had been brought to the hall in a large cart
    on the day previous to the finding of the body.</p>
  <p align="left">It was on that day the draper, presumably, had seen a large
    cart turn out of the main road towards Petleighcote.</p>
  <p align="left">Did that cart contain the box the girl Diuah referred to?</p>
  <p align="left">If so, had it anything to do with the death?</p>
  <p align="left">If so, where was it?</p>
  <p align="left">If hidden, who had hidden it?</p>
  <p align="left">These were the questions which flooded my mind, and which the
    reader will see were sufficiently important and equally embarrassing.</p>
  <p align="left">The first question to be decided was this,&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">Had the big box anything to do with the matter?</p>
  <p align="left">I first wrote my letter to head quarters putting things in
    train to plant one of our people as serving woman at Petleighcote, and then
    I sallied out to visit Mr. White, the draper.</p>
  <p align="left">He was what men would call a &ldquo;jolly&rdquo; man, one who
    took a good deal of gin-and-water, and the world as it came. He was a man
    to be hail met with the world, but to find it rather a thirsty sphere, and
    diligently to spirit-and-water that portion of it contained within his own
    suit of clothes.</p>
  <p align="left">He was a man to be rushed at and tilted over with confidence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. White,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I want an umbrella,
    and also a few words with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Both, mum,&rdquo; said he; and I would have bet, for
    though a woman I am fond of a little wager now and then,&mdash;yes, I would
    have bet that before his fourth sentence he would drop the &ldquo;mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here are what we have in umberellers, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you. Do you remember meeting a strange cart on
    the day, a Monday, before Mr. Petleigh&mdash;Petleigh&mdash;what was his
    name?&mdash;was found dead outside the hall? I mention that horrid circumstance
    to recall the day to your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, yes, I do, mum. I&rsquo;ve been hearing of this
    from Mary Green.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What kind of cart was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, mum, it was a wholesale fancy article manufacturer&rsquo;s
    van.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, such as travel from drapers to drapers with samples,
    and sometimes things for sale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes; that were it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">[He dropped the mum at the fourth sentence.]</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A very large van, in which a man could almost stand
    upright?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A man, my dear!&rdquo; He was just the kind of man to  &ldquo;my
    dear&rdquo; a customer, though by so doing he should offend her for life.  &ldquo;Half-a-dozen
    of &rsquo;em, and filled with boxes of samples, in each of which you might
    stow away a long&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter, eh? What do you want to find
    out about the van for, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t ask me, White,&rdquo; said I, knowing
    the way to such a man&rsquo;s confidence is the road of familiarity. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,
    don&rsquo;t inquire what. But tell me, how many men were there on the van?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What were they like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t notice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you know them, or either of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ha! <i>I</i> see,&rdquo; said White; and I am afraid I allowed
    him to infer that he had surprised a personal secret. &ldquo;No; I knew neither
    of &rsquo;em, if <i>I</i> know it. Strangers to me. Of course <i>I</i> thought they were
    coming with samples to <i>my</i> shop; for I am the only one in the village. But
    they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; they went to the hall, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. <i>I</i> thought they had turned wrong, and I hollered
    after them, but it was no use. I wish I could describe them for you, my dear,
    but I can&rsquo;t. However, I believe they looked like gentlemen. Do you
    think <i>that</i> description will answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did they afterwards come into the town, Mr. White?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, my dear, they did, and baited at the White Horse,
    and then it was I was so surprised they did not call. And then&mdash;in fact,
    my dear, if you would like to know all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t keep anything from me, White.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, my dear, I went over as they were making
    ready to go, and I asked them if they were looking for a party of the name
    of White? And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, pray, pray continue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, then, one of them told me to go to a place, to
    repeat which before you, my dear, I would not; from which it seemed to me
    that they did <i>not</i> want a person of the name of White.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And, Mr. White, did they quit Tram by the same road
    as that by which they entered it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, they did <i>not</i>; they drove out at the other end of
    the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it possible? And tell me, Mr. White, if they wanted
    to get back to the hall, could they have done so by any other means than
    by returning through the village?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, not without&mdash;let me see, my dear&mdash;not
    without going thirty miles round by the heath, which,&rdquo; added Mr. White, &ldquo;and
    no offence, my dear, I am bound to submit they were not men who seemed likely
    to take any unnecessary trouble; or why&mdash;why in fact did they tell me
    to go to where in fact they told me to go to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True; but they may have returned, and you not know anything
    about it, Mr. White.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There you have it, my dear. You go to the gateman, and
    as it&rsquo;s only three weeks since, you take his word, for Tom remembers
    every vehicle that passes his &rsquo;pike&mdash;there are not many of them,
    for business is woundily slack. Tom remembers &rsquo;em all for a good quarter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mr. White. I think I&rsquo;ll take the
    green umbrella. How much is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now look here, my dear,&rdquo; the draper continued,
    leaning over the counter, and dropping his voice; &ldquo;I know the umbereller
    is the excuse, and though business <i>is</i> bad. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want
    you to take it; unless, indeed, you want it,&rdquo; he added, the commercial
    spirit struggling with the spirit proper of the man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the
    green&mdash;you will kindly let me call upon you again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With pleasure, my dear; as often as you like; the more
    the better. And look here, you need not buy any more umberellers or things.
    You just drop in in a friendly way, you know. <i>I</i> see it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said; and making an escape I was
    rather desirous of obtaining, I left the shop, which, I regret to say, I
    was ungrateful enough not to revisit. But, on the other hand, I met White
    several and at most inconvenient times.</p>
  <p align="left">Tom the &rsquo;pikeman&rsquo;s memory for vehicles was, I found,
    a proverb in the place; and when I went to him, he remembered the vehicle
    almost before I could explain its appearance to him.</p>
  <p align="left">As for the question&mdash;&ldquo;Did the van return?&rdquo;&mdash;he
    treated the &ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo; with which I met his shake
    of the head&mdash;he treated my doubt with such violent decision that I became
    confident he was right.</p>
  <p align="left">Unless he was bribed to secrecy?</p>
  <p align="left">But the doubt was ridiculous; for could all the town be bribed
    to secrecy?</p>
  <p align="left">I determined that doubt at once. And indeed it is the great
    gain and drawback to our profession that we have to doubt so imperiously.
    To believe every man to be honest till he is found out to be a thief, is
    a motto most self-respecting men cling to; but we detectives on the contrary
    would not gain salt to our bread, much less the bread itself, if we adopted
    such a belief. We have to believe every man a rogue till, after turning all
    sorts of evidence inside out, we can only discover that he is an honest man.
    And even then I am much afraid we are not quite sure of him.</p>
  <p align="left">I am aware this is a very dismal way of looking upon society,
    but the more thinking amongst my profession console themselves with the knowledge
    that our system is a necessary one (under the present condition of society),
    and that therefore in conforming to the melancholy rules of this system,
    however repulsive we may feel them, we are really doing good to our brother
    men.</p>
  <p align="left">Returning home after I left the &rsquo;pikeman&mdash;from whom
    I ascertained that the van had passed his gate at half-past eight in the
    evening, I turned over all my new information in my mind.</p>
  <p align="left">The girl Dinah must have seen the box in the hall as she went
    to bed. Say this was half-past nine; at half-past five, at the time the alarm
    was given, the box was gone.</p>
  <p align="left">This made eight hours.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, the van had left Tram at half-past eight, and to get round
    to the hall it had to go thirty miles by night over a heath. (By a reference
    to my almanack I found there was no moon that night.) Now, take it that a
    heavy van travelling by night-time could not go more than five miles an hour,
    and allowing the horse an hour&rsquo;s rest when half the journey was accomplished,
    we find that seven hours would be required to accomplish that distance.</p>
  <p align="left">This would bring the earliest time at which the van could arrive
    at the hall at half-past three, assuming no impediments to arise.</p>
  <p align="left">There would be then just two hours before the body was discovered,
    and actually as the dawn was breaking.</p>
  <p align="left">Such a venture was preposterous even in the contemplation.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first place, why should the box be left if it were to
    be called for again?</p>
  <p align="left">In the second, why should it be called for so early in the
    morning as half-past three?</p>
  <p align="left">And yet at half-past five it had vanished, and Mrs. Quinion
    had said to the girl (I assumed the girl&rsquo;s evidence to be true) that
    the box had been taken away again.</p>
  <p align="left">From my investigation of these facts I inferred&mdash;firstly:
    That the van which brought the box had not taken it away.</p>
  <p align="left">Secondly: That Mrs. Quinion, for some as yet unexplained purpose,
    had wished the girl to suppose the box had been removed.</p>
  <p align="left">Thirdly: That the box was still in the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Fourthly: That as Mrs. Quinion had stated the box was gone,
    while it was still on the premises, she had some purpose (surely important)
    in stating that it had been taken away.</p>
  <p align="left">It was late, but I wanted to complete my day&rsquo;s work as
    far as it lay in my power.</p>
  <p align="left">I had two things to do.</p>
  <p align="left">Firstly, to send the &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; which I had gathered
    from the clothes to a microscopic chemist; and secondly, to make some inquiry
    at the inn where the van attendants had baited, and ascertain what they were.</p>
  <p align="left">Therefore I put the &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; in a tin box, and directed
    it to the gentleman who is good enough to control these kind of investigations
    for me, and going out I posted my communication. Then I made for the tavern,
    with the name of which Mrs. Green had readily furnished me, and asked for
    the landlady.</p>
  <p align="left">The interest she exhibited showed me in a moment that Mrs.
    Green&rsquo;s little remarks and Mr. White&rsquo;s frank observations had
    got round to that quarter.</p>
  <p align="left">And here let me break off for a moment to show how nicely people
    will gull themselves. I had plainly made no admission which personally identified
    me with the van, and yet people had already got up a very sentimental feeling
    in my favour in reference to that vehicle.</p>
  <p align="left">For this arrangement I was unfeignedly glad. It furnished a
    motive for my remaining in Tram, which was just what I wanted.</p>
  <p align="left">And furthermore, the tale I told Mrs. Quinion about my remaining
    in Tram because I had found a friend of my own friend, would, if it spread
    (which it did not, from which I inferred that Mrs. Quinion had no confidences
    with the Tram maiden at that hour with her, and that this latter did not
    habitually listen) do me no harm, as I might ostensibly be supposed to invent
    a fib which might cover my supposed tribulation. Here is a condensation of
    the conversation I had with the landlady.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! I know; I&rsquo;m glad to see you. Pray sit down.
    Take that chair&mdash;it&rsquo;s the easiest. And how are you, my poor dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not strong,&rdquo; I had to say.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! and well you may not be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I came to ask, did two persons, driving a van&mdash;a
    large black van, picked out with pale blue (this description I had got from
    the  &rsquo;pikeman)&mdash;stop here on the day before Mr.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
    forgotten his name&mdash;the young squire&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, my poor dear, an&rsquo; a tall gentleman with auburn
    whiskers, and the other shorter, without whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dear me; did you notice anything peculiar in the tall
    gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, my poor dear, I noticed that every now and then
    his upper lip flitched a bit, like a dog&rsquo;s asleep will sometimes go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here I sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the other?&rdquo; I continued.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! all that seemed odd in him was that he broke out
    into bits of song, something like birds more nor English Christian singing;
    which the words, if words there were, I could not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Italian scraps,&rdquo; I thought; and immediately I
    associated this evidence of the man with the foreign mask.</p>
  <p align="left">If they were commercial travellers, one of them was certainly
    an unusual one, operatic accomplishments not being usually one of the tendencies
    of commercial men.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were they nice people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says the landlady, concessively and hurriedly; &ldquo;they
    were every inch gentlemen; and I said to mine, said I&mdash;&lsquo;they aint
    like most o&rsquo; the commercial travellers that stop here;&rsquo; and mine
    answers me back, &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;for commercials prefers
    beers to sherries, and whiskies after dinner to both!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! did they only drink wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing but sherry, my dear; and says they to mine&mdash;&lsquo;Very
    good wine,&rsquo;&mdash;those were their very words&mdash;&lsquo;whatever
    you do, bring it dry;&rsquo; and said mine&mdash;I saying his very words&mdash;&lsquo;Gents,
    I will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Some more conversation ensued, with which I need not trouble
    the reader, though I elicited several points which were of minor importance.</p>
  <p align="left">I was not permitted to leave the hotel without  &ldquo;partaking,&rdquo;&mdash;I
    use the landlady&rsquo;s own verb&mdash;without partaking of a warmer and
    stronger comfort than is to be found in mere words.</p>
  <p align="left">And the last inference I drew, before satisfactorily I went
    to bed that night, was to the effect that the apparent commercial travellers
    were not commercial travellers, but men leading the lives of gentlemen.</p>
  <p align="left">And now as I have set out a list of inferences which rest upon
    very good evidence, before I go to the history of the work of the following
    days, I must recapitulate these inferences&mdash;if I may use so pompous
    a word.</p>
  <p align="left">They are as follow:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">1.<br>
    That the key found on the body opened a receptacle containing treasure.</p>
  <p align="left">2.<br>
    That the mask found on the body was of foreign manufacture.</p>
  <p align="left">3.<br>
    That the handkerchief found on the body had very recently belonged to a young
      lady named Frederica, and to whom the deceased was probably deeply attached.</p>
  <p align="left">4.<br>
    That the circumstances surrounding the deceased showed that he had been engaged
      in no poaching expedition, nor in any house-breaking attempt, notwithstanding
      the presence of the mask, because no house-breaking implements were found
      upon him.</p>
  <p align="left">5.<br>
    That the young lady was innocent of participation in whatever evil work the
      deceased may have been engaged upon. [This inference, however, was solely
      based upon the discovery of the embroidery braid round the button of the
      deceased&rsquo;s coat. This inference is the least supported by evidence
      of the near dozen.]</p>
  <p align="left">6.<br>
    That a big box had been taken to the hall on the day previous to that on
      which the deceased was found dead outside the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">7.<br>
    That the box was not removed again in the van in which it had been brought
      to the house.</p>
  <p align="left">8.<br>
    That whatever the box contained that something was heavy, as it took the
      two men to carry it into the house.</p>
  <p align="left">9.<br>
    That Mrs. Quinion, for some so far unexplainable reason, had endeavoured
      to make the witness Dinah Yarton believe that the box had been removed;
      while, in fact, the box was still in the house.</p>
  <p align="left">10.<br>
    That as Mrs. Quinion had stated the box was gone while it was still on the
      premises, she had some important motive for saying it had been taken away.</p>
  <p align="left">11.<br>
    That the van-attendants, who were apparent commercial travellers, were not
      commercial travellers, and were in the habit of living the lives of gentlemen.</p>
  <p align="left">And what was the condensed inference of all these inferences?</p>
  <p align="left">Why&mdash;That the first probable means by which the solution
    of the mystery was to be arrived at was the finding of the box.</p>
  <p align="left">To hunt for this box it was necessary that I should obtain
    free admission to Petleighcote, and by the most extraordinary chance Mrs.
    Quinion had herself thrown the opportunity in my way by asking me to recommend
    her a town servant.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, beyond any question, she had made this request with
    the idea of obtaining a servant who, being a stranger to the district, would
    have little or not any of that interest in the catastrophe of the young squire&rsquo;s
    death which all felt who, by belonging to the neighbourhood, had more or
    less known him.</p>
  <p align="left">I had now to wait two days before I could move in the matter&mdash;those
    two days being consumed in the arrival of the woman police-officer who was
    to play the part of servant up at the hall, and in her being accepted and
    installed at that place.</p>
  <p align="left">On the morning of that second day the report came from my microscopic
    chemist.</p>
  <p align="left">He stated that the fluff forwarded him for inspection consisted
    of two different substances; one, fragments of feathers, the other, atoms
    of nap from some linen material, made of black and white stuff, and which,
    from its connexion with the atoms of feather, he should take to be the fluff
    of a bed-tick.</p>
  <p align="left">For a time this report convinced me that the clothes had been
    covered with this substance, in consequence of the deceased having lain down
    in his clothes to sleep at a very recent time before he was found dead.</p>
  <p align="left">And now came the time to consider the question&mdash;&ldquo;What
    was my own impression regarding the conduct of the deceased immediately preceding
    the death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">My impression was this&mdash;that he was about to commit some
    illegal action, but that he had met with his death before he could put his
    intention into execution.</p>
  <p align="left">This impression arose from the fact that the mask showed a
    secret intention, while the sound state of the clothes suggested that no
    struggle had preceded the bloody death&mdash;struggle, however brief, generally
    resulting in clothes more or less damaged, as any soldier who has been in
    action will tell you (and perhaps tell you wonderingly), to the effect that
    though he himself may have come out of the fight without a scratch, his clothes
    were one vast rip.</p>
  <p align="left">The question that chiefly referred to the body was, who placed
    it where it was found between three o&rsquo;clock (the time when the rain
    ceased, before which hour the body could not have been deposited, since the
    clothes, where they did not touch the ground, were dry) and half-past five?</p>
  <p align="left">Had it been brought from a distance?</p>
  <p align="left">Had it been brought from a vicinity?</p>
  <p align="left">The argument against distance was this one, which bears in
    all cases of the removal of dead bodies&mdash;that if it is dangerous to
    move them a yard, it is a hundred times more dangerous to move them a hundred
    yards.</p>
  <p align="left">Granted the removal of young Petleigh&rsquo;s body, in a state
    which would at once excite suspicion, and it is clear that a great risk was
    run by those who carried that burden.</p>
  <p align="left">But was there any apparent advantage to compensate that risk?</p>
  <p align="left">No, there was not.</p>
  <p align="left">The only rational way of accounting for the deposition of the
    body where it was found, lay in the supposition that those who were mixed
    up with his death were just enough to carry the body to a spot where it would
    at once be recognised and cared for.</p>
  <p align="left">But against this argument it might be held, the risk was so
    great that the ordinary instinct of self-preservation natural to man would
    prevent such a risk being encountered. And this impression becomes all the
    deeper when it is remembered that the identification of the body could have
    been secured by the slipping of a piece of paper in the pocket bearing his
    address.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, when it is remembered that it must have been quite dawn
    at the time of the assumed conveyance, the improbability becomes the greater
    that the body was brought any great distance.</p>
  <p align="left">Then this probability became the greater, that the young man
    had died in the vicinity of the spot where he was found.</p>
  <p align="left">Then followed the question, how close?</p>
  <p align="left">And in considering this point, it must not be forgotten that
    if it were dangerous to bring the body to the hall, it would be equally dangerous
    to remove the body <i>from the hall; supposing</i> the murder (if murder it were)
    had been committed within the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">Could this be the case?</p>
  <p align="left">Beyond all question, the only people known to be at the hall
    on the night of the death were Mrs. Quinion and Dinah.</p>
  <p align="left">Now we have closed in the space within which the murder (as
    we will call it) had been done, as narrowly circumscribing the hall. Now
    was the place any other than the hall, and yet near it?</p>
  <p align="left">The only buildings near the hall, within a quarter of a mile,
    were the gardener&rsquo;s cottage, and the cottage of the keeper.</p>
  <p align="left">The keeper was ill at the time, and it was the gardener who
    had discovered the body. To consider the keeper as implicated in the affair,
    was quite out of the question; while as to the gardener, an old man, and
    older servant of the family (for he had entered the service of the family
    as a boy), it must be remembered that he was the discoverer of the dead body.</p>
  <p align="left">Now is it likely that if he was implicated in the affair that
    he would have identified himself with the discovery? Such a supposition is
    hardly holdable.</p>
  <p align="left">Very well; then, as the doctor at six a.m. declared death had
    taken place from six to eight hours; and as the body, from the dry state
    of the clothes, had <i>not</i> been exposed during the night&rsquo;s rain, which
    ceased at three, it was clear either that the murder had been committed within
    doors, or that the body had been sheltered for some hours after death beneath
    a roof of some kind.</p>
  <p align="left">Where was that roof?</p>
  <p align="left">Apart from the gardener&rsquo;s cottage and the keeper&rsquo;s,
    there was no building nearer than a quarter of a mile; and if therefore the
    body had been carried after three to where it was found, it was evident that
    those cognizant of the affair had carried it a furlong at or after dawn.</p>
  <p align="left">To suppose such an amount of moral courage in evil-doers was
    to suppose an improbability, against which a detective, man or woman, cannot
    too thoroughly be on his or her guard.</p>
  <p align="left">But what of the supposition that the body had been removed
    from the hall, and placed where it was found?</p>
  <p align="left">So far, all the external evidences of the case leant in favour
    of this theory.</p>
  <p align="left">But the theory was at total variance with the ordinary experience
    of life.</p>
  <p align="left">In the first place, what apparent motive could Mrs. Quinion
    have for taking the young heir&rsquo;s life? Not any apparently.</p>
  <p align="left">What motive had the girl?</p>
  <p align="left">She had not sufficient strength of mind to hold a fierce motive.
    I doubt if the poor creature could ever have imagined active evil.</p>
  <p align="left">I may here add I depended very much upon what that girl said,
    because it was consistent, was told under great distress of mind, and was
    in many particulars borne out by other evidence.</p>
  <p align="left">I left Dinah Yarton quite out of my list of suspects.</p>
  <p align="left">But in accepting her evidence I committed myself to the belief
    that no one had been at Petleighcote on the night of the catastrophe beyond
    the girl and the housekeeper.</p>
  <p align="left">Then how could I support the supposition that the young man
    had passed the night and met his death at the hall?</p>
  <p align="left">Very easily.</p>
  <p align="left">Because a weak-headed woman like Dinah did not know of the
    presence of the heir at Petleighcote, it did not follow he could not be there&mdash;his
    presence being known only to the housekeeper.</p>
  <p align="left">But was there any need for such secrecy?</p>
  <p align="left">Yes.</p>
  <p align="left">I found out that fact before the town servant arrived.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Quinion&rsquo;s express orders were not to allow the heir
    to remain at the hall while the family were in town.</p>
  <p align="left">Then here was a good reason why the housekeeper should maintain
    his presence a secret from a stupid blurting servant maid.</p>
  <p align="left">But I have said motive for murder on the part of the housekeeper
    could scarcely be present.</p>
  <p align="left">Then suppose the death was accidental (though certainly no
    circumstance of the catastrophe justified such a supposition), and suppose
    Mrs. Quinion the perpetratress, what was the object in exposing the body
    outside the house?</p>
  <p align="left">Such an action was most unwomanly, especially where an accident
    had happened.</p>
  <p align="left">I confess that at this point of the case (and up to the time
    when my confederate arrived) I was completely foiled. All the material evidence
    was in favour of the murder or manslaughter having been committed under the
    roof of Petleighcote Hall, while the mass of the evidence of probability
    opposed any such belief.</p>
  <p align="left">Up to this time I had in no way identified the death with the &ldquo;big
    box,&rdquo; although I identified that box with the clearing up of the mystery.
    This identification was the result of an ordinary detective law.</p>
  <p align="left">The law in question is as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">In all cases which are being followed up by the profession,
    a lie is a suspicious act, whether it has relation or no relation, apparent
    or beyond question, with the matter in hand. As a lie it must be followed
    to its source, its meaning cleared up, and its value or want of value decided
    upon. The probability stands good always that a lie is part of a plot.</p>
  <p align="left">So as Mrs. Quinion had in all probability lied in reference
    to the removal of the box, it became necessary to find out all about it,
    and hence my first directions to Martha&mdash;as she was always called (she
    is now in Australia and doing well) at our office, and I doubt if her surname
    was known to any of us&mdash;hence my first instruction to Martha was to
    look about for a big box.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What kind of box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well there will be plenty of boxes in a big house&mdash;is
    it a new box?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell; but keep an eye upon boxes, and
    tell me if you find one that is more like a new one than the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Martha nodded.</p>
  <p align="left">But by the date of our first interview after her induction
    at Petleighcote, and when Quinion sent her down upon a message to a tradesman,
    I had learnt from the polished Mr. White that boxes such as drapers&rsquo;  travellers
    travelled with were invariably painted black.</p>
  <p align="left">This information I gave her. Martha had not any for me in return&mdash;that
    is of any importance. I heard, what I had already inferred, that Quinion
    was a very calm, self-possessed woman, &ldquo;whom it would take,&rdquo; said
    Martha, &ldquo;one or two good collisions to drive off the rails.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You mark my words,&rdquo; said Matty, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d
    face a judge as cool as she faces herself in a looking-glass, and that I
    can tell you she does face cool, for I&rsquo;ve seen her do it twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Martha&rsquo;s opinion was, that the housekeeper was all right,
    and I am bound to say that I was unable to suppose that she was all wrong,
    for the suspicion against her was of the faintest character.</p>
  <p align="left">She visited me the day after Martha&rsquo;s arrival, thanked
    me coolly enough for what I had done, said she believed the young person
    would do, and respectfully asked me up to the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">Three days passed, and in that time I had heard nothing of
    value from my aide-de-camp, who used to put her written reports twice a day
    in a hollow tree upon which we had decided.</p>
  <p align="left">It was on the fourth day that I got a fresh clue to feel my
    way by.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Lamb, the publican&rsquo;s wife, who had shown such a
    tender interest in my welfare on the night when I had inquired as to the
    appearance of the two persons who baited the van-horses at their stables
    on the night of the death&mdash;Mrs. Lamb in reluctantly letting me leave
    her (she was a most sentimental woman, who I much fear increased her tendencies
    by a too ready patronage of her own liquors) intreated me to return, &ldquo;like
    a poor dear as I was&rdquo;&mdash;for I had said I should remain at Tram&mdash;&ldquo;and
    come and take a nice cup of tea&rdquo; with her.</p>
  <p align="left">In all probability I never should have taken that nice cup
    of tea, had I not learnt from my Mrs. Green that young Petleigh had been
    in the habit of smoking and drinking at Lamb&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p align="left">That information decided me.</p>
  <p align="left">I &ldquo;dropped in&rdquo; at Mrs. Lamb&rsquo;s that same afternoon,
    and I am bound to say it was a nice cup of tea.</p>
  <p align="left">During that refreshment I brought the conversation round to
    young Petleigh, and thus I heard much of him told to his credit from a publican&rsquo;s
    point of view, but which did not say much for him from a social standing-place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And this, my poor dear, is the very book he would sit
    in this very parlour and read from for an hour together, and&mdash;coming!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For here there was a tap-tap on the metal counter with a couple
    of halfpence.</p>
  <p align="left">Not thinking much of the book, for it was a volume of a very
    ordinary publication, which has been in vogue for many years amongst cheap
    literature devotees, I let it fall open, rather than opened it, and I have
    no doubt that I did not once cast my eyes upon the page during the spirting
    of the beer-engine and the return of Mrs. Lamb.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said she, in a moved voice, for she
    was one of the most sentimental persons ever I encountered. &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s
    very odd!&mdash;poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s odd, Mrs. Lamb?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why if you haven&rsquo;t got the book open at his fav&rsquo;rite
    tale!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whose, Mrs. Lamb?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why that poor dear young Graham Petleigh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">I need not say I became interested directly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh! did he read this tale?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Often; and very odd it is, my own dear, as you should
    be about to read it too; though true it is that that there book do always
    open at that same place, which I take to be his reading it so often the place
    is worn and&mdash;coming!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here Mrs. Lamb shot away once more, while I, it need not be
    said, looked upon the pages before me.</p>
  <p align="left">And if I say that, before Mrs. Lamb had done smacking at the
    beer-engine, and ending her long gossip with the customer, I had got the
    case by the throat&mdash;I suppose I should astonish most of my readers.</p>
  <p align="left">And yet there is nothing extraordinary in the matter.</p>
  <p align="left">Examine most of the great detected cases on record, and you
    will find a little accident has generally been the clue to success.</p>
  <p align="left">So with great discoveries. One of the greatest improvements
    in the grinding of flour, and by which the patentee has made many thousands
    of pounds, was discovered by seeing a miller blow some flour out of a nook;
    and all the world knows that the cause which led the great Newton to discover
    the great laws of the universe was the fall of an apple.</p>
  <p align="left">So it frequently happens in these days of numberless newspapers
    that a chance view of a man will identify him with the description of a murderer.</p>
  <p align="left">Chance!</p>
  <p align="left">In the history of crime and its detection chance plays the
    chief character.</p>
  <p align="left">Why, as I am writing a newspaper is near me, in which there
    is the report of a trial for attempt to murder, where the woman who was shot
    at was only saved by the intervention of a piece of a ploughshare, which
    was under her shawl, and which she had <i>stolen</i> only a few minutes before the
    bullet struck the iron!</p>
  <p align="left">Why, compared with that instance of chance, what was mine when;
    by reading a tale which had been pointed out to me as one frequently read
    by the dead young man, I discovered the mystery which was puzzling me?</p>
  <p align="left">The tale told of how, in the north of England, a pedlar had
    left a pack at a house, and how a boy saw the top of it rise up and down;
    how they supposed a man must be <i>in</i> it who intended to rob the house; and
    how the boy shot at the pack, and killed a man.</p>
  <p align="left">I say, before Mrs. Lamb returned to her &ldquo;poor dear&rdquo; I
    had the mystery by heart.</p>
  <p align="left">The young man had been attracted by the tale, remembered it,
    and put it in form for some purpose. What?</p>
  <p align="left">In a moment I recalled the mania of the squire for plate, and,
    remembering how niggardly he was to the boy, it flashed upon me that the
    youth had in all probability formed a plan for robbing his father of a portion
    of his plate.</p>
  <p align="left">It stood true that it was understood the plate went up to town
    with the family. But was this so?</p>
  <p align="left">Now see how well the probabilities of the case would tell in
    with such a theory.</p>
  <p align="left">The youth was venturesome and daring, as his poaching affrays
    proved.</p>
  <p align="left">He was kept poor.</p>
  <p align="left">He knew his father to possess plate.</p>
  <p align="left">He was not allowed to be at Petleighcote when the father was
    away.</p>
  <p align="left">He had read a tale which coincided with my theory.</p>
  <p align="left">A large box had been left by strangers at the hall.</p>
  <p align="left">The young squire&rsquo;s body had been found under such circumstances,
    that the most probable way of accounting for its presence where it was found
    was by supposing that it had been removed there from the hall itself.</p>
  <p align="left">Such a plot explained the presence of the mask.</p>
  <p align="left">Finally, there was the key, a key opening, beyond all question,
    an important receptacle&mdash;a supposition very clear, seeing the character
    of the key.</p>
  <p align="left">Indeed, by this key might be traced the belief of treasure
    in the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Could this treasure really exist?</p>
  <p align="left">Before Mrs. Lamb had said &ldquo;Good night, dear,&rdquo; to
    a female customer who had come for a pint of small beer and a gallon of more
    strongly brewed scandal, I had come to the conclusion that plate might be
    in the house.</p>
  <p align="left">For miserly men are notoriously suspicious and greedy. What
    if there were some of the family plate which was not required at the town
    house then at Petleighcote, and which the squire, relying for its security
    upon the habitual report of his taking all his plate to town, had not lodged
    at the county bank, because of that natural suspiciousness which might lead
    him to believe more in his own strong room than a banker&rsquo;s?</p>
  <p align="left">Accept this supposition, and the youth&rsquo;s motive was evident.</p>
  <p align="left">Accept young Petleigh&rsquo;s presence in the house under these
    circumstances, and then we have to account for the death.</p>
  <p align="left">Here, of course, I was still at fault.</p>
  <p align="left">If Mrs. Quinion and the girl only were in the house, and the
    girl was innocent, then the housekeeper alone was guilty.</p>
  <p align="left">Guilty&mdash;what of? Murder or manslaughter?</p>
  <p align="left">Had the tale young Petleigh used to read been carried out to
    the end?</p>
  <p align="left">Had he been killed without any knowledge of who he was?</p>
  <p align="left">That I should have discovered the real state of the case without
    Mrs. Lamb&rsquo;s aid I have little doubt, for even that very evening, after
    leaving Mrs. Lamb, and promising to bear in mind the entreaty to  &ldquo;come
    again, you <i>dear</i> dear,&rdquo; my confederate brought me a piece of information
    which must have put me on the track.</p>
  <p align="left">It appeared that morning Mrs. Quinion had received a letter
    which much discomposed her. She went out directly after breakfast, came down
    to the village, and returned in about an hour. My confederate had picked
    the pocket (for, alas! we police officers have sometimes to turn thieves&mdash;for
    the good of society of course) of the housekeeper while she slept that afternoon,
    and while the new maid was supposed to be putting Mrs. Quinion&rsquo;s stockings
    in wearable order and she had made a mental copy of that communication. It
    was from a Joseph Spencer, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">My dear Margaret,&mdash;For God&rsquo;s sake look all over
    the place for key 13. There&rsquo;s such a lot of &rsquo;em I never missed
    it; and if the governor finds it out I&rsquo;m as good as ruined. It must
    be somewhere about. I can&rsquo;t tell how it ever come orf the ring. So
    no more at present. It&rsquo;s post time. With dear love, from your own</p>
  <p align="left">Joseph Spencer.</p>
  <p align="left">Key 13!</p>
  <p align="left">Why, it was the same number as that on the key found on the
    dead man.</p>
  <p align="left">A letter was despatched that night to town, directing the police
    to find out who Joseph Spencer was, and giving the address heading the letter&mdash;a
    printed one.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Green then came into operation.</p>
  <p align="left">No, she could not tell who lived at the address I mentioned.
    Thank the blessed stars <i>she</i> knowed nought o&rsquo; Lunnon. What! Where had
    Mrs. Quinion been that morning? Why, to Joe Higgins&rsquo;s. What for? Why,
    to look at the young squire&rsquo;s clothes and things. What did she want
    with them? Why, she &ldquo;actially&rdquo;  wanted to take &rsquo;em &ldquo;arl
    oop&rdquo; to the Hall. No, Joe Higgins wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course I now surmised that Joseph Spencer was the butler.</p>
  <p align="left">And my information from town showed I was right.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, certain as to my preliminaries, I knew that my work lay
    within the walls of the Hall.</p>
  <p align="left">But how was I to reach that place?</p>
  <p align="left">Alas! the tricks of detective police officers are infinite.
    I am afraid many a kindly-disposed advertisement hides the hoof of detection.
    At all events I know mine did.</p>
  <p align="left">It appeared in the second column of the <i>Times</i>, and here is
    an exact copy of it. By the way, I had received the <i>Times</i> daily, as do most
    detectives, during the time I had been in Tram:&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wanted, to hear of Margaret Quinion, or her heirs-at-law.
    She was known to have left the South of England (that she was a Southener
    I had learnt by her accent) about the year 1830 to become housekeeper to
    a married foster-sister, who settled in a midland county (this information,
    and especially the date, Mrs. Green had to answer for). Address, &mdash;&rdquo; Here
    followed that of my own solicitors, who had their instructions to keep the
    lady hanging about the office several days, and until they heard from me.</p>
  <p align="left">I am very much afraid I intended that should the case appear
    as black against her as I feared it would, she was to be arrested at the
    offices of the gentlemen to whom she was to apply in order to hear of something
    to her advantage. And furthermore, I am quite sure that many an unfortunate
    has been arrested who has been enticed to an office under the promise of
    something to his or her special benefit.</p>
  <p align="left">For of such misrepresentations is this deplorable world.</p>
  <p align="left">When this advertisement came out, the least acute reader is
    already aware of the use I made of it.</p>
  <p align="left">I pointed out the news to Mrs. Green, and I have no doubt she
    digited the intelligence to every soul she met, or rather overtook, in the
    course of the day. And indeed before evening (when I was honoured with a
    visit from Mrs. Quinion herself), it was stated with absolute assurance that
    Mrs. Quinion had come in for a good twenty-two thousand pounds, and a house
    in Dyot Street, Bloomsbury Square, Lunnun.</p>
  <p align="left">It was odd, and yet natural, that Mrs. Quinion should seek
    me out. I was the only stranger with whom she was possibly acquainted in
    the district, and my strangeness to the neighbourhood she had already, from
    her point of view, turned to account. Therefore (human nature considered)
    I did not wonder that she tried to turn me to account again. My space is
    getting contracted, but as the following is the last conversation I had with
    Mrs. Quinion, I may perhaps be pardoned for here quoting it. Of course I
    abridge it very considerably. After the usual salutations, and an assurance
    that Martha suited very fairly, she said,&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have a favour to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed; pray what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have received some news which necessarily takes me
    from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;I know what
    that news is,&rdquo; and I related how I had myself seen the advertisement
    in the morning.</p>
  <p align="left">I am afraid I adopted this course the more readily to attract
    her confidence.</p>
  <p align="left">I succeeded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;then since you have
    identified yourself with that news, I can the more readily ask you the favour
    I am about to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am desirous of going up to town&mdash;to London&mdash;for
    a few hours, to see what this affair of the advertisement means, but I hesitate
    to leave Martha alone in the house. You have started, and perhaps you feel
    offended that I should ask a stranger such a favour, but the fact is, I do
    not care to let any one belonging to the neighbourhood know that I have left
    the Hall&mdash;it will be for only twenty-four hours. The news might reach
    Mr. Petleigh&rsquo;s ears, and I desire that he should hear nothing about
    it. You see the position in which I am placed. If, my dear lady, you can
    oblige me I shall be most grateful; and, as you are staying here, it seemed&mdash;to&mdash;me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here she trailed off into silence.</p>
  <p align="left">The cunning creature! How well she hid her real motive&mdash;the
    desire to keep those who knew of the catastrophe out of the Hall, because
    she feared their curiosity.</p>
  <p align="left">Started! Yes, indeed I had started. At best I had expected
    that I should have to divulge who I was to the person whom she would leave
    in the place did the advertisement take, and here by the act of what she
    thought was her forethought, she was actually placing herself at my mercy,
    while I still remained screened in all my actions referring to her. For I
    need not say that had I had to declare who I was, and had I failed, all further
    slow-trapping in this affair would have been at an end&mdash;the &ldquo;game&rdquo; would
    have taken the alarm, and there would have been an end to the business.</p>
  <p align="left">To curtail here needless particulars, that same evening at
    nine I was installed in the housekeeper&rsquo;s parlour, and she had set
    out for the first station past Tram, to which she was going to walk across
    the fields in order to avoid all suspicion.</p>
  <p align="left">She had not got a hundred yards away from the house, before
    I had turned up my cuffs, and I and Martha, (a couple of detectives,) were
    hard at work, trying to find that box.</p>
  <p align="left">Her keys we soon found, in a work-basket, and lightly covered
    with a handkerchief.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, this mode of hiding should have given me a clue.</p>
  <p align="left">But it did not.</p>
  <p align="left">For three hours&mdash;from nine till midnight, we hunted for
    that box, and unsuccessfully.</p>
  <p align="left">In every room that, from the absence of certain dusty evidences,
    we knew must have been recently opened&mdash;in every passage, cellar, corridor,
    and hall we hunted.</p>
  <p align="left">No box.</p>
  <p align="left">I am afraid that we even looked in places where it could not
    have gone&mdash;such as under beds.</p>
  <p align="left">But we found it at last, and then the turret-clock had gone
    twelve about a quarter of an hour.</p>
  <p align="left">It was in her bedroom; and what is more, it formed her dressing-table.</p>
  <p align="left">And I have no doubt I should have missed it had it not been
    that she had been imperfect in her concealment.</p>
  <p align="left">Apparently she comprehended the value of what I may call &ldquo;audacity
    hiding&rdquo;&mdash;that is, such concealment that an ordinary person searching
    would never dream of looking for the object where it was to be found.</p>
  <p align="left">For instance, the safest hiding-place in a drawing-room for
    a bank note, would be the bottom of a looselyfined card-basket. Nobody would
    dream of looking for it in such a place.</p>
  <p align="left">The great enigma-novelist, Edgar Poe, illustrates this style
    of concealment where he makes the holder of a letter place it in a card-rack
    over the mantelpiece, when he knows his house will be ransacked, and every
    inch of it gone over to find the document.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs. Quinion was evidently acquainted with this mode of concealment.</p>
  <p align="left">Indeed, I believe I should not have found the box had it not
    been that she had overdone her unconcealed-concealment. For she had used
    a bright pink slip with a white flounce over it to complete the appearance
    of a dressing-table, having set the box up on one side.</p>
  <p align="left">And therefore the table attracted my notice each time I passed
    and saw it. As it was Martha, in passing between me and the box, swept the
    drapery away with her petticoats, and showed a <i>black corner</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">The next moment the box was discovered.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no doubt that being a strong-minded woman she could
    not endure to have the box out of her sight while waiting for an opportunity
    to get rid of it.</p>
  <p align="left">It was now evident that my explanation of the case, to the
    effect that young Petleigh had been imitating the action of the tale, was
    correct.</p>
  <p align="left">The box was quite large enough to contain a man lying with
    his legs somewhat up; there was room to turn in the box; and, finally, there
    were about two dozen holes round the box, about the size of a crown piece,
    and which were hidden by the coarse black canvas with which the box was covered.</p>
  <p align="left">Furthermore, the box was closeable from within by means of
    a bolt, and therefore openable from within by the same means.</p>
  <p align="left">Furthermore, if any further evidence were wanting, there was
    a pillow at the bottom of the box (obviously for the head to rest on), and
    from a hole the feathers had escaped over the bottom of the box, which was
    lined with black and white striped linen bed-tick, this material being cut
    away from the holes.</p>
  <p align="left">I was now at no loss to comprehend the fluff upon the unhappy
    young man&rsquo;s coat.</p>
  <p align="left">And, finally, there was the most damnifying evidence of all.</p>
  <p align="left">For in the black canvas over one of the holes <i>there was
    a jagged cut</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lie down; Martha,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in the box,
    with your head at this end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, whatever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tut&mdash;tut,&mdash;girl; do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She did; and using the stick of a parasol which lay on the
    dressing-table, I found that by passing it through the hole its end reached
    the officer in exactly the region by a wound in which young Mr. Petleigh
    had been killed.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course the case was now clear.</p>
  <p align="left">After the young woman, Dinah, had gone to bed, the housekeeper
    must have had her doubts about the chest, and have inspected it.</p>
  <p align="left">Beyond all question, the young man knew the hour at which the
    housekeeper retired, and was waiting perhaps for eleven o&rsquo;clock to
    strike by the old turret clock before he ventured out&mdash;to commit what?</p>
  <p align="left">It appeared to me clear, bearing in mind the butler&rsquo;s
    letter, to rob the plate-chest No. 13, which I inferred had been left behind,
    a fact of which the young fellow might naturally be aware.</p>
  <p align="left">The plan doubtless was to secure the plate without any alarm,
    to let himself out of the Hall by some mode long-since well-known to him,
    and then to meet his confederates, and share with them the plunder, leaving
    the chest to tell the tale of the robbery, and to exculpate the housekeeper.</p>
  <p align="left">It struck me as a well-executed scheme, and one far beyond
    the ordinary run of robbery plots.</p>
  <p align="left">What had caused that scheme to fail?</p>
  <p align="left">I could readily comprehend that a strong-minded woman like
    Quinion would rely rather upon her own than any other assistance.</p>
  <p align="left">I could comprehend her discovery; perhaps a lowmuttered blasphemy
    on the part of the young man; or may be she may have heard his breathing.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, following out her action, I could readily suppose that
    once aware of the danger near her she would prepare to meet it.</p>
  <p align="left">I could follow her, silent and self-possessed, in the hall,
    asking herself what she should do.</p>
  <p align="left">I could mark her coming to the conclusion that there must be
    holes in the box through which the evildoer could breathe, and I apprehended
    readily enough that she had little need to persuade herself that she had
    a right to kill one who might be there to kill her.</p>
  <p align="left">Then in my mind&rsquo;s eye I could follow her seeking the
    weapon, and feeling all about the box for a hole.</p>
  <p align="left">She finds it.</p>
  <p align="left">She fixes the point for a thrust.</p>
  <p align="left">A movement&mdash;and the manslaughter is committed.</p>
  <p align="left">That the unhappy wretch had time to open the box is certain,
    and doubtless it was at that moment the fierce woman, still clutching the
    shaft of the arrow, or barb&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;leant back,
    and so withdrew the shaft from the rankling iron.</p>
  <p align="left">Did the youth recognise her? Had he tried to do so?</p>
  <p align="left">From the peacefulness of the face, as described at the inquest,
    I imagined that he had, after naturally unbolting the lid, fallen back, and
    in a few moments died.</p>
  <p align="left">Then must have followed her awful discovery, succeeded by her
    equally awful determination to hide the fault of her master&rsquo;s, and
    perhaps of her own sister&rsquo;s son.</p>
  <p align="left">And so it came to pass that she dragged the youth&rsquo;s dead
    body out into the cold morning atmosphere, as the bleak dawn was filling
    the air, and the birds were fretfully awaking.</p>
  <p align="left">No doubt, had a sharp detective been at once employed, she
    would not have escaped detection.</p>
  <p align="left">As it was she had so far avoided discovery.</p>
  <p align="left">And I could easily comprehend that a powerfully-brained woman
    like herself would feel no compunction and little grief for what she had
    done&mdash;no compunction, because the act was an accident; little grief,
    because she must have felt she had saved the youth from a life of misery&mdash;for
    a son who at twenty robs a father, however bad, is rarely at forty, if he
    lives so long, an honest man.</p>
  <p align="left">But though I had made this discovery I could do nothing so
    far against the housekeeper, whom of course it was my duty to arrest, if
    I could convince myself she had committed manslaughter. I was not to be ruled
    by any feeling of screening the family&mdash;the motive indirectly which
    had actuated Quinion, for, strong-minded as she was, it appeared to me that
    she would not have hesitated to admit the commission of the act which she
    had completed had the burglar, as I may call the young man, been an ordinary
    felon, and unknown to her.</p>
  <p align="left">No, the box had no identification with the death, because it
    exhibited no unanswerable signs of its connexion with that catastrophe.</p>
  <p align="left">So far, how was it identifiable (beyond my own circumstantial
    evidence, known only to myself,) with the murder?</p>
  <p align="left">The only particle of evidence was that given by the girl, who
    could or could not swear to the box having been brought on the previous day,
    and to the housekeeper saying that it had been taken away again&mdash;a suspicious
    circumstance certainly, but one which, without corroborative evidence, was
    of little or indeed no value.</p>
  <p align="left">As to the jagged cut in the air-hole, in the absence of all
    blood-stain it was not mentionable.</p>
  <p align="left">Corroborative evidence I must have, and that corroborative
    evidence would best take the shape of the discovery of the shaft of the weapon
    which had caused death, or a weapon of similar character.</p>
  <p align="left">This, the box being found, was now my work.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is there any armoury in the house, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No; but there&rsquo;s lots of arms in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">We had not searched in the library for the box, because I had
    taken Martha&rsquo;s assurance that no boxes were there.</p>
  <p align="left">When we reached the place, I remarked immediately&mdash;&ldquo;What
    a damp place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As I said so I observed that there were windows on each side
    of the room, and that the end of the chamber was circular.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well it may be,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s
    water all round it&mdash;a kind of fountain-pond, with gold fish in it. The
    library,&rdquo;  continued Martha, who was more sharp than educated, &ldquo;butts
    out of the house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Between each couple of book-cases there was fixed a handsome
    stand of arms, very picturesque and taking to the eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">There were modern arms, antique armour, and foreign arms of
    many kinds; but I saw no arrows, though in the eagerness of my search I had
    the chandelier, which still held some old yellow wax-candles, lighted up.</p>
  <p align="left">No arrow.</p>
  <p align="left">But my guardian angel, if there be such good creatures, held
    tight on to my shoulder that night, and by a strange chance, yet not a tithe
    so wonderful as that accident by which the woman was saved from a bullet
    by a piece of just stolen iron, the origin of the weapon used by Quinion
    came to light.</p>
  <p align="left">We had been searching amongst the stands of arms for some minutes,
    when I had occasion suddenly to cry&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hu-u-sh! what are you about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For my confederate had knocked off its hook a large drum, which
    I had noticed very coquettishly finished off a group of flags, and cymbals,
    and pikes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; she said, as I ran to pick
    up the still reverberating drum with that caution which, even when useless,
    generally stands by the detective, when&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">There, sticking through the drum, and hooked by its barbs,
    was the point of such a weapon&mdash;the exact counterpart&mdash;as had been
    used to kill young Petleigh.</p>
  <p align="left">Had a ghost, were there such a thing, appeared I had not been
    more astounded.</p>
  <p align="left">The drum was ripped open in a moment, and there came to light
    an iron arrow with a wooden shaft about eighteen inches long, this shaft
    being gaily covered with bits of tinsel and coloured paper.</p>
  <p align="left">[I may here at once state, what I ultimately found out&mdash;for
    in spite of our danger I kept hold of my prize and brought it out of battle
    with me&mdash;that this barb was one of such as are used by picadors in Spanish
    bull-fights for exciting the bull. The barbs cause the darts to stick in
    the flesh and skin. The cause of the decoration of the haft can now readily
    be comprehended. Beyond all doubt the arrow used by Quinion and the one found
    by me were a couple placed as curiosities amongst the other arms. The remaining
    one the determined housekeeper had used as suiting best her purpose, the
    other (which I found) had doubtless at some past time been used by an amateur
    picador, perhaps the poor dead youth himself, with the drum for an imaginary
    bull, and within it the dart had remained till it was to reappear as a witness
    against the guilty and yet guiltless housekeeper.]</p>
  <p align="left">I had barely grasped my prize when Martha said&mdash;&ldquo;What
    a smell of burning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;we have set the house
    on fire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The house was on fire, but we were not to blame.</p>
  <p align="left">We ran to the door.</p>
  <p align="left">We were locked in!</p>
  <p align="left">What brought her back I never learnt, for I never saw or heard
    of her again. I guess that the motion of the train quickened her thought
    (it does mine), that she suspected&mdash;that she got out at the station
    some distance from Tram, and that she took a post-chaise back to Petleighcote.</p>
  <p align="left">All this, however, is conjecture.</p>
  <p align="left">But if not she, who locked us in? We could not have done it
    ourselves.</p>
  <p align="left">We were locked in, and I attribute the act to her&mdash;though
    how she entered the house I never learnt.</p>
  <p align="left">The house was on fire, and we were surrounded by water.</p>
  <p align="left">This tale is the story of the &ldquo;Unknown Weapon,&rdquo;  and
    therefore I cannot logically here go into any full explanation of our escape.
    Suffice it to our honour as detectives to say, that we did not lose our presence
    of mind, and that by the aid of the library tables, chairs, big books,  &amp;c.,
    we made a point of support on one side the narrow pond for the library ladder
    to rest on, while the other end reached shallow water.</p>
  <p align="left">Having made known the history of the &ldquo;Unknown Weapon,&rdquo; my
    tale is done; but my reader might fancy my work incomplete did I not add
    a few more words.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no doubt that Quinion returning, her quick mind in but
    a few moments came to the conclusion that the only way to save her master&rsquo;s
    honour was the burning of the box by the incendiarism of the Hall.</p>
  <p align="left">The Petleighs were an old family, I learnt, with almost Spanish
    notions of family honour.</p>
  <p align="left">Effectually did she complete her work.</p>
  <p align="left">I acknowledge she conquered me. She might have burnt the same
    person to a cinder into the bargain; and, upon my word, I think she would
    have grieved little had she achieved that purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">For my part in the matter&mdash;I carried it no further.</p>
  <p align="left">At the inquiry, I appeared as the lady who had taken care of
    the house while Mrs. Quinion went to look after her good fortune; and I have
    no doubt her disappearance was unendingly connected with my advertisement
    in the <i>Times</i>.</p>
  <p align="left">I need not say that had I found Quinion I would have done my
    best to make her tremble.</p>
  <p align="left">I have only one more fact to relate&mdash;and it is an important
    one. It is this&mdash;</p>
  <p align="left">The squire had the ruins carefully examined, and two thousand
    ounces of gold and silver plate, melted into shapelessness of course, were
    taken out of the rubbish.</p>
  <p align="left">From this fact it is pretty evident that the key No. 13, found
    upon the poor, unhappy, ill-bred, and neglected boy, was the  &ldquo;Open
    Sesam&egrave;&rdquo; to the treasure which was afterwards taken from the
    ruins&mdash;perhaps worth &pound;4000, gold and silver together.</p>
  <p align="left">Beyond question he had stolen the key from the butler, gone
    into a plot with his confederates&mdash;and the whole had resulted in his
    death and the conflagration of Petleighcote, one of the oldest, most picturesque,
    and it must be admitted dampest seats in the midland counties.</p>
  <p align="left">And, indeed, I may add that I found out who was the &ldquo;tall
    gentleman with the auburn whiskers and the twitching of the face;&rdquo; I
    discovered who was the short gentleman with no whiskers at all; and finally
    I have seen the young lady (she was very beautiful) called Frederica, and
    for whose innocent sake I have no doubt the unhappy young man acted as he
    did.</p>
  <p align="left">As for me, I carried the case no further.</p>
  <p align="left">I had no desire to do so&mdash;had I had, I doubt if I possessed
    any further evidence than would have sufficed to bring me into ridicule.</p>
  <p align="left">I left the case where it stood.</p>
