  My Great Electioneering Trick</b></h2>
  <p>ABOUT twelve years ago there was an election anticipated in the Borough
  of N&mdash;. It was a notorious place for bribery, as I, who have been professionally
  concerned in many elections, perfectly well knew. It was an extraordinary
  town. It had once been a very flourishing place. A staple trade had been
  carried on there, and almost nowhere else; but an evil spirit of gentility
  pervaded its corporation in those days.</p>
  <p>The genius of two or three well-known men would have taken advantage of
  the neutral position and prospects of that spot and its neighbourhood to
  found there a new industry, and give employment to an immense population
  of skilled artisans. The labour of these people, however, could only be set
  to work and supplemented by smoke. The mayor and town-council of N&mdash;,
  acting in the supposed interest of its inhabitants, determined they would
  have no smoky chimneys within their town. An Act of Parliament had been obtained
  sanctioning such municipal regulations as enabled these wiseacres to keep
  out the threatened innovation of gold-producing smoke. The new industry had,
  therefore, to settle down in the neighbourhood beyond municipal control.
  After this achievement had been successful, the surrounding district went
  on rapidly increasing in prosperity until it reached its present exalted
  position in that respect, and the trade of N&mdash; went on diminishing to
  its present abject or exhausted condition. Meanwhile, also, the stage-coaches,
  which ran continuously through its streets&mdash;for N&mdash; was on the
  great northern line of turnpike-road&mdash;dropping in their course a modicum
  of wealth for the inhabitants, were themselves put down by the unequal competition
  of a trunk railway; so that N&mdash; became in course of time what it now
  is&mdash;a clean, shabby, pretentious, and poverty-stricken place. Stagnation
  amid activity distinguishes it. The grass grows in its High Street and Market-place.
  The remnant of independent people&mdash;that is, people who have a pecuniary
  independence&mdash;show airs, and walk about the neighbourhood under the
  belief that they are thought to be and are superior beings. The inhabitants
  who are not in this sense independent are craven, humiliated, impoverished,
  and corrupt. Yet N&mdash; is a parliamentary borough; and, consequently,
  its present dilapidated, forlorn position supplies a fine opportunity for
  adventurous politicians&mdash;whether with or without brains, no matter&mdash;who
  have heavy purses, skilful agents, and good machinery at their command.</p>
  <p>Before I describe the special incidents of the case I am about to lay before
  the reader, let me supply some further particulars about the electoral conscience
  of this extraordinary old town. It has three classes of voters, who have
  been classified by a well-known Conservative electioneering agent (an attorney
  residing there); and a similar, or rather obverse, classification has no
  doubt been made by the other side. In the first list or classification are
  the really true and honest electors, men who would resent as an insult the
  offered bribe, sterling, worthy fellows, who would resist almost, or perhaps
  quite, to the death any attempt to coerce them to vote otherwise than as
  their consciences directed.</p>
  <p>There is another list or classification of men who are inclined towards
  Conservatism (as, perhaps, some sardonic reader will suggest, every body
  in an old place like N&mdash; ought to be); and these men will take half
  as much from the real supporter of our venerable institutions as they can
  get from some mushroom pursy adventurer professing ultra-Radical principles,
  who desires to make a market of his political influence, or is perhaps anxious
  to satisfy the cravings for distinction of his wife by getting himself as
  her marital adjunct returned to Parliament, and privileged to wear M.P. after
  his name.</p>
  <p>The third list or classification embraces those electors who have no political
  principles, or character, or conscience whatever. These are fellows who want
  as much from Conservative as from Radical or from Whig. They are the scum
  and refuse, or dregs, of political life; and this foul element of the political
  existence at N&mdash; is by no means the smaller portion of the three classifications.</p>
  <p>The operator, or agent, as he likes to be called,&mdash;although, as police-magistrates
  and all other people dealing with crime are aware, the title &ldquo;agent&rdquo; is
  complimentary,&mdash;knows precisely with what material he has to deal. He &ldquo;plays
  his cards,&rdquo; as he sometimes describes his anxious labours, accordingly;
  and is only liable to one derangement. It is said that honesty and good faith
  towards one another is characteristic of thief-life. I have, in a former
  volume, shown that notion to be a fallacy. Politicians supply an additional
  proof of the accuracy of my statement.</p>
  <p>When the operator or agent has&mdash;say, two days before the election&mdash;made
  all his arrangements for voting, and feels quite confident that, as the representative
  of Mr. Heavy Purse, his candidate,&mdash;a gentleman who rejoices in a retiring
  forehead, thick neck, small brain, a little talker and smaller doer, who
  has no political character, principle, sentiment, or notion whatever,&mdash;he
  has made it all right by virtue of the money already dropped, and the vastly
  larger amount promised, he goes to sleep in his downy, well-curtained bed
  at the Dodo, charged to the brim with rosy wine and deep spiritual potations,
  only to be awakened in the morning by a vigilant subordinate, who informs
  him that shortly before the witching hour over night there came into N&mdash; a
  post-chaise or a &ldquo;trap&rdquo; with four horses, which did not seem
  fatigued by the length of their journey, for they had only come from Z&mdash;,
  but were the drawers of a load on the floor of the carriage, which hindered
  their movement and might have sacrificed their character for speed. The operator
  or agent knows that some wealthy political speculator has arrived with a
  good round sum in golden sovereigns. He does not think the affair so cleverly
  planned as it might have been, and would seem to have been on the first blush,
  but still he is a little tremulous, because he knows that the problem of
  success may be most easily resolved by the hand which can ply the largest,
  or heaviest, golden solvent. He knows that the magic of gold nowhere exercises
  a more potent influence over the soul than at N&mdash;; and he would already
  feel inclined to give up the contest if he could be sure that the new arrival
  had a large preponderance of gold over his own man. Notwithstanding the fact
  that he thinks his candidate a superior man, and one that the constituency,
  if it could be made honest, would be sure to like; and notwithstanding, also,
  that he has had the start of three weeks in canvassing, and got the promises
  of a considerable majority of electors over the comparatively needy Liberal
  candidate, who has been hitherto opposed to Mr. Heavy Purse,&mdash;the third
  arrival disquiets the operator.</p>
  <p>One other remarkable fact I discovered in this town. I hope the reader will
  not be startled by it. I relate it as a truth. I state it as an undeniable
  proposition. I am open to be convinced if I am wrong; but if I am right it
  is a thing to be laid before Parliament, as a great argument in favour of
  something or against something else. Every fact surely leads up to an inference.
  Every truth has a moral. This fact I commend to all whom it doth concern,
  and I declare it. It is this: the representation of N&mdash; is usually determined
  by the brothel-keepers of the town. All the men who ever sat for that borough
  since the Reform Bill passed have been returned by these despicable human
  creatures, who derive means of sustaining their own existence out of the
  most loathsome, although we are told incurable, evil. How do I prove my fact
  and moral? the reader asks. Thus: when all the really honest electors have
  been polled, the operators or agents exhaust the comparatively decent section
  of the bribable part of the town, and the result of the whole gives to the
  Conservative, it may be, a majority of four, or it may be a majority to the
  Liberal of four, or it may be five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or eleven,&mdash;according
  to circumstances. We may suppose this to be late in the day. But there are
  still from twenty-three to twenty-five of the morally unclean ten-pound householders
  or burgesses in a particular street of N&mdash;, who regularly pay their
  rates and taxes within the date prescribed for exclusion from the register,
  and who are, therefore, duly-qualified voters. Neither Liberal nor Conservative
  will lose an election if he can help it. In the emergency of the time I speak
  of, the Liberal, finding himself in a minority of four, goes into Stew Street
  and buys up the twenty-three, four, or five occupiers of these leprosy-distilling
  houses, and pays any price the occupiers think fit to demand. They are taken
  up to poll like free, independent, honest, and moral electors. They turn
  the scale. They return the member. All the rest has been a farce. Printing
  the addresses of rival candidates, engaging committee-rooms, every thing
  in the way of machinery or principle, up to the visit of the operator or
  agent in Stew Street, has been useless. I hate shams. I detest mockeries.
  Why not leave Stew Street to return the gentleman or blackguard who is to
  be called M.P. for N&mdash;?</p>
  <p>Apropos to this, or by way of postscript to my moralising, let me inform
  the reader that a cabinet minister has been returned for N&mdash;, and that,
  beyond all earthly doubt, Stew Street alone, or its voters, and the cabinet
  minister&rsquo;s money, returned him to Parliament in the way I have pointed
  out.</p>
  <p>Well, as I have told the reader already, I saw the opportunity for getting
  an engagement, so I went to somebody, who put himself into communication
  with somebody else&mdash;this gentleman, who for the present may be called
  Mr. Somebodyelse, having made a fortune in trade, and having a wife who had
  persuaded him that he was a remarkably clever fellow, and that he ought to
  go into Parliament.</p>
  <p>Mr. Somebodyelse had no political principles. He had himself always voted,
  as an elector, just in the way that his largest customer had recommended;
  which largest customer, as if events happened by chance, had always been
  a Liberal. Somehow or other, Mrs. Somebodyelse got into her feminine head
  that her spouse had herein gone on the wrong tack; that it was &ldquo;not
  respectable&rdquo; to be a Liberal; that the &ldquo;highly genteel thing&rdquo; was
  to stand by the Tories; and she therefore determined that, whenever her spouse
  went into Parliament, he should be a stanch Conservative: to which he, like
  a fond husband, said, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; This did not much matter to me.
  Mr. Somebodyelse would do for N&mdash; and for me as well as any other man.
  I was not careful about political opinions, and therefore made no hesitation
  about rendering my services to him.</p>
  <p>It is always desirable to go through the usual forms. Occasionally, forms
  useless in themselves are made essential by custom. A man who could write
  was therefore employed to write an Address for our candidate, and one or
  two fellows were also engaged to &ldquo;cram&rdquo; or &ldquo;coach&rdquo; him
  with speeches that he was to re-deliver. They were not very fine speeches.
  The oratory was, in my opinion, gassy, flowery, nonsensical; or, as the great
  Mr. Barnum would say, and I shall take the liberty of saying, they were &ldquo;humbugeous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went down from London direct to the borough. The party consisted of myself,
  my associate (who was the agent), an attorney, and the candidate, whose name,
  address, and quality I had now ascertained. The reader may now know this
  gentleman as Mr. Jollefat, a retired tallow-melter or chandler, then residing
  at Melpomene Lodge, Clapham, and supposed to be a sleeping partner of &ldquo;the
  old house&rdquo; in which he had skimmed the cauldrons of boiling tallow
  admirably for more than thirty years.</p>
  <p>On our arrival, we put out the address of our candidate. We started a personal
  canvass. We did all that was usual except bribe&mdash;and the time had hardly
  come for that&mdash;but all that we did only served to discourage every body
  but me.</p>
  <p>My associate had told his candidate that he thought a couple of thousand
  pounds or thereabouts would do, whereas I had told <i>him</i> it would cost
  five thousand pounds at least, but that he ought to be prepared with seven
  or eight thousand if he really meant to go in and win. At N&mdash; the candidate
  got to learn there was no chance for him with two or even three thousand
  pounds. He was chapfallen, and telegraphed to his wife, who came down in
  a sumptuous anonymity, which, to our annoyance, had more effect than the
  simple announcement of her name and her relationship to the candidate would
  have had.</p>
  <p>This lady, unlike the wife of Sir Baldpate Belly, under the like circumstances,
  became presumptuous and impracticable. She said she thought that three thousand &ldquo;goolden
  suvrins was a wery enormus sum.&rdquo; It cost her good man a wery long time
  to make that &rsquo;ere sum of money; and although she did not mind his spending
  his money like a Briton or a prime-minister, she said she thought three thousand
  pounds ought to satisfy every body, and if it didn&rsquo;t, why, she wouldn&rsquo;t
  go no further, and they might do as they could.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Jollefat also said that she liked to see her way sure before she began.
  If it could not be done for that price certain, why, she&rsquo;d rather not
  try it on at all. Three thousand &ldquo;goolden suvrins,&rdquo; as she often
  said, was a wery big sum of money, and it was not to be tossed into the Thames.
  That is what they would say in London, and she meant it was not to be made
  ducks and drakes on.</p>
  <p>I was a little astonished, more especially when my associate boldly told
  her that, upon his honour, he would do it for the money. Of course I could
  not there and then contradict him, and in effect say he was a jolly humbug
  to let in a thrifty woman and her spouse in such a mode, so I held my peace
  until I got him alone. Then I protested. He replied, &ldquo;Oh, gammon! make
  the old boy and girl spend. They won&rsquo;t do any good with their money
  if they don&rsquo;t drop it here; and, after all, rely upon it, I will make
  them shell out three or five thousand pounds more if it is wanted.&rdquo; I
  argued and expostulated; my associate was firm. He said, &ldquo;We have gone
  too far into the matter to go back. We shall both of us be ruined in our
  professions if we run away from the stake. I say, that we must go in and
  win, and make the old boy pay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I have heard it said that &ldquo;Necessity is the mother of invention.&rdquo; I
  believe the proverb is familiar to most of my readers. I am going to supply
  another illustration of it.</p>
  <p>I was oppressed in conscience about Mr. and Mrs. Jollefat and their purse
  for the rest of the day. I felt that we must go in and win, or we must not
  go in at all, but must run away. Then my associate and partner would stick
  by the candidate, and perhaps really succeed in doing as he said must be
  done&mdash;that was, gladden the hearts of the candidate and his wife by
  a triumph at the poll, and get the requisite amount of money to pay him for
  the operation. About the former part of the business I was not at all certain;
  but if, on the other hand, he failed, which was more likely, could I rid
  myself from the responsibility by merely withdrawing at the present stage
  of affairs? I resolved to go on, and make the best use of the little legal
  knowledge I had obtained, so as to keep out of harm&rsquo;s way. I was ultimately
  able to devise what I then thought, and still think, my greatest Electioneering
  Trick.</p>
  <p>I took a stroll, in order to collect my thoughts; and after cudgelling my
  brain for an hour or two, hit upon the following expedient, which I carried
  out in the manner described.</p>
  <p>I hastened to London by a midnight train, took a cab from the Euston Station,
  and knocked up a clever fellow in my own line of business, who was instructed
  by me, and who acted under my direction to the letter and spirit, so that
  the <i>ruse</i> was, as the reader will see, entirely successful. As far
  as I could, of course, I directly superintended the details of my scheme.</p>
  <p>Residing in the neighbourhood of Soho was a man of considerable ability,
  who, as I was informed, and have now good reasons for believing, could talk
  and write with great ease and facility. What his political principles were
  I do not know, nor did I then care about any more than he did himself. He
  was ready to accept the engagement which I offered him. For a price he agreed
  to become a third candidate for the representation of N&mdash;.</p>
  <p>My man&mdash;the new candidate&mdash;and I, after quitting the lodgings
  of the former, went to an adjacent hostelry, where, having secured a private
  room, and called for pens, ink, and paper, cigars, and a bottle of wine,
  we concocted an address to &ldquo;the free and independent electors&rdquo; of
  the borough we were to humbug. This was taken to a printer, who, for a little
  more than ordinary pay, got it into type, and printed off five hundred copies
  within three hours.</p>
  <p>We next paid a visit to the shop of a well-known clothes-dealer not far
  off, whose name has a flavour of Hebrew in its orthography, where our candidate
  got rigged out in admirable style; although at an expense, I think even now,
  a little extravagant. When thus costumed in the habit of a gentleman, he
  really looked such; and with the influence of external prosperity, and, I
  suppose, the magic of twenty sovereigns in his pocket (such a sum as he had
  not been in the enjoyment of, I fancy, for a very long while), all the traces
  of want and dissipation left his countenance. He talked with additional volubility,
  and became so eloquent, that I really thought it a pity he was not the real
  instead of the sham aspirant for senatorial dignity.</p>
  <p>I plead guilty to a passing idea which then possessed me, and suggested
  an odious comparison. I thought he would have fitted the character of M.P.
  much better than our candidate Mr. Jollefat, whose jackal or provider he
  really was.</p>
  <p>I next took our party to a restaurant in Regent Street, where I called for,
  and paid for, a sumptuous dinner.</p>
  <p>Over our wine suggestion and plot developed themselves grandly. I became
  indebted for many valuable hints to my new chum and his clever friend. We
  smoked, and chatted, and afterwards strolled in St. James&rsquo;s Park until
  the time began to arrive for our leaving Town.</p>
  <p>One other call had to be made at a trunk-maker&rsquo;s for two or three
  goodly portmanteaus, which, although expense was not of much importance,
  I preferred to have second-hand, as I thought shabbiness, or at least a soiled
  appearance, would look better, as an accessory to the scheme or great trick
  we had already begun to play out.</p>
  <p>I should also tell the reader that I promised &ldquo;the popular candidate&rdquo; in
  embryo a bonus of fifty pounds if he played his part skilfully, and kept
  good faith; but I gave him no security beyond my word (from which I never
  departed in my life) for the fulfilment of my part of the contract. Neither
  of us had then, or thereafter, to regret the manner in which it was executed
  and paid for.</p>
  <p>The portmanteaus were stocked from an outfitter&rsquo;s, a hosier&rsquo;s,
  a perfumer&rsquo;s, and other tradesmen.</p>
  <p>We also purchased a large, heavy, wooden box from a dealer in antiquities.
  It had huge steel clasps, and a ponderous lock. It looked like a thing designed
  for the keeping of treasure, and a thing customarily so employed. We filled
  this box.</p>
  <p>We then went to the printer&rsquo;s, where the copies of the placard we
  had ordered, and of which we had not thought it necessary to see a proof,
  were all worked off; and it looked, in clear bold type, fascinating to the
  eye of each of us, but most charming of all it perhaps seemed to the man
  who embodied most of its unreality.</p>
  <p>It is astonishing how many excellent devices, and how many grand projects
  and schemes of lofty usefulness, are marred by inattention to detail, or
  it may be the want of a single but essential ingredient. This was nearly
  the case on the present occasion. My Great Electioneering Trick had almost
  failed from an oversight in its initiation. We had, up to this moment, retained
  no lawyer or attorney,&mdash;a most essential feature of such a plot as that
  we had engaged in. This omission was discovered by me just in time to be
  filled up. We heard of an attorney&mdash;a low sort of fellow, I believe&mdash;who
  lived in the neighbourhood. I hired him, and sent him down with the other
  two to the borough of N&mdash; that night.</p>
  <p>I parted company with my friends at the Euston Station. They proceeded a
  little more than a hundred miles to the populous town of H&mdash; by railway,
  and there alighted. From this point the journey was performed in a lumbering
  post-chaise, as I had desired my party not on any account to arrive at the
  town of N&mdash; before twelve o&rsquo;clock at night. I preferred that it
  should be a little after one in the morning, and I suggested they might as
  well get up a little sensation on their arrival. This I told them might easily
  be done, by a pretended anxiety to keep their arrival dark and quiet.</p>
  <p>My instructions herein were obeyed, as I afterwards ascertained, with unerring
  exactness.</p>
  <p>There was, at a very short distance on the outside of the town, a toll-bar,
  always locked at night, and the keeper of which was not renowned for his
  vigilance or wakefulness. The party found a trifle of real difficulty in
  gaining admission to the borough. It was some time before the man at the
  toll-house, rubbing his eyes, opened his little wicket, and came forth to
  unlock the gate. As he did so, he was startled by the sight of a vehicle
  with three persons in it, and heavily laden.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s sagacity penetrated, as he thought, the whole secret. He
  winked, and nodded, and grinned significantly. He saw in one of the party
  another candidate for the franchise of the free and independent electors;
  and in the other two his agents. His acute vision dived through the keyhole
  of that box, and there beheld a weight of gold, which he defined, in conversation
  next day, as &ldquo;such a sight as he never saw in his life before even
  at an election.&rdquo; My man kept up the delusion well, by throwing two
  half-crowns to the fellow; and each of his companions tossed a handful of
  small coin at him, as he closed the gate after them.</p>
  <p>Away rolled, at a slow pace, the heavily-laden vehicle, the horses throbbing
  and panting, and the riders chuckling to their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
  <p>At length the town of N&mdash; was reached. As quietly and mysteriously
  as possible the vehicle was driven by the strangers, its occupants, up to
  the hotel of our opponent; and, after ringing the bell, refusing to accept
  the servants&rsquo; answer, and insisting upon awakening the host, my man
  tried to strike a bargain with the hotel-keeper (putting him under confidence)
  to let his house as the central committee-room of the &ldquo;independent
  candidate.&rdquo; Boniface was proof against temptation. He had let his house
  to Mr. Sallow Twitch, the Whig candidate, and he was &ldquo;not a-going to
  break his engagement&mdash;not he.&rdquo; He never had done such a thing
  in his life, and never would. They must go elsewhere, he said; and the interview
  was closed by the irate landlord sheering off to bed, telling them he didn&rsquo;t
  want to have no more to do with them.</p>
  <p>Next the party went to the hotel where Mr. Jollefat was staying, and in
  which he held his quarters. A similar interview with Mr. Bung, at that establishment,
  ended not unlike the conference with Mr. Boniface.</p>
  <p>At last a solitary medieval-looking policeman was observed torpidly creeping
  along the Market-place, and for a consideration he undertook, in the first
  place, to find the best quarters now available, and in the second to keep
  the arrival of his patrons as quiet and as solemn as death.</p>
  <p>It was unfortunate, he said, that they had come into the town so late, because
  the other parties had been in the field so long, and had got the regular
  start of them. However, there was a tidyish sort of a place, which had always
  been the head-quarters of a third candidate; and, for his own part, he did
  not think it much mattered, if the candidate was &ldquo;a regular gentleman,&rdquo; which
  house he put up at. This shrewd policeman thought it would be all the same,
  if the candidate had about him friends who knew their business.</p>
  <p>The policeman&rsquo;s advice was taken in the selection of a central committee-room,&mdash;the
  Green Swan with Two Tails, which, let me confess and regret, was a comparatively
  humble place for head-quarters. I should have very much preferred the first
  hotel in the town; and if that had been possible, I would have yielded up
  the place in which Mr. Jollefat was enthroned. However, as the sequel will
  show, this matter did not influence the success of the <i>coup</i>.</p>
  <p>Without further loss of time&mdash;that is to say, early next morning&mdash;my
  man went to work. The first person to whom, as the agent of the independent
  candidate, he paid his addresses, was not the mayor of the town, nor the
  town-clerk, nor an alderman, nor a town-councillor, but he was&mdash;a bill-sticker.</p>
  <p>There consequently appeared upon the walls an address, which ran as follows:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;<i>To the Free and Independent Electors of the
  Borough of N&mdash;.</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&mdash;Your borough has too often been
      the arena of faction fights. You have been regarded as the supporters of
      Whig and Tory. Your grand historical traditions and your eminent public
      virtues have not been respected, cared for, understood, or apparently known
      to your representatives in Parliament, or even those who have hitherto
  aspired to the most honourable distinction of representing you in the Legislature.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Gentlemen, although a stranger among you, having resided many years
  abroad, and having but lately returned to my native country; having studied
  the political institutions of Europe and America, and seen them in practical
  operation; and having, moreover, read the history of your ancient town, which
  forms so many brilliant pages in the grand history of our native country;
  and having had the good fortune to inherit an ample estate,&mdash;I have
  resolved to place my services at the disposal of my country, with a special
  desire to serve the interests of a free and enlightened constituency, such
  as that of N&mdash;.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Gentlemen, under these circumstances I offer myself
      as a candidate at the forthcoming election for the representation of your
      borough; and although I shall immediately do myself the honour of waiting
      upon you individually, and canvassing each of you at his own fireside,
      I think it right to lay before you concisely a statement of my political
  principles.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Gentlemen, I am in favour of the broadest and most comprehensive
  scheme of reform which political philosophy can devise. If you should do
  me the honour to return me to Parliament (as I feel confident you will),
  I shall, by my speeches and votes, support every measure which tends to increase
  the happiness of the people, by extending the demand for labour, increasing
  the wages of industry, at the same time adding to the profits of capital,
  and promoting the comfort of every man, woman, and child throughout her Majesty&rsquo;s
  wide dominions.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Gentlemen, I am in favour of other measures of
      political and social amelioration which benefit all, but injure none, in
      their comprehensiveness and beneficence, that I find it impossible to properly
      explain, within the limit of a printed address, but upon which I shall
      have many opportunities to offer explanations when I meet you face to face
      in public meeting, in your own houses, and upon the hustings on the day
  of nomination.</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Gentlemen,<br>
  I have the honour to subscribe myself,<br>
  Your very faithful and obedient servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bill-sticker lost no time in placarding the walls of the town; but his
  functions had been largely anticipated by the disclosures of the toll-bar
  keeper, Boniface, his boots, Bung, and his ostler.</p>
  <p>The town was set in a commotion. The Green Swan with Two Tails was crowded
  in the bar-parlour, in front of the bar, and in every public room it had.
  Mr. Smith (I mean Mr. Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps) received a dozen offers
  of professional assistance, two or three score of requests for the honour
  of making his acquaintance, letters innumerable for his autograph, with other
  delicate and indelicate overtures of good-will and friendship,&mdash;all
  within a few hours. Mr. Fipps, after he had returned to London, and been
  retransformed into &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; told me it was the &ldquo;jolliest
  spree&rdquo; he had ever been engaged in during his life; and my man told
  me that the fictitious candidate played his part with the skill of a genius.</p>
  <p>In the course of the morning a crowd assembled in front of the Swan with
  Two Tails, and loud huzzas were heard in honour of &ldquo;the independent&rdquo; and
  now &ldquo;popular candidate.&rdquo; A speculative printer had, without orders,
  either in the excess of political zeal, or in reliance upon a careless auditing
  of accounts, got another placard stuck upon the walls, which read thus:</p>
  <p align="center">&ldquo;FIPPS FOR EVER!!!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mob became towards afternoon a little impatient and uproarious, and
  the candidate had to present himself on the balcony of the hotel, and harangue
  his admirers. I regret to say, no short-hand writer being present, I cannot
  give the reader a report of this speech, which I am sorry for, because I
  have been told it was one of the grandest orations of the kind ever uttered
  by a pretended or real candidate. However, let that pass.</p>
  <p>Towards evening a deputation asked permission to wait upon Horatio Mount-Stephen
  Fipps, Esq., to express their admiration of the principles so clearly and
  exactly enunciated in his address, and so beautifully illustrated and enforced
  in his most eloquent speech. Their request was granted with the utmost cordiality
  by that great man, and he supplicated them to do him the honour of dining
  with him.</p>
  <p>The hospitality of the Green Swan with Two Tails was, I am told, worthy
  of a more pretentious establishment; and ample justice was done, as the penny-a-liners
  say, to the culinary skill of the hostess. Mine host&rsquo;s vintages were
  also duly appreciated, or at least I judge so by the items of account which
  I afterwards saw under the date of this entertainment. It is true that the
  good things bore familiar names; but that circumstance may rather be ascribed
  to the English character of the candidate and his admirers, than to the limited
  capacity or means of the landlord and his better half. Sherry and port and
  champagne&mdash;champagne and port and sherry&mdash;seemed to have been mingled
  in profusion with cigars that, in the aggregate, weighed a few score pounds,
  and were (I take it from the price they cost me or my principal) the finest
  that Havannah could produce.</p>
  <p>At this improvised banquet speeches were of course delivered, toasts were
  drunk, and songs were sang, until the <i>finale</i>,&mdash;a medley of variations
  from &ldquo;Rule Brittania,&rdquo; &ldquo;God Save the Queen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We
  won&rsquo;t go Home till Morning,&rdquo;&mdash;which last chorus embodied
  a resolution that the patriotic admirers of Fipps did faithfully perform.</p>
  <p>Out of this party a committee was formed by the sober men; for, let it be
  observed, Smith&mdash;that is, I mean Fipps&mdash;kept faith by keeping sober
  with a constant eye to results; and all now was expected to go on merrily
  as a marriage-bell.</p>
  <p>The next day was spent very much as the previous one had been, except that
  the third and popular candidate, as a matter of form, called upon a number
  of respectable inhabitants, and went through the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a candidate&rsquo;s
  duties, such as shaking hands with one or two loungers in front of the hotel
  clad in soiled smock-frocks, kissing a few slobbering babies, talking pleasantly
  to the voters&rsquo; wives, and expounding principles to the voters themselves.</p>
  <p>On this day the attorney of Mr. Twitch sent a note by hand to the attorney
  of Mr. Jollefat, proposing that these ravens should meet in confidence, and
  without prejudice, to discuss a matter of importance to both the candidates.
  Mr. Jollefat&rsquo;s legal adviser replied by assenting to the conference.
  They met. Fipps&rsquo;s candidature was the theme of discussion. Twitch&rsquo;s
  attorney said he had telegraphed to Brookes&rsquo;s, and the Reform, and
  to Mr. Coppock, but he could learn nothing about Fipps. He was not known
  to the party, and they thought he must be some adventurer, whose wealth,
  if it had any other than an imaginary existence at all, must be grossly exaggerated.
  Mr. Jollefat&rsquo;s attorney said that he had in like manner inquired at
  the Carlton, but could learn nothing about their opponent. The Liberal was
  discouraged; the Conservative did not take the matter to heart. They were
  agreed that nothing could be done to spoil the new candidate.</p>
  <p>My man went to a local printer and got some forms printed with counterfoils,
  much after the manner of tradesmen&rsquo;s &ldquo;delivery note-books&rdquo; or
  bankers&rsquo; cheques, the use of which will immediately be seen. He also
  contrived to make the acquaintance of a few leaders of the people,&mdash;what
  the French would call &ldquo;men of action,&rdquo;&mdash;not spouters or
  loudly boasting partisans.</p>
  <p>On the evening of the second day after Mr. Fipps&rsquo;s arrival at N&mdash;,
  my man had a consultation with about half a dozen of the principal of these
  men, who may be called the heads of gangs of voters; persons who regarded
  the franchise as a property to be sold in the market, like any other commodity;
  except that this article called a vote must be purchased by a candidate in
  retail quantities, in order that he might sell them, as a constituency, in
  a lump or by wholesale. The result was a compact or understanding, which
  I have no doubt would have been faithfully kept by the vendors. These men
  always keep faith with their purchaser, if no other candidate, supposed to
  have still a heavier weight of metal with which to solve their honesty, should
  arrive on any subsequent night between the date of the arrangement with them
  and the day of polling.</p>
  <p>This part of the business requires to be explained with much precision,
  or the reader may not perhaps observe the central point or pivot of the Great
  Electioneering Trick which it is my intention now to explain.</p>
  <p>My man had occasion to address one of the vendors of the franchise to the
  following effect. He explained that the law against bribery was rather severe;
  and Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps, Esq., was a gentleman of extremely delicate
  sensibilities, whose honourable feelings would recoil from venality; and
  that if there were no law on the Statute-book or among the precedents for
  its punishment (which indeed there was), all must be free and above board,&mdash;or
  at least it must be made to appear so to the eyes, not only of policemen,
  or judges, or Parliamentary Commissioners, or other judicial officers, but
  also to that most upright, righteous, and wealthy man, the &ldquo;popular
  candidate&rdquo; himself. The agent went on to say that he came down to the
  town with the gentleman whom he had the honour to serve. He could not have
  supposed that the state of the borough would have entailed upon him the necessity
  of doing things which he saw were essential to the success of Mr. Fipps,
  but yet, being in it, he was determined to go on and secure a triumph for
  the distinguished and generous-hearted man he represented at that interview.
  As for money, that did not matter. Mr. Fipps was rich enough in all conscience.
  Any thing they might have to pay would not hurt him&mdash;not a bit of it;
  but his character must be above reproach at the clubs and in his own eyes.
  One way out of the difficulty, my man went on to observe, had occurred to
  him, and he had already resolved to pursue that course, or to withdraw his
  candidate at once before any money worth mentioning had been spent; because
  although it was true Mr. Fipps had enough, and more than enough, for every
  necessity, he did not like squandering it, and losing the object of his ambition
  also. At this suggestion of the removal of the candidate and his cash-box,
  the leaders of the people looked somewhat blank or alarmed. They said a man
  like Mr. Fipps was sure to win if he went the right way about it, and they
  thought it a pity he should run away after the handsome manner in which he
  had been treated by all classes.</p>
  <p>Some further parleying took place, when it was agreed that late at night
  the several leaders of the people should, one by one, take my man round to
  the residences of the free and independent electors who were in reality to
  be bribed, and that that operation should be colourably done in the way arranged.</p>
  <p>A contract was made with each elector that he should fill the post of flag-bearer,
  messenger, check-clerk, polling-clerk, or something or other, and should
  receive 10<i>l.</i> at the close of the election for so doing. He was guaranteed
  payment of that money to his perfect satisfaction, by a printed form of engagement,
  or an agreement in law, on a slip of paper, signed by my man with his bold
  clear autograph, and on the stump counterfoil of which the lured voter wrote
  his name or made his mark (+). Just by way of a present balm to each hired
  elector, the sum of 5<i>s.</i> was given him when his engagement was effected.</p>
  <p>Next day the nomination took place. Mr. Twitch, the Whig candidate, was
  received with derisive shouts, and a greeting of missiles. Mr. Jollefat fared
  no better, and in his heart of hearts cursed the borough, with that ambition
  or folly which had induced him to enter the lists as a candidate; and he
  stopped at the conclusion that of all the vanities which have marked humanity
  since the days of Solomon, nothing equalled that of desiring to be the representative
  in Parliament of such a free and independent constituency as the borough
  of N&mdash;.</p>
  <p>Mr. Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps was the hero of the day. If any thing checked
  the outpouring of his eloquent tongue, it was the rapid appreciation of his
  audience, which overtook the completion of his sentences. They cheered, and
  shouted, and hurrahed, and made every conceivable, and, to the reader, many
  unconceivable demonstrations of affection for his person, and of admiration
  for his principles. But for these exuberant manifestations of attachment
  and devotion, I certainly might give the reader a splendid specimen of what
  a speech on the hustings may be. The hurrahs and the huzzas broke up Mr.
  Fipps&rsquo;s arguments, and the coruscations of his eloquence into fragments.
  Let it suffice to say, it was a brilliant and a grand speech.</p>
  <p>On the show of hands being called for, a few were held up for Mr. Twitch,
  a few more for Mr. Jollefat, and a whole forest of uplifted palms testified
  their desire to have Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps as the member for N&mdash;.
  The returning officer, of course, declared the choice of the electors, by
  an open vote, to have fallen upon that honourable gentleman, and a poll was
  demanded by each of his antagonists.</p>
  <p>The most important thing to be now effected was an escape from the town.
  This was not in reality a very easy thing, although to the reader nothing
  may perhaps appear more easy of accomplishment. By this time every body in
  the place knew the three conspirators, and neither the &ldquo;candidate,&rdquo; nor
  his two immediate associates, were often left alone during five consecutive
  minutes. To quit the place by either of the ordinary roads, in the ordinary
  way, would have been likely to excite suspicion. To have moved off singly,
  but simultaneously, by three different roads, would have excited less suspicion
  perhaps, but would have been more damnatory if discovered. To move off other
  than simultaneously would have been to peril, perhaps, the lives, and certainly
  to have perilled the chastisement, of one or two who might remain after the
  flight of one had been ascertained.</p>
  <p>Detection was, moreover, a thing likely, under any circumstances, to follow
  rapidly on the retreat. My man had noticed the presence of at least half
  a dozen strangers in the camp of the enemy. These strangers had a knowing
  look, and wore a metropolitan aspect. He suspected them of being spies upon
  us. Mr. Fipps&rsquo;s antecedents might, for any thing we positively knew
  to the contrary, have been ascertained, and become known to the Liberal candidate,
  whose game he was trying to spoil, although that gentleman and his friend
  might not deem it expedient (if they could not exactly prove the connexion
  between the party of Fipps and that of Mr. Jollefat) to explode the fiction
  of the former&rsquo;s candidature. However, get away they must, and that
  before the polling of to-morrow, or they would not get away until too late.</p>
  <p>It was part of my design that the scheme should explode, and that the match
  should be applied at this exact point of the scheme.</p>
  <p>We had arranged to keep the poll open for Fipps, notwithstanding his flight.
  No official notice of the abandonment of his candidature was therefore served
  upon the returning officer.</p>
  <p>In fact, although Fipps ran away, Fipps must still be a candidate. Our head
  lawyer thought that necessary, and also thought it wise to poll one man at
  least for the runaway.</p>
  <p>After deliberation, it was arranged between the intended fugitives that
  morning should be chosen for their flight, and that they should fly in company.
  After the nomination, high revelry had been kept at the Green Swan with Two
  Tails. Every section of the community of N&mdash; had its representation
  there: the lower orders being provided for in rooms, and with refreshments
  suited to their tastes, while the topsawyers and municipal notabilities who
  had attached themselves to the popular and winning cause of Fipps, were being
  entertained in a better room of the house. Fipps himself, and my man and
  the attorney, being in the company of the latter, carefully guarded against
  any thing like excess. They were the only prudent people in the lot. This
  revelry lasted through the night, and until morning. Mine host himself, knocked
  up by fatigue and potations, retired to an uneasy couch. The hostess had
  snatched a little rest, and resumed charge of the house while her lord slumbered.
  As for Mr. Fipps, my man, and the attorney, they contrived to disentangle
  themselves from their supporters about three in the morning, under strong
  protestations of anxiety for the welfare of those gentlemen, who were urged,
  for appearance&rsquo; sake and their own health&rsquo;s sake, to retire
  home and get a few winks of sleep, and come refreshed in the morning to the
  poll. By this means the multitude surrounding the candidate, except his two
  confidants, were got rid of. So far good.</p>
  <p>About six in the morning, Fipps,&mdash;oppressed with an imaginary headache
  and sense of fatigue; my man, in like condition; and the attorney, in a similar
  state,&mdash;called for soda-water with a dash of brandy, and began, in the
  presence of the hostess, to bewail their unfitness to go through the labours
  of the approaching struggle. My man suggested that it might be as well to
  take a stroll, if they could get out quietly and not have a rabble at their
  heels. They asked if that were possible. The landlady consented to let them
  out by a back-door across a meadow which formed part of her lord&rsquo;s
  tenancy, where they could strike off into some by-lanes, and get what they
  so urgently needed&mdash;&ldquo;a breath of fresh air.&rdquo; This suited
  admirably. My man had already taken soundings of the roads, and knew that
  by this means the party could walk or run off a distance of only five miles,
  and meet an up-train to London at the &mdash; Station at eight o&rsquo;clock
  a.m.</p>
  <p>Not a soul was astir on the outskirts of the town, save here and there a
  rustic labourer walking to his toil or engaged thereon&mdash;rude, unlettered
  men, without political thought or character, who took no interest in the
  great struggle at the borough of N&mdash;, and who cared to do no more than
  return the salutation of &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to the gentlemen wayfarers.</p>
  <p>The absence of Mr. Fipps and his agent and attorney was soon discovered,
  and it was at once suspected to have a sinister object. This notion spread
  like wildfire throughout the whole borough, and a scene of excitement ensued
  which literally beggars description; nothing has ever equalled it in electioneering
  development. The Green Swan at one time ran great risk of utter demolition.
  A few innocent people, suspected of participation in the fraud, were punished
  by the mob, who must have a victim or two, and who wreaked their vengeance
  upon suspects in the absence of those real delinquents that by this time
  were safely proceeding southwards to the great metropolis in the train which
  they had met.</p>
  <p>The windows of Mr. Fipps&rsquo;s hotel were broken. The remonstrances of
  the landlord were not believed by a large portion of the crowd, although,
  for that worthy&rsquo;s reputation, it may be stated a large contingent of
  the rioters did put faith in his asseverations.</p>
  <p>The committee-room was broken into and ransacked, and no little glee was
  excited when the strong-box was discovered. A fitful gleam of savage hope
  took possession of the discoverers. They thought for a moment they had grasped
  a treasure, and the prospect of a grand loot cheered their hearts. This discovery
  also soon got communicated to the crowd outside. There was a demand that
  the box should be brought out into the Market-place, and its contents distributed
  fairly amongst them. With much difficulty the ponderous chest was carried
  down-stairs and into the street. For a while the lock withstood all efforts
  to break it open; but at length a smith came, with tools that would have
  almost battered down the gate of a fortress. With this effective aid the
  hasp was fractured or detached, and the lid of the mysterious box was lifted.
  To their surprise and astonishment, carefully embedded in sawdust were found&mdash;not
  the sovereigns that were to have compensated the various messengers, flag-bearers,
  check-clerks, poll-clerks, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; but&mdash;do not start,
  gentle reader, in amazement&mdash;ten solid lumps of fine Scotch granite,
  which had been diverted from their legitimate purpose (that of forming part
  of the roadway in Oxford Street) to the unhallowed desecration of the free
  and independent electors of N&mdash;. Shouts of derision, and anathemas both
  profound and deep, were uttered; imprecations of the direst were showered
  on the whilom popular candidate; and it may be accepted as a fact that, if
  Mr. Fipps, or his attorney, or my man, had fallen into the hands of that
  enraged crowd, his legal representatives would have been entitled to make
  a claim on the offices in which he had insured his life.</p>
  <p>The retreat of Fipps and the discovery were themes of merriment; but perhaps
  in no part of the borough was the joke or trick so much relished as in the
  committee-room of Mr. Jollefat, our real candidate.</p>
  <p>It should be also stated, for the reader&rsquo;s information&mdash;and he
  is particularly requested to notice&mdash;that the general postal delivery
  from London conveyed to each of the central committee-rooms of Mr. Fipps&rsquo;s
  rivals an oblong packet, addressed to each of the remaining candidates by
  name, and to their agents, and to all others whom it might concern, giving
  them formal notice that the men whose names were included in lists which
  were enclosed in the communication (being free and independent electors of
  N&mdash;) had disqualified themselves from voting at the present election,
  by having accepted offices of emolument, under binding legal contracts with
  one of the candidates.</p>
  <p>In consequence of this notice the poor wretches who had entered into the
  engagements mentioned with my man were unable to sell their votes and consciences
  to Mr. Twitch, if he had been inclined to buy them; because, if he had bought
  up the tainted electors, he would thereby have insured a petition against
  his return, with the certainty that his rival would, by a scrutiny, unseat
  him. The returning officer received a similar letter and a similar list.</p>
  <p>The poll being kept open under these circumstances, the general result may
  be pretty well ascertained by the reader&rsquo;s imagination; but, for his
  particular information, I may state that the numbers announced by the returning
  officer were:</p>
  <p>Jollefat. . . .209<br>
  Twitch. . . .64<br>
  Fipps. . . . .1</p>
  <p>The consequence was, that the first-named gentleman was duly returned, and
  took his seat, and was for a period of several years the unchallenged representative
  of the borough of N&mdash;. It is fair to say that he was returned, at a
  comparatively small cost, by a large majority of the honest suffrages of
  the decent men of the borough. My man, I believe, had succeeded in disqualifying
  for once all the corruption of that notorious place.</p>
  <p>The landlord of the Green Swan was of course very glum over his misfortunes.
  He managed to get his broken glass and other damage repaired at the expense
  of the Hundred; but he had given up all chance of recovering his debt from
  Mr. Fipps, when he received a letter from a well-known political solicitor
  of Westminster, stating it was not the desire of Mr. Fipps that any person&rsquo;s
  honest claim should go unsatisfied; and that if mine host would make out
  his account and forward it to him, it should be examined, and if found correct
  be settled. The account was duly rendered, and on being scrutinised or audited
  was deemed excessive. Two-thirds of the total amount&mdash;that is to say,
  100<i>l.</i>&mdash;was remitted him; and, although 50<i>l.</i> was thus knocked
  off, I have solid reason for believing he did not fare ill by the candidature
  of Horatio Mount-Stephen Fipps.</p>
  <p>One little circumstance none of us had anticipated now arose, to our embarrassment.
  The payment of that bill of the landlord of the Green Swan told the story
  of Fipps&rsquo;s purse with approximate accuracy. Mr. Jollefat, the successful
  candidate, was now suspected by many people of being near the bottom of my
  Great Trick. To get at him, however, it was necessary to track and attack
  Fipps, which, I am sorry to say, the disappointed free and independent electors
  who could not vote at the late election succeeded in doing. How they discovered
  him is to me a secret at this day; but they certainly did somehow find him
  out, and they assaulted him by a battery of writs issued out of her Majesty&rsquo;s
  Court of Common Pleas, at Westminster. A counsel learned in the law advised
  that we had a good defence to these actions, on the ground that the agreements
  for service were contracts to pay money either to induce men to vote&mdash;which
  was bribery&mdash;or not to vote, which rendered the engagements null and
  void. About the first point I believe there could be no doubt; around the
  second I believe there did exist much room for speculation and legal ingenuity.
  Mr. Jollefat, however, wished to avoid discredit with his constituents; so
  it was thought expedient to get rid of the difficulty by another mode. Fipps
  was a man of cosmopolitan tastes, and he had not the phrenological organs
  of locality and adhesiveness largely developed. It mattered not much to him
  on which side of the Atlantic or of the Pacific he dwelt. Somebody on his
  behalf, an attorney, intimated to the solicitor for Mr. Jollefat that it
  would be cheaper to &ldquo;square&rdquo; Fipps than to submit to the game
  process all the voters and their actions. One hundred pounds was the sum
  named as one that would take the eloquent and popular candidate beyond the
  jurisdiction of her Majesty&rsquo;s judges and officers. The amount was provided,
  and he quietly set sail, or rather took steam, for the United States of America,
  where, I am told, an ample scope and opportunity for the exercise of the
  peculiar abilities of that popular candidate has always been found in the
  service of the various parties who divide the spoils of the Model Republic.</p>

  Mistaken Identity</b></h2>
  <p>AN eminently respectable tradesman was seated in his cosy little parlour,
  or counting-house, at the back of his shop, within a mile of the Mansion
  House in the City of London, one summer afternoon in the year 1861. His wife
  was the only other person present on this occasion. It was an unusual circumstance
  for this lady to be there, as Mr. Delmar also occupied, for purposes of residence,
  a neat little house in an eastern suburb of the metropolis. He was, moreover,
  the father of a family. He had four sons and three daughters, whose ages
  varied between seven and twenty-two. He was churchwarden of the parish in
  which he carried on business. He was regarded as the very pattern of domestic
  virtue, and a model of rectitude in business. Few men, indeed, in the whole
  world enjoyed a better reputation than Mr. Delmar. Nobody had ever breathed
  a word against his character, and nobody had a right to do so. His fireside
  was as cheerful as moderate prosperity, a good wife, and dutiful children
  could render it.</p>
  <p>These particulars about Mr. Delmar, his family, his connexions, his circumstances,
  and his reputation, are necessary to enable the reader to appreciate the
  incidents I have to describe.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Delmar had come to town, on the present occasion, for the legitimate
  purpose of shopping. She was giving her prudent spouse an estimate of the
  call she needed&mdash;or considered that she needed&mdash;to make upon his
  purse for a variety of domestic necessities, from little child&rsquo;s-shoes
  to her own and her eldest daughter&rsquo;s bonnets. Mr. Delmar was checking
  off the anticipated outlay, or, as I may put it, revising the domestic estimates,
  with a prudence quite commendable and, I also think, consistent with a good
  husband and father&rsquo;s affection for those dependent on him.</p>
  <p>An assistant of Mr. Delmar&rsquo;s entered the parlour, or counting-house,
  and observed, &ldquo;A gentleman wishes to see you, sir, in the shop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show him in, Williams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says he wishes to see you privately, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Privately!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Delmar, in tones of surprise; &ldquo;show
  him in;&rdquo; and the speaker glanced at his better half as he finished
  the sentence.</p>
  <p>Williams left the room and informed the gentleman, who was standing in the
  shop, that his master wished him to walk in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You told me,&rdquo; observed the unknown visitor to the shopman, &ldquo;that
  Mrs. Delmar was with her husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would rather Mr. Delmar should step out to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will not do it, sir. He says you are to go in to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I will see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The unknown visitor advanced to the apartment in which the worthy and happy
  couple were closeted; he cautiously, not to say nervously, opened the door,
  and seemed to halt in the execution of his purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would very much rather see you alone, sir, for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot see me alone, sir; this lady is my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My business is private.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no private business or secrets unknown to my wife, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed
  Mr. Delmar, growing a little irritated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you will oblige me if you will step out a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you, sir, I have no secrets from my wife. What is your business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You really, sir&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir? I insist upon your telling me immediately
  what brings you here. And if you do not, I will kick you into the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Delmar uttered these words in a tone which alarmed his visitor, who,
  perhaps, apprehended the fulfilment of the threat which his delicacy had
  elicited; but, summoning his courage, he advanced towards the desk and took
  from his pocket a paper, which he handed in silence to the astonished and
  indignant husband.</p>
  <p>It was a summons to show cause why he should not maintain a female child
  which one Selina Wilkins, chambermaid at the Griffin&rsquo;s Head Hotel (an
  excellent hostelry, well known to commercial travellers on the midland road
  who call at the town of &mdash;), was the mother of.</p>
  <p>Mr. Delmar was a man who had seen much of the world, although he had, happily
  for himself, not known many of its vicissitudes, or its wickednesses and
  perils. His knowledge and experience were, however, at fault on the present
  occasion. During two or three minutes of perfect silence, in which the three
  persons glanced at one another alternately, Mr. Delmar was a prey to conflicting
  emotions and cross purposes. At first he was disposed, without warning, to
  enforce the threat he had not long ago made, and punish the agent of the
  infamous practical joke now being practised at his expense, as he conceived
  it, by inflicting upon him an ignominious and severe chastisement. Next,
  he trembled before a vague apprehension that some foul conspiracy might have
  been devised for the ruin of his own and his family&rsquo;s domestic peace.
  The inquiry passed through his mind. Had he acted prudently in compelling
  the disguised officer to serve the process in the presence of Mrs. Delmar?
  Should he treat the messenger who brought this scandalous official libel
  with civility? Should he take him into confidence? What, indeed, should he
  do?</p>
  <p>Within the brief space of three minutes he had many times doubted whether,
  after all, it was a prudent thing for a man of business, and a man of the
  world, to let his wife know all his secrets. At last he resolved to pursue
  in this emergency that frankness and uprightness towards his wife, which
  had been the source of so much comfort to them both in those various emergencies
  which even the serene life of a prosperous London tradesman occasionally
  encounters.</p>
  <p>The wife had looked on the previous scene in amazement and fear. The changing
  hues of her husband&rsquo;s countenance, the twitching of the muscles in
  his face, the spasmodic movement of his limbs, under suppressed rage, disgust,
  and dread, told her that the document she had seen handed to him was the
  premonitory note of something very dreadful. If she had not so well and thoroughly
  known the rectitude and honourableness of the father of her children, she
  might have jumped to the conclusion, in her bewilderment, that he had committed
  forgery, or murdered some one, and that the summons was a warrant for his
  apprehension on a charge that might have consigned him to Portland or led
  him to the gallows.</p>
  <p>The officer was the first to break silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a painful duty, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. But what does this mean?&rdquo; Mr. Delmar replied, rapidly
  passing from affected indifference to painful curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, sir, what it is,&rdquo; said the officer.</p>
  <p>Had Mr. Delmar&rsquo;s leg and boot been slighter than they were, a smile
  might have passed from the inner to the outer man of the speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, sir, what it is,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Delmar; and summoning
  all his moral resolution, and lifting himself to a height of moral dignity,
  which perhaps he had never occupied in any one moment of his wedded life,
  from the day when in his young and pure manhood he had taken that woman,
  every way worthy, to be his partner and help-meet to the altar, he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am very glad indeed, sir, for one thing only,&mdash;that I did
  not consent to see you, or accept at your hand this infamous paper, unknown
  to my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still Mrs. Delmar was silent, bewildered, and intensely anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have done my duty,&rdquo; said the officer, in an apologetic tone,
  glancing at the door, as if desirous of withdrawing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may leave,&rdquo; said Mr. Delmar.</p>
  <p>I draw a veil over the scene which followed. It is enough, at all events,
  the reader should know that Mr. Delmar read the document to his wife, explained
  its exact purport, and craved her assistance in penetrating the mystery.
  He had no occasion to ask her whether she believed him guilty of the offence
  attributed to him. She volunteered an assurance of her belief in its untruthfulness.
  She felt and declared that it was the result of some awful mistake of personal
  identity, or some most foul conspiracy.</p>
  <p>It would be incorrect to say that the interchange of confidence did not
  leave a painful sense of the possible consequences of this mysterious incident;
  yet it may be affirmed that the event did not estrange a particle of that
  woman&rsquo;s love, nor for a moment excite in her breast one flimsy or evanescent
  doubt of the fidelity of her husband.</p>
  <p>The unfortunate man who was thus called upon to defend himself against a
  charge of which he was no more guilty than my reader is, went to his lawyer,
  who said he could not make it out. This gentleman, Mr. Drawly, was at a loss
  to determine whether his client was fool enough to be deceiving him, or whether
  he was the victim of what Mrs. Delmar had called a foul conspiracy, or whether
  an artfully planned scheme of extortion had been practised against him.</p>
  <p>I was now consulted. I should have liked to have been intrusted with full
  personal discretion, so that I might have investigated the mystery in my
  own way. I think I might have more easily cleared it up, if I had not been
  embarrassed by the definiteness of my instructions. I was, however, told
  to inquire, in the first place, whether Selina Wilkins had employed any solicitor,
  and if so, to put myself in communication with him. I was told to use my
  best skill in tracing what I could; at the same time, if the professional
  man on the other side were a man of reputation, to deal frankly with him.
  I was to explain the position in life and the character of the defendant,
  and urge the improbability of his having committed any such offence against
  domestic propriety as that he was charged with; and I was told to endeavour
  to get the affair cleared up or settled without scandal or notoriety.</p>
  <p>I did as I was requested. My habit, when my instructions from solicitors
  were definite, was to follow them implicitly. This commonly saved me much
  trouble, and when the result was not unsatisfactory I liked that course all
  the better; but sometimes the plan a little tantalised and vexed me, because
  I conceived that through it I missed my aim, and did not obtain the credit
  by success I might otherwise have done.</p>
  <p>In this case I ascertained that the young woman had, on the recommendation
  of her former master and mistress, employed a solicitor, who stood very high
  among the lawyers in that part of the country where he dwelt. He received
  me courteously, and expressed his willingness to tell me all about the case.
  He, however, insisted that the defendant must be a wily rascal, a consummate
  hypocrite, a mean-spirited fellow, &amp;c. &amp;c. He told me there could
  not be the shadow or shade of a doubt about the case; and he entered into
  the matter in the spirit of a partisan imbued with the righteousness of the
  side he was engaged to fight on.</p>
  <p>As to the identity of the person, he thought any defence on that head must
  break down; for he had obtained, through his agents in London, a description
  of Mr. Delmar, which corresponded exactly to the description given him by
  his &ldquo;unfortunate client.&rdquo; It is true that the poor girl had not,
  he said, seen the fellow since her misfortune, because she had not the money
  to pay visits to London; nor, indeed, was her strength sufficient to enable
  her to make that journey and back without peril to her life. Grief and shame
  and bitter mortification had held her tongue until the last possible moment;
  and it was only when material evidence of her wrong-doing became palpable
  to her mistress, that she admitted the injury which had been done her. &ldquo;Why,
  sir,&rdquo; observed the provincial lawyer, &ldquo;even after the poor girl&rsquo;s
  condition had been ascertained, she refused to tell who was the author of
  her misery, and clung to the foolish belief that, as he was a perfect gentleman,
  he would one day redeem his promise by making her his wife. The way it was
  found out, sir, was this. She went home to be confined. Her mother one night
  searched her little portmonnaie, and there found the blackguard&rsquo;s card.
  So her friends ascertained his name and address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I had obtained these particulars from Selina Wilkins&rsquo;s attorney,
  it was almost post-time; so I wrote an account of my interview with the lawyer
  as rapidly as I could, and sent it to London to the solicitor from whom I
  had received my instructions.</p>
  <p>I had an answer by electric telegraph, desiring me to pursue my inquiries,
  as there could be no doubt the case was one of conspiracy or fraud.</p>
  <p>Some of the further particulars of this mysterious case had perhaps better
  be stated in the brief narrative I can furnish of the inquiry before the
  magistrates.</p>
  <p>On the day appointed for the hearing Mr. Delmar came down from London, attended
  by his confidential and most respectable solicitor, and by a gentleman of
  the long robe whose name had figured in a thousand Old-Bailey narratives.
  The young woman was examined. Amid tears and sobs and threatened hysterics,
  she related her story. It was to the effect that a gentleman, or &ldquo;commercial,&rdquo; she
  styled him, who had visited the town of &mdash;, and stayed five or six times
  at the hotel where she had been in service, had paid his addresses to her
  with great ardour, and, under cover of a promise of marriage, effected her
  ruin. She had no hesitation in declaring that the defendant was the man.
  The card on which was printed his name and address was produced in Court.
  A severe cross-examination by the defendant&rsquo;s counsel did nothing to
  shake these allegations. Although the gentleman had not been many times to
  the hotel in question, he appeared quite familiar with the town, and she
  had seen him enter a rival hostelry before she knew him as one of her master&rsquo;s
  guests or customers. The defendant was sworn. He denied that he had ever
  seen the young woman before, or that he had been in the town for several
  years, or that he had ever in his life stayed at the hotel where she had
  been employed.</p>
  <p>The complainant&rsquo;s attorney argued that the case against the defendant
  was conclusive. It did not, he said, admit of a shadow of doubt. He heaped
  vituperative aspersions upon the head of the defendant, for adding insult
  to injury by his disreputable defence. The defendant&rsquo;s counsel, on
  the other hand, contended that the evidence of the complainant was incomplete;
  that it was in several respects highly improbable; and that it should not
  counterbalance the testimony of the most respectable defendant in his own
  behalf. The learned gentleman called upon the magistrates to dismiss the
  case, and intimated that, if the decision were against his client, he should
  appeal. The magistrates agreed with the complainant&rsquo;s attorney; expressed
  an opinion that she was a much ill-used young woman; and said a few things
  uncomplimentary of the defendant, upon whom they expressed their willingness
  to do what, by the way, they could not help doing, I believe&mdash;that is,
  give him an opportunity of appealing against their decision.</p>
  <p>It will occur to the reader that there were several means of rebutting some
  of the special facts upon which the complainant&rsquo;s case must have rested,
  as it did rest, although I omit them for the sake of brevity, as they are
  not necessary to the explanation I have to give of one leading fact.</p>
  <p>The reader will wonder how that card of the defendant&rsquo;s fell into
  the hands of the complainant. I will say at once, in order to clear away
  some mystery, that the young woman herself was no doubt honestly mistaken,
  although somewhat rash in the evidence she gave as to the identity of her
  undoer.</p>
  <p>But, unless some confederate had given her that card, how could she have
  obtained it? It must have been palmed off upon her by some unmitigated villain,
  who was content to divert inquiry from his own track into that of an innocent
  and right-minded man&rsquo;s household, to the peril of the destruction of
  his own and his family&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
  <p>To track this miscreant was my special mission. I had not much time to effect
  a discovery before the appeal must be heard and decided.</p>
  <p>Mr. Delmar could not help me. He had given his card, at various times, to
  various people; and within a few years a few hundred persons might have been
  the conscious or unconscious media, direct or remote, of conveying the fatal
  pasteboard from his hand to that of the complainant.</p>
  <p>After I had been a week engaged in the effort to track the double culprit&mdash;having,
  let me frankly say, no clue by which I hoped to discover him&mdash;I was
  getting weary of the task, when a ray of light dawned through the imperfect
  memory of Mr. Delmar. He recollected that, about ten months before the complaint
  was laid against him at &mdash;, he had been obliged to visit Norwich on
  urgent business. A man who owed him a considerable sum of money was then
  in embarrassment, and had called a meeting of his creditors, at which Mr.
  Delmar was invited to attend. After this business had been completed, he
  intended returning to town by a late train, but allowed himself to be detained
  in conversation with his fellow-sufferers until it became necessary to abandon
  that intention. He accordingly put up for the night at the Saracen&rsquo;s
  Head Hotel, and sought to while away the hours which intervened before bed-time
  by a social pipe and glass in the commercial room. Here he met, as a stranger
  of unpretentious manner always does, with a cordial greeting and good-fellowship.
  One man, however, Mr. Delmar became very chatty and familiar with. This man,
  who told him his business&mdash;that is to say, what &ldquo;line&rdquo; he
  was in&mdash;in the course of conversation took out his card-case and was
  about to hand Mr. Delmar his card, when unfortunately, as he said, he found
  that he was out of cards, but he told him his address. Mr. Delmar also took
  out his card-case, and, very unfortunately indeed, as the sequel shows, he
  gave the commercial his printed name and address.</p>
  <p>I was not long in drawing the inference&mdash;nor would any person, I apprehend,
  be&mdash;that this commercial was the villain of my story.</p>
  <p>With a photograph of Mr. Delmar in my pocket, I speedily took my ticket
  for Norwich, and had not much doubt about overtaking the rascal.</p>
  <p>Would the reader like to know how I got hold of the fellow? It will appear
  a very simple and easy process when explained, and I don&rsquo;t take much
  credit for it. Give a shrewd man a clue, and I warrant you, if he have time
  and opportunity, he will follow it to the end.</p>
  <p>Well, then, the way I pursued the clue to its extremity was this. I concluded
  at once in my own mind that this man&rsquo;s &ldquo;proclivities&rdquo; had
  been manifested wherever he went, and that at more than one of the hotels
  and commercial inns on his road he would have left a clear recollection of
  his name and line on the retina of a pretty chambermaid.</p>
  <p>I was right. After making myself agreeable by innocent devices with the
  chambermaids at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head Hotel, at Norwich, I ventured to
  let one of them see the picture of the man I wanted. I saw at a glance that
  no tender regard for him was felt by this female observer. I noticed something
  like pique, or it might be disgust for him. This was enough for me. I frankly
  told the young woman that I wanted to track and punish him for a mean and
  vile crime. I saw that, although chambermaid at an inn, she had a woman&rsquo;s
  sense of propriety. However, to make doubly sure of her aid, I appealed to
  her by another argument, which might be supposed to have some influence with
  a young woman who had to live upon small fees and perquisites. I offered
  her 5<i>l.</i> reward if she enabled me to discover him, and in earnest of
  my sincerity and means of so rewarding her I handed her a sovereign at once.
  She told me she thought my photograph was a copy of the features of Mr. John
  Brown, who travelled in the cigar line, who had been at that inn some time
  ago, and who might be expected again in a week or a fortnight at most, as
  the time for his visit to Norwich must have almost come round. She said she
  would show the photograph to the other servants, if I would lend it to her,
  and as I could easily get another, I did so. The rest of the servants agreed
  that that portrait was not exactly like Mr. John Brown, but it was something
  like him too. &ldquo;Very like him,&rdquo; one said. Next morning&rsquo;s
  delivery brought to the hotel, among other letters for expected people (which
  letters where placed in a rack in the commercial room), two for Mr. John
  Brown of London. The next day Mr. John Brown of London arrived, and I was
  struck by the resemblance of the man as he opened the door of the commercial
  room, in which I was then sitting, a little anxiously watching for his arrival.
  It is needless to take the reader through the subsequent steps of my investigation.
  He will see that I had almost bagged my game. It is enough to say that a
  few inquiries upon the subject elicited the fact that a regular traveller
  (on the road in which the town of &mdash; and the Griffin&rsquo;s Head Hotel
  were situated) being suddenly taken ill, and many accounts being due to the
  house he travelled for on that line, Mr. John Brown was ordered to do the
  midland journey for him a few times. It was on one of these journeys that
  he found his evil opportunity for seducing the domestic of the inn, and playing
  off upon her the mean trick which led to the summons against Mr. Delmar,
  the reckless testimony the complainant bore as to his identity, and his condemnation
  by the justices. It is only necessary to add, that the decision against Mr.
  Delmar was quashed at the Quarter Sessions; and that his character as a man
  of unblemished honour and domestic virtue was, if possible, strengthened
  by the ordeal he had to pass through.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  An Unscrupulous Woman</b></h2>
  <p>SOME years ago I was retained to penetrate the mystery of a case in many
  respects not very unlike the celebrated Road murder; and I was to bring the
  criminal to justice if possible. It was a case of child murder. The house
  in which the horrid deed was perpetrated was a cottage, standing in the midst
  of ample grounds&mdash;perhaps ten acres in extent&mdash;communicating with
  a turnpike-road, not much used or frequented, and along which no vehicles
  passed, except those going to or from the cottage or an adjacent farm-house.</p>
  <p>I feel that I am at liberty to indicate the locality of this deed no further
  than to say, it was in a south of England county.</p>
  <p>In order to explain the nature of the case I should, however, remark, that
  the occupiers of the cottage were, a gentleman who had retired from a business
  in London, his wife, children, and servants.</p>
  <p>The man was cynical, misanthropical, and morbidly disposed to seclusion.
  He was an eccentric man, and he every where excited prejudices against himself.
  Even the retirement of this cottage was not so complete as to exclude him
  wholly from contact with the world, or to shut him in from these prejudices.</p>
  <p>He had married&mdash;much later in life than is usual with prosperous men&mdash;about
  a year before he took up his abode in the place I have described. His wife
  had been a poor young woman, although rather beautiful, and, in my opinion,
  her amiability and goodness compensated to such a man for her lack of intellectual
  qualifications.</p>
  <p>At the time I speak of there were living in this cottage Mr. Robinson, his
  wife, their two infant children, and two general domestic servants&mdash;one
  of whom, a young woman about twenty-three years of age, they had brought
  with them from London to this retreat in the south of England.</p>
  <p>One morning in June, Mrs. Robinson arose from her bed about half-past six
  o&rsquo;clock, and before dressing herself, as was her custom, she crossed
  the straggling passage and drawing and dining room to a chamber beyond, in
  which her children and the servant, who performed the duties of nursemaid,
  were supposed to be sleeping. Two of them were sleeping. She was, however,
  astonished to observe that one appeared cold to the touch. In amazement and
  horror the poor woman discovered that the third&mdash;her youngest child&mdash;was
  sleeping in the embrace of death!</p>
  <p>The bereaved mother rushed frantically to her husband, who was just awakening
  from his slumbers, and she roused him to perfect consciousness by her shrieks
  and wild ejaculations. The husband was soon astir, and every body seemed,
  as every body ought to have been, affected by intense grief.</p>
  <p>The loudest interest and most demonstrative agony was that poured out in
  sobs, tears, interjections, and apostrophes&mdash;all vague, incoherent,
  indefinite&mdash;by the nursemaid.</p>
  <p>I will not dwell upon the frightful incident, nor attempt to sketch in detail
  the lamentations and misery of that household. It may suffice to observe,
  that wicked rumour said all sorts of uncharitable things. The local gossips
  were immensely dissatisfied with the proceedings at the inquest;&mdash;the
  acumen of the coroner, or the want thereof; and the sagacity of his jurymen,
  or its deficiency. Among the dreadful facts asserted by rumour (which, let
  me observe, is, in nineteen out of twenty cases, altogether wrong in her
  suspicions and asseverations) in this case, were charges of improper intimacy
  between the nursemaid and the master, and jealousy on the part of this girl
  towards her mistress, which had, it was suggested, led up to the perpetration
  of the crime, through a desire to wreak vengeance out of a mother&rsquo;s
  agony. One ingenious theorist&mdash;a sort of local oracle in the estimation
  of many, and the possessor of all wisdom in his own&mdash;hinted that the
  mean, selfish, egotistical tradesman, Mr. Robinson, afraid lest his children
  should encroach too rapidly on his accumulated profits, had hit upon the
  Turkish expedient for thinning families; using, in this case, the hand of
  his dishonoured servant to carry out his infamous design.</p>
  <p>The surgeon who made a post-mortem examination&mdash;a man by no means unskilful
  in his profession&mdash;who declined to say whether the inclination of his
  belief favoured the theory of an accidental death or of wilful murder, did,
  however, upon oath, admit that it was possible the child might have been
  smothered by its nurse in the course of a night quite accidentally.</p>
  <p>The coroner&rsquo;s jury were for two hours very much divided in opinion
  about what verdict they should return. Some were for a verdict of wilful
  murder against Mr. Robinson. One man would have liked to have brought in
  a verdict that would have handed over his wife to the tender mercies of Jack
  Ketch. In justification of the eleven others I may add, that a strong disposition
  was felt, amid the solemnity of that investigation, to inflict corporal punishment
  upon the stupidest fellow. A very strong desire was felt in the breast of
  more than the majority to return a verdict of wilful murder against the nurse,
  either with or without yoking her master in that condemnation. The coroner
  was consulted, and, with an immense amount of circumlocution, which mightily
  puzzled and confused his sapient aids, that functionary gave it as his opinion
  that no evidence before the jury was sufficient to justify a verdict of wilful
  murder against any one. He also ventured to tell the jury that they had better,
  perhaps, find what he called &ldquo;an open verdict;&rdquo; that is to say,
  one of &ldquo;wilful murder,&rdquo; without divining the culprit, or one
  of &ldquo;found dead,&rdquo; and leave the cause of death an obviously more
  open question still.</p>
  <p>About this time I was consulted by a gentleman, without the intervention
  of any lawyer, and I was requested to look up the facts in an impartial manner;
  my directions being to nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.</p>
  <p>Who was this gentleman? What his motive? What the latent desire he really
  had? Who did he wish to clear, and upon whom may he have desired to fix the
  doom of punishment attaching to the supposed crime, I must be excused from
  stating.</p>
  <p>Just before my visitor called upon me to undertake this matter, I had received
  instructions to investigate a case of forgery upon a bank, to a large extent.
  I was to receive, as a reward for my services in this case of forgery, a
  very liberal fee; and I had also, as I have always had, a distaste for investigations
  into the mystery of deeds of blood. I have never been the agent through whom
  a culprit&rsquo;s neck has been encircled by a halter. That is an awful responsibility
  (for fear of mistake) that I have always shrunk from. Frankly, let me say,
  I would rather have avoided this engagement altogether, and I did, I think,
  very gracefully escape from personal action in the matter, by showing my
  visitor a letter enclosing an instalment of one hundred pounds on account
  of my fee over the forgery case. He was a man of business, and saw at once
  that I could not be expected to give up a lucrative and comparatively easy
  job of that kind for the less remunerative, and in any event less agreeable,
  inquiry he desired me to prosecute. I, however, took his retainer, upon the
  understanding and condition that I should act in this case by a deputy, and
  simply overlook and generally superintend or advise and direct my assistant&rsquo;s
  labours.</p>
  <p>The reader may as well be informed, that through the intervention of a friend
  of my visitor&rsquo;s, my assistant was provided with lodging in the cottage,
  and was told to use that sequestered retreat of commercial ease as the central
  point of his investigations.</p>
  <p>I accordingly employed the best man I could get or spare from the other
  case I had in hand, in which I needed some assistance, and sent that person
  down to the south of England.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think this man was quite up to his work. Of course I had not
  formed that opinion when I set him about the job; but a review of what transpired
  now inclines me to think he made a too palpable show of his suspicions. He
  made no secret of his quality, or the work he had in hand; but for this he <i>may</i> have
  had adequate reasons.</p>
  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Robinson were both convinced that the murder (if murder it
  was) had not been committed by any one in their household. They were both
  prepared to spend any amount of money in defence of their suspected servant,
  if she had been arrested on suspicion. They had come to the conclusion that
  the sad affair was the result of an accident,&mdash;which was not an over-strained
  hypothesis.</p>
  <p>If, however, it was a case of murder, for which there seemed no apparent
  motive, it must have been committed by somebody obtaining access from the
  outside to the room in which the child was sleeping; and a cursory examination
  of the place showed my man it was by no means a difficult thing to obtain
  both access and egress through a window opening upon a side of the cottage.
  My man would have arrived at the conclusion very soon that the death of the
  poor child had been caused by accident, and would have returned to London,
  but for the not over recondite suspicions generated under his own eye in
  the cottage itself.</p>
  <p>Very curious to know his opinion, very eager in the suggestion of contrary
  and improbable theories, and very profuse in expressions of regard for Mrs.
  Robinson and &ldquo;dear little Willie,&rdquo; was the nursemaid. She followed
  my man about with a closeness which seemed to indicate a kind of fascination
  or terror. At least this is what he told me he thought of her conduct. This
  alone marked out that girl as the murderess to his mind, and he resolved
  to linger as long as he could, with a decent show of appearances, in the
  cottage, thoroughly confident that something would turn up to fix the crime
  on her, and perhaps somebody else in connexion with her.</p>
  <p>The room assigned to him was a rather capacious and tolerably comfortable
  one, adjoining that through which the little child passed to heaven, and
  some distance from the chamber in which its nurse had slept since the &ldquo;accident.&rdquo; Of
  course my man was not superstitious, and had no unnatural fears&mdash;to
  which circumstance, perhaps, may be ascribed the fact that he left his dressing-case
  open and his razors loose during his stay at the cottage.</p>
  <p>My man was moreover not afraid of ghosts, which perhaps was fortunate. The
  window-catch was broken, and the lock of the door was so dilapidated that
  it would have kept no impudent dog or cat from entering, and it afforded
  the room no protection against intruding spirits.</p>
  <p>One night, about a week after his arrival at the cottage, he had fallen
  into a sleep,&mdash;such a sleep as a man of his profession might be allowed,
  a sort of permanent half-wakefulness, in which the footfall of an elf would
  have aroused consciousness without stirring a muscle or raising an eyelid,
  and from which a salute of artillery could not have disturbed him abruptly
  enough to produce a quiver or a twitch of skin or muscle,&mdash;when that
  insecure door did open, and the form of a woman, in her night-dress, appeared
  at his bedside.</p>
  <p>Her step excited the wakefulness of my man as he lay with his face to the
  door. He gently opened his eyes wide enough to enable him to examine and
  measure the form of the nocturnal visitor, without permitting her to notice
  the effect of her presence. He saw her glance round the room, which the beams
  of the moon lighted up sufficiently to exhibit the several articles on the
  toilet-table and elsewhere. My man thought his interrupter&rsquo;s eyes fell
  upon the loose razors, and he availed himself of the opportunity afforded
  by the turning of her face aslant from his bed to disengage his arms somewhat
  from the bedclothes. He was now prepared to meet an attack upon him by her
  with his own material weapons.</p>
  <p>He had misunderstood the woman&rsquo;s object in visiting his bedchamber
  that night.</p>
  <p>She turned again in the direction of the bed. He now thought it prudent
  to let her see that she was noticed. He coolly raised himself up on his haunches,
  and fixed his eyes upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; he rather sternly inquired; and the
  words seemed to alarm her.</p>
  <p>She replied, in faltering accents and spasmodic sentences, &ldquo;What?
  I want to see you. Why do you look at me all day? What do you mean by looking
  at me as you do? Do you mean to say that I killed Willie? Say any thing against
  me, and I will ruin you. Promise me you won&rsquo;t say any thing against
  me, or I will scream out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then steadily glancing at him, she uttered what no doubt were about the
  only words she had intended to say, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t promise me
  here, as you are sitting in that bed, that you don&rsquo;t suspect me, that
  you won&rsquo;t say any thing against me, that you won&rsquo;t look at me
  as you do and try to make people suspect me, I will cry out. I will say that
  you have taken improper liberties with me; that you have seduced me; that
  I have been awakened in my sleep by conscience, and am afraid of your other
  evil designs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you will, will you? And what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What then? Why, won&rsquo;t people say that, after getting me to
  come here and sleep with you, you denounced me in order to cover your own
  improper conduct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My man admits that he thought this &ldquo;devilish clever.&rdquo; If he
  had not been the intended victim, I believe he was so enamoured of the skill
  of this young woman that he might have offered to take her into a detective
  partnership, and set up in business with her in opposition to me. But he
  saw his danger, and did not like being made the object of an experiment with
  such very fatal incidents surrounding it.</p>
  <p>He seized her wrists with one hand, and with the other thrust her from the
  bedside, placed his hands in so doing over her lips, seized one of the razors
  lying on the table, and held it before her eyes to terrify her, saying nothing,
  however, which had reference to that instrument; then he suddenly dropped
  it near the spot where they were standing, seized her again, and shouted
  with all his might.</p>
  <p>My man was not to be outwitted.</p>
  <p>He charged this young woman with having stolen into his bedroom, knowing
  it to be unfastened, when she calculated that he would be asleep, and knowing
  also that he had been imprudent enough during his stay in the house to leave
  his razors on the toilet-table. He declared that he awoke just as she was
  in the act of putting the razor to her own throat, intending to commit suicide
  in his room, with the intention, it was suggested, of fastening upon him
  the crime of her murder.</p>
  <p>It will only be necessary to further inform the reader, that although no
  evidence could be procured sufficient to maintain an indictment for wilful
  murder against this nurse, and although it was generally believed that she
  had committed the murder (a fact about which I had my doubts, for I believe
  the child was accidentally smothered in its sleep, as children often are),
  no evidence was offered to the jury in support of an indictment for the capital
  offence; but she was accused and punished for the attempted suicide.</p>

  The Incendiary Gang</b></h2>
  <p>IN the year 1833 I was engaged to investigate the circumstances attending
  a fire&mdash;one of a series&mdash;which had ended in claims upon several
  of the great London offices, and which fires were believed to have arisen
  out of wilful fraud.</p>
  <p>The present fire broke out on a Monday afternoon between one and two o&rsquo;clock,
  in a warehouse belonging to an extensive bonnet manufactory near Dunstable,
  in Bedfordshire.</p>
  <p>Among the peculiar circumstances of this case was the somewhat remarkable
  fact, that the business of the manufactory had just been transferred from
  one proprietor to another, and that the policy of insurance was in the hands
  of the company&rsquo;s officers, at its headquarters in London, for the purpose
  of having a transfer of the contract endorsed thereon.</p>
  <p>The new proprietor informed the fire-office that he had resolved upon enlarging
  his premises, in order to extend his business.</p>
  <p>In a letter to the company he indeed stated, in precise terms, that he then
  had on hand several large export orders to complete. The policy, which had
  covered an insurance of 3000<i>l.</i> hitherto, was now increased to 4500<i>l.</i></p>
  <p>Shortly after this another letter was received by the office, in which the
  writer stated that 4500<i>l.</i> would, he found, not cover the value of
  all his improvements, machinery, and stock-in-trade, so that he proposed
  to still further increase the insurance to 6000<i>l.</i></p>
  <p>As this was an unusually heavy risk on a country policy, and as the premises
  were only about thirty miles from town, the board determined that the surveyor
  for the office should go down and report upon the case before the last proposal
  was accepted.</p>
  <p>Mr. Phillimore, the surveyor, accordingly went down. He arrived about eleven
  o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon, and was very politely received by the firm&mdash;Newton
  Brothers&mdash;who showed him over the premises, which he examined with his
  usual critical minuteness, and was subsequently invited up-stairs into the
  manager&rsquo;s residence on the works, where he consented to partake of
  a glass of sherry and a sandwich while he awaited a return train to Town.</p>
  <p>It was now a few minutes after one o&rsquo;clock, and the people employed
  in the manufactory had all quitted the premises for dinner.</p>
  <p>The younger member of the firm, Mr. Albert Newton, left the room for the
  sherry, returned in a few minutes, and had been chatting with the surveyor
  about half or three-quarters of an hour, when the workpeople began to return.</p>
  <p>Before many of the hands had arrived, a cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; was raised.
  It was discovered that a portion of the old building, which adjoined the
  new, was in a blaze, and that a large quantity of straw hats and bonnets
  had been ignited. With immense rapidity the flames extended up the sides
  of the warehouse, in which there was, it appeared, stored a large quantity
  of manufactured goods. Appearances were, however, a little deceptive in this
  respect. The stock had been so distributed in racks (it might have been for
  convenience of classification) that the bulk appeared greater than it really
  was. Perhaps this circumstance, however, rather aided than retarded the progress
  of devastation; for the flames diffused themselves with more ease through
  the interstices or spaces in which the parcels were stored, than might have
  been possible had they been more densely packed.</p>
  <p>A confusion and panic seized the few persons in the lower part of the building,
  and terror paralysed their efforts for a while. Moreover, they did not know
  that any persons were in the rooms above; and, if they paused in their alarm
  to consider at all about this matter, they probably thought that they alone,
  and the new arrivals from dinner, were the only persons within scope of the
  fire. They accordingly rushed out into the town, and, with commendable prudence&mdash;that
  is, as soon as calmness and reason were restored&mdash;sought to procure
  assistance in quenching the flames. The rest of the work-people, as they
  arrived, either went off on similar errands, or clustered round the outside
  of the building.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the devouring element pursued its unchecked course, and spreading
  with the rapidity already indicated, it soon enveloped the whole of the ground-floor.
  The flames had, indeed, begun to consume the staircase, and had singed the
  rafters, before notice of their peril reached the few occupants of the upper
  story.</p>
  <p>Mr. Newton and the surveyor of the office were first alarmed by a subdued
  murmur or buzz produced by the conversation of the mass of people who were
  below looking on at the spectacle.</p>
  <p>The attitude and conduct of the crowd was afterwards the subject of much
  inquiry and no little suspicion, but there really was no ground for either
  doubt or astonishment. If the fire had broken out at night, there is every
  reason to believe that the natural tones of alarm would have taken a louder
  form of demonstration. If such a fire had broken out in London, where persons
  are customarily to be found at all times on every floor of a large warehouse,
  and where the comparative familiarity of people with such incidents leads
  them to take wiser steps than provincials, the shout of &ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo; would
  probably have been at once raised even in broad daylight. But that people
  unaccustomed to such things, paralysed by terror to a large extent, and in
  a still greater degree stupefied by wonderment, made no shouts loud enough
  to arrest the conversation of the endangered little party above, is not,
  it appears to me, very remarkable.</p>
  <p>The sounds which first greeted the ears of Mr. Albert Newton and his guest
  caused them to listen, and simultaneously one man in the mob (for a mob had
  by this time formed) did shout &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; A smell of singed material
  also greeted the nostrils of the little party.</p>
  <p>It is needless to say, that these persons immediately rushed to the window
  with the view of ascertaining what was the matter, and determining the course
  to be pursued if, as they had already almost ascertained, their own lives
  were in jeopardy.</p>
  <p>The appearance of Mr. Albert Newton at the window elicited a shriek from
  the women and girls, and a corresponding cry of alarm from the men below.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Albert Newton, &ldquo;our place is on
  fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, the flames burst through the lower windows in a dense mass;
  and although the part of the building in which the manufacturer and his guest
  were standing was considerably to the east of that part on which the fire
  had taken its principal hold, there was sufficient palpable cause of danger
  to whiten the cheeks of both men, and to cause the proprietor&mdash;who had,
  of course, far less experience in such matters than the surveyor, Mr. Phillimore&mdash;to
  betray a degree of confusion which gave that worthy gentleman perhaps more
  anxiety than the fire alone could have done.</p>
  <p>With a degree of calmness and self-possession worthy of the crisis, Mr.
  Phillimore asked Mr. Newton what means of escape they had, and implored him
  to be calm, as it might need all their self-possession as well as their courage
  to extricate themselves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we leap out of the window?&rdquo; exclaimed the embarrassed
  man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the firm reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think we can safely descend the staircase?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The party then descended one flight of stairs, but found a dense vapour
  issuing up the staircase,&mdash;an impassable difficulty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are lost!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Newton.</p>
  <p>The surveyor&rsquo;s countenance betrayed intense anxiety as he apprehended
  that the terrified man&rsquo;s ejaculation involved an awful truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us seek the roof. Have you any rope at hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Mr. Newton.</p>
  <p>Silently and rapidly they flew rather than ran up the stairs, Newton leading
  the way to where a quantity of stout hempen rope, of a quarter of an inch
  diameter, was lying in a corner of a room devoted to empty packages and waste.</p>
  <p>The surveyor&rsquo;s experienced eye measured the extent and capacity of
  this medium of escape with considerable accuracy, and saw that it would suffice
  for the purpose of liberating them, if they had the discretion to wisely
  use the means at their disposal.</p>
  <p>Scarcely a word was exchanged between the two men. In almost total silence
  Mr. Phillimore drew out the first piece of rope and fastened it adroitly
  round the waist and under the arms of the proprietor of the establishment,
  and then fastened another length of the cord to the one which encircled his
  terrified companion. The third end was joined in the same manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will, I think, serve our purpose,&rdquo; were the first words
  uttered, and these were spoken by the surveyor.</p>
  <p>Mr. Newton may be excused for the selfishness which allowed him to avail
  himself of this means of escape, without much thought about his saviour.
  Few men under the like circumstances would have acted otherwise than he did.
  It is only in such cases as a ship on fire at sea that heroism, which is
  ordinarily slow in its manifestations, rises to the height of that generosity
  which seeks the preservation of another rather than oneself. Trade does not,
  perhaps, tend to bring out the finest qualities of our nature. Domestic affections
  are the most rapid in generating a spirit of self-denial or self-sacrifice.
  Brother may yield the boon or privilege of life to his brother, the husband
  to his wife, or the mother to her child; but strangers, or casual acquaintances,
  are not given to the manifestation of those sublime virtues, self-abnegation
  and self-sacrifice.</p>
  <p>Perhaps, however, Mr. Phillimore might not have parted with the first chance
  of extrication from the now rapidly consuming flames, if he had not been
  enabled, by professional sagacity and long training, to ascertain that his
  own best means of self-preservation really lie through the preservation,
  in the first instance, of his companion. He had a better chance of extrication
  when Mr. Newton had reached the cool earth below, than while he remained
  in the upper story dreading every moment that most horrible of all fates&mdash;death
  by fire. When the one man most liable to panic had been removed from peril,
  the other would have entire command, as he saw, of such agencies as were
  then within the equal control of both.</p>
  <p>Mr. Phillimore converted one of the sashes into a sort of windlass, or made
  it at least serve the purpose of a pulley, and by a process that requires
  no description he lowered the frightened man to within a yard or two of the
  ground, the rope being not quite long enough to permit of his feet touching.</p>
  <p>While dangling in this position, the crowd below shrieked and shouted, and
  were palsied and confused. One or two, however, had sufficient presence of
  mind to understand the crisis, and they instantly flew to a neighbouring
  builder&rsquo;s yard, from which a ladder was procured tall enough to reach
  the height at which Mr. Albert Newton was suspended.</p>
  <p>The flames at this moment were just beginning to shed their vivid light
  through an adjacent window on the ground-floor at this angle of the building
  when the last means of escape arrived. It was the work of a moment to plant
  the ladder against the wall. One cool-headed fellow ascended the steps, placed
  his arm round the waist of his suspended and now almost lifeless master,
  disengaged him from the rope, and brought him down in safety amid the shouts
  of the crowd beneath.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile second thoughts had entered the head of Mr. Phillimore, whose
  danger had been of course greatly increased during the space of time covered
  by the incidents I have just narrated. He ran about the floor in search of
  further rope, perceiving for the first time, perhaps, that he would require
  a greater length to effect his own deliverance. Happily, in a packing-case
  he discovered some other pieces of cord, not so reliable in quality as that
  which had completed a work of mercy in his hands; but of course he had to
  use such material as he could, and to trust the contingencies of its strength
  and tension. He had spliced the pieces of rope he last discovered, which
  were of short lengths and unequal thickness the one to the other, when his
  attention was again aroused by the voice of the crowd below, shouting to
  warn him that the flames were beginning to burst from every opening at the
  end of the building beneath his feet; while, it may be observed, the fire
  had also just begun to reach the third story at the end where it commenced.</p>
  <p>Newton had before this been released, and the further extremity of the rope
  which had encircled his body had itself began to catch fire.</p>
  <p>The coolness and discrimination of Mr. Phillimore began to desert him.</p>
  <p>He told me that he became sensible of giddiness or approaching vertigo.
  By a strong effort of will he conquered the present most serious danger,
  and his judgment and prudence rose again with the extremity of his peril.</p>
  <p>He joined all the rope together&mdash;that which he had last found to that
  which had been used in the deliverance of Newton&mdash;and fastening one
  end of the cord round his body, he slowly and cautiously lowered himself
  until he began to feel the scorching flames about his extremities.</p>
  <p>The cord was not quite long enough!</p>
  <p>Another awful sensation of approximate death overtook him; and he afterwards
  informed me that he knows not how he contrived to complete the work of his
  own deliverance.</p>
  <p>In truth, however, as I afterwards learned from two of the bystanders, with,
  it seemed to them, wonderful regularity, although with extraordinary speed,
  he continued to lower himself right through a mass of belching flame. When
  he landed on the ground, it was seen that his coat-tails were ignited, and
  that his face was terribly scorched. He must have closed his eyes, or he
  would inevitably have been blinded.</p>
  <p>Happily the fire had not consumed the wall nor the floor, and it was possible
  for three or four of the most daring spectators to rush forward, seize the
  now swooning and senseless man, and carry him off to a surgeon&rsquo;s hard
  by. Here he received immediate attention, and he was afterwards removed to
  an hotel, where he lay delirious for several days; but at length his reason
  was restored, his wounds dressed, and he was enabled to proceed to his residence
  in London. Under the skilful treatment of an eminent surgeon, he thoroughly
  recovered. Although a trace or two of the flames were indelibly marked upon
  his countenance, they were but faint or slight traces.</p>
  <p>Nothing effectual could be done for the preservation of the building. The
  fire for some time pursued its devastating course altogether without let
  or hindrance. At length an engine from the town-hall arrived, and began to
  throw a feeble jet of water among the flames. It seemed, however, to produce
  not the slightest possible effect, and its operation looked very like a satire
  or mockery. The entire of the building was gutted; the whole of the stock,
  materials, &amp;c., of the factory were consumed; the machinery was rendered
  useless, and not much less than 20,000<i>l.</i> damage was altogether perpetrated;
  but this included the injury to the old premises, which were insured by the
  landlord.</p>
  <p>I cannot tell how it happened that very imperfect reports of this fire reached
  London, or were circulated in the newspapers of the district. Perhaps it
  was, as I have been told, because the local reporter was a man of inferior
  descriptive power, and unable to give didactic interest or picturesqueness
  to the narrative he wrote, without which, it is needless to inform the reader,
  no account of any thing is palatable to the reading public, and with which
  comparatively small matters can be made interesting, or even sensational.
  Perhaps it was because Mr. Newton&rsquo;s brother and co-partner did not
  want to invest the case with more importance than he could possibly help,
  and was indeed rather anxious that no more noise should be made about it
  than was inevitable. I have heard it stated that he knew the only representative
  of the local press in the town, and sought him out, or was sought out by
  him, and that he dictated or inspired the feeble and uninteresting narrative
  that was published of the event.</p>
  <p>These circumstances or rumours are just of sufficient importance to the
  developments of the case I am about to describe to justify my stating them.</p>
  <p>I should mention that Mr. Henry Newton, the other proprietor of the manufactory,
  was absent at Birmingham. He was indeed travelling on behalf of the firm
  of which he was a member, and knew nothing of the catastrophe until informed
  of it by a telegram, when he of course repaired homewards with all possible
  speed.</p>
  <p>The cause of this fire was never certainly ascertained; but a likely hypothesis,
  which a jury might believe, was that it arose out of the negligence of the
  gas-fitters. These men went to dinner at the same time as the ordinary work-people
  of the factory; and on doing so, stopped by a wooden plug one end of a gas-pipe
  that was connected to the metre, and enveloped an unfinished joint, also
  near to the metre, in white lead and tow. The gas at this time was not turned
  on at the metre, or so it was thought; and the most mysterious feature of
  the case is, how it was afterwards turned on. This point, however, could
  not be cleared up, and the <i>onus</i> of so doing did not, of course, rest
  upon the insured.</p>
  <p>In due course a claim was made upon the company. It was investigated; and
  although suspicions were entertained in the neighbourhood of the Mansion
  House, where their office was situate, that the calamity was the work of
  an incendiary, the fact could not be proved, and the amount of the insurance
  was ultimately paid.</p>
  <p>Messrs. Newton contended that the sum they obtained from the fire-office
  was insufficient to cover the value of their machinery, stock, fixtures, &amp;c.
  They further alleged that they had sustained considerable loss by the suspension
  of their trade, and they accordingly brought an action against the gas company
  who supplied the town, and who had undertaken to lay the pipes in the premises.</p>
  <p>This action was defended up to the day of trial, and stood high on the special-jury
  list at Guildhall one morning. The cause immediately preceding it had nearly
  terminated. The judge was summing up in that cause. A rather numerous body
  of spectators (among whom I might have been seen) were awaiting, with various
  degrees of interest, the case of &ldquo;Newton <i>v.</i> the H&mdash; Gas
  Company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this stage of the case, a consultation across the bar took place between
  Sergeant Bustle and Mr. Quicke, Q.C., the principal learned counsel or &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; for
  the plaintiff and for the defendant, which ended in their suggesting to his
  Lordship (Mr. Baron Snapwell) that an arrangement might probably be effected
  between the parties, if his Lordship would kindly permit the case to stand
  over until to-morrow. His Lordship, with a show of reluctance, but I believe
  with perfect willingness to get rid of a long and intricate case, consented
  to the request, and all I have further to tell the reader about it is, that
  the anticipations of these learned gentlemen were realised.</p>
  <p>A compromise was effected. Messrs. Newton Brothers obtained a rather liberal
  sum by way of further compensation for their injuries and loss through the
  conflagration.</p>
  <p>Another extraordinary and suspicious circumstance was the death shortly
  afterwards of Mr. Paterson, the late proprietor of this establishment, to
  whom Newton Brothers were indebted in a considerable sum. This happened about
  four months after the fire, and under these circumstances. He was living
  in the town, not having yet determined into what fresh business he would
  embark, and not, it is believed, having received all the consideration he
  had bargained for from the firm to whom he had transferred his business.</p>
  <p>The Newtons and Mr. Paterson had been passing an evening at the Dove Hotel,
  and had taken rather more brandy-and-water than any rational idea of temperance
  would sanction. Mr. Paterson left the Dove before the Newtons.</p>
  <p>His way lay across a canal, and in the morning he was found drowned. He
  had tumbled, as it appeared, somehow over the low parapet into the water.
  The Newtons left the house after him, and found their way home to their beds
  in safety. A coroner&rsquo;s inquest sat upon the body of the deceased, and
  returned an open verdict of &ldquo;Found drowned.&rdquo; Some people in the
  town and neighbourhood, among whom were the Newtons, professed much grief
  at the calamity. The new firm said, indeed, it appeared as if the place and
  all connected with it were under a spell or a brand. They declared that it
  seemed as if Providence had resolved nothing should prosper in connexion
  with this particular manufactory. How, or for what reason, they could not
  tell; but here was the death, it might be by accident, or it might be by
  suicide, in a state of drunkenness, of their predecessor, not long after
  they had lost every thing (as they in the freedom of their language said
  they had) through a fire on the premises.</p>
  <p>The insurance company heard of the death of Mr. Paterson, and the secretary
  got it into his head that the Newtons were incendiaries and murderers&mdash;that
  they had killed this man for some evil reason best known to themselves. He
  consulted the solicitors of the company, and they employed me to sift the
  mystery, and, if it turned out that the secretary&rsquo;s suspicions were
  justifiable, to spare no trouble or expense in obtaining evidence upon which
  to prosecute the alleged miscreants.</p>
  <p>I went down secretly, and investigated all the circumstances as far as I
  could. I collected a variety of little scraps of fact, which left no doubt
  in my mind that the secretary was right. I came, indeed, to the conclusion
  that these Newtons were the vilest wretches who had for a long time been
  permitted to escape the hangman. Yet, frankly let me say, I could not gather
  enough information on which to rest an indictment with the likelihood of
  securing a conviction.</p>
  <p>I need hardly point out to the reader how very complete my evidence must
  have been before I could have recommended the company to incur the risk of
  a prosecution. If, for instance, they failed in conclusively establishing
  the guilt of the insurers, the institution would be irreparably damaged in
  public estimation. Popular opinion, and newspaper commentators, would say
  the company set up this odious defence in order to escape payment of a just
  claim. The accused would be elevated into the ranks of martyrdom. The company
  would have to pay all that was demanded from them, with costs, and they might
  almost as well afterwards give up business, or set the lawyers to work to
  liquidate the affairs of their institution in Chancery. So that after laying
  my statement in detail before the solicitors of the company (who paid me
  handsomely for my services), they drew up a report with their comments and
  opinions upon my facts; the matter was considered by the board of directors,
  and there for the time it dropped.</p>
  <p>It was not exactly dropped either. I was employed to keep my eye upon the
  Newtons without intermission for a couple of years, if I felt it necessary
  to prolong the scrutiny so far&mdash;which instructions I had no unwillingness
  to obey.</p>
  <p>Through the medium of several of my assistants, who were changed from time
  to time, the subsequent career of these persons was noted down with a degree
  of accuracy which afterwards proved very useful to the interests of metropolitan
  insurance companies in particular, and to the interests of society and the
  cause of justice in general.</p>
  <p>Among the persons in the town where the dismantled factory was situate whose
  acquaintance I made, and whose confidence I thought I had gained, was the
  widow of the drowned late proprietor. She grieved over the premature loss
  of her husband, but had no apparent suspicion, or at least disclosed to me
  no suspicion, that he had met his death by foul play. I, among other expedients,
  condoled with her, discoursed about the lamentable effects of intoxication,
  eulogised the memory of her husband, lightly and softly touching the subject
  of that peculiar weakness for the bottle which had led to his untimely death.
  But none of these conversations elicited from her any suggestion that he
  had been murdered by the Newtons.</p>
  <p>Not long after the money had been paid I discovered that, clever as I thought
  I had been, I had been outwitted; but not by the Newtons, about whom let
  there be no further mystery with the reader. They were what the secretary
  had thought, and what I had become convinced&mdash;they were vile wretches,
  fit for the hangman, and rotten-ripe for the gallows. I had been outwitted
  by a woman&rsquo;s ingenuity. No one suspected me or my mission in the town
  (as it afterwards turned out) except the widow Paterson. She had somehow
  got to know my name and real character, and had been fencing with me or humbugging
  me, and was prepared, when occasion or opportunity arose, to use me. At the
  risk of losing some of my <i>prestige</i> with the reader, I am frank enough
  to fairly admit this.</p>
  <p>Shortly after Messrs. Newton Brothers had received the reward of their villany
  from the fears of the insurance company, and, so to speak, through the broken
  links in the evidence of their rascality and scoundrelism, an anonymous letter
  was received by me, the substance of which I may communicate to the reader.
  It was a statement in effect that the insurance company had been robbed by
  the Newtons, who had set fire to their own factory in order to achieve their
  ends; and that the writer was, under proper guarantees, disposed to put me
  on the track of a successful investigation into the mystery of the crime.
  The writer required that I should answer the letter, in the first place,
  by an advertisement in the second column of the <i>Times</i>, on the morning
  of the third day after receipt of the letter. The form of that advertisement
  was given me, which I was only to insert if I consented to the terms, could
  give the required guarantees, and was prepared to follow up the clue to be
  communicated to me.</p>
  <p>I saw the solicitors of the company, and with them saw the secretary, when
  it was arranged that I should accept the terms, see the writer, give the
  guarantee, and follow up the investigation as it might seem to me expedient,
  drawing from the company such expenses and remuneration as I might think
  necessary to incur. After the advertisement, and one or two preliminary letters,
  I met the writer of the first letter at an appointed place. The writer of
  that letter was the widow Paterson. She was a remarkable woman, that Mrs.
  Paterson; by no means handsome or beautiful, yet by no means decidedly the
  reverse of either. She was not masculine, and she had certainly none of the
  delicacies of her sex. She was an unscrupulous, designing, wicked woman,
  cherishing and respecting her own comfort and material welfare more than
  any thing else. I believe she was sorry to lose her husband, but anxious
  to make the best use of her misfortune, and chiefly disappointed when she
  ascertained that his loss also involved the loss of money due to him which
  she expected to have had the enjoyment of in connexion with him.</p>
  <p>When we met we were a little embarrassed. She was startled by the success
  of her former <i>ruse</i> and concealment. I was disconcerted, if not somewhat
  humbled, by the then evident truth that I had been all along known to her
  while I had been, as I thought, pumping her. This embarrassment, however,
  soon yielded to business. She gave me an insight into a plot of which I had
  hitherto not had a complete idea.</p>
  <p>She could not positively assert that her husband had been murdered. On that
  head she had her suspicions, as others had. All she could say distinctly
  was, that the Newtons had burned down their house. The fact was, that her
  husband had been embarrassed. The Newtons had seen this, and proposed to
  him an elaborate scheme for defrauding the insurance company. The same means
  would also enable him to get time from his creditors, who might afterwards
  be arranged with, or &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; by a bankruptcy, as thereafter
  should seem desirable. Meanwhile the Newtons and he were to take parts in
  the great scheme of fraud. They settled between them the extension of the
  premises and the burning of the manufactory, the claim upon the company,
  and the division of the spoil. All these arrangements had been carried out,
  as the reader is aware, except the last part of the programme, which was
  the subject of another fraud, illustrating a truth I have so frequently insisted
  upon&mdash;that there is no honour among thieves.</p>
  <p>Newtons might or might not have overtaken Paterson after he left the Dove,
  who, being drunk, could not walk towards his home very quickly. They might
  or might not have pitched him over the canal-bridge into the water; but it
  was clear that they conceived his death gave an opportunity for cheating
  him, or rather his widow, out of his share of the proceeds of their joint
  crime. Mrs. Paterson was in her husband&rsquo;s confidence about the destruction
  of his premises. This was a little circumstance the Newtons were unacquainted
  with. On the other hand, Paterson had often told them that he did not let
  his wife know every thing, and had so frequently spoken in disrespectful
  terms of the gentle sex (especially on the score of speech or intrigue),
  that he led them to believe his wife knew nothing about the conspiracy; but
  in point of fact she had been informed all about it. She had held her peace,
  since Paterson&rsquo;s death, to see how Messrs. Newton would behave when
  they got the insurance money, secretly having resolved all the while that
  if they played her false, or did not hand over to her what she considered
  her fair share, or what it was arranged her husband should have, she would &ldquo;let
  the cat out of the bag,&rdquo; and assist the officers of justice in raising
  that firm to the level of a platform outside the county gaol, where Mr. Jack
  Ketch had previously been known to perform in a few dismal tragedies. When
  the Newtons got the money she boldly made her demand upon them. They affected
  to be indignant, and they menaced her with a criminal information for slander,
  which raised her fears a little, for she did not clearly see how she was
  to establish her case against them. She was lawyer enough to know that in
  any criminal proceedings against her, her mouth would be shut, by the forms
  of that branch of English jurisprudence. It required not much self-possession
  on her part to hold her tongue a while longer, to simulate, if not satisfaction,
  at least resignation, at the loss of her share of the plunder. She however
  determined to place herself in communication with me, in the full reliance
  that I could with her aid, overtake the villains, who had not been true to
  their compact of rascality, and get them punished, as they deserved to be,
  if not for their original crimes, for their want of honour to the confederate.</p>
  <p>I listened to her story, and noted all the circumstances she could relate.
  I made another report, that went through the same ordeal or ceremonial which
  my former report was submitted to, and with about the like result. This woman&rsquo;s
  evidence was tainted. She did not indeed want to be brought forward. She
  trembled under the fear of being murdered by some other confederates of the
  Newtons, if she were the ostensible and avowed agent of their punishment.
  She wanted &ldquo;the thing done without using her.&rdquo; It appeared to
  me, and to the other adviser of the insurance company, that with her evidence
  a prosecution of the Newtons was not a perfectly safe experiment; and that
  without such support an indictment was an exceedingly dangerous expedient
  for the company.</p>
  <p>It is needless to observe that the disclosures of this woman rendered the
  fact of the Newtons&rsquo; crime doubly certain to <i>us</i>; but all that
  could still be done was to watch and wait another opportunity for bringing
  these wretches to justice.</p>
  <p>The explanations which I had from Mrs. Paterson were to the effect that,
  although her husband was pecuniarily embarrassed at the time when he sold
  the business, a large portion of the money owing was money that he held as
  trustee, and which, being in the funds, railway stocks &amp;c., he had the
  exclusive management of, having taken all the securities several years ago
  out of the hands of the lawyers concerned in the trust. There was no one
  to check his malversation, and by the simple expedient of keeping the interest
  paid, he escaped detection. At length, finding that the affair was getting
  beyond his control, the means of his permanently concealing it being rendered
  more and more difficult by its magnitude, and the fact that losses in trade,
  perhaps the interest upon the lost capital, swelled up an awful total, he
  took the Newtons into his confidence, and the set devised a scheme for colourably
  selling his stock-in-trade, fixtures, good-will, &amp;c., &amp;c., for extending
  the premises, and so forth, and burning the place down, so as to realise
  a large sum in ready money&mdash;considerably more than the value of the
  things insured. By these means he hoped to retrieve his position as trustee,
  and put a tidy sum of money in his own pocket&mdash;his confederates, the
  Newtons, of course also profiting somewhat largely.</p>
  <p>Paterson was a peculiar and self-reliant man. Moreover, he could not rely
  upon getting any solicitor to enter into such a confederacy. It is absolutely
  certain that if he could induce any one in the legal profession to join in
  such a villanous compact, he would have been the very lowest among low attorneys.
  He would in all probability have known sufficiently well how to screen himself,
  and also how to swallow and retain the lion&rsquo;s share of the plunder.
  All these things were evident to Mr. Paterson, so he kept the bills of exchange
  which the Newtons had given him in his own hands, and dreading burglary,
  or the fraudulent and surreptitious removal of them from the apartments he
  now occupied during his absence, if an opportunity of any kind were furnished,
  he usually carried these documents about with him in his pocket-book when
  he left home. This was, of course, a dangerous plan, and one that any honest
  man in an ordinary position would not adopt; but perhaps, after all, it was
  the safest for such a man as Paterson in the position he then stood.</p>
  <p>The Newtons knew of Paterson&rsquo;s fraudulent trusteeship. They were sufficiently
  in his confidence to have obtained nearly all the information which enabled
  them to keep him at arm&rsquo;s length. And of course Paterson also knew
  of the exaggerated claim which had been presented to the insurance company,
  based upon inventories and papers supplied to them by him on the transfer
  of the business. It is hard to say that either was more deeply implicated
  in the villany than the other; although it is clear that Paterson, who stood
  behind the scenes and was screened from observation by the prominent defrauders,
  was, in reality at least, as deep, and perhaps more deeply, involved in the
  swindle and arson than either of the Newtons. The situation of the parties
  towards each other was not very unlike that thieves ordinarily stand in.
  One had reason to fear the other, and there was in consequence mutual jealousy,
  distrust, and apprehension.</p>
  <p>After leaving the Dove, I had no doubt that the Newtons hastened in the
  direction that Paterson had; go homewards, and succeeded in overtaking him;
  that, being partially intoxicated he was easily grasped and held by his whilom
  confederates, one of whom probably held his hand over the victim&rsquo;s
  mouth while the other hastily seized his pocket-book, removed from it the
  acceptances which had been given him on the transfer of the business, &amp;c.,
  after which he was pitched into the water. When taken from the canal and
  searched, a pocket-book was found upon the person of the murdered incendiary,
  and in it all the papers that he was known to carry except the acceptances,
  which were, to the mind of Mrs. Paterson, painfully conspicuous by their
  absence.</p>
  <p>I have explained that the Newtons did not know that Mrs. Paterson was in
  her husband&rsquo;s confidence; that they imagined she was not; and that
  he, with a desire for counter-check which distinguishes the suspicious, taught
  them so to believe. He would frequently say, when Mrs. Paterson&rsquo;s name
  transpired in their conversations prior and subsequently to the fire, that &ldquo;he
  never trusted a woman with a secret of any importance, as she was sure to
  blab or peach,&rdquo; &amp;c. As I have said, however, he was all the while
  disclosing to her the conspiracy and plot. She was thoroughly informed of
  every circumstance, and knew all about their proceedings from first to last
  as well as either of the Newtons did.</p>
  <p>After her husband&rsquo;s death, in her emergency, before seeking me she
  consulted those well-known criminal lawyers, Messrs. Levy Levy, Brothers,
  and Sons, who (except when they attend a police-court, and think a demonstration
  requisite for the vindication of their skill to the newspaper-reading World,
  as an advertisement for business in the same line) conceive that the Carlylese
  or Chinese motto about silence embodies the prime wisdom or the highest sagacity.
  They recommended Mrs. Paterson to wait and hold her tongue&mdash;for the
  present. She did this until she knew that the money had been paid by the
  insurance company, of which circumstance she then informed her clever Mosaic
  attorneys. They, upon hearing this circumstance from their client, wisely
  and shrewdly, perhaps, told her the time had now arrived for action, that
  they were the people to act, and that she had better leave herself in their
  hands. To this she readily consented; for, as I have said, the Newtons inspired
  her with awe. If she had not been sensible that she had an advantage in her
  knowledge of them, and that they at the present moment had no conception
  she was aware of their villany, she would have trembled lest, as the greed
  of the brothers led them to the murder of her husband in order to prevent
  further disclosures, they would murder her.</p>
  <p>The action of her attorneys was not a very remarkable or, I think, skilful
  performance. One thing to be said is, these gentlemen have an enormous amount
  of very lucrative business, and it does not, I believe, pay them to bestow
  much thought upon any thing. For instance, when some wholesale forger, some
  coiner in an extensive way of business, some pivot of pick-pocketing or burglary,
  or the member of any gang, is arrested, he sends immediately for Messrs.
  Levy Levy, Brothers, and Sons, and, to secure their best services, makes
  them a large payment. They hear what he has got to say. They attend the police-court,
  bully the witnesses for the prosecution, make every conceivable statement
  about their client&rsquo;s respectability within the limits that evidence
  will permit; and although, almost as a matter of course in these cases, the
  criminal gets sent for trial, he goes away to the House of Detention rejoicing
  in the confident belief that he has got, at all events, the best criminal
  lawyers in the country to defend him. When he comes up for trial, out of
  the hundred or two hundred pounds or more which Messrs. Levy Levy and family
  have extracted from the prisoner, his relatives, his connexions, or his gang,
  these attorneys give a brief or a couple of briefs to counsel, which contain
  little if any thing more than copies of the depositions taken before the
  magistrates, and on the back of those briefs are severally indorsed, &ldquo;Mr.
  Noxious Sound, 10 guineas;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Modest Emptypurse, 2 guineas.&rdquo; The
  leader of these two gentlemen perhaps tries to pick a hole in the indictment,
  which has for several years past been not very serviceable to prisoners,
  because if the hole is but a small one, and unless the bench can be satisfied
  that the indictment, as it stands, describes a different offence to that
  which a prisoner has been arrested upon, or has come prepared to meet, it
  is amended in court so as to cure the defect which Mr. Noxious Sound&rsquo;s
  not miraculous penetration has discovered. Or Mr. Sound may raise what thieves
  call a &ldquo;pint of law&rdquo; for the Court of Criminal Appeal, about
  which it is needless to say any thing, except that the case then easily glides
  from the lower to higher tribunal and that in its course Messrs. Levy Levy
  and kindred get another considerable lump of money out of it. While they
  thus realise enormous incomes by a process so facile, and one which involves
  no responsibility and taxes no intellect&mdash;a thing, by the way, nearly
  impossible, for the Levys have not much of the latter article among the lot
  of them&mdash;they are not disposed, even under what would to the ordinary
  solicitor be a temptation of liberal costs, to take a vast deal of trouble,
  or, as one of them would observe, &ldquo;put themselves far out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Messrs. Levy Levy and family wrote to Messrs. Newton Brothers a letter,
  which stated that they had been called upon and consulted by a client on
  a matter in which they (Messrs. Newton Brothers) were concerned; and that
  they (Messrs. Levy Levy and kindred) would be glad to see them (Messrs. Newton
  Brothers).</p>
  <p>Mr. Albert Newton received this letter and opened it. When he communicated
  it to his brother, that gentleman elegantly observed that he thought he &ldquo;smelt
  a rat;&rdquo; but I do not think he exactly comprehended who the rat was,
  or its location. However, the firm also thought it desirable to consult attorneys.
  Newtons would have gone to Messrs. Levy Levy and family; but as the professional
  services of these renowned pettifoggers were forestalled, Newton Brothers
  put themselves into communication with another Levy, who is an attorney,
  and may or may not be, for any thing I know, a kinsman of the members of
  the great Old Bailey house. He called upon Messrs. Levy Levy and family,
  and the result was, that Mrs. Paterson, when she next waited upon them, was
  told it was &ldquo;an ugly affair,&rdquo; and that they &ldquo;did not see
  how to move in it without peril.&rdquo; They talked to her in the language
  of professional wisdom&mdash;and slang. They said something about stinks
  that were stirred smelling all the more because of the operation, and used
  other unequally sage observations. The widow was not broken-hearted, but
  certainly crest-fallen, and eminently, although silently, indignant.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Paterson vowed vengeance, although the inarticulate form of her protestations
  saved their being registered any where to her disadvantage. She now determined
  to take her own course in bringing down upon the heads of her husband&rsquo;s
  confederates in the swindle and in the arson, and her husband&rsquo;s murderers,
  the vengeance of the law. She was ultimately led by this amiable turn of
  reflection to communicate with me, and the reader has already been told the
  immediate result.</p>
  <p>Popular belief, I am sorry to say, in the town where the bonnet-factory
  had stood, was largely tinged with prejudice or superstition, which materially
  assisted Newtons&rsquo; future plans. Paterson&rsquo;s breach of trust became
  known; his losses in trade also became generally known. The fire having broken
  out so soon after the transfer of the business had been effected, and the
  suicide&mdash;as it was said&mdash;of the late proprietor, all confirmed
  the mass of the people there in the Newtonian belief that a spell, or witchery,
  or fatal influence of some kind, hung over the establishment. Newtons&rsquo; professions
  of faith of the same kind did not, therefore, appear remarkable. A few people
  wondered, but nobody except the insurance office suspected the reason why
  the firm determined not to resume business there. They were content to pay
  such debts as they had contracted in the neighbourhood, to display a little
  kindness to a few of the workpeople in the bitterest distress; and having
  thus obtained a very pleasant reputation, they quitted the neighbourhood
  for London, intending, as they said, to embark in some other line of enterprise.</p>
  <p>I kept close watch upon the culprits, and knew all their movements; but
  still I could not, for a long time, bring any thing home to them with sufficient
  precision to warrant a prosecution by the insurance company. Among the things
  I did, however, discover, was an abundant series of links in a chain of evidence
  which, some day, I felt certain I could attach at its extremity to a great
  crime; and although my employers were, I think, getting a little impatient,
  as I also think I was myself, I never doubted that the result would be, if
  not the hanging of the Newtons, their certain condemnation to the bulks or
  a convict prison for the term of their natural lives.</p>
  <p>I also ascertained that these villains were mixed up with, in divers ways,
  a gang who for many years past, and for some years after the date of this
  narrative, played a prominent part in, or were at the root of, all the great
  crimes of London, and many of those in the provinces. The Newtons appeared
  to have a special department of the criminal business allotted to or taken
  up by them. Although they had been concerned in a forgery or two, in a railway &ldquo;plant,&rdquo; and
  a burglary on a grand scale, yet their preference was to get up fires. They
  had been concerned as subordinates and screened performers in a large incendiary
  fire at Whitechapel, in another at Manchester, and, I also believe, one in
  Liverpool.</p>
  <p>After about sixteen months&rsquo; waiting and watching&mdash;during which
  time the Newtons had made one or two pleasure-trips to the Continent, had
  resided at various parts of the metropolis in superior furnished apartments,
  and had patronised tailors extensively for various costumes&mdash;I ascertained
  that they had resolved to re-commence business.</p>
  <p>One of them, Mr. Henry Newton, went into the west of England, to the town
  of B&mdash;, and took a large house and shop there, which he opened as a
  music-seller&rsquo;s and a pianoforte warehouse. Next door to the goodly
  and capacious premises which Mr. Henry Newton had taken, was a small, dwarfed,
  and not by any means pretty building. This had been not long before to let,
  but had found a tenant about a month or six weeks before Mr. Newton took
  the adjacent more pretentious structure. The small house was opened, in a
  humble way of business, by an old man and woman. The old folk sold lollipops,
  fruit, children&rsquo;s books, &amp;c. Newton complained to the agent of
  the low character of this business, and went so far as to negotiate with
  the small shopkeeper for the surrender of his tenancy in the premises; but
  the negotiation broke off, in consequence of the small shopkeeper demanding
  what Mr. Newton thought any thing but a small price for his interest in the
  hovel. Mr. Newton declared that he had an unconquerable objection, on principle,
  to being swindled or robbed in that way. Rather than submit to the small
  shopkeeper&rsquo;s gross extortion, he said he would put up with the nuisance,
  although it would interfere with the respectable business he intended to
  carry on.</p>
  <p>I ought to explain, that Mr. Newton did not appear in the town under the
  name of Newton. He set up there as &ldquo;Keeling and Co., wholesale pianoforte
  manufacturers, dealers, and merchants.&rdquo; His establishment was called
  the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses,&rdquo; and a very pretty affair it was.</p>
  <p>Mr. Albert Newton remained in London. He started, under the title of &ldquo;Cross
  and Co.,&rdquo; as &ldquo;general commission-agent, importer, and merchants,&rdquo; near
  Tower Hill, and soon found himself engaged in rather extensive operations
  at home and abroad. He also served as a reference for his brother, Mr. Keeling.</p>
  <p>Mr. Keeling had not opened his premises long when he slightly intimated
  his intention to insure the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses.&rdquo; Several of
  the local agents of insurance companies left at his premises circulars and
  prospectuses, inviting him thereby to insure his life or his chattels, or
  both. He had interviews with two or three of the agents about terms, and
  was critical in comparing the different rates of their offices, the dates
  of their foundation, the respectability of their management, and all such
  other things as a prudent insurer would like to be well informed about. The
  upshot or result was, that he effected an insurance through the local agent
  of one of the oldest London offices (the title of which need not for the
  present be mentioned), although it cost him a trifle more than was asked
  by the agent of a modern office, because he had no belief, he said, in &ldquo;mushroom
  concerns.&rdquo; The agent, who profited by it, considered this decision
  a token of Mr. Keeling&rsquo;s sound practical judgment.</p>
  <p>Several pianos arrived, some large parcels of music, and other goods, which
  were duly taken from the railway station to the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses,&rdquo; by
  the railway servants, whose fatigue was usually lightened by a trifling <i>douceur</i> from
  Messrs. Keeling and Co.</p>
  <p>Messrs. Keeling&rsquo;s men, an assistant and a porter, were brought by
  them from London. The principal had been heard to say that nobody but London
  men could understand his way of business; and that although he liked the
  people of B&mdash; very well (especially the better classes), he could not
  put up with the trade assistants to be got in that town.</p>
  <p>Shortly after the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses&rdquo; was opened, the proprietor
  was scandalised by a little stall having been put outside the next house
  or hovel, with ginger-beer and other trifling articles of refreshment upon
  it for sale, which, indeed, seemed to be displayed with a sort of vulgar
  ostentation by the proprietor, as Keeling said, as a sort of means to annoy
  him, until he gave a fancy price in order to get rid of the fellow. In this,
  however, the small shopkeeper was not successful. Although Mr. Keeling&rsquo;s
  indignation and disgust were intense, he would not buy off the nuisance at
  the price demanded. He talked of going to law with the old man, and consulted
  the leading solicitor in the town about an action or an indictment; but was
  advised that the annoyance was insufficient to give him the remedy he sought.</p>
  <p>No business seemed to be done by Keeling and Co. A few pieces of music were
  sold. A good many people called to see the pianos; but the prices asked for
  them somewhat alarmed the customers. Mr. Keeling occasionally got disgusted,
  and assured his visitors he could not sell such articles as he had to sell
  at the prices they were expected to be sold for, although he knew that common
  trashy things could be supplied at those figures.</p>
  <p>One day there was a sale in London of the stock of a pianoforte manufacturer
  advertised in the daily papers. It announced an auction at some future day,
  unless the whole stock were previously disposed of by private contract, together
  with the lease and good-will of the manufacturer&rsquo;s premises. Mr. Keeling
  received a telegram from Messrs. Cross, which ran thus: &ldquo;See the <i>Times</i>.
  Advertisement, sale of Mr.&mdash;. Stock, good-will, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Keeling, after receiving this telegram, was very anxious to see the <i>Times</i>,
  which arrived in due course about mid-day. He sent to the railway station
  two or three times, and ultimately went up himself, to get an early copy
  of the paper. On his way there he met an acquaintance or two (one was my
  assistant, although he little dreamt it), whom he told there was a splendid
  opportunity, he thought, for buying a large stock, and perhaps getting a
  first-class Town business, to which his country trade of the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses&rdquo; might be added with advantage. He thought he might also
  be able to get a stock of pianos, of rather lower quality than he now had,
  which the people of B&mdash; might appreciate at the price he could offer
  them. After he had procured the <i>Times</i>, and taken care to explain to
  a few people the precise cause of his journey to London, he only awaited
  the arrival of the next up-train, and away he went to Town by it. He expected
  to be down the next day, but found this impossible, as he explained in a
  telegram to his assistant or shopman, but said that he would positively return
  on the day following.</p>
  <p>On the second night after Mr. Keeling&rsquo;s departure for London, about
  a quarter to twelve o&rsquo;clock, there was a cry of fire in the town of
  B&mdash;. The little hovel had caught light in the rear, and it happened
  that this wretched place actually joined the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses.&rdquo; A
  wooden outhouse behind the smaller structure also joined the back premises
  of the Temple, in which were stored packing-cases, straw, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>The flames soon demolished the straw-roofed lollipop-shop, and left nothing
  but a heap of ashes as a memorial of its devastation. The old man and his
  wife readily escaped, however, as the fire began at the back of the house,
  and they were not sound sleepers. Few old people, if we may believe the physiologists,
  do sleep soundly; so that to suspect the lollipop shopkeeper and his wife
  of incendiarism, on the ground of their escape, would be as absurd as it
  would be unjust. The old man was, moreover, not insured. What motive could
  he have to set his establishment on fire?</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Temple of the Muses&rdquo; fared not much better than the hovel.
  The walls and some of the cross-beams were left standing; but it was tolerably
  well gutted, and all the stock and furniture in it were consumed.</p>
  <p>It unfortunately happened that the town of B&mdash; had no appliances worth
  mentioning for the extinction of fire. It was worse off in this respect than
  the town in which Messrs. Newtons&rsquo; straw-bonnet manufactory was situate.
  There was the town-engine at B&mdash;, but it was found impracticable to
  get that crazy instrument into working order. It was a long time before the
  door of the engine-house could be opened for want of the key. It was then
  found impossible to get the parts of the engine together. Half of the town
  might have been destroyed before it could be got ready for use. Some portions
  of the hose were missing; the hinges were all rusty, and the metal-work dirty
  and corroded. The engine was, in point of fact, a wreck of time, and in an
  advanced stage of decay. But for this it is likely that the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses&rdquo; would not have sustained so much damage as it did; but
  happily no lives were lost in either building.</p>
  <p>Mr. Keeling being telegraphed for, rushed, with the rapidity of an express
  train, to the scene of what he called his misfortune, and met the condolences
  of every body there, not excepting his rivals and most jealous neighbours.</p>
  <p>The only man who could not understand the affair, but whose suspicions,
  if he had any, took no definite shape, was the agent of the company, deputy-registrar
  of births, deaths, and marriages, parish-clerk, undertaker, coal-merchant,
  and commission-agent. This respectable old gentleman informed every body
  that there had been no house on fire in B&mdash; for forty years. He had
  been agent for the insurance office thirty-four years himself; and, although
  he had taken in premiums not less than 10,000<i>l.</i>, he had never been
  called upon under one of those cases for a shilling.</p>
  <p>The poor old man seemed to think, or one might judge by his manner that
  he thought, a claim of 3000<i>l.</i>, which Messrs. Keeling and Co., of the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses,&rdquo; would have to present, would about ruin the office,
  and utterly destroy him as an agent. He was very anxious, therefore, to explain
  all about it; to show the care with which he had made an examination of the
  premises; to exhibit how unfortunate the contiguous position of the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses&rdquo; and the adjoining premises was; to demonstrate how little
  he could have expected that a fire would have broken out in that hovel; and
  how, if he had thought of such a thing, he must also have concluded that
  the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses&rdquo; would not have caught light before
  the flames could have been extinguished in the other building.</p>
  <p>The agent made a special journey to London, in order to see the board; and
  he did see the secretary, in an interview at which I was present. It was
  suggested by me that it could not be helped, and that such things must happen.
  The secretary said, &ldquo;Yes; he did not know but that a claim like that
  was, in the long-run, rather beneficial to the company than otherwise.&rdquo; The
  agent was consoled by the assurance that it might assist him in extending
  the operations of the company; that he might hope to make up the loss in
  new business; and that, indeed, he was entitled, when estimating the results
  of his own business with the company, to set off against this loss a larger
  amount, which he had during his thirty-four years&rsquo; agency remitted
  them.</p>
  <p>The poor old agent, who could be of no use to me in my investigations, went
  back to B&mdash;, and unconsciously did me a little service by trumpeting
  the statements of myself and the secretary as the settled conviction of the
  company that all was right, and that its intention was to pay the claim in
  the most handsome manner&mdash;all of which Mr. Keeling got to know, and
  was no doubt as much comforted thereby as the agent himself.</p>
  <p>One party in B&mdash; appeared likely to be over-looked&mdash;the old man
  and his wife who, previously to the fire, sold sweetmeats and fruit, &amp;c.
  next door to the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses.&rdquo; But the necessities of
  the venerable couple drove them before the public in a rather prominent shape.
  Handbills were printed in the town, and taken round by the old gentleman
  to the various shopkeepers and other inhabitants, in which hand-bill was
  set forth the melancholy accident which had burned his house down, destroyed
  his stock, and left him in beggary, as he was unfortunately not insured.
  A great deal of commisseration was excited in and beyond the town, and the
  poor couple got something like 100<i>l.</i> subscribed for them by voluntary
  contributions. A clergyman preached a sermon in the largest dissenting chapel
  of B&mdash; on the old man&rsquo;s special behalf; and the reverend gentleman
  drew such a pathetic description of the poor people&rsquo;s sufferings and
  forlorn condition, that a very tidy sum was dropped into the plates at the
  chapel-door as the congregation left the sacred edifice.</p>
  <p>The old man did not, however, set up in business immediately, because the
  house or hovel was not at once rebuilt. The owner of the land formed a notion
  of erecting upon it a more elegant structure than the one which had been
  destroyed, and the former tenant could not tell whether he would be able
  to occupy the old site or not.</p>
  <p>Messrs. Keeling and Co., of the &ldquo;Temple of the Muses,&rdquo; complained
  very bitterly about the destruction of their premises and stock, just as
  they were on the threshold of deriving the advantage of their invested capital
  and labours over the dreary season. They made a formal complaint to the local
  authorities as to the construction of the building, and contended that if
  similar arrangements to those which prevailed in the metropolis had existed
  in B&mdash;, that is to say, if, for instance, proper party-walls had been
  erected between all the edifices in the town of B&mdash;, the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses&rdquo; would not have been ignited by the fire in the adjoining
  hovel. In fact, Mr. Keeling pretty extensively ventilated the grievance of
  his firm, although it never transpired who was represented by the &ldquo;Co.&rdquo; He
  also, of course, commented with very legitimate warmth upon the wretched
  condition of the town fire-engine, and on the lack of means for extinguishing
  the flames before they had acquired a hold over the premises.</p>
  <p>It is perhaps unnecessary to say that after this fire my inquiries were
  pursued with great vigilance, and that a careful watch was kept upon Mr.
  Keeling and upon Mr. Cross.</p>
  <p>I advised the company to adopt a bold course; but the solicitors to whom
  this advice was directly given, in the first place, hesitated about endorsing
  it. The secretary of the company, whom I had reason to see on more than one
  occasion, for the purpose of examining the papers sent in by Messrs. Keeling
  and Co. when the assurance was effected, also shared the timidity of the
  company&rsquo;s legal advisers. Still I was told to pursue my investigations,
  and I did so.</p>
  <p>A correspondence ensued between Mr. Keeling and the secretary of the company
  immediately after the fire. The secretary was rather wily, but Mr. Keeling
  was as acute. After some parleying, and the exchange of one or two letters,
  the secretary, in a fit of impatience, told Mr. Keeling that the company
  had their doubts about the <i>bon&acirc; fides</i> of his claim, and that
  he thought it was possible it might be resisted.</p>
  <p>On receiving this intimation from the secretary, Mr. Keeling was indignant,
  and demanded an interview with the board of directors.</p>
  <p>The garrulity of the old agent had given this man confidence. He thought
  he saw in that, and in other circumstances around him, enough to warrant
  him in a confident belief that his crime was unsuspected. Or he may have
  argued with himself that safety lay in a bold attitude and tone. So he adopted
  that kind of tone and attitude. He was informed, in reply to his demand,
  that he could not see the board, but that he might see the secretary on any
  day and hour he chose to appoint.</p>
  <p>I should explain that this interview was part of my plan. The secretary
  was disposed to refuse to see the incendiary at all, but I overruled his
  objections to the meeting.</p>
  <p>I had, previous to the appointment for this interview being made and kept,
  two or three very deliberate and somewhat anxious conferences with the solicitor
  and the secretary of the company. They were for adopting an exceedingly cautious
  policy. I was still for taking bold steps. I recommended the arrest of Mr.
  Keeling at once, suggesting, in support of that measure, that in all probability,
  if I did so, the other members of his gang would fly, and that evidence of
  guilt sufficient, at all events, to rebut any claim at common law for the
  insurance money, would be thus obtained. Indeed, I thought, in all probability,
  it would never be attempted to enforce the claim. This, I argued, would be
  the ultimate consequence, even should Mr. Keeling slip through the hands
  of the hangman or the convict-warder; but added, that I thought there was
  little doubt, if Mr. Cross, Mr. Keeling, and the old man and woman, the tenants
  of the hovel, were all arrested, I could get evidence enough to convict the
  lot&mdash;if in no other way, partially by the confession of one of the set.
  I added, for the instruction and enlightenment of my auditors and employers,
  and as the climax of my reasoning, that I never yet knew a case in which
  a gang or a lot of confederates in crime were seized, that there was not
  a perfect race between them in tendering Queen&rsquo;s evidence. I could
  not lead the convictions of the solicitor and secretary up to the point of
  my demonstration or argument, but they agreed to allow me a tolerably wide
  discretion in my personal conversation with Mr. Keeling at the interview.</p>
  <p>One Monday morning, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Keeling walked into the
  insurance office. He certainly looked very unlike Mr. Henry Newton. The clean
  shaven face of the manufacturer near Dunstable was now ornamented by carefully
  trimmed hirsute appendages. The sober garb of the straw-bonnet manufacturer
  had given place to the swell costume of the proprietor of the &ldquo;Temple
  of the Muses,&rdquo; who dressed, I may remark <i>en passant</i>, in good
  clothes. Some people might say he looked the gentleman, although to my eye
  he looked just what he was&mdash;a consummate, perfect type of arch-villany.
  He was cool and collected. I was at least as calm as he was on the outside,
  and I warrant much calmer inside.</p>
  <p>After some little conversation between the secretary and the criminal, in
  which the former suggested that the items of the demand he was trying to
  recover were vague and uncertain, and stated that the company would require
  to investigate them, and that he thought they would be sure to contest the
  claim, and in which conversation Mr. Keeling used strong language about the
  disreputable character of those threats, and indeed said that he should bring
  his action at once, and that the company might do their best or their worst,
  and that he would do his best to show them up to the whole world and effect
  their ruin,&mdash;I thought it time to intervene.</p>
  <p>I stepped forward, looked Mr. Keeling steadily in the face, and I saw his
  eye quail as I addressed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, sir. It is time to put an end to this nonsense. Whether
  you know me or not, I know you perfectly, and all about you, and the gang
  to which you belong. Let me tell you, I know all about that fire in Whitechapel,
  and enough to transport you about that fire in Birmingham; enough, I think,
  to send you to Portland for a few years for those fires in Manchester and
  Liverpool. I have watched your career with my own eye for a long while, Mr.
  Newton, or Keeling, or Roberts, or Jamieson, or whoever you really are&mdash;and
  now listen to me. You got clear off with that money through your fire near
  Dunstable. Think yourself lucky that you are not hanged, with your pretended
  brother Albert&mdash;Mr. Cross, I mean&mdash;for the murder of your confederate
  Paterson. Understand that it is no good-will of mine that will let you step
  across the threshold of this door again; and I do not yet know whether you
  will be permitted to do so. I know I have got at every thing about your B&mdash; experiment,
  Mr. Temple of the Muses. I know who your neighhours, the old man and woman,
  were. They are Bill Smith and his wife, the fences of Rosemary Lane. I know
  what was done with the money got by the chapel subscription. Why, you bought
  your railway-ticket for London yesterday out of the proceeds of the charity
  sermon, you consummate villain. I was never the means of hanging a man yet;
  but I should like to hand you over to Jack Ketch, as much as I should like
  to enjoy a good dinner to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I placed my back against the outer door of the secretary&rsquo;s office,
  in order that I might compel Mr. Keeling to listen to all I had to say. He
  was, therefore, obliged to listen to all I have here written down, and somewhat
  more than I inform my reader. It was, I imagine, a difficult thing for him
  to control the expression of his feelings; but he did so tolerably well,
  with the exception of a little restlessness of the eyes, and a slight nervous
  movement of the countenance. There was no distinct symptom of fear, or any
  thing of the kind, in his breast.</p>
  <p>About half a minute after I had done, the fellow broke silence&mdash;being
  obliged to say something&mdash;by observing, &ldquo;This is too bad, sir;
  and you will have to repent addressing me in such language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew what the company wanted. I had explained to them, in addition to
  what I have already told the reader, how I could, no doubt, trace the pianos
  to their source, and have shown that they were not paid for; or that they
  were manifestly inferior things, not worth 25 per cent of the sum asked for
  them in the way of trade; and that they were only intended as a blind or
  cover for the fraudulent claim. I could in fact, beyond all doubt, get a
  conviction of arson in any criminal court; but I knew that the company merely
  wished to avoid paying a claim that was fraudulent; and as corporations have
  no conscience, or care about hunting down a gang of incendiaries, or doing
  any thing with the simple view of serving public policy,&mdash;knowing this,
  and seeing the end of my game (without offending my employers) at hand,&mdash;I
  just put my arm in front of the incendiary and murderer, gave him a chair
  with mock politeness, and asked the secretary if he would let me have the
  exclusive use of his office for a few minutes. He retired on this hint. He
  had scarcely left the room&mdash;he had certainly not been out more than
  a minute&mdash;before I said to the culprit, &ldquo;As you came here under
  the invitation of the secretary, you are free to leave, but I will give you
  only two hours. I am a detective officer, as I dare say you have guessed,
  and perhaps you have wondered that you did not know me. Now, to be frank
  with you, I may say that this company will, I believe, be content to let
  you get away, but they will not be satisfied to let you or your confederates
  have the chance of defrauding either its shareholders or any other company
  again. Your movements will be watched from this door; and in every way that
  you turn you may reckon that we are on your track, as we have been for more
  than a year and a half. If you are as wise as I take you to be, you will
  get out of the country as soon as possible; and if you are then but moderately
  shrewd, you will never come back again. Mind, I have no authority to say
  this, but I do say it on the strength of my own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I opened the door which led into the lobby of the company&rsquo;s offices.
  I looked at Keeling, and uttered my last monosyllable in his ear&mdash;&ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went.</p>
  <p>I had the satisfaction of reporting that within a few days he was a passenger
  by a steam-vessel from Southampton to New York. I had also the pleasure of
  announcing to the company that within a few days afterwards Mr. Cross left
  our shores for the same port by way of Liverpool. I further learned and stated
  that the venerable old man and woman at B&mdash; had returned to their old
  haunts, and had been heard to complain that they had been &ldquo;sold&rdquo; by
  Messrs. Keeling and Messrs. Cross.</p>
  <p>The company of course saved 3000<i>l.</i> The solicitor highly complimented
  me to my face; I also had to listen to the compliments of the secretary;
  and I received payment of my bill. The secretary, who was a very gentlemanly
  man, appeared to think that something more by way of courtesy was due to
  me than the payment of my charges. He said that he should bring my case before
  the board, and would feel personally glad if I would call on him on the following
  Wednesday at 11 o&rsquo;clock, when he would introduce me to his directors,
  and no doubt he should obtain from them instructions to further recognise
  the services I had rendered, not alone to that institution, but to all the
  fire-insurance companies of the metropolis.</p>
  <p>I accepted this invitation and attended the meeting of the board. The members
  of that board were a rum lot of fellows, but to describe them might be tedious.
  I should like to say that a fat old man was in the chair.</p>
  <p>As the secretary was explaining the case in detail (for it seemed that the
  board knew little if any thing about the matter up to this point, every thing
  having been done by the orders of the secretary and the solicitor, on, I
  should imagine, their own responsibility), this old man interrupted him by
  such profound remarks as &ldquo;Ah! I see; very bad case&mdash;How fortunate!&mdash;Villain
  ought to be hung&mdash;Why did we not prosecute him?&mdash;I think we ought
  to have prosecuted him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not, however, for me to interfere with the conversation. I merely
  listened; and at the conclusion, the secretary said that he thought he would
  ask this gentleman (myself) to attend to-day, in order that he might receive
  from the board personally some expression of their sense of, what it appeared
  to him, my eminent services.</p>
  <p>The old man thereupon addressed me. &ldquo;Oh, yes; oh, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
  have done your dooty very well, my man; very clever, I think I ought to say.&rdquo; And
  he looked round at the other members for a nod of acquiescence, which was
  given.</p>
  <p>One keen, intelligent-looking man said he thought some more substantial
  recognition of such services as the secretary had described ought to be made,
  and that he should, therefore, move a vote of thanks to me; which proposal
  was seconded by another gentleman, and passed unanimously.</p>
  <p>The chairman, again addressing me, said, &ldquo;You see, we have given you
  a vote of thanks;&rdquo; which I acknowledged by a simple nod of the head&mdash;not,
  I am afraid, very highly esteeming the compliment.</p>
  <p>Another gentleman then rose and said, &ldquo;I know that a vote of thanks
  is all very well; but I think we ought to make this gentleman some substantial
  recognition of his services. I am only a young member of the board; I do
  not like to move the resolution myself, but I would suggest to you, sir,
  as chairman, whether you should not move that a sum of money be given to
  the officer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo; said the chairman, &ldquo;at all.
  He has done very clever; but he has only done his dooty, after all, like
  we are doing ours; and I don&rsquo;t think we ought to spend shareholders&rsquo; money
  in compliments to men for just doing their dooty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I heard this remark with not very comfortable feelings, but did not say
  any thing.</p>
  <p>The gentleman who had proposed the testimonial said that he could hardly
  agree with their worthy chairman in all he had said; and another member of
  the board said something to the same effect.</p>
  <p>The chairman now seemed to think he was a little in the wrong, and to treat
  these remarks as a rebuke. He appeared to think he was bound to recognise
  my services by what, I dare say, he imagined a little act of personal generosity.</p>
  <p>Again talking at me, he said, &ldquo;Well, well! do not let us waste time
  about this; we cannot spend the money of the company, that I am certain about.
  I will make this gentleman a present myself.&rdquo; Then turning to me, he
  proceeded, &ldquo;Here, my man; you have heard what has been said by the
  board. I will make you a present of half-a-sovereign out of my own pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This marvellous act of generosity I confess quite overpowered my self-control.
  I could not help a passing desire to insult the old man. For the life of
  me, I could not smother that resolution; so, taking the half-sovereign between
  my fingers, I said to him, &ldquo;Well, you see, sir, I agree with you. When
  a man has done his duty, and especially when he has been paid for it, he
  should not want any thing else. I don&rsquo;t want any thing else. Your company
  has paid me 310<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>, which amount will quite remunerate
  me; and if you have no objection, sir, as I have no doubt you have got some
  poor relations, perhaps you will hand one of them this half-sovereign, with
  my compliments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I did not wait to notice the effect of this retort upon the pursy magnate;
  but laying down the coin on the middle of the table, I simply and hastily
  said, &ldquo;Good morning, sir,&mdash;good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; and
  quitted the palatial structure which contained the head-quarters of the Triumph
  of Meanness Assurance Company.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  A Railway Accident?</b></h2>
  <p>A FEW years ago, and about fifteen miles from London, a gentleman named
  Freeling, returning from the village of A&mdash; to the village of B&mdash;,
  a distance of only four miles, had to cross one of the two trunk lines of
  railway which runs northward from the great metropolis and intercepts populous
  districts of England. To tell the exact truth about this gentleman, he had
  been visiting a friend&mdash;a man of substance, and likewise in the horticultural,
  floricultural, and agricultural lines, in which Mr. Freeling&rsquo;s mind
  had an inclination to run. To tell a little more of the truth, as it is desirable
  to tell the whole, after examining, approving, and admiring the skill of
  his friend and its results, Mr. Freeling was invited by Mr. Goodwin to dinner;
  and I believe that the guest imbibed rather excessively of his host&rsquo;s
  spiritual stores and wines. Yet he was not insensible to sights and sounds;
  and if he had been, he would not have figured as a character in this narrative.</p>
  <p>The way of Mr. Freeling from his friend&rsquo;s house to his own home lay,
  after crossing the railway, through a narrow lane not far from a station.
  Happily for him however, perhaps, he was not aware that, near the footpath
  across the line (that is, the railway-line), there had been a great smash
  about the time that the two rustic amateurs had been discussing the good
  cheer of the host&mdash;somewhere about four hours before the incidents I
  am about to describe. The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> had been, however, cleared
  up before our friend passed the scene of the catastrophe, and none of its
  relics were visible in the moonlight. He had not proceeded far beyond the
  rails, when he thought he heard a low sound very like a groan; and if he
  were any judge of such things (he reasoned), it was the moaning of a man
  or woman in pain. He paused; he listened. All was silent. He moved on a pace
  or two; listened again; and the wind brought him something like a repetition
  of the moan. Could he be mistaken? he asked himself. No; that was a human
  voice; perhaps some drunken wretch. If so, the first thought which suggested
  itself was, that he should turn back and see that the man was not lying in
  the track of the iron horse or its carriages. Second thoughts are said to
  be the best,&mdash;and, if selfishness be better than disinterestedness,
  Mr. Freeling&rsquo;s second thoughts were better than his first. What did
  it matter to him, he argued with himself, if people got drunk? They must
  suffer for it, was the second thought of the half-drunken man. So he trudged
  along again; but the sound, louder this time, overtook him once more. He
  was not essentially an unkind man; and although home had peculiar attractions
  for him in his then condition, he was obliged by the force of his human nature
  to pause.</p>
  <p>Another groan. There could be no mistake about it. A poor wretch was lying
  somewhere near him in evident pain. He shouted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holloa! what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A feeble groan responded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>Again a moan.</p>
  <p>It was more than decent, although half-drunken, humanity could resist. He
  turned back in the direction of the railway a few steps. Then he paused,
  and once more a dismal sound greeted his ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some poor fellow,&rdquo; the traveller said to himself, &ldquo;must
  be lying on the railway in a dying state. What can I do? The nearest station,
  B&mdash;, is <i>two</i> miles away; the nearest house is two miles. Still,
  I must find where he is lying, and what is the matter with him, and do what
  I can to help him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This resolution taken, he walked back, ever and anon pausing to listen,
  and now and then guided by the plaintive cry of agony.</p>
  <p>At length, after reaching the gate which abutted on the railway, he paused
  and listened for another cry to guide him in turning right or left. A moment
  supplied the indication he required. He turned to the left, and proceeded
  rapidly a distance of three hundred yards, when he met an obstruction to
  his course, against which he stumbled. A shriek, or something like it, followed.
  It was that of a prostrate man whose voice he had so frequently heard.</p>
  <p>Mr. Freeling bent over the poor sufferer, and learnt enough to satisfy himself
  that an accident had happened to this man on the railway, and that medical
  assistance and attention were required.</p>
  <p>The situation and its incidents had a beneficial effect upon the intoxicated
  man,&mdash;they roused his senses. In five minutes he was as sober as he
  had ever been in his life. Carefully removing the limbs of the prostrate
  body out of the way of further immediate danger, he ran along the course
  of the railway until he reached a station, where he learnt the particulars
  of a collision; but was informed that all the passengers had been removed,
  most of them, if not all, being well enough to proceed on their journey to
  their respective homes. He insisted that there must have been at least one
  exception to this rule, which the officials at the station had not observed;
  and they did not require any further proof of their oversight than that he
  supplied.</p>
  <p>With lanterns, and with the means of removing the wounded passenger, two
  porters, and two other men who were pressed into the service, walked with
  our friend to the spot where he had found the injured man.</p>
  <p>He was still lying there, moaning and groaning with greater vigour than
  before. He was lifted with all the gentleness the four bearers were capable
  of, and carried by stages along the line back again to the station.</p>
  <p>It was fortunate that, closely adjacent to this station, there was an hotel&mdash;a
  small, unpretentious establishment, which nobody who was perfectly master
  of his own actions would think of selecting for a temporary abode if he had
  the means of paying for his entertainment and refreshment elsewhere. Such
  as it was, however, it was deemed expedient to rest the burden under its
  shelter. The poor man was carried into the hostelry, and placed on a cosy
  bed, that formed the leading part of the furniture of a best bedroom.</p>
  <p>He now rallied. He called for brandy, and was supplied with a small portion
  of a liquor probably distilled from potatoes in London, but retailed as the
  finest cognac.</p>
  <p>The liquor seemed to have a good effect on the wounded traveller. After
  a few minutes&rsquo; consciousness, articulation was restored under its genial
  influence. He asked one of the people in attendance to take from his breast-pocket
  a pocket-book, and from that pocket-book to take out a letter, the envelope
  of which gave his address:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Ephraham Sweetman</i>,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;19 &mdash; <i>Street, Pimlico</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The injured traveller was able to sustain a brief conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this your address, my good man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the feeble reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you very much injured?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was again slowly and faintly articulated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are these your name and address?&rdquo; was asked by another person;
  and the interrogator held before the eyes of the wounded passenger the envelope
  of the letter extracted from his pocket.</p>
  <p>A smile was accepted as a reply in the affirmative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had better send for Dr. Scalpel,&rdquo; observed a railway-porter
  to an agricultural labourer.</p>
  <p>The poor fellow&rsquo;s face betrayed signs of evident dissatisfaction.
  He dropped his head, as if fainting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had better send for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; escaped from the lips of the man upon the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; exclaimed another of the party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr. Jones,&rdquo; the wounded man hurriedly but faintly exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell us where he lives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No reply was immediately given; and as the poor fellow seemed unable to
  bear the weight of his own chest and brain, they laid his head upon the pillow.</p>
  <p>The station-master, who had been awakened from his natural sleep, now entered
  the room; and having been informed what had taken place, he asked for the
  London Directory, which, by another happy circumstance, formed part of the
  furniture of the hotel. It was so discovered that in the street in which
  the poor fellow had been ascertained to dwell, one &ldquo;Anthony Jones,
  M.R.C.S.,&rdquo; also had a local habitation&mdash;about twenty doors from
  his own patient&rsquo;s residence.</p>
  <p>Dr. Jones was accordingly telegraphed for, and informed when the next down-train
  started from London.</p>
  <p>Dr. Jones was an attentive man, and on receipt of the message he lost no
  time in repairing to the station where his neighbour was deposited.</p>
  <p>On his arrival the patient revived a little, and on seeing the face of his
  own medical man he recovered sufficiently to indicate that the pain proceeded
  from the neighbourhood of his ribs.</p>
  <p>The surgeon desired the men to leave, and asked for the assistance of a
  woman until morning. Again the beneficent telegraph was made use of. A message
  sent to London requested Mrs. Brandyface, who lived somewhere in Pimlico,
  to come down to the B&mdash; Station Hotel, informing her at what time the
  next train started from London in the morning.</p>
  <p>These directions having been given, and the clothes of the unfortunate patient
  having been cut and torn off his body, he was put to bed, and made as comfortable
  as might be&mdash;the doctor administering something in a tumbler of water
  from a bottle which he carried in his pocket. He then told the woman of the
  house that she might retire after supplying him with some more of the London
  cognac before mentioned, for his own use during the night. The doctor sat
  up with his patient until Mrs. Brandyface arrived in the morning, when he
  handed him over to the care and attention of his own nurse.</p>
  <p>Next morning Dr. Attrabilious, chief medical officer and surgeon extraordinary
  to the railway company, also came down by express train to see what he could
  do in the way of restoring the patient&rsquo;s health, patching up his wounds,
  and&mdash;most important of all&mdash;making an arrangement for compensation
  by the company, whom he served in the dual capacity of doctor and compensation
  negotiator, when the negligence of their servants had caused any mischief.</p>
  <p>Dr. Attrabilious was of course admitted to the patient&rsquo;s bedside,
  to the evident dissatisfaction of his faithful nurse. The patient, however,
  would have nothing to say to him when he had explained that he came on behalf
  of the railway company. The poor fellow declared that nobody should attend
  him but his own regular medical man or surgeon. In vain Dr. Attrabilious
  pressed his services. The damaged passenger manifested an aversion to receive
  his attentions; and the nurse said she thought it was not right to force
  himself on the helpless gentleman when he was not wanted, as Dr. Jones was
  known to all Pimlico, if not all the world, as a very clever man.</p>
  <p>This scene tended to disturb the patient&rsquo;s equanimity. The outrage
  of the nurse&rsquo;s feelings, or it might be prejudices, led to the discomfiture
  of Dr. Attrabilious, who was pushed out of the room amid a torrent of abuse
  for trying to kill the sufferer by impertinent officiousness. Dr. Attrabilious
  left the place in dudgeon, with all the humility of one who felt himself
  snubbed to the last extent and very nearly extinguished.</p>
  <p>Dr. Jones telegraphed about mid-day to state that pressing engagements would
  not permit him to reach the village again until towards evening; but that
  in the mean time he would send&mdash;and he did send by the next train&mdash;a
  small parcel of medicine.</p>
  <p>The patient was attended with all possible care by Mrs. Brandyface and Dr.
  Jones for several days, when, on request to the company, a special train
  was provided, and in a carriage well supplied with all that could give ease
  to the invalid traveller he was removed to London and taken to his own house.</p>
  <p>After some time, perhaps about a month, the patient was sufficiently restored
  to health to go about his ordinary business, whatever that may have been.
  A letter was sent by his solicitor to the company demanding a good round
  sum as compensation for three broken ribs, sundry contusions, permanent damage
  to the animal economy of the sufferer, and his past and future detriment
  in business. The company made an offer of 25<i>l.</i> in settlement, which
  was declined. A writ was issued out of the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench.
  The company defended the proceedings which were taken, and the action was
  ultimately set down for trial.</p>
  <p>At the trial, Mr. Capulet Attic, Q.C., appeared as the leading counsel for
  the plaintiff, and in the course of his opening speech very clearly stated
  the facts already narrated. He dwelt with considerable emphasis upon the
  negligence of the company&rsquo;s servants, not only in allowing the accident
  to occur, which he said arose from the most patent and the grossest carelessness,
  but also for the, if possible, still greater and still more unpardonable
  negligence in allowing his unfortunate client the plaintiff to remain upon
  the ground for so many hours without attendance. He referred to the accidental
  detention of Mr. Freeling over his friend&rsquo;s dinner-table, and his journey
  homewards across the railway, which the eloquent lawyer called a special
  interposition of Providence, and without which his unfortunate client, the
  plaintiff, would in all probability have died a lingering death from cold,
  damp, and hunger. He bitterly censured the company for the employment of
  Dr. Attrabilious, not alone as a medical attendant, in order to dispense
  mercy to the wounded or injured plaintiff, but also no doubt for a purpose
  that he, Dr. Attrabilious, had frequently been employed to serve,&mdash;namely,
  effecting a compromise between the plaintiff and the company. He further
  condemned, in bitter terms, the shabby and mean offer of compromise which,
  since the action had been threatened, was made by the directors through their
  solicitor. Lastly, he confidently appealed to the jury to bestow upon his
  unfortunate client substantial damages; and sat down smiling confidently
  to the jurymen, as if he expected to obtain all that he had asked.</p>
  <p>Of the evidence it is needless to speak at length. The gentleman who found
  the unfortunate plaintiff described, like a perfectly honest and worthy man,
  the condition in which he was at the time. The cross-examination of this
  witness was almost a matter of form. How could any thing be expected from
  him in that way that would not strengthen the plaintiff&rsquo;s case? He
  was a perfectly honest and impartial man. He was indeed the witness of the
  truth as far as in him lay. The doctor and the nurse in attendance upon the
  plaintiff also gave their evidence very clearly, although endeavours were
  made somewhat to shake their testimony, and to prove that the injuries had
  not been so severe as was represented. Still not much was done by the defence,
  and it may be said that the plaintiff made out his case.</p>
  <p>The defendants&rsquo; counsel, Mr. Pompous Blower, Q.C., made an energetic
  appeal to the court and jury; but what could he make out on their behalf
  in such a case? The most he could do was to throw back the taunts of his
  learned friend Mr. Capulet Attic, and proclaim, in sonorous and round periods,
  the philanthropic character of the corporation he represented. He defended
  Dr. Attrabilious, or at least inveighed against the condemnation of that
  scientific gentleman in his absence. The learned counsel denied that Dr.
  Attrabilious had ever been so employed as was represented, and contended
  that the company had no other object in sending him to the bedside of the
  smashed or mutilated traveller on their line, than to relieve his pain and
  do the best he could for the sufferer. Dr. Attrabilious was not, however,
  called as a witness for the defence, and the plaintiff of course did not
  want him; so the allegation, that the doctor had on former occasions played
  the part of negotiator in the settlement of claims against his masters, did
  not receive such a contradiction as it might have had, and it might have
  been desirable for them to render.</p>
  <p>The judge summed up, and said that it appeared to him very like an undefended
  cause; but he urged the jury not to suffer their judgment to be led captive
  by the eloquence of Mr. Capulet Attic, who had, however, acted in all respects
  very properly for the plaintiff, in so trying to run away with their senses.
  The plaintiff seemed to be entitled, almost on the admission of the company,
  to fair and reasonable compensation; but that was all. The presumed wealth
  of a great corporation like the &mdash; Railway Company was not a fact that
  should lay them open to extortion, and he would tell the jury that excessive
  damages might bear the complexion of meditated or of unconscious injustice.</p>
  <p>The jury rose in their box, turned round face to face, had a little to say
  to one another during perhaps two or three minutes&rsquo; time, and then
  returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with 500<i>l.</i> damages.</p>
  <p>The company was somewhat taken aback by the largeness of these damages.
  The truth is, their case had not been got up so patiently and carefully as
  it might have been. A proper investigation into the antecedents and mode
  of life of the plaintiff, by any moderately intelligent lawyer&rsquo;s clerk,
  would have enabled them to lay such facts before the jury as must have reduced
  his claim to less than one-fifth of the amount he got,&mdash;if such inquiry
  had not led the investigator into a track for entirely exploding the plaintiff&rsquo;s
  case.</p>
  <p>The defendants, as a random experiment, determined to move for a new trial
  in this case. A rule absolute for a new trial was granted, upon condition
  that they brought into court enough money to abide the event of such new
  trial&mdash;that is to say, to cover damages and costs. The railway company
  had before now derived immense advantages by delay, and were hopeful that
  time would bring some advantage in this case&mdash;as it did.</p>
  <p>The success which had attended my investigations on former occasions in
  a somewhat similar case or two, led to my being employed on the present.</p>
  <p>I had not much difficulty in effecting my object. I had several clues to
  the parties. I almost suspected, from the nature of the case, that the affair
  was altogether a conspiracy to defraud the company&mdash;and I was right
  in my suspicions.</p>
  <p>The plaintiff had not been injured. The collision had taken place some time
  before his arrival on the spot. The principal guard of the train in which
  the collision took place was in the swindle. He professed to telegraph on
  behalf of a passenger who had been somewhat bruised to a friend in London,
  which message (in order to divert suspicion) ran thus: &ldquo;Collision at
  B&mdash;. I am not hurt. All right.&rdquo; Upon this hint the plaintiff hastily
  communicated with one or two of his companions in such frauds, and hastened
  down to the spot in a gig hired from a livery stable. The vehicle deposited
  him about a mile from the place where the accident occurred, which had, in
  the mean time, been ascertained with precision. The gig was then driven back
  by a companion, and the plaintiff slunk off to the margin of the line, and
  waited for an opportunity to sigh and groan with advantage.</p>
  <p>The return home of Mr. Freeling, who had been seen by the watchful swindler,
  supplied the opportunity he wanted; and the plaintiff accordingly made the
  noises already described, which attracted the attention of that gentleman.
  Of course the scoundrel knew that the railway company would, as usual, send
  their doctor. He knew how to get over that little difficulty. He had his
  confederates, and he knew how to make the most of the unscrupulous tactics
  of the company in dealing with the real victims of railway collisions. He
  saw that he could turn Dr. Attrabilious&rsquo;s visit to good account by
  supplying it to Mr. Capulet Attic as one of the pegs for an oratorical display.
  The Dr. Jones who was sent for was a confederate. He belonged to the gang,
  and of course would have shared the spoil. The nurse was also in the swindle.
  The arrangement for the division of the spoil remunerated her more liberally
  than nurses are generally paid for their services. In fact the whole thing
  was a conspiracy.</p>
  <p>I laid all these circumstances before the company&rsquo;s solicitors in
  my report. It was, however, resolved, as we had the whole set clearly in
  our grasp, not to arrest them immediately, but to await the progress of events,
  and see if the next combination of the gang for a like purpose did not reveal
  to us a few more of its members. It did so. I discovered that the doctor
  in attendance upon a damaged railway traveller in Lancashire, about two months
  afterwards, and the plaintiff in the first case, visited as friends the intended
  plaintiff in the second place. Just as our plans were ripe for execution,
  we were, however, forestalled by the arrest of five members of the dangerous
  confederacy on two gigantic cases&mdash;one for forgery, and the rest for
  a great railway robbery, which had been suddenly disclosed to the police
  authorities by a wretch who craved vengeance upon an associate in the gang
  because he had been successful in carrying off the affections of &ldquo;a
  lady&rdquo; with whom the informer had cohabited. Of these men captured,
  all were found guilty on the strongest testimony, got at through the informer
  by officers who laid traps under his guidance, and by surrounding circumstances
  to which he had assisted them. One of the parties to my action&mdash;that
  is, the doctor&mdash;made good his escape. I believe he went to America.</p>

  A Patriotic Barber In Fault</b></h2>
  <p>A FEW years ago I was employed to watch &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; in
  a hotly contested election. It was my first engagement of the kind, and I
  sharpened my wits in order that I might fairly earn my fee,&mdash;which the
  reader may be glad to know was a handsome one. Perhaps he may also be pleased
  to learn that I am an impartial man. It is true that, on the occasion I now
  speak of, I was employed by the agent of the Liberal candidate; but I have,
  on other subsequent occasions, rendered service, and I believe good service,
  to Conservative gentlemen who now wear the title of M.P. During this election
  many curious little incidents took place, as they always do at elections,
  and one of them I propose to relate. By the way, there is nothing which quickens
  human ingenuity like a vigorous electioneering struggle. Wit, humour, desperate
  practical joking, and ingenious stratagems, crowd in such exciting profusion,
  that sometimes the strict rules of moral propriety are hidden or get confused
  before the eyes of the parties concerned. Sometimes I think I behaved unhandsomely
  towards the barber of whom I am about to speak. At other times I think it
  served him right. The reader shall decide between my first and my second
  thoughts on this head.</p>
  <p>In the borough of W&mdash; there lived one John Shufflebotham, a barber
  who earned a livelihood&mdash;that is to say, earned or got money to buy
  scanty food, little raiment, plenty of beer, and a liberal supply of stronger
  waters for the consumption of himself and Mrs. Shufflebotham&mdash;by the
  exercise of his trade, or &ldquo;profession,&rdquo; as he styled it, and
  it was believed in no other way. This barber had a reputation for shaving
  his customers as clean as they could wish for a penny each&mdash;and he would
  do the job at half the price for regular patrons&mdash;and for cropping any
  rough and stubborn head of hair, popular tradition, and the tariff on his
  door-post, declared threepence to be a fixed or immovable charge. This, however,
  was not the only character which John Shufflebotham enjoyed. He was esteemed
  a man of principle; thoroughly incorruptible. Not a breath of suspicion of
  his political honesty had ever been floated on the turbid atmosphere of W&mdash; at
  the most prying time&mdash;say just after the settlement of accounts between
  the &ldquo;free and independent voters&rdquo; and the candidates. I was told
  that John Shufflebotham wouldn&rsquo;t require to be looked after. He had
  never taken a bribe, and to offer him one would insure any man an ignominious
  chastisement. The barber was a stout man, and although beer or whisky had
  perhaps softened his brain a little, and rendered his muscles somewhat flaccid,
  there was strength enough in his legs to wield a heavy boot with almost terrible
  force.</p>
  <p>This barber had acquired a degree of influence over sterling, honest working
  men by his reputed incorruptibility to an extent that he would not otherwise
  have gained, so that it became rather important to obtain his support on
  behalf of our candidate.</p>
  <p>At the commencement of the struggle it was believed that John Shufflebotham
  would, as a matter of course, vote for our candidate; but this was a miscalculation.
  It appeared that something had turned the current of his political sympathies.
  He was down in the former poll-book as having voted for the Liberals, and
  so it was expected that he would vote again, bringing with him to the hustings
  about twenty honest fellows who believed in him.</p>
  <p>On the contrary, he soon intimated that he had come to believe the Whigs
  were a little worse than the Tories. He did not think they cared, either
  of them, for poor working men like him or any of his customers, but that
  they (the Whigs and Tories) were both thieves. If he must vote, he would
  turn and turn about. Perhaps he should be inclined to give the Tories a turn
  this time; but he didn&rsquo;t know. He wasn&rsquo;t at all sure about it
  either way.</p>
  <p>This man&rsquo;s defection from our cause produced a little alarm. The feeling
  of which he appeared to be the exponent was also, upon inquiry, found rather
  more extensive than was at first thought possible. It ran beyond the pale
  or circle of the barber&rsquo;s supposed influence; and to make matters rather
  worse, the barber, when assailed by a patron for apostasy, or urged to stand
  by his old colours, was compelled, as he said, to argufy in his own justification,
  which attracted other customers to his house, and it became the arena of
  controversy. John Shufflebotham was acquiring a reputation for oratory, in
  addition to his other qualities.</p>
  <p>It was not my proper business to win over friends. My function was to look
  after foes; but I was taken into confidence about the case of John Shufflebotham.
  The chief agent of the candidate quoted the observation of some old dead
  statesman about every man having his price, and I agreed with him to learn
  what the price of the vote and influence of John Shufflebotham might be.
  This view was arrived at by our agent only the day before polling, and it
  was then overruled by one or two people in the secrets of the head committee-room,
  who had a control over the incidents of the election.</p>
  <p>Next day the polling began. It was a day of wild excitement. Beer and spirits
  and food were distributed <i>ad libitum</i> to the whole population by one
  side and the other. Drunkenness was the only general characteristic of civilisation
  in that parliamentary borough by twelve o&rsquo;clock on the day for electing
  one of the prime wisdoms of the country to represent that town in the Legislature
  of Great Britain. Money was being spent profusely in bribes; voters had been &ldquo;bottled&rdquo;&mdash;that
  is to say, made drunk and then fastened up in a public or other house. These
  were the men who could not be induced to vote for us, or who dared not so
  vote because of something or other, but who voluntarily submitted to this
  process as a mid-way of service to us. Some electors were at any risk drugged,
  and hindered from obeying the dictates of political feeling. Some men were
  taken out of the town in vehicles. Respectability of every kind hid its head.
  Ruffianism and common vice of every kind had all their own way.</p>
  <p>John Shufflebotham had not yet voted, nor had many of his friends. The Tories
  had lauded him as &ldquo;a sterling, honest, worthy, good fellow;&rdquo; as &ldquo;a
  man of great political sagacity, who had yielded to the voice of reason,&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
  one who had renounced the errors of political life, and determined to assert,
  in his own person, the rights of matured conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They had fawned upon him; they had coaxed and wheedled him; they had held
  out every kind of future inducement and deferred benefit before his eyes&mdash;but
  John Shufflebotham had not been induced to give a vote, or the pledge of
  a vote, to the Conservative. He had made no distinct or visible sign of yielding
  to us, still it was observed that he had not been so lavish in the censure
  of our candidate during the previous day, or during the day of election,
  as before.</p>
  <p>We had been prepared for his hostility, but hardly knew what to do with
  his neutrality. We had expected to find him leading a body of voters to the
  hustings for the Tories. Jem Smash, the head of our best gang of prizefighters,
  had accordingly received instructions to bestow the courtesy of his underlings
  upon the barber and the barber&rsquo;s friends.</p>
  <p>Some of the liberal tradesmen of the borough of W&mdash; were gloating over
  the satisfaction of seeing the barber &ldquo;doubled up,&rdquo; and a few
  of his believers horribly maltreated. This gratification had, up to the present
  moment, been denied them; and after much deliberation on the subject, it
  was not thought safe to commence an attack upon the humble abode of the recalcitrant
  worthy. Such a step might have brought some of our top people into disgrace,
  as an attorney, who had been retained at a heavy cost to advise our candidate
  and his friends from time to time how much iniquity they might perform without
  danger to their own persons or purses, was good enough to inform them. Such
  a proceeding, dictated or suggested in the committee-room, might be brought
  home to its occupants, and involve a lot of respectabilities as well as ruffians
  concerned therein to a mingled punishment.</p>
  <p>As we could not retaliate upon Barber Shufflebotham for his obstinacy, apostasy,
  or whatever it was, we determined to see if he could not be won or bought
  over. The lawyer, and I, and the principal agent, who was not a lawyer, went
  into a little room to discuss this matter, and ultimately settled that I
  should first approach the barber. I did so; and as I do not want to incur
  a charge of immodesty from the reader&rsquo;s lips, I omit an explanation
  of my visit. Let it be simply stated that I found the barber vulnerable on
  the statesmanlike point. I ascertained that he had a price; and the price
  was not, after all, a very large one, seeing the extent of the influence
  which he had to give, as well as his vote. The price was 100<i>l.</i> I struck
  the bargain with him&mdash;with a reservation that I hope may be forgiven,
  as well as the trick I also meditated and carried out.</p>
  <p>One thing the barber stipulated. Appearances must be somehow saved, and
  (clever dog he was) he suggested to me how that could be done. There were
  two points in the political programme of the candidate which, John Shufflebotham
  and his friends contended a gentleman worthy of a vote ought to be prepared
  to support&mdash;one was universal suffrage, the other was vote by ballot.
  The barber said his men must be told that the candidate would meet them at
  least half-way. If this were arranged, and he were paid 100<i>l.</i>, he
  would recommend his friends to vote with him for the Liberal. I agreed, not
  that the candidate should make these professions, but that somebody on his
  behalf should give that explanation to Shufflebotham and his immediate tail
  or circle.</p>
  <p>I went back to the committee-room, and explained to the attorney and agent
  how I proposed to act. They laughed outright as long as they could afford
  time to laugh, which was not much; for minutes were precious, as my scheme
  required an hour and a half, or perhaps two hours, for the working out. I
  went back to the barber, and arranged that he should jump into a cab and
  run over the town, which was not large, and call his friends together at
  the Pig and Whistle in Backstairs Street, to receive a communication from
  the Liberal candidate.</p>
  <p>I looked at my watch. It was then half-past twelve. The poll closed at four.
  There was a train from the town of W&mdash; to the town of B&mdash;, which
  started at 12:45. It would not take long to cover that distance in a carriage
  drawn by the iron horse. There was a train returning from B&mdash; to W&mdash; at
  2 p.m. precisely. That would do. I also arranged that an orator who had been
  employed for the purpose of addressing the political intellect of the free
  and independent electors of W&mdash;, should attend the Pig and Whistle on
  behalf of our candidate, and make one of his smooth, flowing, rapid, ornate
  addresses.</p>
  <p>This gentleman could talk against time. He was to spout until he had &ldquo;the
  office&rdquo; to shut up his limpid stream of talk.</p>
  <p>The orator did his business first rate. From what I recollect of that speech,
  I wonder that he deserted his title of barrister-at-law, turned aside from
  the ambition of wearing M.P. after his own name at some future date, and
  settled down, as he did, into the secretary of some association having its
  location eastward of the Royal Exchange.</p>
  <p>Our hired barrister-at-law addressed the Shufflebotham circle as honest,
  noble fellows, whose adherence to principle was one of the most refreshing
  examples of political determination he had ever met in his life. He praised
  Shufflebotham as a man who had won an influence over his fellow-men, which
  a tyrant might envy, but could never command, through a stern and inflexible
  course of honest industry spread over an ample term of existence. Shufflebotham
  here turned a little red in the face; some people thought him modest, and
  took that crimson to be a blush. No doubt it was a blush, but whether of
  honesty or of shame I need not stay to point out.</p>
  <p>After the orator had been speaking for some time, my man returned, and I
  received an intimation of that fact. The orator also got a nod and a very
  slight wink from me, when he stated that he had been requested to make an
  explanation to them, but he felt somewhat exhausted by what he had already
  done, and he therefore asked their permission to leave that explanation to
  be made by his friend Mr. Yellowly, who sat by his side; and then, after
  a peroration, in which he talked a good deal about the moon, and the stars,
  and the four winds of heaven, and the British Lion, and the flag that braved
  a thousand years, and honest industry, he sat down amid such applause as
  I have only heard at the Pig and Whistle and in very large assemblies.</p>
  <p>Mr. Yellowly, the attorney, rose, and said that he regretted he had not
  the eloquence of his learned friend; also that, as he was a plain man of
  business, he would address himself to the explanation he had to offer in
  very few words. The fact he was intrusted to announce, he hoped he might
  do in confidence; it was, that although our candidate could not go so far
  as universal suffrage, that most honourable and enlightened gentleman would
  go a long way in that direction, much longer than he even thought it prudent
  to express upon the hustings his intentions to go, lest he should excite
  the prejudices of the middle classes, and secure, by an indiscreet frankness,
  the return of their Tory antagonist. In reply to an inquiry, Mr. Yellowly
  said he could not exactly tell how far the candidate would go in the extension
  of the franchise, but no doubt he would go as far as they desired&mdash;say
  to the admission within the pale of the British constitution of the 2<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> householders.
  As for the ballot&mdash;that most important political principle&mdash;the
  Liberal candidate would vote for such a shield being drawn over the poor
  but honest elector.</p>
  <p>Shufflebotham played his part well&mdash;the rascal! He affected to be a
  little doubtful unless the explanation was made in public. Mr. Yellowly strongly
  appealed to the common sense of his auditors not to peril the election just
  at this moment (when the Tories were four ahead of the Liberals) by so indiscreet
  a demand. One simple-hearted man thought Shufflebotham was a little too particular
  and suspicious. He thought the gentleman, Mr. Yellowly, was right. Shufflebotham
  said he did not want to be a dictator. He was satisfied, if the others were.
  I, at that moment, suggested that they had better not be long making up their
  minds, for it was now a quarter past three o&rsquo;clock, and the poll closed
  at four. It was then speedily settled that Shufflebotham and his men should,
  as a body, go up and vote for the Liberal candidate.</p>
  <p>Our chief agent here craved five minutes&mdash;saying he thought they ought
  to have a band of music. He secretly determined to grace the final <i>coup</i> by
  a demonstration in which three bands were to play their part. He also privately
  determined to bring Jem Smash, and all his fighting men, and all the other
  hired ruffians, to guard our new contingent, in case the enemy, suspecting
  a trick, should set their forces in battle array against our unprotected
  citizens. We should lose the election if even a short delay arose from an
  attack upon us. Shufflebotham thought they might as well have a little music.</p>
  <p>I was not at all sorry it was so arranged. I wanted to have a few words
  with Shufflebotham by himself, and to let him have a taste of my quality
  and smartness, or perhaps I should rather say, whet his appetite for that
  taste.</p>
  <p>The barber led me outside to the yard of the Pig and Whistle, and addressing
  me, inquired, &ldquo;I suppose you have got the money all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you give it us, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I cannot do that until you and your men
  have voted, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How am I to know that you will give it me then? No d&mdash;tricks,
  or by G&mdash;your gentleman&rdquo; (meaning the candidate) &ldquo;shall
  suffer for it, as true as my name&rsquo;s John Shufflebotham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Things had worked more felicitously than I had anticipated, or than my plans
  were estimated to work. I now saw that the patriotic barber was already outwitted,
  if I chose to break faith with him at this point. He was bound to vote as
  his men did, or if he slunk away he had secured them for us. It was now impossible
  to invent another excuse to those truly honest fellows for reversing their
  collective decision. Still I thought it would be as well to keep in with
  the barber to the last. I wanted to let him and some people see how neatly
  I could work out the stratagem.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I think you have as much right to trust me as I have to trust
  you,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind meeting you half-way. I
  don&rsquo;t care whether you do or not, though. I know those honest fellows
  will go up and vote for our man. You cannot prevent that now, can you, Mr.
  Shufflebotham? If you try to spoil our game (which I don&rsquo;t think you
  can spoil), our bargain is off, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t feel bound to give
  you any thing, whether you succeed in upsetting it or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shufflebotham saw that he was practically done, in the matter of security
  at least, and that he must entirely trust in me; so he agreed to meet me
  half-way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do, then?&rdquo; said Shufflebotham, and as he
  spoke the sound of wind-instruments floated on the summer breeze.</p>
  <p>It was evident that the musicians were coming in the direction of the Pig
  and Whistle.</p>
  <p>I was afraid of the finishing touches of my artifice being a little marred,
  so I hastily said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here: here&rsquo;s a hundred-pound note. I divide it in
  halves. I give you one half now&rdquo; (the musicians stopped, and I had
  to make this speech a little longer, so as to spin out the moments, and I
  proceeded to say slowly): &ldquo;To-morrow morning, as early as you like,
  you come up to the central committee-room and ask for me, and I will give
  you the other half. I might say this evening. It would be quite as well,
  perhaps; but some people with sharp eyes may be about. Now mind, Shufflebotham,
  don&rsquo;t tell any one of this. I would not have it known for the whole
  world. It would do you harm, you know. Keep it dark, like the blackest secret
  of our lives. Don&rsquo;t get drunk to-night, or you will let it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The musicians had arrived within a few feet of the door of the Pig and Whistle.
  The barber had been waiting in terrible anxiety for me to hand him over his
  half security, and I now wanted to do it without delay. The note, which was
  for 100<i>l.</i>, had been divided in halves, and was ready for my device.
  I handed him over his half, which he rapidly thrust into his trousers-pocket,
  and left me as he might leave a tormentor, shouting out, &ldquo;Come along,
  lads, and hear the music.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The procession moved forward amid deafening huzzas, and a volume of what
  I must, I suppose, as a matter of courtesy, call music, and the bewilderment
  of many spectators. Shufflebotham shouted, in well-feigned glee,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, my lads; he&rsquo;s a right &rsquo;un. We are all going
  to vote for him;&rdquo; and sundry other more extravagant exclamations.</p>
  <p>Twenty-three votes were recorded by ten minutes to four by John Shufflebotham
  and his friends, without let or hindrance from Tory prizefighters, roughs,
  or any other men. Shufflebotham did get drunk that night, and I neither saw
  nor heard any more of him until next morning.</p>
  <p>Next day, about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, John Shufflebotham called
  upon me at the committee-room as arranged. I preferred to have the attorney
  and the agent with me at this interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, John Shufflebotham,&rdquo; I was the first to say, &ldquo;I
  suppose you have come for the other half of your note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The patriotic barber, who had sold his vote and influence, looked a little
  sheepish and timid.</p>
  <p>I said, &ldquo;It is all right. These gentlemen are the lawyers; they know
  all about every thing connected with the election, and they are of course
  in our secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They know what I want, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; I observed, handing over to him the other
  half of the note which he sought; but as I did so, I said, &ldquo;It is of
  no use to you. It is a Bank-of-Elegance note, which another man of your trade
  in B&mdash; gives away in the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whether Shufflebotham had examined the first half of his note, I cannot
  say; but I had caused the print to be divided in such a way (to guard against
  accidents) that he would see the words &ldquo;Bank of E,&rdquo; and no more
  of the title of the establishment from which it purported to have been issued,
  and he was too illiterate or inexperienced in bank-notes to discover that
  the paper itself was not of the kind made for the Old Lady of Threadneedle
  Street.</p>
  <p>The patriotic barber was thunderstruck. He was speechless for a moment or
  two with disappointment and mortification. When he had partly recovered himself,
  he stamped once, and swore in about two sentences that we were plunderers,
  and that he would have us prosecuted for circulating bad money. Our attorney
  thought this a good joke. It was one of a sort that he could appreciate;
  so drawing upon his imagination for his law, by way of retort Mr. Yellowly
  informed Mr. Shufflebotham that he had been treated as he deserved, that
  he had &ldquo;better keep a quiet tongue in his head,&rdquo; that, at all
  events, he must behave himself in that room, or he would be kicked out by
  one of our roughs in close attendance, and that he might also get transported
  for bribery.</p>
  <p>The barber gnashed his teeth, and went away not rejoicing. I believe he
  has voted twice for the Tories since that day, without fee or reward&mdash;unless
  vengeance upon his Liberal betrayers was his motive and his compensation.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  A Romance Of Social Life</b></h2>
  <p>ABOUT four years ago there lived, in the neighbourhood of Kentish Town,
  a wedded couple of the name of Green.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green was a merchant, carrying on business in the City in co-partnership
  with a German gentleman; and in the enjoyment of a good income from &ldquo;a
  house&rdquo; at the head of which it was his pride to stand.</p>
  <p>The couple had not been long united in the holy bonds of matrimony. When
  he married, he considered himself fortunate in obtaining for his partner
  a pretty little brunette of a woman, somewhere about thirty years of age,
  and of no mean accomplishments. With this lady for his wife, Mr. Green lived
  for a period of three years in an easy and comfortable, not to say happy
  or blissful, state. The couple had no children; but with that exception they
  had all the ingredients which should contribute to the material and social
  happiness of human beings.</p>
  <p>The disparity in age between Mr. and Mrs. Green was perhaps a circumstance
  that contributed to limit the sources of affection; but, as every body said,
  they jogged along very cheerily, and the serenity and calmness of their lives
  made them the objects of a good deal of envy.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Green had been the daughter of a confidential clerk to her husband.
  She had lost her mother early in life, and her father died when she was but
  eighteen years of age. His salary in the house of Messrs. Green and Schnackwether
  had been, for a long period prior to his death, very liberal, and he might,
  with reasonable economy, have saved a few hundreds of pounds out of it if
  he had been so inclined. He ought, certainly, to have left some provision
  behind him in the shape of a life assurance, but he did not. He lived entirely
  up to, or somewhat beyond, his means. Miss Thomson, his daughter, was consequently
  obliged to earn her subsequent livelihood, which she did as a daily governess.
  Her experience in this vocation was not, I dare say, much unlike the experience
  of other young women in that position, of which the reader will have a tolerably
  accurate notion, and therefore I will abstain from describing it. It may
  be enough to say, that it was a cheerless, hard, and mortifying experience.
  She confessed that rebuffs and petty insults shut up, and the wearing influence
  of consecutive labour dried up, the wells of female emotion, gave a certain
  piquancy or sharpness to her thoughts, rendered her, indeed, distrustful
  of the world, and cynical, if not calculating and selfish.</p>
  <p>During her girlhood, while her father lived, and after his death, but before
  her marriage, Mrs. Green had received many kindnesses from her late parent&rsquo;s
  master. He was attached to his clerk Thomson by that sort of attachment,
  and to that extent, which long and faithful service begets in the mind of
  an employer.</p>
  <p>To do the father of Mrs. Green simple justice, it must be stated that he
  had never robbed; peculated, or been in the slightest degree unfaithful to
  the house he served, or its members.</p>
  <p>Just before he died, the clerk received a promise from his master, Mr. Green,
  that little Helen should want for nothing as long as she lived, which promise
  was kept during her subsequent spinstership by inquiries, every quarter,
  with methodical exactness, how she was getting on, and what she wanted; answers
  to which questions were frankly given by her on all occasions, and betrayed
  to the merchant some requirement on her part every three months. It would
  now be a dress or a bonnet; it would on another occasion be the means of
  paying a quarter&rsquo;s rent of her apartments; it would again be something
  else. The article itself, or a cheque for its purchase or satisfaction, was
  uniformly forthcoming.</p>
  <p>In this way a communication had been always maintained from the day of Thomson&rsquo;s
  death to the day of Miss Thomson&rsquo;s marriage between the young woman
  and her subsequent husband.</p>
  <p>The courtship of the merchant was very prosaic. How long he had made up
  his mind that little Helen should be his wife, or at least have the chance
  of becoming his wife, is more than I can tell; but certain it is, that on
  one quarter-day&mdash;I mean her quarter-day&mdash;she received a note, in
  which she was invited to the house of the merchant. He said in this letter
  of invitation that he was very anxious to know how she was getting on, and
  what her prospects were; in fact, he said he was anxious to redeem the promise
  he had given to her dying father by the inquiries he had to make, and the
  intention he had formed of providing, if he could, for her welfare as long
  as she lived,</p>
  <p>The last sentence was the only clue offered to the design of her benefactor.
  That clue was enough. It showed to her acute and reflecting mind what she
  might expect from the merchant, and she was thereby enabled to survey at
  her leisure, before the appointed interview, the prospect laid open to her.
  She balanced in her own mind all the apparent advantages and all the disadvantages
  of becoming Mrs. Green.</p>
  <p>She had no very high respect for Mr. Green&rsquo;s character,&mdash;yet
  she had no aversion to him. He was, indeed, one of those easy-going, even-natured
  men, who neither arouse affection nor excite the opposite of love. He was
  by no means the ideal which she had formed of a husband. Yet how could she,
  who had been a poor daily governess all her life, release her ambition in
  this respect? She had indulged the hope, as I dare say most young women have
  hoped, to marry a man handsome, educated, and of gentlemanly training&mdash;with
  a fortune. She would have been satisfied with a man of good standing or prospects
  in either one of the liberal professions&mdash;the army, navy, the law, or
  even the church. But a dispassionate consideration of Mr. Green&rsquo;s letter
  drove away all the phantasms of such ambition. She came, by a process of
  the severest reasoning, to the conclusion, in the first place, that, if she
  rejected the merchant&rsquo;s intended proposal, she might offend him. That
  was not, after all, so very serious a matter, as she was not very largely
  dependent upon his bounty; yet she could hardly afford to lose a friend.
  This conclusion led her to survey the bright side of Mr. Green&rsquo;s intended
  proposal. She would certainly, as Mrs. Green, be mistress of a liberal establishment.
  His years denied the reasonable prospect of her ever having a child. Yet
  this young woman, hardened by experience, saw a compensation for that denial
  of a true woman&rsquo;s hope in the freedom from a mother&rsquo;s cares and
  troubles. It was something to get rid of the drudgery of toil, and escape
  the snubbing and rebuffs of her present vocation. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; at length
  she said to herself, in forming her resolution, &ldquo;I might do worse than
  become Mrs. Green.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was only one small difficulty&mdash;there was a prior attachment. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she
  said to herself, &ldquo;I shall have to get rid of Edward. That is not so
  very difficult either. I do not think he would break his heart about it.
  I know I should not break mine if he were to throw me off. I do not believe
  in broken hearts. He cannot bring an action against me for breach of promise
  of marriage. That is a pleasant thing to know. I heard Mr. Jones, who is
  a lawyer, telling his wife at the tea-table only the other evening, that
  a gentleman never got any good by that, and I think he said a farthing was
  about the price a gentleman&rsquo;s damages would always be assessed at.
  Well, I could pay that sum without much injury to my own purse; and if any
  proceedings should be brought against my husband after I have married him.
  I suppose he would be responsible for them, among my other obligations, but
  I would pay that sum out of my pin-money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss Thomson agreed within herself to become Mrs. Green, and had so far
  realised this speculation in the lottery of life, that she began to sketch
  her future home, make arrangements for her bridal trousseau, &amp;c., within
  ten minutes after forming her resolution.</p>
  <p>Miss Thomson&rsquo;s anticipations were correct. Her benefactor told her
  he had noticed she had been a very hard-working girl. The way she had striven
  to keep herself as a lady out of her own earnings, with such little assistance
  as he had felt bound to render her, reflected the highest possible credit
  upon her. He had noticed her conduct&mdash;he might say with admiration.
  He had never beheld such a combination of all the virtues which make up a
  good woman as he had seen in her. Now, he hoped he should not frighten or
  startle her by a communication that he was going to make. He had been living
  a lonely life, she was aware. He was not married. She knew he had no sister
  who could manage his household, and secure him those attentions and comforts
  in which he thought he might reasonably indulge after having been, he might
  say, a very successful man in trade.</p>
  <p>During his speech Mr. Green stammered a little, and betrayed an unusual
  hesitation. At this point he had greater difficulty in articulation.</p>
  <p>However, he proceeded to say that his admiration for her, and his belief
  in her virtues, and the other circumstances he had mentioned, had led him
  to offer her his hand and his heart.</p>
  <p>The lady behaved as all ladies can, and I believe do, in such circumstances.</p>
  <p>She delivered a very nice speech, which had been many times rehearsed in
  her bedchamber, and on the pavement as she trudged to and from the house
  of Mr. Jones, which, as a daily governess, she was in the habit of traversing,
  and at other times and places. Gratitude was a word that thickly interlarded
  her periods. She said that she did not know how to accept the proposal he
  made her, and, after a skilful pause or two, having come to the conclusion
  that there was no danger in a little delay (and, aside with the reader let
  me add, become convinced that there was no prospect of his withdrawing the
  offer), she craved time to consider his most noble proposal&mdash;not on
  her own account, because, if she was a selfish thing, he would see that she
  must at once say yes&mdash;but because she scarcely felt equal to the position,
  and because the prospect of such an elevation dazzled and bewildered her
  little brain.</p>
  <p>This was the sum and substance of Miss Thomson&rsquo;s speech.</p>
  <p>The reader has already been informed that Mr. Green and Miss Thomson were
  married, and his imagination will supply the links in the narrative between
  the last interview and the realisation of that event.</p>
  <p>During the almost monotonous life Mr. and Mrs. Green lived, there would
  of course occasionally arise small vexations. Not that they quarrelled. Nothing
  of that sort marred their happiness.</p>
  <p>The vexations I speak of were of the most simple and ordinary kind. A friend
  promised to come and dine with them, and did not keep that promise. The tradesmen
  were not punctual in the delivery of their goods. The wine-merchant occasionally
  deceived Mr. Green, which caused him annoyance. The dressmaker or the milliner
  was not so exact as he or she ought perhaps to have been in executing Mrs.
  Green&rsquo;s orders. And those sort of things annoyed the one or the other
  of them.</p>
  <p>Another annoyance in this house arose from&mdash;what Mr. Henry Mayhew has
  entitled the greatest plague in life&mdash;a bad servant. They had one or
  two bad servants, and on several occasions Mrs. Green made the observation,
  not, I think, quite unique&mdash;a sort of remark, on the other hand, which
  had been made by other ladies, and I believe will be again&mdash;that it
  was impossible to get a good servant.</p>
  <p>However, one good servant was at last obtained. She was a young woman about
  twenty-four or twenty-five years of age. She was, to say the least about
  her merits, somewhat pretty. I have heard her described as beautiful. When
  I last saw her, I thought her exceedingly beautiful. She was, moreover, by
  no means an illiterate girl. She had received a fair amount of education&mdash;a
  much better education than girls in her station usually receive.</p>
  <p>In consequence of the superior manners of this girl she was admitted to
  a considerable share of the confidence and respect of both her master and
  her mistress, and was allowed an amount of discretion in the arrangements
  of the household which is not usually given or permitted in such cases. Mrs.
  Green contemplated, with her husband&rsquo;s approval, the extension of their
  establishment by the engagement of a third servant, and elevating this young
  woman to the position of a recognised companion to the lady.</p>
  <p>Some time after this notion had been formed, there was discovered a new
  series of annoyances in the house of Mr. Green. A number of portable articles
  of value were missed. How they went appeared one of the greatest of all possible
  human mysteries. Discovery seemed impossible, and the irritation of the husband
  was excessive. His wife, moreover, inveighed in the bitterest terms against
  the undetected thief.</p>
  <p>It was agreed between Mr. and Mrs. Green to lay all sorts of traps. They
  did so, but did not succeed in fixing any body with the crime.</p>
  <p>The reader will imagine how such an affair operated. Not only did suspicion
  begin with the lowest and end with the highest of the three servants in the
  household, but it embraced every one of the few friends who came to see Mr.
  or Mrs. Green; and in the failure to discover the delinquent, or get the
  foundation for a rational and decided suspicion, even supernatural agencies
  were beginning to be hinted at by the wife. She, however, always prefaced
  her hints of this kind to her husband as women do their ideas of that sort,
  by a declaration that she was not superstitious, but if she was, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
  <p>At length the loss of a gold watch, which Mr. Green had presented to his
  wife on her marriage, with a gold chain, drove that man pretty near the boundary
  of madness. When he first heard of it, he was frantic. He raved and he cursed,
  uttering language such as his wife had never heard from his lips before against
  some person or persons unknown, and vowing the direst vengeance against the
  offender. He declared that if he or she were his own brother or sister (which
  obviously could not be, as he had no brother or sister), he would transport
  him or hang him or her. And he also said that the worst feature of the case
  was the total impossibility in tracing the thief. He did not like to be beaten
  in that manner. It was so deuced aggravating not to know what had become
  of the things; that is, who had stolen them. It was such a hard thing to
  be suspecting all the servants and their friends. Was he to dismiss all the
  servants? If so, how did he know that he should then get rid of the thief?
  Was he to banish all his friends from his house? How did he know that it
  was some pretended friend that was robbing them? He finished in mutterings,
  which, although not capable of being accurately embalmed in printer&rsquo;s
  ink, may be safely interpreted as imprecations and direful threats.</p>
  <p>In this mode his conversation with his wife one evening rambled; and at
  the conclusion of his incoherent ejaculations, he started to his feet as
  if he had made a grand discovery. &ldquo;By G&mdash;, it must be somebody
  in the house. It must be one of the servants. It must be that girl you have
  so fondled and caressed. The ungrateful wretch! If I find it out to be her,
  and I must find it out, I will have her arrested, prosecuted, transported.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His wife was terrified. The idea of prosecuting this poor girl, whose life
  in many respects resembled her own,&mdash;the chief point of difference being,
  in fact, that she had not been able to catch a merchant husband,&mdash;told
  on Mrs. Green&rsquo;s sympathies. Yet, as she said to her husband&mdash;if
  he were right&mdash;it was horrid ingratitude in that girl to rob them so&mdash;if
  she had done it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; suggested the wife, &ldquo;we should be mistaken,
  how cruel will be the suspicions we have engendered!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cruel!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband; &ldquo;yes, if we are mistaken.
  But how can we be mistaken?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ran through the circumstances under which several articles of value had
  been lost, to show that no friend or acquaintance could have robbed them.</p>
  <p>Burglary was impossible, because of the frequency, the width of time and
  occasion, and the comparative smallness, of the plunder.</p>
  <p>It must, at all events, be one or other of the servants; and he felt it
  to be his duty to investigate the matter thoroughly. He was determined to
  do this. It was a duty they owed to themselves, and the other servants, and
  all their friends, and to the world, that this thief should be detected.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Green said she could not bring her mind to a prosecution. She said
  that, at all events, the most she would do was to turn away either of the
  servants who was discovered. The case was certainly very bad, and the thief
  deserved all he or she got.</p>
  <p>The husband reserved his decision. Perhaps, if the wretch confessed, he
  might be disposed to listen to her appeal for mercy. If that girl (for he
  persisted it must be her) dared to belie the evidence which must be got against
  her, he would have no compunction in hanging her.</p>
  <p>With that kind of rashness or folly which men under such circumstances commit,
  he turned to his wife, and most unreasonably said to her, &ldquo;Now, Helen,
  my dear, you must find out the thief for me. I know it must be that girl.
  Now, find her out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Among the little trinkets Mrs. Green possessed were a bracelet and a locket,
  neither of which had hitherto been missed.</p>
  <p>Both of them had been seen by her and her husband within two days before
  the present conversation. She missed them, as she afterwards explained, the
  day following this conversation. It was very strange that they should have
  disappeared just at that time. For her part, she would, if she could, screen
  the culprit; but her husband&rsquo;s mandate left her no discretion. She
  was to find out the thief. What to do she did not know. She thought of searching
  the girl&rsquo;s boxes&mdash;or of having them searched by a policeman. No,
  she would not do that. She hoped that her husband would not prosecute. She
  therefore contented herself by communicating this further loss to Mr. Green,
  and explaining to him the reasons which had stayed her in the extreme means
  of discovery.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green, on his return home, was uneasy and excited. Something had seemingly
  crossed him in the City. I believe an advice his house received that morning
  told the firm of the bankruptcy of a Hamburg correspondent. This fact had
  soured the merchant&rsquo;s temper, and inflamed his desire for vengeance.</p>
  <p>When his wife communicated her suspicions, he at once insisted upon a search
  of the girl and of her trunks.</p>
  <p>Just at this moment, or before the resolution was carried out, a friend
  dropped in to see them. He observed a gloom on the countenance of the merchant,
  and began to rally him. The visitor wanted to know whether the firm of Green
  and Schnackwether were going to appear in next Tuesday&rsquo;s <i>Gazette</i>,
  and what the devil was the matter with him. He did not care to avow his loss
  in the City, and found an adequate explanation in his losses at home.</p>
  <p>This friend suggested that examining the trunks was perhaps not an unwise
  thing; but he also joined in the wife&rsquo;s appeal for mercy, said that
  he thought the better plan would be to send the girl off to her friends,
  if she had any, and that he would not advise the expense and trouble of a
  prosecution.</p>
  <p>The merchant, however, fully explained his reasons for not acceding to the
  last suggestion, and resolved upon the search.</p>
  <p>The three servants were called into the room which Mr. Green denominated
  his library, and, in the presence of his friend and his wife, they were catechised.
  They all stoutly denied the crime. They all shed tears, and sobbed, and demanded
  an investigation. They each resented the suspicion as cruel and unjust. A
  boy engaged as page and kitchen-assistant was defiant, and hinted vaguely
  that his father and mother would not stand it; that Mr. Green would hear
  about it; and that he would not stay in the house another moment after his
  boxes were searched&mdash;which they might be at once.</p>
  <p>The search began with the boxes of the young male servant, and nothing was
  traced in them.</p>
  <p>The trunks of the favoured young woman of superior beauty and accomplishments
  were next searched. In one of them was found one of these trinkets and a
  duplicate of the other.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green&rsquo;s rage knew no bounds. In vain the girl protested her innocence,
  and declared it was the wicked device of some wretch for her destruction,
  or horrid conspiracy by some dreadful enemy to blast her reputation and dishonour
  her poor parents, which planted the evidence against her.</p>
  <p>The merchant told her that if she confessed her crime he might forgive her.
  She would not admit a crime that, she said, she had not committed.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Green remonstrated with the girl about her obstinacy, and advised her
  that it would be better to confess an offence which was so fairly brought
  home to her, and against the evidence of which it was impossible for a single
  moment to contend. The girl threw herself upon her mistress&rsquo;s sympathy,
  hoping that <i>she</i> at least could not think her guilty of the crime attributed
  to her, although appearances were so much against her.</p>
  <p>At last, under the cross-fire from these accusers, the young woman, who
  still refused to confess, dropped into a chair, and, in tones of agony, implored
  God to witness that she had never taken a thing that did not belong to her
  from any human being.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green said this was more than he could stand. Such frightful hypocrisy,
  such horrid cant, such blasphemy, was the grossest outrage upon Heaven he
  had ever beheld. He told the boy to fetch a policeman, which service the
  lad rendered with alacrity. The already-convicted thief was given into the
  custody of the officer, taken to the station-house, and locked up.</p>
  <p>The next day at the police-court the evidence of these facts was laid before
  the magistrate. The pawnbroker who had taken in the pledge was not able to
  identify the prisoner as the female who had pawned the article; but said
  that she was about the height, age, and appearance of the prisoner, although
  he would not swear to her. It was pledged, he said, about the hour of twelve
  in the morning; and Mrs. Green being called upon to give evidence as to the
  movements of her servant, with a view of confirming or breaking down the
  pawnbroker&rsquo;s suspicion&mdash;as the case might be&mdash;was obliged
  to say that Eliza had been out on an errand for her mistress between eleven
  and twelve o&rsquo;clock on the day referred to.</p>
  <p>The scene in that police-court was one of the most painful things ever witnessed.
  The prisoner had no professional assistance. No expert attorney was there
  to help or mar her defence. All she did, and all she said, was a repetition
  of what she had told her mistress and master and their friend the night before.
  She protested that she was as innocent as an unborn child; that her hands
  had been trained by parents (whose memory she revered, and who tenderly loved
  her) to honest industry; and that she had no more perpetrated these thefts
  than the worthy magistrate. She appealed to her mistress to bear evidence
  of her general character. (Mr. Green was not in court.) Her mistress gave
  her a general good character, and expressed the grief of herself and her
  husband at the discovery in the servant&rsquo;s boxes.</p>
  <p>The magistrate put a question or two to the mistress, who seemed to betray
  an idea that one of the other servants, or some friend, had been the thief;
  or that, at least, the accused had not been, although she did not say as
  much in distinct terms.</p>
  <p>The tone and manner of the girl had evidently impressed the magistrate with
  the belief that she was not in her proper place when in that dock before
  him as a criminal. He, however, remarked that the case was one of very grave
  suspicion, and that he should remand her for a week, in order that inquiries
  might be made, with a view to getting further evidence upon the case.</p>
  <p>The accused had looked forward to her appearance in court as the ordeal
  which would establish her innocence. She had never doubted for a moment that
  a police magistrate would unravel the mystery, and turn the tide of false
  suspicion from her. When she heard the last words fall from the lips of the
  presiding justice, and ascertained that she was to be sent back to something
  like the loathsome cell she had passed the previous night in, her spirits
  gave way. She uttered one heart-rending shriek, swooned, and was carried
  down from the dock&mdash;senseless.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Green narrated circumstantially to Mr. Green what had taken place in
  court that afternoon, with a minute exactness, as he sipped his wine after
  dinner. As she did so, I believe he half repented the prosecution of this
  poor girl, although not a shadow of a doubt rested upon his mind as to her
  guilt. He said he thought it was a pity she had not confessed. As the hours
  rolled on, and bedtime approached, and he was about entering the solemnity
  of night&mdash;when, I am inclined to think, men&rsquo;s better thoughts
  usually gain the ascendency (that is, unless the thinker be <i>intent</i> on
  the perpetration of crime)&mdash;he confessed that he did not know what to
  do; that he thought the poor girl ought to have an attorney employed for
  her; and that he would see his lawyer about it in the morning.</p>
  <p>Next morning after having perused his letters, Mr. Green went to consult
  Mr. Scrowle, his private solicitor, about the engagement of some other attorney
  for the defence of the girl. Mr. Scrowle, however, put rather a new complexion
  on the affair. When he heard the previous good character of the accused;
  when he was informed of her solemn protestations of innocence in the house;
  when it transpired that the boy had run for a policeman with such pleasant,
  not to say indecent, haste; and was told that the magistrate was impressed
  by the girl&rsquo;s declaration of innocence,&mdash;Mr. Scrowle suggested
  to his client, Mr. Green, that his servant had possibly been the victim of
  what is called by thieves a &ldquo;plant;&rdquo; that one of the servants
  (perhaps that boy) might have been the thief, and might have placed the things
  in the girl&rsquo;s box for the purpose of directing suspicion upon her.
  Mr. Green did not think it likely that his attorney was correct, because
  of the difficulty the boy would have in getting at the room from which the
  trinkets were taken; but his lawyer, in reply, said he did not think much
  of such an argument, because thieves found opportunities of getting what
  they wanted under the most adverse or difficult circumstances. The attorney
  then suggested that Mr. Green might possibly get into trouble over the matter
  himself.</p>
  <p>Many reasons, but particularly the last reason, inclined Mr. Scrowle to
  endorse the suggestion of his client, that the girl should be provided with
  legal assistance, procured at the cost of the prosecutor; and, when this
  point had been settled, Mr. Green told his lawyer he thought that, after
  all, the girl had been punished enough, and that he should not have any objection
  whatever to letting her off, if it could be arranged, although she was an
  ungrateful and an obstinate minx for not confessing.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green, who was a somewhat careful, not to say a penurious man, with
  great reluctance consented to give his solicitor authority to take what steps
  he might deem necessary,&mdash;either to pursue or to withdraw from the prosecution,
  to defend the girl, to unravel the mystery of the case, and to arrange it
  if possible, or thought that step expedient.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green&rsquo;s solicitor, at this stage of the business, sent for me.
  I got leave to accompany the attorney who was employed for the defence (acting
  in the capacity of his clerk) to the house of detention, where we had an
  interview with the poor girl. It was one of the most painful scenes I have
  ever gone through. She had completely fascinated the matron and the female
  warders, who, accustomed to deal uniformly with crime, were slow to believe
  in any theory of a prisoner&rsquo;s innocence; yet they believed this girl
  perfectly innocent; and relying upon my experience of human nature, I almost
  immediately wrote her down as innocent.</p>
  <p>It was evident to me, as I told her legal adviser, that a &ldquo;plant&rdquo; had
  been made upon her.</p>
  <p>When he came out of the gaol, like a blackguard as he was, he said to me, &ldquo;You
  must not let the case go off at the next examination, because both you and
  I ought to have some costs out of it.&rdquo; With difficulty I was prevented
  grasping the fellow by the throat. I did, however, suppress my loathing and
  indignation, and played the hypocrite with him sufficiently to suggest that
  it would be a good thing if we could get her off at once. There would be
  more credit attaching to us, I argued, than if the magistrate should commit
  the girl at the next examination for trial, and some ranting barrister of
  the Old-Bailey school got her off, and obtained all the merit. As to costs,
  I suggested that most likely some arrangement could be made for a fixed sum,
  so that he might earn as much by a successful defence at the next magistrates&rsquo; meeting
  as at the sessions. These arguments had their weight with the attorney, and
  he soon coincided with me in thinking that we had better bring the case to
  as speedy a termination as we could.</p>
  <p>At the suggestion of Mr. Green&rsquo;s own private attorney, I took a note
  of introduction to him at his house, with a view of consulting him directly
  on the facts of this case.</p>
  <p>I was immediately shown into the library, where I found the merchant and
  his wife talking; and I was led into the drawing-room by Mr. Green, as I
  thought for the purpose of making a demonstration or producing an effect
  upon me.</p>
  <p>We left Mrs. Green in the library. As Mr. Green, in the drawing-room, began
  to relate to me his conviction of the girl&rsquo;s guilt, my eye rested upon
  a splendid piano, the lid of which was closed, and, as I afterwards found,
  fastened, but jammed in which I thought I saw the corner of a note.</p>
  <p>Here, I said to myself, is a clue. Something has been concealed in that
  piano for the purpose, I dare say, of removal to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s,
  or assayer&rsquo;s, hereafter. In imagination I dimly perceived, through
  the walnut-tree lid of the piano, something wrapped in that envelope of which
  a corner was palpably visible.</p>
  <p>I did not venture to disclose my thoughts at once to Mr. Green. I did not
  know what effect any surprise might have upon him. I did not know that he
  might not spoil my game by some indiscretion on his part, if abruptly let
  into an explanation, &amp;c. I let him talk, and I talked; but I thought
  also none the less.</p>
  <p>Thus I mused as we chatted. Could that be a corner of an envelope, or was
  it a stray fragment of paper? It might or it might not be a clue. It might
  be nothing, after all, but an accidental bit of paper; or perhaps one of
  Mrs. Green&rsquo;s domestic accounts, laid there by her thoughtlessness.</p>
  <p>No, it was a clue. It might not be a trinket. It might be a letter. I was
  perplexed and tantalised, and even, let me confess it, impatient to get that
  piano unlocked.</p>
  <p>But Mr. Green might he seek to destroy the clue, in order to make good his
  consistency, if it led, as I had no doubt it would, in a contrary direction
  to that his suspicions had taken?</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the interview we had this conversation: &ldquo;Can you,
  sir, bear any sudden revelation touching this matter, which may, perhaps,
  show that you are wrong in your suspicions?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Green, &ldquo;I am an honest and upright man.
  I don&rsquo;t think I am wrong; but if you can show me that I am wrong, I
  am the man to confess so, and to make every reparation in my power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt, sir; but you must pardon my caution. Gentlemen when surprised
  are not always so discreet as on ordinary occasions; and it must be an unpleasant
  thing to feel that you have been made a party to the punishment of an innocent
  person for a thief&rsquo;s crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Green had before this seriously looked at the possibility of its turning
  out that his servant had been injured by him. He had comforted himself by
  the notion that, as he had acted <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, no great blame could
  attach to him; and if such discovery were made, he had determined to pursue
  the honourable course of restoring the injured girl, as far as he could,
  to her place in society. He assured me again of that fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;you will place yourself entirely
  in my hands pending this investigation. I shall ask you to let me search
  this house from top to bottom, and in every nook and cranny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Green scarcely liked that. I somewhat surprised him, and threw him for
  a moment in embarrassment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly think that necessary,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and you know I have had much experience.
  I am afraid that time enough has been already given for the destruction of
  some traces of guilt; but I am sure that every hour facilitates the destruction
  of others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will, then, sir,&rdquo; said the merchant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I will again ask you to fortify yourself against the discovery
  of any thing surprising; to act with reserve; and I would implore you not
  to get up a scene in my presence. If the lad or your other female servant
  should, as the result of my investigations, be hunted down this evening,
  I shall ask you to take no steps for his or her punishment, or until you
  have had time for reflection. In the mean time, I will take care of the proofs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be it so, then, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I propose to begin the search in this room, as we are here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stepped to the piano, and was about raising the lid, which, of course,
  did not open at my desire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you the key of this piano?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; my wife has it. You had better ask Mrs. Green for it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He called his wife in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this gentleman is a private detective.
  I have told him that we are anxious for the fullest investigation, and shall
  be glad, indeed, if your servant in custody can be found innocent, although
  I feel that is totally impossible. Still he thinks he will be able to get
  some evidence that will divert suspicion from Eliza to one of the other servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Green, &ldquo;it is an unpleasant thing
  to have one&rsquo;s house pulled about in this way; but I suppose it cannot
  be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I nodded assent to the lady&rsquo;s speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me have the key of this piano?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The piano, sir!&rdquo; she said falteringly. &ldquo;That is my piano.
  What do you require the key of <i>that</i> for?&rdquo; And the colour came
  and went from her olive countenance, in a way that told me I had discovered
  the real thief in the merchant&rsquo;s wife.</p>
  <p>A train of thought passed through my mind as rapidly as messages are conveyed
  by the harnessed lightning over house-tops, beneath the solid earth, or under
  the sea. This was a curious little instance of kleptomania. The poor wife&rsquo;s
  morbid secretiveness, acquisitiveness, or whatever a phrenologist might call &ldquo;the
  organ,&rdquo; was in large excess. I pitied her. Could I here abandon the
  search, and leave the poor lady&rsquo;s crime a mystery, or an undetected
  fact? No; that would not do. She, at least, had permitted the servant, my
  client, to be accused. I knew the depth of woman&rsquo;s cunning. I know
  how tenaciously one will cling to the outward forms of respectability and
  of virtue. I know how horribly unscrupulous a criminal at bay, with the chance
  of setting the dogs of the law on the wrong scent, could be. To relax in
  my vigilance would be fatal to my innocent client, whose late mistress, the
  real thief, would forge other proofs of the guilt of the guiltless.</p>
  <p>Why did I reason to myself thus? Does not innocence tremble, and lose its
  self-possession under the remotest suspicion of an offence? Does not guilt,
  as a rule, maintain its self-possession, and look with a bold front upon
  the perils of its situation? Yes. Ordinarily I see in embarrassment an indication,
  not of guilt, but of innocence. But in Mrs. Green&rsquo;s case there was
  a firmness with the embarrassment; there was an expression which I cannot
  describe in words. There was a dread of me visible in the attempt to hide
  that fear. There was an indescribable <i>something</i>, which operated on
  my mind as moral evidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t press for the key, madam, if you are unwilling to let
  me have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am unwilling only, sir, because I think it an impudent request.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;no request can be impudent which
  is explained by the fact that I am collecting evidence to rescue innocence
  from ruin and shame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall not give you the key of my piano.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again, madam, I say I will not press you for it; but I will state,
  in the presence of your husband, that I think it necessary to know what is
  contained in that piece of furniture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Green was thunderstruck, and bewildered to the verge of insanity. A
  light dawned upon his mind, of which I was then unconscious. He recollected,
  as he shortly after told me, that not a week before, having entered the drawing-room,
  in order to meet his wife, on his return from the City about half an hour
  before his usual time, he found her sitting by the piano. She heavily closed
  the lid of it as he opened the door.</p>
  <p>It was a minute or two after this light dawned upon him before he recovered
  his self-possession enough to open his mouth.</p>
  <p>His first silent inquiry then was how to save his own humiliation by covering
  his wife&rsquo;s disgrace; but this desire mingled with indignation and disgust
  that she, so well provided for&mdash;even to the matter of pin-money&mdash;should
  rob her own home. It was, he argued, criminal insanity. Yet he must dissemble,
  and baffle me if he could, he thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you want to open my wife&rsquo;s piano for,
  or why you can wish to inspect the piece of paper, if it be a piece of paper,
  you see, which I am not certain about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Green,&rdquo; I said solemnly, &ldquo;I shall insist upon opening
  that piano. I shall break it open if the key is not given me. I have a trust
  reposed in me, than which nothing can be more solemn or stern. It is my habit,
  sir, to do my duty; and in the present case no earthly consideration of profit
  or reward would induce me to forego the slightest clue to the vindication
  of the woman whose fate, I may say, is in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The situation was a very awkward one for all parties.</p>
  <p>I thought the better plan would be to take upon myself the first action,
  and thus relieve Mrs. Green from any further refusal to produce the key,
  by taking from my pocket a small instrument sufficiently powerful to break
  the lock. I did this, and neither husband nor wife ventured to resist me.</p>
  <p>As I lifted the lid a letter became visible. Mrs. Green snatched at it,
  endeavouring to grasp it off the key-board of the instrument.</p>
  <p>I had anticipated such an act on her part, and, as she felt the resistance
  of my right arm, I took it with my left hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a letter of mine, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be, madam; but I must know the contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you allow that?&rdquo; she inquired of her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am entitled,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to my wife&rsquo;s letters.
  They are surely not your property, but mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no dispute, sir, about the property in the letter; but its
  contents, I suspect, belong to an unfortunate young woman now lying in prison
  on a charge of which I take her to be as guiltless as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you propose to make that out,&rdquo; said
  the wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor do I, in frankness I may admit,&rdquo; was my rejoinder, &ldquo;yet <i>know</i>;
  but I think this letter will help me to the solution of the whole mystery
  of the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again it appeared to me that I must extricate the merchant and his wife
  from momentary difficulty by some action on my part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;keep this letter until next Monday,
  when, if you insist upon it, it shall be handed over to the magistrate; but,
  in strictness, I must say I think I ought to read it at once, and, if I afterwards
  see fit, hand it over to the prisoner&rsquo;s attorney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Green. &ldquo;You must give it up
  to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His wife also vehemently claimed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With all respect to you, sir, and to you, madam, I shall take the
  responsibility of detaining it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The husband, who all this while had been a prey to intensely painful emotion,
  then desired his wife to leave us alone, saying that he would manage me;
  and, after considerable hesitation, she did so. As she left the room I thought
  I could distinctly trace, in the lines of that pretty countenance, the external
  signs of a mind racked with the agony of crime.</p>
  <p>When she had left, I took a chair, and Mr. Green did the same.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This letter, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;may be an ordinary one, containing
  nothing that can affect the unfortunate prisoner&rsquo;s case; and if so
  I shall be perfectly prepared to hand it over to you at once; but I shall
  now ask, if you please, as a matter of courtesy, to permit me to read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A letter of my wife&rsquo;s, sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a letter of your wife&rsquo;s; and I can promise you no secrecy
  about its contents until I know what they are. If these contents be not essential
  to the interests of the prisoner, and do not call for its use, whatever be
  the secret this letter embodies, no living soul will get the least idea of
  that secret from me. If, on the other hand, it will furnish a material link
  in the evidence of that unfortunate girl&rsquo;s innocence, no considerations,
  no regard to the position, circumstances, or happiness of you, will induce
  me to abstain from using it in a way to secure her liberation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you should let me read it first,&rdquo; said the husband,
  in terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must allow me to reverse the order of perusal. <i>I</i> must
  read it first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Green rose and paced the room. I sat musing, and observing him. At last
  he turned, and said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I can rely upon your judgment sir.&rdquo; He sat down beside
  me. I read the letter in tones loud enough for him to hear, but let no sentence
  or word of it pass through the keyhole of that drawing-room door.</p>
  <p>We drew our chairs closer together as I read the letter. It was addressed
  to the merchant&rsquo;s wife, in the handwriting of the party with whom the
  prior attachment of her heart had been contracted,&mdash;from whom it had
  never been severed. She had in vain sought to wean her affections from him
  as soon as she received the proposal from her present husband; but it was
  useless. Cold, cynical, calculating, as she had been rendered by stern experience,
  there was yet in her breast sufficient of that element of human love to bind
  the attachment of her purer days. She did not muster courage for a long while
  to apprise the lover of her intended marriage. When she did so, he received
  it with what he called &ldquo;philosophical resignation.&rdquo; He professed
  to resign her, and no doubt did resign her, to what he said and conceived
  would be &ldquo;a more satisfactory marriage.&rdquo; It was, however, agreed
  between the lovers that their acquaintance should continue on the basis of
  friendship; but neither of them being led by high and lofty sentiment, being
  indeed both of a somewhat inferior nature, they were incapable of maintaining
  that cold relationship which even better minds might have found it no easy
  task to preserve in its frigid integrity. The attachment of friendship ripened
  into criminal love before the merchant took the lady to the altar. That criminal
  relationship continued after marriage. Misfortune fell upon the lover nearly
  as soon as good fortune was realised by the woman intended for his wife,
  who had become the wife of another. He applied to her to assist him with
  her purse. She did this with all she could obtain from her husband&mdash;saved
  from domestic outlay. The demands upon the wife from this source, however,
  increased with her freedom or desire to satisfy them. Money, easily and ill-gotten
  by the paramour from his mistress, was lightly spent. What had been asked
  for in the first instance in tones of humble supplication, was ere long demanded
  under threats of exposure.</p>
  <p>The letter taken from the piano demanded the sum of 10<i>l.</i>, in order
  that the writer might satisfy what he was pleased to call &ldquo;a debt of
  honour&rdquo; within three days. He must, he said, have the money, and he
  would have it. The wretch had the brutal audacity to say to this unfortunate
  woman in his power, &ldquo;You have more to suffer by exposure than I have;
  and look out, if you don&rsquo;t let me have the money.&rdquo; This amount
  the wretched woman could not procure. She had about a week previously supplied
  him with a like sum, and his demands upon her had of late been so heavy that
  she had been in daily apprehension her husband would discover the malversation
  of the funds he had supplied her with to keep his house. Bills which she
  professed to have paid remained unsatisfied. Several hundreds of pounds had
  been diverted from their legitimate application. She had, therefore, on this
  occasion, as she had done on some other occasions when similarly situated,
  given him the material by which, through the pawnbroker, or in some such
  mode, he might raise the money he required for his unhallowed purposes; and
  be once more extracted, through his criminal hold over the mind, conscience,
  and body of the wife, the cash to expend in debauchery. The watch and chain,
  and some other trinkets, had been given by the wife to her paramour, and
  by him disposed of.</p>
  <p>The effect which this letter produced upon the merchant may be more easily
  conceived than described. It is enough to say that this tolerably strong-minded
  man, who had so well played his part throughout the interview I have at such
  length described, here broke down, completely unnerved. He put himself under
  my guidance, and quitted the house with me that evening, leaving Mrs. Green
  therein&mdash;alone.</p>
  <p>Mr. Green and I had a meeting on the following day at the office of his
  solicitor, to whom I handed a copy of the letter; and I also supplied a copy
  to the attorney for the prisoner. It was arranged between Mr. Green&rsquo;s
  solicitor and his client that a person should be sent up to take immediate
  possession of the house at Kentish Town, which he had evacuated on the previous
  night.</p>
  <p>The man, on his arrival there, discovered that Mrs. Green had fled. She
  took her departure early that morning. She left no article behind that was
  easy of removal. A somewhat extensive wardrobe was packed in boxes. All the
  articles of jewelry, that were easily convertible into money, she also took.
  Mr. Green had, at my suggestion, left her ten cheques, drawn upon his private
  bankers, for 5<i>l.</i> each, and each post-dated seven days apart. These,
  of course, she took with her. She left no address behind her. She took neither
  of the servants for companionship. Whither she had gone to nobody knew, nor
  did I care.</p>
  <p>There was a meeting between the solicitor for the prosecutor and the solicitor
  for the prisoner&mdash;in confidence, and without prejudice.</p>
  <p>Communications were, under this shield, freely exchanged. The poor girl
  was told that an application would be made for her release, when next taken
  before the magistrate, under circumstances that would be afterwards explained
  to her. She was further informed that her master was confident of her innocence;
  that the guilty person had been traced, but would not be prosecuted. For
  the injury she had received at his hands, which he was sorry to confess was
  the consequence of his rash impulses, he asked her forgiveness, which she
  readily granted him.</p>
  <p>At the next examination before the magistrate the prosecutor&rsquo;s solicitor,
  who appeared for the first time, said that the case had been investigated
  since the former meeting, and that he would ask his worship&rsquo;s permission
  to be allowed to withdraw from the prosecution. The magistrate at once turned
  to the prisoner&rsquo;s solicitor, asked whether he had any objection to
  that course, and received for reply that his client had no objection to her
  release without conditions.</p>
  <p>The poor girl was accordingly liberated, and taken away under the care of
  a relative, in whose hands means were placed for her immediate comfortable
  provision. Mr. Green provided those means.</p>
  <p>Of Mrs. Green I have since heard. Indeed I had another engagement to trace
  her, the clue to which was furnished by herself. She employed an attorney
  about two months after her flight from Kentish Town, who waited upon the
  private solicitor of her husband, and implored him, on the ground of humanity,
  to let her have money. The advocate begged him to think of the discredit
  that would attach to Mr. Green if the woman who bore his name were reduced
  to distress, absolute privation, and perhaps the workhouse. After several
  consultations with his solicitor, Mr. Green declined to allow any thing.
  He professed a total unconcern as to what became of the worthless woman;
  and in reply to a menace, then delicately put forward or hinted by her legal
  adviser, that she would be a source of annoyance to her husband, Mr. Green&rsquo;s
  solicitor informed his professional friend that his client would not scruple
  to hand her over to the police if she did so. So ended the negotiation.</p>
  <p>Some time had rolled away since the liberation of the prisoner. Mr. Green
  continued to take considerable interest in her welfare. He frequently visited
  the residence of her aunt, at Camberwell, and betrayed an almost tender solicitude
  about the girl. In fact tender is the right part of speech to use as the
  qualification of solicitude in this case.</p>
  <p>The merchant called upon his solicitor one day, and had a long conference
  with him. Without taking the reader through from the beginning to the end
  of that private conference, I may inform him that Mr. Green was determined
  that Sir Cresswell Cresswell should rend asunder the bonds which had been
  forged by Hymen or the Church-of-England minister, if legal evidence of the
  infidelity of his wife could be produced, and he imagined there would be
  very little trouble in getting it. The letter which had been discovered in
  the piano would of course be very important, but was not sufficient in itself.</p>
  <p>I was accordingly employed, and following up such traces as I apprehended
  would lead me on her track. I was not a great while before I discovered that
  Mrs. Green had become &ldquo;one more unfortunate&rdquo; parading Waterloo
  Place every night, at present decked in the garments which Mr. Green, her
  husband, had purchased; and I further learnt that, out of the proceeds of
  her sin, she was maintaining &ldquo;the prior attachment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When all this evidence had been collected and laid before Dr. Jinks, a very
  accomplished lawyer, as I have seen cause to know, who practises in the court
  till recently presided over so ably by Sir Cresswell Cresswell; and when
  his opinion had been written upon &ldquo;a case,&rdquo; to the effect that
  there was no doubt the court would grant Mr. Green a divorce from his adulterous
  wife,&mdash;that gentleman called upon Eliza&rsquo;s aunt, and explained
  to her that he felt bound to mark at once his sense of the merit and virtues
  of her niece, and his desire to make the amplest reparation in his power
  for the injuries inflicted upon her, by offering to place her in the position
  of her late mistress as soon as the legal ceremonies clearing the way had
  been effected.</p>
  <p>The court readily granted a divorce. The opposition on the wife&rsquo;s
  part was but a sham resistance. It was an attorney&rsquo;s defence, that
  would never have been made if the law, in its kindly regard for woman under
  all circumstances, had not allowed her, although demoralised, to dip her
  hands in an injured husband&rsquo;s pocket for the costs of any pretended
  resistance to his prayer, as well as for alimony during the litigation. As
  soon as Mr. Green issued his citation, he had to allow his wife at the rate
  of 600<i>l.</i> per annum until he got his decree for a dissolution of the
  marriage, and he had also to pay her attorney 150<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
  <p>These moneys being paid, and these processes having been gone through, and
  after further waiting the time prescribed by law for the other side&mdash;that
  is, for Mrs. Green&mdash;to appeal against the court&rsquo;s decision, no
  such appeal having been attempted, the adulterous woman was no longer entitled
  to the use of the merchant&rsquo;s name; she ceased to be, in the eye of
  the law, in any respect his wife; and Eliza became Mrs. Green, under the
  sanction of law and of the Established Church of England.</p>

  The Virtue Of An American Passport</b></h2>
  <p>I WAS once employed to track an absconding bankrupt and hand him over to
  the tender mercies of a criminal court. There was nothing in the case, as
  it appeared on my instructions, to distinguish it from a host of other cases.
  It had not even the merit of difficulty to lend it interest. I made sure
  of catching my man with little trouble, as I did, and as I will point out.
  The affair, however, took a rather curious turn in the sequel, as the reader
  will perceive.</p>
  <p>The bankrupt had been a trader in Liverpool. He had not been in business
  there more than ten months, but had contrived, during that short period,
  to contract debts to the extent of 84,000<i>l.</i> I don&rsquo;t know in
  what line he traded. I believe in many, or in all lines. He professed to
  be a believer in homely saws, and the philosophy they embody. He would not
  object at any time, he said, to turn an honest pound in any way. He therefore
  bought all that came within the range of his credit, from rags and hempen
  fragments to jewelry, and from tallow to diamonds. I don&rsquo;t know where
  he traded to especially. I believe that he sold more in the home-market than
  abroad, although he talked largely about consignments, bills of lading, &amp;c.
  If he had a skill for getting credit, he had a genius for disposing of goods.
  He was also an expert at what is called hypothecating,&mdash;a process which,
  for the unenlightened, I may explain to be as like pawning as any one thing
  can be like another. A peculiarity of his business was, that he always bought
  on acceptances, and for credit; he always sold for cash on delivery. Hence
  he frequently, if not always, traded at a loss. He was sometimes so unlucky
  as not to be able to get half as much in cash for things as they had cost
  him in bills.</p>
  <p>Such trading as this, the reader may think, would soon come to an end. It
  is quite clear that such trading must end in bankruptcy and ruin to some
  one, or to more than one. It is not, however, so sure that this mode of carrying
  on business would overtake ruin speedily. Our American bankrupt lasted ten
  months; and it is the opinion of many well informed persons that he might
  have gone on for three or four years if he had calculated well, and held
  his ground boldly. How was that to be done? Easily. There is a process which
  I have heard scientifically described as &ldquo;widening the ratio.&rdquo; That
  would have done it.</p>
  <p>Suppose that a man in trade loses 500<i>l.</i> upon the business of 1000<i>l.</i>,
  which is about the proportion in our Yankee&rsquo;s business or its results.
  Suppose that he wants to spend, and therefore does spend, the 500<i>l.</i> on
  himself. Is he bound to stop payment at the end of that partial experiment,
  and treat the problem as one therein solved? No. He may double his business
  and losses, and still keep right, in a familiar sense of that nice phrase.
  If he should trade to the extent of 2000<i>l.</i>, and lose 1000<i>l.</i> upon
  it, he will be able to pay off the first credits out of the net proceeds
  of his second series of operations; and all the people who get their money&mdash;noticing,
  also, the activity of his business&mdash;will sound his praises as &ldquo;a
  rising merchant,&rdquo; &ldquo;an upright man,&rdquo; &ldquo;a punctual tradesman.&rdquo; To
  live during the second series of operations out of them, they should, however,
  be extended to 3000<i>l.</i> or 4000<i>l.</i>, instead of 2000<i>l.</i>;
  and nothing is much easier than to do this. Keep on paying each bill as it
  falls due (no matter at what sacrifice,&mdash;by the forced sale of goods,
  or by discounts at any rate of interest), and there will be no difficulty
  about &ldquo;widening your ratio of trade,&rdquo; until you are entitled
  to a place in that category of worthies which Mr. David Morier Evans has
  culled and put together in his work entitled, <i>Facts, Frauds, and Fallacies</i>.
  Some day the bubble will burst, I know; but the ball may be kept rolling
  for a series of years on this plan.</p>
  <p>It is just possible that a hitch may stop the machinery. There are accidents
  against which no human foresight can guard; and if the bright pleasant road
  to ruin gets blocked up, you may in the side paths encounter a policeman,
  who will lead you to a judge, and a prison, or a hulk. That I take to be
  one of the inevitable contingencies which any swindler will look fairly in
  the face&mdash;avoid it, if he can; and if not, then meet it with calmness
  and resignation.</p>
  <p>The Yankee did not, however, as I am told, understand this practical method
  of commercial swindling, and he would have inevitably come to grief if he
  had been an Englishman. The reader may as well bear that little fact in mind.
  A great man once observed that, although many persons resolved to live by
  their wits, the vast majority of those who tried the experiment got half
  starved by a scarcity of the material for that sort of existence.</p>
  <p>The penal clauses of the New Bankruptcy Act are also to be kept in view
  as things to avoid, for I see by the Old-Bailey intelligence they are being
  enforced with terrible severity. If caught and discovered offending against
  any of the primary canons of mercantile jurisprudence, the weight of punishment
  is heavy. The reader must also not forget that, although he gives the criminal
  law and its officers no hold over him, he may encounter cantankerous or savage
  creditors, who, not satisfied with the loss they may have already incurred
  through him, will throw away more good money, not after bad cash, but in
  order to punish what they conceive a bad man. They may hunt him down to disgrace
  and beggary, hold him up to scorn and ignominy&mdash;in violation of the
  pure Christian theory which bids us &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;&mdash;never
  ceasing until he has no certain and regular mode of existence left except
  begging-letter writing, holding horses at the West End of the metropolis,
  hawking ballads, vending penny newspapers, retailing vegetables or fruit
  or stationery, or a life of idleness in a union workhouse.</p>
  <p>But I am moralising, preaching, or sermonising, instead of telling my story.</p>
  <p>Well. Mr. Abraham Driver had run his career in ten months. During this time
  it was believed that he had, however, to use a vulgar term, &ldquo;made a
  purse,&rdquo; or &ldquo;feathered his nest.&rdquo; He had realised considerable
  sums by hypothecating and selling goods, getting advances on bills of lading, &amp;c.
  Where the money had gone to, his creditors were anxious to know. They believed
  he could pay 20<i>s.</i> in the pound. As a matter of fact, he didn&rsquo;t
  pay 1<i>s.</i> in the pound.</p>
  <p>Abraham Driver, merchant, dealer, and chapman, as he was described in legal
  processes, was adjudicated a bankrupt. He didn&rsquo;t surrender. Perhaps,
  if his creditors had had an adequate idea of the dignity of American citizenship,
  or the sanctity of the stars and stripes, or the potency of the meanest recognised
  Yankee diplomat, they would never have offered such an affront as they did
  through Mr. Driver to his bumptious nation.</p>
  <p>The Yankee merchant and citizen, as I have said, didn&rsquo;t surrender
  to his adjudication in obedience to a printed and written summons, which
  he received. He treated that &ldquo;big broad slip of paper&rdquo; with gross
  verbal contempt. Yet he thought it inexpedient to stay in Liverpool. That
  fine town was too hot for him. He therefore shifted his quarters to London
  before the day limited for his appearance in the Liverpool District Court
  of Bankruptcy. When in London, he said he thought he might as well enjoy
  himself; and this notion carried him further from the late scene of his enterprise
  than the British metropolis. He turned his back disdainfully upon the land
  over which Queen Victoria&rsquo;s metaphorical sceptre sways. He went by
  rail and steamboat to the continent of Europe.</p>
  <p>Almost as soon as Mr. Driver left the shores of the Mersey, I was desired
  to bestow upon him my attentions. I supplied him with an unseen guard of
  dishonour. His movements were watched until he landed at the port of &mdash;.
  Here, as no instructions to arrest him on the Continent were given me, he
  was left.</p>
  <p>The principal creditors of the bankrupt determined to follow him. He was
  now an outlaw. The time for his surrender had expired. A warrant that would
  run into France could be obtained for his arrest and for his removal to this
  country. The requisite processes&mdash;or those which able lawyers thought
  sufficient&mdash;were obtained, and placed in my hands.</p>
  <p>I went over myself, and one of the Liverpool gentlemen was my agreeable
  companion.</p>
  <p>In obedience to the wishes of my employer and associate, I consented to
  go with him to the office of the British consul.</p>
  <p>The British consul was a high and mighty man in his own esteem, and he snuffed
  me out in the grandest style. I could not help admiring the art with which
  this servant of the British Crown reduced me, from the height of my legitimate
  self-respect, to the nothingness he thought my true status.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They manage things differently in France to what they do in England,
  sir, I can tell you. Now, leave the matter all to me, sir, till the fellow&rsquo;s
  captured, and you have him again in England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I and my friend retired to the passage of the consul&rsquo;s office (which
  was one small room) to confer on the subject. The consul also had a conference
  in his office with his man of all work, whose name I afterwards ascertained
  to be Boggy. At this conference I agreed to allow the consul to take his
  own course of action in France, and I was to merely assist when asked to
  render aid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my man Boggy shall go and see whether the fellow is at this
  moment in the port. Boggy will soon ascertain that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boggy&rsquo;s palm was crossed with a golden coin, which bore an effigy
  of England&rsquo;s Queen, to stimulate his zeal in the execution of her laws.</p>
  <p>The Frenchman was not long in discovering Mr. Abraham Driver&rsquo;s whereabouts.
  He came back to announce that the man we wanted was unsuspectingly smoking
  a meerschaum at the Anglo-American Hotel.</p>
  <p>Now to seize the villain. I was ready, and the defrauded creditor was intensely
  anxious for the fellow&rsquo;s capture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said the consul. &ldquo;We must go to the commissary
  of police. I must pay his fees. It will not take long to get through the
  ceremonies, but it will cost money to arrest the scoundrel. Nothing is done
  in this country, sir, without money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will be the amount of the fees, do you suppose?&rdquo; asked
  my client.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly. About 16<i>l.</i> or 17<i>l.</i> You had
  better let me have 20<i>l.</i>, and I can return you the balance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boggy here threw his mercurial eyes at the consul, and then at me, and then
  at my client. This had the desired effect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about the change. I don&rsquo;t object to give 20<i>l.</i> (handing
  over the money) for the villain&rsquo;s capture. You can let this good man
  have the balance,&rdquo; said the gentleman from Liverpool.</p>
  <p>Boggy, with glistening eye, and with triumphant mien, led the way. I followed
  with my companion.</p>
  <p>We passed into and out of several mysterious offices. Our warrant and other
  papers were scrutinised with tedious minuteness. Boggy seemed at home, and
  at ease with the minor officials, and to have a becoming veneration for the
  big-wigs.</p>
  <p>At length we quitted the head-quarters of the commissary, and our procession
  looked really formidable as we marched towards the Anglo-American Hotel.
  There were six gendarmes, a sergeant at their head, Boggy in their rear,
  and two Englishmen in the rear of the British consul&rsquo;s Frenchman.</p>
  <p>As we passed along the quay, we observed, not far from the Anglo-American
  Hotel, and with steam up, ready for her departure, a vessel bound for a distant
  Atlantic port.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is going away by dat ship, is he?&rdquo; chuckled the Frenchman. &ldquo;See,
  here he comes,&rdquo; the lively man continued to exclaim.</p>
  <p>He was quite right. There, at a few yards&rsquo; distance, was Mr. Abraham
  Driver, merchant, dealer, and chapman, late of Liverpool, an absconded bankrupt.</p>
  <p>He was walking coolly down to the quay, smoking his cigar, and about to
  take his departure in the vessel we had noticed.</p>
  <p>At a suggestion from Boggy, the sergeant arrested the English bankrupt.
  The creditor and the debtor exchanged a very few words, not of mutual compliment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve made a grand mistake, my good gentleman,&rdquo; said
  Mr. Driver, with a strong nasal accent (which had never been remarked in
  Liverpool), as if anxious to supply the evidence of his nationality, and
  save the trouble of being asked for it.</p>
  <p>Up to this moment neither the creditor nor I had any idea that he was not
  an Englishman and a subject of the Queen&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; asked the sergeant of gendarmes, in
  tolerably good English.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I guess you know that I am an American citizen; and mind now,
  I warn, you, sir, not to annoy me for the delight of those confounded Britishers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The officer looked at us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is an English bankrupt subject, to the jurisdiction of our laws,
  and a felon,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I calculate that&rsquo;s very tall talk, all that, and when you catch
  me back in that old country of yours you may be all right, I dare say; but
  I tell you, sir, that if you keep me here till after that ship&rsquo;s gone,
  you&rsquo;ll have a very pretty penny to pay, that you will, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must come with us to the <i>maire</i>,&rdquo; the sergeant said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess if you say I must, that I must; but here&mdash;look&mdash;here
  is my passport. It&rsquo;s all fair and square, you see. Now, mind what you
  do to an American citizen&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I tell you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hissing of the steam increased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I guess,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll take
  me first to the consulate of the United States, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, to the <i>maire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked round wistfully, and took out a ten-franc piece from his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is there will go to the consul of the United States, and tell
  him that an American citizen wants his protection. Ask him to come to the <i>maire</i> before
  that steam-ship there can go away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boggy grasped the piece of money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, I don&rsquo;t mind doing that. An Englishman in trouble would
  like to have his consul&rsquo;s advice. That&rsquo;s only right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Away Boggy ran to fetch the guardian of the stars and stripes, as cheerfully
  as he had devoted himself to Mr. Driver&rsquo;s discovery.</p>
  <p>Three minutes took us to the <i>maire</i>. The American consul was there
  as soon as we were. The British consul was not there. The <i>maire</i> heard
  what the bankrupt and his consul had to say, and then ruled that there was
  no ground to justify the further detention of the bankrupt, who was protected
  by the passport of his nation. He could certainly not be given up under the
  English warrant, and he should not detain him unless his accusers could enter
  into sufficient recognisances, available in France, to indemnify the accused.</p>
  <p>We had nobody present to enter into the required bonds; the extent of the
  risk was an unknown quantity, and the vagabond was set loose.</p>
  <p>As he parted from us, he put his finger to his nose, and whistled a bar
  of &ldquo;Hail Columbia.&rdquo; He picked out a fusee from his pocket, then
  lit his cigar, and, with a degree of speed compatible with an air of mock
  stateliness, the blackguard walked down to the quay, then on board the ship,
  as she let slip her hawser.</p>
  <p>We were neither of us very well pleased at the result of this excursion.
  It was impossible to resist the mortification of seeing the blackguard slip
  through our hands, as we thought we had him effectually in our grasp.</p>
  <p>We did not return to the consulate of her Britannic Majesty. We stayed only
  about another hour in France to refresh ourselves, as there was a vessel
  then about to start for England, and we were desirous of getting home.</p>
  <p>There is a moral to this story which politicians may relish; and I am therefore
  about to add material out of which a Member of Parliament might make a reputation.
  I have disguised the names and localities of the actors in this little international
  mercantile drama. It may, however, be worth while to add, that the facts
  are substantially and&mdash;with the specific exceptions I name&mdash;literally
  correct. If any Member of Parliament or noble lord wants the real name and
  address of the consul, I am at liberty to give it; if he wants the real names
  of any other actors in this little drama, I can and am at liberty to supply
  them.</p>
  <p>On our return homewards we discussed the conduct of the consul&mdash;our
  own consul&mdash;in this affair. We were led to doubt the propriety of his
  taking that money from us. We suspected that he wanted it, not to pay the
  French police any fees, but to put in his own pocket. We thought that, if
  our suspicions were accurate, the conduct of the consul was scandalous.</p>
  <p>I made inquiries. In a letter from the commissary of police I was informed
  that the French officers were not permitted to take fees, and that not one
  sou had been paid to a gendarme out of the 20<i>l.</i> taken from us. By
  direction of the French local authorities, proceedings against the British
  consul were taken in a local court. He disputed the jurisdiction of the French
  tribunals. He set up his consulship in bar of the suit. On this purely technical
  point&mdash;the merits of the case being taken from under the control of
  the court&mdash;an appeal went up to a court of appeal. The consul&rsquo;s
  plea in bar of jurisdiction was held to be a good one. The French judges
  held that the defrauded person being an Englishman, and the alleged offender
  being an English consul, the remedy was by an application to the Foreign
  Office in London. Memorials, setting forth all the merits or demerits of
  the case, and setting forth the miscarriage of justice in the French courts,
  accompanied by newspaper reports of the arguments and the decisions, were
  laid before a late Foreign Secretary. The answer to this memorial and evidence
  was, that, as the case had been taken before the French courts, and decided
  upon, his lordship saw no reason to interfere. Further explanations were
  offered, rearguing that the merits of the case against the consul had not
  been heard, that he took effectual means to prevent these merits from being
  touched by the French courts, and that the case was indeed remitted from
  French law to British diplomacy. Still, almost word for word, and to the
  same precise effect, was the answer. A third application, further endeavours
  to show the Foreign Office its duty, elicited only an answer, almost word
  for word, and to the same precise effect. So the matter was dropped, and
  it now lies where it was dropped a few years since.</p>

  Who Was The Greatest Criminal?</b></h2>
  <p>ABOUT six years ago a detective officer, in the employ of the regularly
  constituted authorities whose local habitation is Scotland Yard, Westminster,
  was directed to track a young delinquent who had, it was said, forged the
  autograph of his master, a tradesman in the borough of Southwark.</p>
  <p>The search was not a very difficult one. The culprit, who had only defrauded
  some one of 50<i>l.</i> by that operation, I dare say, thought he had got
  possession of an inexhaustible fortune; or I should rather say that he acted
  as if he thought so.</p>
  <p>It is said that thieves (I mean strictly professional thieves), who have
  either been born and bred to the craft of robbery, or who have served an
  irregular apprenticeship thereto, look with cool deliberation at the risks
  and contingencies of every enterprise, weigh its profit or loss, and are
  careful not to load the adverse scale of probabilities by rashness or indiscretion.
  This is, I believe, the case with regular thieves. It is not the case with
  those who are betrayed by impulse or necessity into the commission of a single
  crime. Fast men (clerks, shopmen, and the like), when they rob a till, steal
  a few pounds&rsquo; worth of goods, or even perpetrate a forgery, act in
  the most foolish way imaginable. In most cases they aid the task of their
  discovery, if they do not entirely lay open the secret of their crime.</p>
  <p>The case I am describing illustrates one half of my theory, and shows the
  truth of an old saw which affirms that ill-gotten money does no good to the
  possessor.</p>
  <p>The means of the fraud or forgery were procured by the criminal on the Monday
  afternoon. On the Tuesday morning he made use of them. He did not on that
  day put in an appearance at his situation, and his absence was immediately
  remarked. An inquiry was made, by his master&rsquo;s directions, at his lodgings,
  and it was ascertained that he had not slept there since the Monday night.
  His landlady was as uneasy about him as his master&mdash;perhaps more so.
  She was starting to make inquiries concerning him, when inquiries were made
  of her on the subject. The good woman, a widow, who was the mother of a family
  (all grown up to man and woman&rsquo;s estate, and off her hands), dreaded
  that some harm had come to her lodger. These forebodings of evil took no
  definite shape,&mdash;that is to say, a hundred different forms of peril,
  misadventure, and suffering crowded so rapidly on the kind-hearted woman&rsquo;s
  brain, that they became merged and confused; but her suspicions never traced
  the fact, nor any thing like the reality. The master of the young man, so
  far unlike the landlady, was not troubled by many thoughts about his clerk.
  All that gentleman said or thought about him may be put into a few short
  sentences. He said he was a blackguard, and that he should never have a character
  from him; that it was a rascally shame to leave him in the lurch, without
  the slightest notice; that he ought to be punished (as artisans are in the
  manufacturing districts) for neglecting his work, and breaking his contract
  for service. Yet, argued the master, &ldquo;there are plenty of fish in the
  sea as good as were ever caught. I dare say I can get another clerk, after
  all, any day, at 15<i>s.</i> per week, quite as good as that fellow. When
  Mr. Thinshanks comes back whining for me to employ him, he&rsquo;ll find
  that I won&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all. No, it isn&rsquo;t all either. I shall
  just tell him a bit of my mind as well. I&rsquo;ll kick him out of my counting-house,
  and tell him to go to &mdash;&rdquo; Well, never mind where, my readers;
  it wasn&rsquo;t Botany Bay, nor Woolwich, nor Portsmouth, nor Millbank, nor
  Pentonville, that the metaphor or expletive assigned as his destination.
  Perhaps your imagination, reader, will spare me all excuse for sullying my
  pages by mentioning the locality, which some original mind has said is not
  fit to name or write to ears or eyes polite.</p>
  <p>In Wednesday morning&rsquo;s <i>Times</i> there appeared an advertisement,
  which informed the readers of the leading journal that Mr. Crapp wanted,
  as clerk, a single young man, of good education, quick at accounts, who wrote
  a superior hand, of unquestionable sobriety, strict honesty, and enjoying
  one or two minor qualities. These must must be vouched by undeniable references.
  The salary offered by Mr. Crapp was 15<i>s.</i> per week. Three hundred applicants
  wrote to J. C. (Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s initials), at the post-office adjacent
  to his place of business, in the course of Wednesday. On Thursday morning
  the employer selected from the lot half a dozen letters, and saw as many
  young men that evening. On Friday an applicant who had passed through &ldquo;the
  ordeal by reference&rdquo; whole and unscathed in body and reputation, was
  given the stool on which Mr. Thinshanks had been long perched with honour.</p>
  <p>That day the new clerk received a numerous body of commands. He had been
  called upon to solemnly declare before Mr. Crapp that he wasn&rsquo;t afraid
  of work; and the truth of such averment was tested, as far as it could be,
  in a single day&mdash;on the Friday.</p>
  <p>Among the numerous directions Mr. Crapp gave his new clerk were instructions
  to write to Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid, politely asking the reason why they
  had not acknowledged the receipt of the cheque for 50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
  which had been sent them in due course on the previous Monday afternoon?</p>
  <p>This firm carried on business in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch. It did
  not take long for Mr. Thinshanks&rsquo;s successor to write that and a dozen
  other letters of equal brevity, and it, with the others, was posted by eleven
  o&rsquo;clock on Friday morning.</p>
  <p>Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid were astonished. They had not received any such
  cheque, although they had expected to receive one for such an amount from
  Mr. Crapp. They also knew that the cheque could not have been delivered at,
  and lost or mislaid in, their establishment. The extreme regularity of all
  their proceedings, the elaborate system of check and counter-check which
  their genius had many years ago devised and set in motion, enabled them to
  say at once that the error or accident or wrong, of whatever kind it might
  be, was not to be laid inside their doors. Further than this they did not
  care to inquire. The loss, if there was to be a loss, would not be theirs.
  As a matter of fairness and good-will as between tradesmen, Messrs. Clockwork
  and Co. thought it their duty to inform Mr. Crapp as speedily as they could
  that his cheque had never reached the firm in Shoreditch. A letter was immediately
  written and despatched to Mr. Crapp, apprising him of that untoward fact.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp saw at a glance, as any fool might have done, that between the
  non-receipt of his cheque by Messrs. Clockwork and Rigid and the disappearance
  of Mr. Thinshanks there was a link. The money which ought to have passed
  from his bankers to the bankers of his correspondents was that link. He had
  been robbed of 50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> by that villain
  Thinshanks! Such base, black, vile ingratitude, after the kind manner in
  which he had treated that vagabond! He deserved to be hung, quoth his late
  master, in token of the remnant of that same loving kindness of which he
  had just spoken.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp dismissed the messenger from Messrs. Clockwork with a formal expression
  of thanks, which, out of the frame of mind he then enjoyed, it was hard to
  extract.</p>
  <p>He determined&mdash;although, as he said, it was a painful duty&mdash;to
  prosecute the villain with the utmost rigour of the law. He put on his hat,
  and, to speak exactly, he may be described as having rushed to his attorney&rsquo;s
  office. That gentleman had left for the day. He was able to quit the dingy
  office for a cheerful home at an early hour just now. The incidents I have
  described took place during that portion of the year so obnoxious to plaintiffs
  and pleasant to defendants (always except debtors on bills of exchange, who
  come under the purview of a statute designated by some gloomy wag as the
  Sudden Death Act), the Long Vacation. The business on which the client wanted
  the advice and guidance of his attorney would not justify an invasion of
  the home of the latter; so he must necessarily wait until to-morrow.</p>
  <p>While pausing for the interview between Mr. Crapp and Mr. Croak (the solicitor),
  will the reader ask himself, Had the clerk robbed <i>his master</i> of the
  50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> in question?</p>
  <p>Perhaps the reader has a judicial mind. I hope he has. Some day he may have
  to sit on a jury, as no doubt he has already had to do. That frame of mind
  has enabled him, and will enable him, to discharge his important duties to
  society as a juryman in a sagacious manner. Well, then, the reader, having
  a judicial mind, can&rsquo;t exactly say. The evidence is insufficient. He
  will wait and hear what other facts I have to disclose, before he gives his
  decision on the issue I have raised. A wise reservation.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp went home again after his fruitless visit to the attorney&rsquo;s
  office.</p>
  <p>He looked critically and suspiciously at his new clerk, to see whether <i>he</i> looked
  like a thief or not; and he did many other things, which, as they do not
  touch the issue just raised, or that raised by the question at the head of
  this narrative, the reader need not ask me to relate.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp, it may, however, be as well to say, was impatient for the capture
  of the thief. He reasoned much and seriously with himself on the subject,
  and came to the conclusion that, if he delayed all action in the matter until
  the morning, he might be neglecting his duty to society at large. The culprit
  might escape in the course of that very night to America, or some other sanctuary
  for crime. Too much time had already been given him for defeating the pursuit
  of British justice. The police ought to be instructed at once. Yes, he would
  go to the nearest station-house and inform the police. He did so. The inspector
  on duty introduced him to Mr. Sergeant Downey, and that expert thief-catcher
  and mystery-prober took from Mr. Crapp a full, true, and particular account
  of the matter&mdash;as far as the prosecutor could relate it.</p>
  <p>Sergeant Downey had not much doubt about catching the offender. The young
  man had the good or ill fortune to possess a marked and individualised countenance
  and gait. The offence was, in all probability, his first crime. The officer
  did not think the thief had left the country; nor had he, as the next incidents
  will show.</p>
  <p>That night a row took place in one of the haunts of pleasure and vice at
  the West End of the metropolis. A robbery was committed upon a young man
  from the country in one of the night-houses of the Haymarket, during a squabble
  between some &ldquo;social evils&rdquo; and fast men who had there congregated.
  The police, on being called in, seized two men on suspicion of having perpetrated
  the offence. One of them next morning was liberated by the sitting magistrate.
  His pocket-book, his card-case, and his own explanations, warranted his declaration
  that he was &ldquo;a gentleman,&rdquo; and innocent of the robbery. Another,
  and a young man, was not so fortunate. Having, he said, the fear of the reporter
  and the newspapers before his eyes; being, he added, unwilling to disgrace
  his respectable friends; and being withal sure to lose his situation if it
  transpired that he had spent an evening in such disreputable society,&mdash;he
  refused to give his name and address. The victim of the affray could not
  identify the reticent person as the thief, and was ready to admit the reasonableness
  of his excuse for secrecy; but the magistrate thought the police ought to
  know something more than they did about him before he was set at large. &ldquo;It
  was,&rdquo; the learned gentleman said, &ldquo;very strange that a young
  man should have about him, in such a place, in bank-notes and gold, about
  three-and-twenty pounds.&rdquo; Notwithstanding his appeals and protestations,
  and in despite the air of injured innocence he put on, and although the police
  knew nothing to his disadvantage except his presence at the scene of the
  robbery and the possession of this money, he was remanded, in order that
  further inquiries might be made about him.</p>
  <p>Sergeant Downey paid a visit to the house of detention, and was allowed
  to see the reticent prisoner. The sergeant asked him if his name was not
  Thinshanks? The prisoner said, &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The officer
  shook his head in token of doubt about the truthfulness of that denial, and
  grinned sardonically. He went direct from the house of detention to the abode
  of Mr. Crapp. Both afterwards visited the temporary prison. The plausible
  sufferer was at once identified by the tradesman as his absconded clerk.
  Mr. Thinshanks, although sullen and as reticent as ever, was humiliated and
  crushed by the terrible eye of his late master.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s solicitor, when first consulted by his client, advised
  him not to think of prosecuting. Such a step was, he said, unsatisfactory.
  If the thief were caught, the affair would cost his prosecutor a tidy sum
  of money, in addition to his present loss, and a world of trouble to boot.
  The prosecution could not be left in the hands of the police. If so, the
  scoundrel would, in all probability, escape; and who could tell that he might
  not then turn upon the kind master he had robbed, and bring an action against
  him for false imprisonment? If, on the other hand, the prosecution were conducted
  by Mr. Croak with proper vigour and skill, so as to secure a conviction,
  as the scoundrel merited, Mr. Crapp would have to pay a bill of costs; he
  would have to kick his heels for several days about the Surrey Sessions-House
  (the atmosphere of which was physically deleterious); he would sustain discomfort,
  lose his temper, and impair his digestion, or perhaps his health, in addition
  to the loss of his money. Mr. Crapp inveighed against the rules and practice
  of British criminal jurisprudence, because it did not bear all the cost of
  prosecutions, liberally pay witnesses for their time and trouble, and hold
  out premiums to loyal men for their energetic pursuit of justice. But, at
  any necessary cost, and any unnecessary inconvenience or annoyance, he said
  he was prepared to do his duty by hunting this forger as near to the gallows
  as such a culprit might be driven.</p>
  <p>When Mr. Croak was informed that the criminal had been taken, and that upon
  him nearly half the proceeds of the cheque had been found, the legal gentleman&rsquo;s
  objections to a prosecution were not so pointed and decided as they had been.
  He merely observed to his client that the fellow must now be so prosecuted
  as to insure his conviction; and he thought, although he did not so say,
  that the money which Mr. Thinshanks had not dissipated would suffice, in
  addition to the scanty allowance of the Home Office, to pay the cost of his
  judicial condemnation. Mr. Crapp, who ostentatiously grieved over the wickedness
  of the foolish young man, withal begged that, in the interests of outraged
  justice, Mr. Croak would employ all his eminent skill; and at the same time
  wished it to be understood that when the trial came off he desired the counsel
  for the prosecution would inform the judge, the jury, the spectators, the
  reporters, the readers of newspapers, and the outer world, that he, Mr. Crapp,
  the prisoner&rsquo;s kind-hearted master, recommended him to mercy.</p>
  <p>James Thinshanks was in due course taken before one of the magistrates of
  Southwark on the accusation for which he had <i>not</i> been arrested, and
  the one for which he had been taken up was dropped.</p>
  <p>At the first examination of the prisoner Mr. Crapp was represented by a
  counsel in a stuff gown, and very learned in the criminal law of his country.
  The reader will not care to have a report of his speech when I tell him that
  it was not worth reporting. Of this scene and its incidents it is enough
  to say, that Mr. Snayke, the learned counsel (then attired in stuff, but
  who now wears silk), did not trouble himself to examine the charge-sheet,
  and took the accusation as it had been framed by the police, without inquiring
  about its accuracy. The evidence was yet, however, of the flimsiest character,
  and scandalously incomplete. The cheque was not in court; and so many other
  essential ingredients of the case were only conspicuous by their absence,
  that Mr. Snayke should merely ask the bench to remand the prisoner. An insignificant
  fact or two were then given in evidence, and the prisoner, who offered no
  objection, was remanded for seven days. He would have acquiesced in a remand
  for seven or ten times seventy months. Much as the stupid and mean thief
  disliked the house of detention, its diet, and its restraints, he had an
  intenser dread of what is called &ldquo;a trial,&rdquo; with its inevitable
  sequel, a conviction. He drew a species or a degree of comfort from the philosophy
  of Hamlet. He would very much rather bear the ills he had, than fly to others
  which appalled by their very uncertainty. He had not yet arrived at that
  other stage of criminal philosophy (which a genteel villain named William
  Roupell found, it is said, in Spain) that draws its only consolation out
  of knowing the worst.</p>
  <p>After the first examination of the prisoner, Mr. Snayke intimated to Mr.
  Croak he thought it very desirable to have a consultation as early as possible.
  Mr. Croak understood, or&mdash;not to pay him an undue compliment&mdash;he <i>saw</i> that
  there was <i>something</i> in the suggestion. He therefore indorsed the learned
  counsel&rsquo;s brief with that potent word &ldquo;consultation,&rdquo; and
  with the yet more potent figure of two guineas.</p>
  <p>A meeting between attorney and counsel took place that very afternoon at
  the chambers of Mr. Snayke. Mr. Croak attended it himself, and nobody else
  was there. It was a secret meeting; but I shall take the liberty of drawing
  aside the veil, and letting the reader into this consultation. I shall ask
  him to prick up his ears, so that he may lose nothing of the conversation,
  and to concentrate his attention, so that he may understand what he hears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Croak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray be seated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was the frigid tone of a greeting between the mouthy criminal advocate
  and the patron attorney who buttered his bread on both sides. I am told that
  this bumptiousness on the one hand, and humbleness on the other, is the almost
  invariable style of intercourse between the technically upper and the technically
  lower ranks of the legal profession. Much of the power of wig and gown is
  said to depend upon the maintenance of a relative status in the business
  of the law.</p>
  <p>After a moment or two of iciness, Mr. Snayke&rsquo;s consciousness of what
  was due to the attorney warmed him, so he grew polite and more condescending
  towards his inferior brother and paymaster.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Croak,&rdquo; said the great Snayke, &ldquo;that it is very
  important to frame this charge against the prisoner accurately, and I should
  like to know the real facts of the case&mdash;such as can be established
  in evidence exactly&mdash;which I do not yet. Did the prisoner steal a cheque
  with the amount and so forth filled in, and with his master&rsquo;s signature
  attached in his master&rsquo;s own handwriting, or did the fellow steal a
  blank cheque, and fill it in, and sign it with his master&rsquo;s name? The
  distinction is important to the prisoner himself, because the different facts
  establish different crimes; but the prosecutor is far more interested, as
  it seems to me, in this part of the affair than the accused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir, if I say I don&rsquo;t see <i>that</i>,&rdquo; the
  attorney ventured to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, obviously,&rdquo; replied Mr. Snayke. &ldquo;If the cheque had
  been perfectly drawn by the prosecutor&mdash;if it had his signature making
  the 50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> payable to Messrs. Clockwork
  and Rigid or bearer&mdash;if it was a complete and genuine cheque, then it
  is plain that the loss must be borne by Mr. Crapp. It was an act of embezzlement
  of a cheque or its proceeds by his own clerk. Suppose, on the other hand,
  that the prisoner stole a blank cheque, and wrote his master&rsquo;s name
  at the foot thereof, that would be a forgery; and the bank must bear the
  loss, because they have no right or authority to pay forged cheques.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A light entered the head of the attorney. He was lawyer enough to see a
  point when his microscopic vision had been sharpened, and when the point
  was held up to him. He told Mr. Snayke that he could not distinctly say&mdash;he
  had not positively ascertained from the prosecutor&mdash;whether or not the
  cheque was stolen in blank, or after it had been filled up and signed. He
  would see how the matter stood in this respect, and further instruct Mr.
  Snayke.</p>
  <p>The attorney afterwards had a conference with his client, in which he endeavoured
  to expound the law of the case to the prosecutor before he sought to learn
  how the facts stood. I don&rsquo;t know what the reader may think of this
  order of proceeding. It strikes me as having not been quite logical, or morally
  correct. It was very like giving Mr. Crapp a hint how he might shape the
  facts, and throw off a burden or loss from his own shoulders to those of
  the banker. Until indeed this result of the legal demonstration was made
  quite apparent to the prosecutor, he could not be induced to tax his memory
  about the facts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Mr. Croak, &ldquo;if you really did fill up
  and sign the cheque, and happened to suffer it to lie about unnoticed for
  an hour or two; or suppose, after filling it up and signing it, you handed
  it to Thinshanks to post to Clockwork&rsquo;s, and suppose he stole it or
  cashed it without authority, and appropriated to his own use the proceeds&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, suppose he did. That&rsquo;s what he did do, I dare say,&rdquo; replied
  Mr. Crapp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; rejoined the attorney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope not! What&rsquo;s the use of hoping not? the blackguard&rsquo;s
  bad enough for any thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt he is; but, you see, if he stole a cheque after you had
  signed it, we couldn&rsquo;t say that he forged your signature, could we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not; but what matters about that? Isn&rsquo;t it as
  wicked and abominable to steal a cheque signed, as it would be to steal one
  unsigned? If it isn&rsquo;t forgery, it&rsquo;s robbery, felony, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, my good Mr. Crapp; but I must speak plainer, I see. I want
  to find out who is to be at the loss of the money&mdash;the 50<i>l.</i> odd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose I must be&mdash;of course, mustn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let us see how the facts and the law stand. I
  hope I can show that not my client, but the bank, must bear the loss of the
  cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see your drift; but how is that to be made out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, suppose you left your drawer open&mdash;just suppose, you know,
  it had so happened&mdash;and that you left your cheque-book available to
  your clerk.&rdquo; (Here the attorney drew breath, and looked critically
  at his client.) &ldquo;Suppose that he tore out a blank cheque, and filled
  it up, and wrote your signature under the order to pay, that would be forgery,
  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you would <i>not</i> have to lose the money. The banker would
  lose it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; because if he pays a forged cheque, the consequences are his,
  not yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp was bewildered by the strength of his new enlightenment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see. Yes. I wonder how it was? Now, &rsquo;pon my word, Mr.
  Croak, I can&rsquo;t tell for the life of me at this moment how it was. I&rsquo;ll
  rub up my memory. I&rsquo;ll let you know to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The client and attorney parted company. The former, on his return home,
  at once sent his pass-book to the bank, and got his account made up. The
  cheques which had been cashed since the last balancing of his account were
  of course returned in the pass-book, and among them the cheque made payable
  to &ldquo;Clockwork or bearer,&rdquo; and not crossed.</p>
  <p>Whoever wrote the signature of &ldquo;Jno. Crapp,&rdquo; there could be
  no doubt that the date and the amount (in words and in figures) were written
  by Thinshanks. This, however, was not remarkable. The clerk usually wrote
  the body of cheques, for his master to sign.</p>
  <p>Mr. Crapp pondered long and anxiously over the document. He compared the
  signature &ldquo;Jno. Crapp&rdquo; with the same autograph on other cheques.
  Did he doubt who had written his name at the foot of that order to pay? No.
  He knew it was his own writing. He was only looking at it to see whether
  he could find a sufficient excuse to say it was not his writing. Strangely
  enough, the &ldquo;Jno. Crapp&rdquo; on this cheque was not exactly like
  that on the others. This signature was a little more extended, or sprawling,
  than his customary autograph. How was that? He recollected perfectly well.
  He wrote it in a frightful hurry. He had on the day he wrote it&mdash;in
  the afternoon&mdash;promised to take his dear wife, Mrs. Crapp, to the theatre.
  He was racing through his business that afternoon. It was also very odd that
  he neglected to cross the cheque. That neglect arose through the same cause.
  Dare he venture to say, on his oath, with all the consequences of perjury
  before his eyes, that he had not written &ldquo;Jno. Crapp&rdquo; on that
  slip of paper? Why not? Who should contradict him? Who could do so? Only
  Thinshanks. Was that possible? Yes, he might from the dock contradict him,
  but his evidence could not be taken; and the unlikeness of the signature
  was a further guarantee against harm to the prosecutor from such a denial.
  He (Mr. Crapp) was a respectable man. Could he swear to the lie without blushing?
  He was afraid not. Yes, he could&mdash;he would. He couldn&rsquo;t afford
  the loss of 50<i>l.</i> It was a heavy sum for him to lose. It was a fleabite
  to Undertails. They were rich beyond computation. He would venture to say
  it was not his signature, and risk discovery. Nobody could give legal evidence
  to the contrary&mdash;that was very certain.</p>
  <p>At the next examination Mr. Snayke opened the case as one of forgery. The
  learned counsel argued that the prisoner at the bar had doubtless seized
  an opportunity, when his master&rsquo;s back was turned, to tear out a blank
  cheque from the book, had filled up the stump; he had filled up the body
  of the cheque (which was not unusual), but he had also written his master&rsquo;s
  name underneath&mdash;a course never allowed by Mr. Crapp, never before done
  by this young man, and which he had no authority whatever for doing. Of course
  he had not crossed the cheque, which showed his intention to misapply the
  proceeds, so that he might get those proceeds to dissipate in that haunt
  of vice from which he had been taken. It was (Mr. Snayke proceeded to say)
  an artful contrivance, and had so well succeeded, that his master, guided
  by the stump-cheque, was really led, in the absence of reflection, to suppose
  that he had, in the usual way, signed the draft itself with his own hand;
  but on looking carefully at the signature he immediately saw that, although
  a clever imitation of his autograph, this &ldquo;Jno. Crapp&rdquo; had never
  been written by him. He (Mr. Snayke) could very well understand how even
  a bank-clerk might, without pausing to compare signatures, honour the forged
  draft; but the worthy magistrate, or any one, upon making the comparison
  between the several cheques he now offered for comparison with the one payable
  to Messrs. Clockwork, see that it was not in the same handwriting as the
  others. His highly respectable client would distinctly swear that the signature
  was forged, and there could be no doubt about it. The case was now complete,
  or would be when he had laid the evidence he had in court before his worship;
  and he should ask for the prisoner&rsquo;s committal to the next sessions,
  to stand his trial on the charge he had described.</p>
  <p>The evidence sustained the learned gentleman&rsquo;s address. The prisoner,
  who was not a little astonished at the extraordinary blunder of his master,
  as he thought it, saw no object in explaining how the case really stood.
  If he could get rid of the proof of the one alleged forgery&mdash;that of &ldquo;Jno.
  Crapp&rdquo;&mdash;he could not hope to grapple with the other charge. He
  saw that the robbery of the cheque and its proceeds could be proved. He did
  not know the object his master had in swearing that his own signature was
  not his handwriting, and if he had been informed, the same authority might
  have told him that his purpose would not have been very effectually served
  by trying to expose the fraud and villany of his master.</p>
  <p>What did happen in the progress of this very remarkable case, the reader
  will learn.</p>
  <p>The prisoner&rsquo;s committal was reported in the newspapers. His family,
  with whom he had not communicated, thus got to know of his situation. They
  communicated with him. They employed an attorney for him, whose name I shall
  call Shark.</p>
  <p>Mr. Shark, who is a notable man in the transpontine region of the metropolis,
  and looked upon as almost a deity, at least in power or skill, by the criminal
  heathen &ldquo;across the border,&rdquo; had private interviews with the
  culprit in his temporary gaol. Mr. Shark told his client to make a clean
  breast of it with him&mdash;that he must know the whole truth, if he was
  to do him any good, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>The unhappy client was as candid as the attorney could wish. He pleaded
  guilty at this investigation&mdash;not of forgery, but of the other offence.
  He insisted that the &ldquo;Jno. Crapp&rdquo; had been written by the hand
  of his master, in a hurry, as described, and that the neglect to cross the
  cheque had been the clerk&rsquo;s temptation. He saw that by intercepting
  the course of the cheque from Crapp&rsquo;s to Clockwork&rsquo;s, and that
  by presenting it at Messrs. Undertail&rsquo;s himself, he could easily get
  the sum of 50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> Under an evil impulse
  he determined to do so, and was foolish and guilty enough to obey that impulse.</p>
  <p>The wretched young man declared that he had never before been guilty of
  a dishonest act. This was, he solemnly protested, his first offence. His
  whole career had been blasted by yielding to the one temptation. He also
  poured into the indifferent ear of his legal adviser the story of his wretchedness
  from the moment when he clutched his ill-gotten money. He had, he said, endured
  an agony of remorse. In wild excitement he had afterwards, until his arrest,
  obtained his only relief from the pangs of conscience. Several times he had
  resolved to throw himself upon the mercy of his late employer; but the savage
  sternness of that gentleman&rsquo;s character made him tremble on the threshold
  of that good resolution.</p>
  <p>Mr. Shark saw at once, and almost admired, the ingenuity of the device adopted
  by the prosecution for throwing the loss of the money upon the bankers. He
  did not think it necessary to enlighten his client on this head, and allowed
  him to indulge the belief that Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s evidence contained an involuntary
  misstatement of fact. He did not, he said to himself, think it any part of
  his duty to interfere between the prosecutor and his bankers. The prisoner
  had scarcely any object to gain by the denial of the forgery; and he would
  assuredly get no one to believe him.</p>
  <p>This criminal practitioner saw just one use he could make of his client&rsquo;s
  frank instructions. The threat of an explanation on the one hand, and the
  promise of silence on the other, might get a strong recommendation to mercy
  from the prosecutor.</p>
  <p>Mr. Shark called upon Mr. Croak. What passed at the interview may be guessed
  at through the result. When at the trial Mr. Snayke repeated the speech of
  which I have given an outline, he added that the prosecutor, who had been
  convinced that this was the prisoner&rsquo;s first crime, and was anxious
  that he should have an opportunity of recovering his lost character, instructed
  his counsel to recommend him to the merciful consideration of the court.</p>
  <p>The facts were proved, and something more than the facts were sworn to.
  The jury found the prisoner guilty. The judge, after giving, as he said,
  full effect to the generous recommendation of the prosecutor, sentenced the
  culprit to four years&rsquo; penal servitude.</p>
  <p>The bankers allowed Mr. Crapp the amount of the stolen cheque, which had
  been declared a forgery by the deliberate judgment of a criminal court.</p>
  <p>About twelve months out of the four years of hard punishment allotted to
  the dishonest clerk had been served in patience and unrepining penitence.
  He had won the good opinion of warders, governor, and chaplain. He was granted
  such indulgences as were consistent with the discipline of his prison. He
  was not unlikely to get a ticket of leave as soon as one could be granted.</p>
  <p>One evening, amid the calm thoughts which solitude engendered, there came
  a notion that he ought not to have allowed that error of Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s
  about his own autograph to have gone uncorrected. It was, he had always understood,
  desirable to tell the truth&mdash;if for no special or other reason, for
  the abstract interests of truth. And, for his own sake, was it not desirable
  to let the real facts be known? Why should he suffer under the odium of a
  deeper criminality than he had been guilty of? He determined to speak to
  the chaplain on the subject. He did so. The chaplain thought he was right
  in desiring to make these explanations. The reverend gentleman, in his simplicity,
  said he would write to Mr. Crapp and so endeavour to lighten the burden of
  that gentleman&rsquo;s prejudice, and perhaps get his signature to a memorial
  on his late clerk&rsquo;s behalf. The chaplain, in an accidental bit of wisdom,
  mentioned the story of the convict to the governor. The governor saw at once,
  or suspected there had been, an object in Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s evidence, although
  he hardly knew what it was. His brother-in-law, who was a solicitor, was
  then on a visit at his house for a couple of days. The whole story was repeated
  by the chaplain and governor to the lawyer. He traced the successful fraud
  in his imagination at once. The circumstances were accordingly mentioned
  to the proper authorities, who directed that the facts should be communicated
  to Messrs. Undertail, the bankers.</p>
  <p>The head of the banking firm who had been so defrauded out of 50<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 1&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
  consulted their solicitors, and was informed that under the new law of evidence
  the testimony of Thinshanks could be used in a prosecution against Mr. Crapp,
  which they recommended as an act of simple justice, and for the interests
  of the banking community. Mr. Undertail&rsquo;s partner was a truly generous
  man. He shrunk from the destruction of a respectable tradesman, and the firm
  was by this partner led to hesitate. Mr. Undertail consulted the solicitors
  again on the subject, and they still thought the firm were bound to prosecute.</p>
  <p>There were some difficulties about the case. The evidence of the convict
  might be disbelieved. Mr. Snayke, or whoever might be Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s counsel
  for his defence, would assuredly argue that the convict had, in the solitude
  of his prison, invented this story, in order to gratify a revengeful feeling
  against the master who, although he had prosecuted him to conviction under
  a stress of duty, had recommended him to mercy. Yet there were some corroborating
  facts to be laid before the jury. Experts might testify that the signature
  was not a forgery. Mr. Crapp&rsquo;s hurry might be sworn to by the convict;
  his visit to the theatre, which caused it, might be proved. The motive of
  throwing the loss upon the bankers could be argued.</p>
  <p>Second thoughts in a counting-house at Lombard Street ran in the same direction
  as in the solicitors&rsquo; office. It was determined to prosecute Mr. Crapp,
  in the prospect of his conviction for the good of society.</p>
  <p>Within a few hours of the formation of this opinion Mr. Crapp fled from
  his house, and as a living man was never again heard of. The body of a man
  resembling him was ten days afterwards washed ashore at Barking Creek.</p>
  <p>I suspect that Mr. Undertail&rsquo;s partner was led by his excessive generosity
  to warn the wretch of his peril, that he fled in consequence, and that, dreading
  capture, shame, and punishment, he committed suicide by drowning.</p>
  <p>Does the reader wish me to answer the question at the head of this narrative?
  He is welcome to my opinion, and at liberty to differ from it if it does
  not please him. I think Mr. Crapp was worse than his clerk; I think that
  Mr. Croak was a greater criminal than either; but I consider that the vilest
  knave of the lot was Mr. Snayke.</p>

  A Grand Railway &ldquo;Plant&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>DOES the reader know that all the money taken at a railway station is sent
  up to head-quarters every night? Such is the arrangement. The money is put
  into a box, constructed as well as may be to render peculation or robbery
  on the way difficult, if not impossible, and off it is sent. An &ldquo;advice&rdquo; is
  of course also sent by the station-master or cashier from the particular
  station to the head-office. The money for paying salaries and wages is also
  sent in a like manner in a reverse course from head-quarters to the tributaries
  from which it originally came. The chief station, terminus, or office, is
  in fact the centre of an arterial monetary system. Every thing in the form
  of cash comes in there and goes from there.</p>
  <p>The mode of paying wages, or at least of conveying the wages from head-quarters,
  is this. In order to guard against robbery or fraud, a list of all the porters,
  engine-drivers, guards, and other servants who belong to or are allotted
  to each station for payment, is sent up to head-quarters. On a given day&mdash;say
  Friday or Saturday&mdash;this list is taken back to the station by a clerk
  from the cashier or secretary&rsquo;s office, who also takes with him the
  sum required to pay all these servants their wages. The clerk makes a journey
  from one end of the line to the other, depositing, as he goes along, a parcel
  of money packed up with the wages-list. These parcels are received from the
  hands of the clerk by some one who is always on the lookout at each place
  of deposit, with that eagerness or care men usually betray when they expect
  to obtain the reward of their industry. The arrival of the cash-bearer is
  always either known by fixed arrangement or by a special telegram which is
  sent down the line.</p>
  <p>The reader is, I dare say, also quite unaware of the fact that, until a
  year or two ago, there existed a gang of the vilest scoundrels, who derived
  enormous gains by the systematic plunder of railway companies. Their modes
  of operation were as various as the devices of wicked ingenuity could possibly
  make them, and their ramifications were astonishing to the most practised
  detectives. Their subterfuges, plans, and arrangements furnished me with
  many a long and lucrative job; and very many cases, it is fair to suppose,
  went undiscovered, or even unsuspected. They brought actions for injuries
  never received, by persons who were never present at collisions or smashes;
  they made demands for lost parcels which, as an Irishman might be excused
  for saying, had never been lost; they stole passengers&rsquo; luggage; they
  appropriated goods in course of transit; and they had other schemes of plunder.
  So widely ramified was their machinery, that in nearly every large station
  there would be a confederate ostensibly doing the company&rsquo;s work, receiving
  the company&rsquo;s pay, and ranked among the company&rsquo;s faithful servants.
  On every ninth or tenth train there was a guard who had a connexion, either
  as principal or agent, with the plunderers. At the head-quarters of many
  lines of railway throughout the kingdom&mdash;in the secretary&rsquo;s, chief
  cashier&rsquo;s, and manager&rsquo;s offices of several lines&mdash;they
  had their spies, informers, and associates.</p>
  <p>The usefulness of these spies at head-quarters was enormous. Take the case
  of a pretended accident by way of an example. An action was once brought
  against a company having its chief station in the metropolis. The plaintiff
  asked damages or compensation for the injuries sustained through a collision.
  The company did not see its way to resist the claim entirely, but as they
  considered the amount wanted by the plaintiff to be excessive, they thought
  it could be reduced by negotiation. Two thousand pounds was the sum originally
  asked. The plaintiff, however, in the course of the negotiation, reduced
  his expectations to 1000<i>l.</i> This was, his attorney said, the very lowest
  he would accept. The company&rsquo;s solicitors reported this one day, and
  were authorised to settle by payment of 800<i>l.</i> and costs. The company&rsquo;s
  solicitors thereupon offered 700<i>l.</i> as their very highest figure. If
  this was declined, they must, they said, fight to the end, and see what a
  jury would give. It was of course their intention to spring 100<i>l.</i> at
  the last moment, rather than let the negotiation break down. The plaintiff&rsquo;s
  attorney, however, in reply to the offer of 700<i>l.</i>, wrote back to say
  that he had seen his unfortunate client, who, in order to put an end to dispute
  and litigation, would take 800<i>l.</i>, but not 1<i>s.</i> less; and added,
  that it was useless to negotiate further if that concession were not met
  at once by an assent. It did not appear, nor was it at all remarkable, that
  the negotiation should be thus conducted up to the very point at which the
  company&rsquo;s solicitors were empowered to settle; but the real cause of
  the plaintiff&rsquo;s agreement to accept 800<i>l.</i> was the information
  he had received that that sum was the most he could hope to get without passing
  through the ordeal of a public investigation&mdash;a test the gang would
  always yield much to avoid.</p>
  <p>It happened, by a singularly fortuitous combination of circumstances, that
  I had under my vigilant eye at that time a man who was concerned in getting
  up a forgery. In the course of my watch I saw letters passing to and from
  the secretary&rsquo;s office of an important railway. It was no part of my
  business to report the circumstance. To have done so might have spoiled the
  game I was playing; so I took no notice, or rather made no sign. In less
  than a week after the delivery of the last letter, about six o&rsquo;clock
  in the evening, my plot was ripe, and I seized my man. Extraordinary inadvertence,
  and wonderful care! He had destroyed one link in the chain I was constructing
  with his own unconscious aid, but he had preserved one link in another chain
  of equal value and utility to his other foes. On his person I found a note,
  in cipher it is true, but written on paper which had an impression of one
  of the company&rsquo;s seals.</p>
  <p>The cipher was, moreover, not so very hard to decipher. A friend, to whose
  skill I paid a deserved compliment in my former volume, soon unravelled that
  mystery.</p>
  <p>Would the reader like to guess what the letter contained? It was a transcript
  in cipher of the minute of the board in relation to that case of damage and
  compensation! A confederate of the gang, or at least one of its spies, actually
  held a confidential situation in the secretary&rsquo;s office, so near to
  the heart of the company&rsquo;s innermost secrets that he could copy the
  minutes from the book in which their resolutions were recorded. It was under
  this guidance the plaintiff instructed the attorney, employed by the gang
  for that action, to take his stand upon 800<i>l.</i> precisely, and it was
  through this infamous betrayal of the company&rsquo;s confidence that the
  plunderers got the money.</p>
  <p>Of course I now handed the document over to the company. The money had,
  however, been paid. My prisoner was found guilty on another charge, so that
  it was not requisite to prosecute <i>him</i> for the railway fraud. The clerk
  was also not prosecuted. He escaped that fate under the shelter of his respectable
  connexions. He solemnly assured the directors that he had not participated
  in the plunder, that the forger was not one of his regular associates, that
  he had learned the cipher, but as an amusement, playfully, and that he merely
  told him the effect of the board&rsquo;s resolution in order that he might
  induce his friend, the plaintiff (who he supposed had been indeed hurt),
  not to persist in his excessive demand. The directors believed, or affected
  to believe, this story. Perhaps they did not like it to transpire that fraud
  and villany had nestled in their head-quarters, and so near to the very centre
  of their administration. However that may have been, I know that they reprimanded,
  censured, and dismissed the clerk, and that they abstained from his prosecution.</p>
  <p>When this young gentleman, who had copied the minute, was discharged, the
  company imagined no doubt that they had weeded out the fraudulent elements
  which tainted their confidence. How great their mistake was will now appear.
  The matter I am about to speak of occurred only about twelve months after
  the episode just narrated.</p>
  <p>It so happened that, at the date of this grand &ldquo;plant,&rdquo; a clerk
  attached to the chief cashier&rsquo;s office, whose duty it was to convey
  the wages down the main line, had arranged to take his annual month&rsquo;s
  holiday and to start on Friday&mdash;the day on which he had always delivered
  out the money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is to be done about the wages, sir, this week?&rdquo; the clerk
  inquired of the chief cashier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easily managed, Wilson,&rdquo; replied that gentleman; &ldquo;you
  must pay on Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. But shall I telegraph to the stations and tell them
  we pay this week on Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That may be as well, Wilson,&rdquo; added the chief cashier.</p>
  <p>Now, whether any message was handed to the telegraph-clerk by Wilson, or
  not, is a mystery yet unsolved. He says that he did so. The telegraph-clerk
  says he did not. Between these conflicting statements there hangs a painful
  suspicion to this day. It would seem only probable that the liar was a confederate
  of the gang, but that is not a certain inference. The written message may
  have been handed by Wilson to one of his fellow-clerks in the chief cashier&rsquo;s
  office, in a confusion or excitement resulting from his impending holiday;
  or it may have been inadvertently placed aside by the telegrapher, and one
  of his associates may have destroyed it in order to favour the criminal enterprise
  which its suppression (from whatever cause arising) did render possible.</p>
  <p>The board of directors could not, and perhaps could not be reasonably expected
  to judge between the conflicting declarations of the two clerks, so they
  dismissed both from their situations, and thought they had done all which
  impartial justice and their duty to the shareholders required.</p>
  <p>The only certain fact is a negative one. The telegraphic message was not
  sent. The wages were looked for, and looked for in vain, on the Friday.</p>
  <p>Wilson, laden with a good round sum of money, went down the line on Thursday,
  as he had arranged with his chief. He went, as ill luck would have it, according
  to his promise in the telegram, by an afternoon express, and, as if the elements
  favoured the fraud, a heavy autumnal mist, nearly amounting to a fog, lasted
  during the whole of his journey; although I don&rsquo;t know that events
  would have taken any other form or colour if the day had been distinguished
  by sunshine.</p>
  <p>As Wilson approached each station the train slackened speed, according to
  usage when he travelled by it on such an errand, and he put out his head
  from the carriage in which he enjoyed a separate compartment. As soon as
  it appeared he was greeted by a friend&mdash;or at least some one who knew
  his features very well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Wilson. You&rsquo;re early this week. Never too
  soon to take money. Hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy your holiday, Mr. Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These sentences embody the pleasant wishes of his quondam friends, and with
  slight variations confirm the letter, as well as the substance, of all the
  greetings he received.</p>
  <p>As each friend so greeted the clerk he took the money designed for a particular
  station, and in double quick time the train was again in motion.</p>
  <p>In some cases the train didn&rsquo;t stop at all. The money was dropped
  out much in the way that mail bags are dropped; an attendant being on this
  Thursday, as on previous Fridays, in readiness to meet the expected boon.</p>
  <p>At one station&mdash;it was a large station&mdash;a man, who was there patiently
  waiting to receive the cash from Mr. Wilson, was disappointed. An old acquaintance
  caught a glimpse of the cash-clerk as the train slackened speed.</p>
  <p>After a moment&rsquo;s shaking of hands Wilson offered the station-clerk
  the money.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Wilson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The screw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Thursday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m off to-morrow for my holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! very well. It&rsquo;s just as welcome to-day as to-morrow, I
  dare say; but why didn&rsquo;t you say you were coming to-day? &rsquo;Pon
  my word, I wasn&rsquo;t looking out for you; and what an awful lark it would
  have been if you had had to take the money back to London!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did telegraph on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The d&mdash;l you did! The gaffer never told me any thing about it.
  It&rsquo;s just like him; but never mind, I&rsquo;m mum about his carelessness.
  He&rsquo;s a good sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The train moved on again, and the expectant thief went empty away.</p>
  <p>From another station the money was lost. That is to say, it reached neither
  the hands for which it was intended by the company&rsquo;s cashier, nor those
  who laid a plan to divert it into other channels. It went in a direction
  that neither party contemplated.</p>
  <p>The train did not stop at this station, and a man was there to receive the
  money, but his movements had, he thought, been noticed. He was cautious&mdash;perhaps
  needlessly timid. He thought that as the train approached two faces were
  peering at him from the station-master&rsquo;s office. So he turned, went
  into the station, asked when the next down-train which stopped at that station
  would arrive, and sneaked away.</p>
  <p>Wilson arrived at this station in due course, and saw what he took to be
  a man in waiting for him. Unluckily the wheels did not properly bite the
  rails, owing to the damp and their slipperyness, so that he had not sufficient
  time for observation, although the condition of the atmosphere rendered careful
  notice doubly requisite. Into the hands, as he supposed, of the official
  in waiting, the incautious (and I think I must, after all fair allowances,
  say very negligent) clerk dropped his packet, which lay there unnoticed until
  morning.</p>
  <p>An old man and woman, passengers by the market train, then saw it, picked
  it up, took it home, said nothing, but inserted it in a hole up the cottage
  chimney for a long while; after which they informed the parson of the parish
  that an uncle of the husband&rsquo;s mother had sent this money to them.
  It was the amount of a legacy. The clergyman thought it remarkable that this
  money should be received abruptly, without his knowing a word about any previous
  correspondence with lawyers; but the parson was not a suspicious man, and
  he made no inquiries.</p>
  <p>The sum, although not large (only about 53<i>l.</i>), was very much more
  than the usual weekly apportionment to the station where it was dropped.
  The wages there were not more than 8<i>l.</i> per week. There was, however,
  a sum due from the company to a cattle-dealer, as compensation for the unpublished
  destruction of a part of his freight; and this was forwarded along with the
  wages to the station-master, with strict directions about the form of the
  receipt he was to take for it.</p>
  <p>The clergyman advised that the money should be laid out under the guidance
  of Messrs. Seal and Delivery, highly respectable solicitors in the neighbouring
  town of H&mdash;. He gave an introduction to those gentlemen by a letter,
  which explained the matter as it had been explained to him; and this introduction,
  and his explanation, saved all inquiries as to the source of the funds, which
  they profitably invested for the childless couple, who will never enjoy a
  penny of it.</p>
  <p>The two miscarriages I have mentioned were the only failures of the plan
  of the gang to capture one whole week&rsquo;s wages throughout the line of
  the Great &mdash; Railway Company.</p>
  <p>Next day (Friday) Mr. Wilson went on his holiday trip to Paris. The company&rsquo;s
  servants were expecting him, as usual&mdash;except at the one station to
  which a misadventure had taken the money intended for its use. It is needless
  to say that no Mr. Wilson and no money reached either of these places from
  London, as expected. Until rather late in the afternoon, when the chief cashier&rsquo;s
  office was closed, and that exalted functionary and all his clerks had gone
  home, nothing was said about the affair. It had not indeed until then become
  very remarkable; but as soon as the fact became the subject of particular
  notice, it rose to the magnitude of a grievance, and threatened to become
  a scandal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had no money, and ain&rsquo;t likely to get none till
  to-morrow,&rdquo; said a porter at one of the extremest stations to the
  guard of an up-train.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh; don&rsquo;t come that, you know. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
  lend you another shilling in a hurry,&rdquo; retorted the guard, who had
  two days before lent that small amount to the friendly porter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, we ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; rejoined the porter; and
  he appealed to his fellow-servants for a corroboration, which they supplied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be all right to-morrow,&rdquo; said the guard. &ldquo;I suppose
  the chief cashier has got a headache and hasn&rsquo;t been to the office,
  or Wilson has got the belly-ache, or some fine thing or other. Well, it&rsquo;s
  lucky for me my old woman isn&rsquo;t without a pound; so she can go to market,
  if we are as bad off at our station as you are here; and I suppose we&rsquo;re
  all in the same pickle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The porters were less philosophical. All their domestic and personal arrangements
  were planned on the theory of a week&rsquo;s wages on Friday, and no other
  day. The wives might have been allowed to postpone the purchase of the Sunday
  joint and the rest of the needful week&rsquo;s supply of provision, but every
  man had engagements which could not be so easily deferred. Every Friday night
  the porters assembled at a &ldquo;public&rdquo; to spend a convivial hour.
  Was this enjoyment to be sacrificed, or even postponed? It was more than
  human nature, cast in the railway-porter mould, could endure without protests
  as loud as they were deep. Were they to be laughed at, and jeered at, and
  told that the company was insolvent, that their masters couldn&rsquo;t pay
  their wages? It was too bad. Hadn&rsquo;t they feelings as well as a secretary,
  or a general manager, or a director, or the chairman of a board? That was
  what they would like to know. They meant to say it was shameful, scandalous,
  atrocious, and abominable, and worthy of harsher terms of description. This
  is not only what they meant to say, it is what they did say.</p>
  <p>During the night the news had circulated up and down the line, and over
  all its tributaries. In the morning it was known to the secretary and the
  chief cashier. The circumstances of the case were so peculiar, that these
  leading functionaries did not feel themselves competent to deal with it.
  The secretary hastened to confer with the chairman of the board, who again
  consulted two of his colleagues, who happened to be in Town, and, in consequence,
  certain steps were taken.</p>
  <p>In the first place a cheque was drawn upon the company&rsquo;s bankers for
  the amount they had been robbed of&mdash;exactly 2310<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
  and a clerk was despatched to all the stations for the satisfaction and comfort
  of all the indignant servants, who had now grown clamorous for their wages.</p>
  <p>Wilson&rsquo;s conduct was the topic of serious consideration. Could he
  have run away with the money? How could the robbery have been effected without
  his participation or connivance? What was his previous character? What sort
  of references did he bring to the company when he first entered its service,
  now five years ago? The latter questions were answered satisfactorily; the
  former were not. The chief cashier echoed a general opinion when he declared
  that he did not think Wilson capable of such a villanous and wholesale robbery.
  Yet the chairman of the board and the secretary did not see how the thing
  could have been perpetrated without his connivance, or, they thought, indeed
  without his active participation. They asked again and again, How could it
  have been done in despite of his vigilance? They searched the papers, and
  examined the &ldquo;Clerks&rsquo; Reference Book&rdquo; to see what sort
  of references he gave when engaged as one of their servants. Nothing could
  be more satisfactory than these. Their distinctness, emphasis, and verisimilitude
  were, it would seem, an adequate guarantee for his fidelity in any place.
  Yet again and again these very inquiries landed them upon the question, How
  could it have happened without at least his connivance? His mode of life,
  his habits, and his manners, conversation, tone of thought, and known tastes,
  were repugnant to the theory of his criminality. Yet again, here the chairman
  of the board ventured to say that he had heard of rascals who covered the
  most nefarious designs, and even found their opportunities for the commission
  of crime, in the well-sustained outward show of virtue. He was absolutely
  sure that that fellow Wilson was at the bottom, if not also at the top, of
  the crime.</p>
  <p>The solicitors to the company were instructed to take such steps as they
  might think fit in the case. They consulted me, and I gave it as my decided
  opinion that the facts were as consistent with the innocence of the clerk
  as with his guilt. This was a view of the matter which had not occurred to
  the solicitors. Lawyers have a kind of second instinct, which always makes
  them lean to the dark side of conduct and of events. Of criminal lawyers
  this is especially true. A regular Old-Bailey practitioner cannot understand
  a theory of innocence. It would be far more easy to convince any judge or
  jury of the guiltlessness of an accused man or woman, than it would that
  able and accomplished gentleman with the hooked nose and guttural voice,
  who is known as the &ldquo;thieves&rsquo; attorney-general,&rdquo; in the
  City of London. But what does he care about the guilt or innocence of his
  clients? Literally nothing. Under the genial influence of a fee, he will
  speak as eloquently (in his own and in some other person&rsquo;s opinion)
  and contend as loudly that his client is really guiltless, whether he be
  so or not. If any thing, as he has often had occasion to say, he likes to
  have a confession of crime from the accused, because then he knows that the
  client is not humbugging him; he relies upon a knowledge of the worst; he
  is sure that no facts are being concealed from him; and he can tell how far
  it is safe to carry his objurgations or his cross-examination of witnesses.
  The company&rsquo;s solicitors were, it is true, not men of this precise
  stamp. Still, they had in their professional career seen so very much of
  the corrupt and evil in mankind, and so very little of the higher traits
  of human nature, that they were always ready to accept unfavourable hypotheses
  in explanation of human conduct, and slow to receive opposite theories in
  their place. They were hard to convince that Wilson <i>might</i> be innocent
  of all participation in the robbery. At length, however, after carefully
  weighing all the reasons I advanced against the immediate arrest and accusation
  of the clerk, they admitted it was just possible that he did not aid the
  conspirators and thieves otherwise than by his gross and culpable negligence.</p>
  <p>I speedily ascertained how and where Wilson intended to spend his holiday.
  It was arranged that I should follow him. If, when I overtook him, he consented
  to return with me, I was not to legally arrest him. In case he should, however,
  refuse, or manifest any decided unwillingness to return, warrants for his
  seizure in Paris and his rendition were procured, and placed in the hands
  of an ordinary detective officer, who accompanied me, and had instructions
  to obey my directions.</p>
  <p>Thus armed, we proceeded to Paris. To discover the suspected clerk was not
  difficult. It was one of the easiest tasks I ever had allotted me. I found
  out the hotel he put up at. He was not in when we arrived there, somewhat
  early in the evening. I left my companion with the warrants at the hotel,
  while I went further, in quest of Mr. Wilson.</p>
  <p>I had a special motive for this part of my little arrangement. I did not
  think my man would return during my absence from the hotel. I thought it
  most likely&mdash;as I knew my way about Paris, was acquainted with the institutions
  of the gay capital, knew I could get aid from the French police in my search,
  and for other reasons&mdash;that I should bring Mr. Wilson back to the hotel,
  a prisoner in fact, although under no formal detention. In case I did not
  discover him out of doors, I resolved to return alone to the hotel in good
  time&mdash;in all likelihood to meet him there. I wanted to have the first
  word with him, and, if I could, to have that word in the absence of my fellow-traveller,
  clothed with so much authority.</p>
  <p>And why, the reader may ask, did you want to take this advantage of the
  law&rsquo;s proper servant or officer? I did not want any such advantage.
  I would have given him an advantage, which might have served his turn at
  Scotland Yard, if I could have done so with what I considered fairness towards
  the suspected. I did not wish the circumstances of his arrest to prejudice
  him with his masters, and it might have been before a criminal tribunal.
  My experience of human nature and of society had suggested to me that this
  young man might perhaps, when so far from the scene of his labours, beyond,
  as he supposed, the eyes and ears of his employers, and in a holiday mood,
  visit some places, not thought proper places by many right-minded folks,
  of whom I am, at least in this respect, one. As I felt that the weight of
  suspicion, before evidence of guilt, already bore with undue force upon the
  clerk, I thought it wrong to let the weight of another element (however fair
  in itself) be added to the burden of prejudice. If I had then been, as I
  have on other occasions often been, employed to watch leisure movements and
  scan the holiday pursuits of a clerk, so that his masters might by my report
  determine whether or not he were fit to hold a position of trust, I should
  have had no desire to screen the incidents of Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s visit to
  Paris. Here I saw or thought I saw it my duty to bring him back to London,
  in order that he might render such explanations as he could about a particular
  crime. To do this effectually, I argued that it was desirable, for his sake
  truly, but also for the interests of justice, that he should encounter no
  prejudice which the clerks&rsquo; reference book, his antecedents, and his
  general conduct did not warrant. This, I hope the reader will see, was but
  an act of simple justice to the suspected. Let me add, that I foresaw, if
  the clerk were really innocent, but if prejudice led to his wrongful arrest,
  the true culprits would have had an effective warning to destroy any clue
  while their pursuers were on the wrong track. Whatever the reader may think,
  I am candid enough to say, will not alter my conviction that I acted so far
  prudently and justly.</p>
  <p>I found Wilson, costumed a little <i>outre</i>, in a &ldquo;fast&rdquo; dancing-room
  of the French capital. A gendarme pointed him out as a new arrival. An inspection
  of my photograph satisfied me of his identity.</p>
  <p>I accosted him as &ldquo;Mr. Wilson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it perfectly well. I want to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you? What&rsquo;s your name? What have you got to say to
  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you step aside to the other end of the gallery, and leave this
  pretty little lady here, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You be&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>I stopped the remainder of the sentence by a look which terrified him.</p>
  <p>I whispered in his ear that I wanted him, and should, if he did not obey
  me, call upon the police, who were in force in and about this haunt of folly
  and vice, to arrest him, on a charge of robbing his employers, the &mdash; Railway
  Company, of 2310<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; but that if he followed
  me back to his hotel, and from thence to London, he would have an opportunity
  of rendering any explanation of the case which lay in his power.</p>
  <p>He extricated himself from his frail companion, and we proceeded together
  to the end of the gallery, where conversation, unheard by the disinterested,
  was possible; and I told him in greater detail the circumstances of the robbery.
  He naturally denied all knowledge of the affair; said he was entirely unable
  to account for it; and, although it was plain to see the terror inspired
  by a bare suspicion against him, he expressed an ardent wish to return with
  me to England, and lend all the assistance he could in the discovery of the
  culprits.</p>
  <p>I explained my reasons for not allowing my friend with the warrants to arrest
  Wilson. He was very grateful. I told him that if he followed me out I would
  allow him to make his way, under my eye, to one of the least objectionable
  of the caf&eacute;s on the Boulevards, where I should take him into my custody.
  The poor wretch was glad enough to avail himself of this privilege.</p>
  <p>I telegraphed my success that night. By an early train next morning we took
  our journey homewards, and arrived in London the same evening in due course.
  Mr. Wilson consented to become my guest for the evening, and until either
  the stress of duty compelled me to hand him over to the police, or I had
  the pleasure of announcing that he was no longer under restraint.</p>
  <p>The day after my return to London there was a solemn conference at the head-quarters
  of the &mdash; Railway. That august assembly, the board, had been hastily
  convened, and had a special meeting. The whole matter was investigated by
  the light of facts now within the knowledge of its officers and advisers.
  Other minor and auxiliary conferences were held in ante-rooms between myself
  and the leading partner of the firm who enjoyed the lucrative and honourable
  appointment of solicitors to the company. The results of the whole deliberations
  put together were, a resolution not to prosecute the suspected clerk, because
  there was not enough evidence at hand to warrant a conviction; and another
  resolution, that as there was more than enough evidence to justify a strong
  suspicion of his complicity in the affair&mdash;as there was abundant proof
  of gross negligence&mdash;the clerk Wilson should be dismissed.</p>
  <p>One victim not being sufficient to compensate for the loss of so much money,
  the two other clerks&mdash;one in the chief cashier&rsquo;s and one in the
  telegraph department&mdash;were also deprived of their situations.</p>
  <p>The most unsatisfactory part of the affair, to my mind, was the abandonment
  of all further search for the culprits. No why or wherefore was given me
  in explanation of this abrupt and extraordinary decision. I suspect the cause
  was an unwillingness to allow so palpable a sign of administrative weakness
  at headquarters, and from the very centre to the extreme circumference of
  the financial operations of the company, to be trumpeted throughout the world.
  I have known much heavier losses quietly submitted to for a like reason by
  joint-stock companies and by great mercantile firms. When one of the oldest,
  wealthiest, and most highly reputed discount-houses in the City of London
  discovered that its chief acting partner had advanced a young firm of traders
  a vast sum of money upon the security of forged dock-warrants, it determined
  not to prosecute the scoundrels, because the defrauded gentlemen, knowing
  their own importance, feared that if it should become known in Lombard Street
  that they, the great, old, wealthy, and &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; house, had
  been so let in, all the floating securities in the London markets would be
  discredited, a panic would seize all the money-changers, metropolitan bankers
  would be involved in trouble that might upset a lot of them, the governor
  and company of the Bank of England would have to guard its issues, limit
  to the minimum its credits, and, in fact, that through the one gigantic fraud
  a radius of half a mile round the Royal Exchange (where the potentates of
  gold, who are the arbiters and controllers of manufacture all over England
  and beyond this Queendom, do congregate) might become a scene of despair,
  ruin, or chaos. Am I overstating the case? Let the reader who thinks so peruse
  the evidence given by Mr. Chapman, of the well-known house of Overend, Gurney,
  and Company, at the London Bankruptcy Court, and in the Central Criminal
  Court, in the proceedings taken against Messrs. &mdash;. Or, if he cannot
  readily learn the particulars of this noted case, let him ask any friend
  who knows the history of British banking and British trade during the last
  twenty years, and that friend will supply him with at least as many instances
  in which splendid swindles, forgeries, and frauds have not been investigated&mdash;ay,
  or, being investigated and proved, have been secretly condoned, for such
  reasons as my imagination assigns to the directors of the &mdash; Railway
  Company for their decision in the present case. No man of the world, no one
  who has had much experience in practical business, will gainsay the probability
  of my suggested motive. I do not say that the reason hinted at was the operative
  reason in this instance, but I think it was, and I say that I think it was;
  and the intelligent reader can form his own opinion as to the soundness or
  hollowness of my hypothesis.</p>
  <p>It may be satisfactory to further explain (as I have very much pleasure
  in doing), that although not instructed to hunt down the perpetrators of
  this crime, I was requested to assist the officials of the company in framing
  such arrangements as would make it impossible to repeat a robbery like that
  so successfully accomplished. With the aid of the company&rsquo;s officers,
  I did this; and I have the satisfaction of knowing that if any further designs
  of the same description were afterwards conceived, they were never carried
  out. A survey of the obstacles to their realisation must have warned off
  the conspirators.</p>
  <p>The reader who desires to see poetical justice summarily inflicted on every
  wrong-doer as soon as the wrong has been committed, may have been grieved
  to learn that a gang of villains escaped their merits. I shared that feeling.
  I do not believe that Wilson was in the fraud, although I cannot undertake
  to say that the evidence of my faith is so perfect as I could wish. He, however,
  was utterly and hopelessly ruined, by the dismissal from his situation under
  circumstances of so grave suspicion; and if his worst offence was negligence
  (as I suppose), he has been terribly punished. The last time I saw him (not
  six months ago) he was selling penny packets of &ldquo;stationery for the
  million&rdquo; on a stall in one of the popular marts at the East End of
  London. The reader last mentioned may obtain some proper comfort in the evidence
  I can supply as to the ultimate vindication of justice upon the persons of
  the whole of the gang concerned in this great &ldquo;plant.&rdquo; I hunted
  down four of them not long since, and one volunteered a statement of the
  facts of that case (as each of the four did), in the hope of being admitted
  to the privileges of what the Irish call an approver. During this conversation
  (after he had completed his confession of the offence he was then charged
  with) he also told me that he had taken part in this affair along with all
  his present companions in crime,&mdash;who were the last of the set who had
  up to that date eluded justice.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  An Episode Of Criminal Justice</b></h2>
  <p>SOME time ago a robbery was perpetrated in the mansion of Lord H&mdash;,
  which is situated in one of the squares of Belgravia. The thieves made a
  tolerably successful and remunerative haul. They cleared out the whole of
  the plate, and also much of the jewelry, which chiefly belonged to Lady H&mdash;,
  and was of enormous value.</p>
  <p>How the thieves obtained access to the premises did not for a long while
  seem at all clear. Appearances on the surface warranted a belief that one
  or more of the servants of his lordship or her ladyship had aided and abetted
  the robbery. But there was no scintilla of what is called legal evidence
  to justify or warrant that suspicion. Nobody attached to the household was
  therefore arrested on the charge; but a reward was offered for the discovery
  of the offenders, and ordinary police vigilance was exhausted in the endeavour
  to track the delinquents.</p>
  <p>Weeks and months (about three months) rolled by, and nobody was brought
  to justice.</p>
  <p>His lordship was irritated beyond measure by this failure of justice. He
  one day went to his solicitors, declaring that he would spend half his fortune,
  if necessary, in order to secure the offender and his adequate punishment.</p>
  <p>What share in the production of this decision Lady H&mdash; may have had
  I do not know, but I have a notion that she had much to do with it; for it
  is certain beyond all doubt that the loss of her jewelry preyed upon her
  spirits, and exasperated her to the last pitch of intensity. Being rather
  shrewishly inclined, she would, I verily believe, have inflicted summary
  vengeance on the stoutest of the thieves if she could have clutched him.</p>
  <p>Lord H&mdash;&rsquo;s solicitors were somewhat annoyed at the failure of
  the police in the discovery of the criminals. They communicated with me upon
  the subject, and I at length was employed.</p>
  <p>It was a teasing and difficult job. It gave me ten times more trouble than
  many a greater and more important business. Yet, having undertaken it, I
  was determined to go through with it. I would not, I felt, be baffled.</p>
  <p>For a long while I could obtain no clue. At length I did get a scent of
  my prey, and from that moment the result was certain, although it could only
  be overtaken by a circuitous and uneven track.</p>
  <p>I at length hunted down the principal delinquent.</p>
  <p>The whole robbery had been effected by one man and one woman. The woman
  fled as soon as the man was arrested. I might have secured her before, but
  in doing so must have lost the man. Her arrest would have given him notice
  of his peril; and, in truth, I was almost careless about the female&rsquo;s
  escape if I could catch her companion.</p>
  <p>Lord H&mdash; was more exasperated than ever when he ascertained who the
  criminal was; although he assured his solicitors, as they informed me, that
  he had not the slightest knowledge of the man, nor did he suppose the delinquent
  had any knowledge of him beyond that which all thieves of London might have
  in common of a nobleman.</p>
  <p>I suspected that some mysterious cause inspired this desire for vengeance
  in his lordship, besides the natural influence of his loss upon his mind.
  That was sufficient to account for much revengefulness, but it did not appear
  to me an adequate motive for the sudden increase of such an emotion since
  the disclosure of the identity of the criminal. I do not, however, know that
  my suspicions were correct. It is possible that they were incorrect.</p>
  <p>The offender was brought before the magistrate, in the usual course, and
  remand upon remand was applied for and obtained. The prisoner&rsquo;s attorney
  resisted the application with all his argumentative power and force of advocacy,
  but in vain. The prosecution was thought by the bench to be entitled to every
  opportunity for discovering their property, and so involving the prisoner
  in the evidence of his guilt as to render his escape through the meshes of
  the law impossible.</p>
  <p>At length the case was brought home with sufficient clearness to the prisoner,
  not only to warrant his committal for trial, but to secure his conviction
  when that trial took place. He was accordingly committed.</p>
  <p>Next sessions a true bill was found against the prisoner by the grand jury
  of the Central Criminal Court, and in due course the prisoner was placed
  in the dock, to go through the great ordeal in connexion with this case.</p>
  <p>The court was somewhat crowded. The incidents of this robbery had attracted
  public attention. The value of the plate, the rareness of the gems, the neatness
  and completeness of the exploit, had all combined to invest the case with
  an air of public importance.</p>
  <p>In the court, awaiting the trial with greedy anxiousness, were Lord and
  Lady H&mdash;.</p>
  <p>In the gallery was a female, attired in costly raiment, enriched by here
  and there a jewel of considerable value. She was, perhaps, one of the handsomest
  women in London; and her beauty was of that order usually denominated &ldquo;sweet.&rdquo; There
  was an apparent gentleness and amiability of expression underlying the traces
  of deep and painful emotion which something then transpiring, or anticipated,
  had aroused.</p>
  <p>The eyes of this elegantly attired and beautiful female rested entirely
  upon Lord and Lady H&mdash;, who together occupied seats upon the bench on
  the right hand, a short distance from the judge, and who were prominent marks
  of observation for other persons beside this interesting female.</p>
  <p>The case then before the court was a tedious trial for perjury, in which
  there was a mass of conflicting evidence. The tasks of judge and jury were
  rendered peculiarly difficult by the tangled mass of fact and fiction which
  the skill of the prosecution and the dexterity of the defence had laid before
  the court. To the parties interested in the next case&mdash;that of the plate
  robbery&mdash;no doubt this protracted evidence was very irksome, as well
  as to the man in the dock, whose liberty trembled in the balance of this
  conflicting testimony, or the discrimination of his fellows the jurymen.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously with the latter portion of this trial for perjury, the counsel
  for the defence, Mr. Sergeant Ponderous and Mr. Anthony Stuffgown, were engaged
  in a consultation with Mr. Wheedle, the prisoner&rsquo;s attorney.</p>
  <p>A communication had been made to the latter &ldquo;gentleman according to
  Act of Parliament,&rdquo; the night before. It was a letter written by the
  fair spectator in the gallery of the court, who had also had an interview
  with Mr. Wheedle that morning.</p>
  <p>The position she then occupied in court had been selected for her by the
  prisoner&rsquo;s legal adviser. He had calculated with tolerable precision
  where his lordship would sit, and he wished her to be within the range of
  his vision, without being too prominent to the disinterested spectator.</p>
  <p>The prisoner&rsquo;s attorney had, in this consultation, explained to the
  counsel his stratagem, or intended <i>coup de th&eacute;atre</i>. The learned
  sergeant and his learned junior considered the idea a good one, and may be
  said to have approved it; although, as they explained, it was no part of
  their professional duty to offer an opinion upon it. When the consultation
  was ended, the counsel returned into court, one taking his seat and the other
  hanging listlessly on the railing of the counsels&rsquo; boxes.</p>
  <p>Mr. Wheedle was on the staircase of the court, watching its two modes of
  egress, and awaiting the effect of his little stratagem.</p>
  <p>An usher received a three-cornered note from the hands of somebody, addressed
  to Lord H&mdash;, with a small gold coin, and a request that he would put
  the half-sovereign in his own pocket, and hand the note to his lordship unseen
  by her ladyship.</p>
  <p>The note ran thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Gallery of the Old Bailey</i>,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>July 19th, 185-</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Lord,&mdash;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t prosecute my
  brother, and kill your faithful Clara!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His lordship cast his eyes to the gallery, and for the first time in that
  place he beheld the form and features of a lady not unknown to him, but one
  he had very frequently met elsewhere. Those eyes, and the recognition of
  the writer, were too much for the nobleman&rsquo;s delicate sensibilities.
  His face became as pale as chalk. He trembled almost as violently as a man
  attacked by St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance. He swooned immediately after he had
  thrust the missive unseen into one of his pockets.</p>
  <p>This event caused what the reporters for the daily journals described as &ldquo;a
  painful sensation&rdquo; in court. His lordship was removed in his carriage
  to his residence in &mdash; Square, Belgravia, without uttering more than
  one sentence.</p>
  <p>That sentence he so uttered was an instruction to his solicitor to get the
  trial postponed.</p>
  <p>The trial for perjury, after a short interval, was proceeded with, and ended
  in the prisoner&rsquo;s acquittal.</p>
  <p>Whereupon Mr. Keeneye, as one of the counsel for the prosecution, rose after
  a conference with his learned brother retained for the defence, and, addressing
  his lordship, begged that, owing to the sudden illness of the prosecutor,
  the trial of the prisoner might be postponed. The prisoner&rsquo;s counsel
  felt, they said, some difficulty in resisting the application after what
  they had seen, but added, that they thought the prisoner, who had done nothing
  to cause his lordship&rsquo;s illness, was entitled to be liberated on bail.
  The judge, after glancing at the depositions, said he did not see that the
  accused had any such claim, and declined to attach that condition to the
  adjournment of the case, as prayed for by the prosecution.</p>
  <p>Clara, who from the gallery beheld all that had gone on, and who devoured
  every word that had been uttered by the lawyers and the bench with greedy
  ears, maintained a wonderful show of self-possession, but was stirred by
  the intensest and most anxious thought. She left the court when this decision
  had been arrived at in her brother&rsquo;s case; he being, indeed, quite
  unconscious up to this moment as to what had taken place in his absence,
  and, when it was explained to him, being left ignorant for the time of its
  cause.</p>
  <p>Next session the prisoner was again brought up for trial. His lordship attended&mdash;but
  not her ladyship. She was induced to remain at home by the solicitude of
  her husband, who apprehended the effect upon her of the fetid atmosphere
  of the court. Although he had been up to the day first appointed for the
  trial resolutely bent upon securing to the prisoner the weightiest punishment
  he could get inflicted, he was now prepared to recommend the prisoner to
  mercy.</p>
  <p>The evidence, which in the briefs as originally delivered to counsel disclosed
  a complete chain of proof, was remodelled. They now contained a narrative
  which set forth the difficulties of the theory for the prosecution, and went
  far towards explaining away the points against the accused. The briefs for
  the defence, which as originally delivered set forth no possible answer to
  the charge, now contained a theory which reconciled the evidence as it stood,
  or was expected to stand, with a possibility of the innocence of the accused.</p>
  <p>A witness for the prosecution did not answer to his name when called; and
  the reader may be informed that this witness had gone beyond the jurisdiction
  of any English tribunal. The result was, that the prosecution broke down,
  and the culprit was liberated.</p>
  <p>The explanation of this miscarriage of justice is simple. Pretty Clara was
  the mistress of the noble lord. He had indeed seduced her some years before,
  and she had been living since then (unknown to his wife) under his lordship&rsquo;s
  protection. She was the sister of the prisoner. She was innocent of all participation
  in or knowledge of the robbery. For many years she had not seen that brother.
  They were orphans. They had both been thrown upon the world at a very early
  age to earn their own bread. She, when not more than fourteen years of age,
  had been placed in one of the West-End millinery houses, and had won a promotion
  to the counter of a shop in Oxford Street. He had occupied a situation in
  a City warehouse, but had never obtained a promotion by the exercise of any
  industry or fidelity on his part.</p>
  <p>Brother and sister had both diverged from the paths of virtue in different
  ways and at different times, and had been for a period of six years unknown
  to each other. Neither cared to let the other know his or her whereabouts,
  pursuits, and mode of life. What had become of her, the reader knows. Of
  him it is necessary to say, that he robbed his employers, who forgave what
  they correctly believed to be a first offence, but discharged him without
  a character. From step to step he travelled deeper and deeper into the mazes
  of criminality, until he got inextricably involved with associates in various
  cases of fraud, larceny, and burglary.</p>
  <p>The mode in which the robbery had been effected was very simple. The prisoner
  had won over the affections of a servant in Lord H&mdash;&rsquo;s household,
  and used the information he thus obtained to effect, with her connivance,
  if not her assistance, the crime for which he afterwards stood charged at
  the Old Bailey. This, however, was not his first appearance in that court.
  He had been there on a former occasion, and had, as on this day, been acquitted
  by a flaw in the evidence against him. The sister, through whose instrumentality
  he now escaped, became acquainted with his last crime and peril by a newspaper,
  which, in noticing the cases laid before the grand jury, mentioned, as a
  fact discovered by the prosecution, the real name of the accused, and one
  or two instances of his early career, sufficient to prove his identity with
  her lost brother.</p>
  <p>From the moment when Clara made this discovery, it had become impossible
  for her to get access to his lordship. Her first thought was to throw herself
  at his feet, and ask, as the only disinterested favour she had sought at
  his hands, and as the highest reward for her dishonour&mdash;a brother&rsquo;s
  liberty. Foiled in this, her woman&rsquo;s wit suggested a communication
  with the attorney for the defence. She had no difficulty in ascertaining
  who had that task allotted to him, and she met Mr. Wheedle, who arranged
  with her the stratagem which proved so successful.</p>
  <div align="center">
  <hr size="3" width="152" noshade color="black" align="center">
 </div>
  <p>This little episode was followed by one or two circumstances that the reader
  may be put in possession of. Lord H&mdash;, who was by no means a strong-minded
  man, accepted the incident as a warning of Providence. He would not for a
  trifle risk the enmity of her ladyship, to whom he was somewhat attached,
  and he dreaded the notoriety of his own criminal association with the prisoner&rsquo;s
  sister. He resolved to be virtuous, and carried out that resolution by a
  financial arrangement with his mistress, through the family lawyer. She,
  who had not been further tainted by sin than in her illicit connexion with
  the prosecutor, used the means now placed at her disposal in a way that enabled
  her to gain an honest and creditable livelihood henceforth. Her brother tried
  to do the same; but that wish was broken down by the constant interference
  with his good resolutions from old associates. He also tried various modes,
  like his sister, for obtaining an honest livelihood; but the impossibility
  of maintaining an incognito rendered this impracticable. Ever and anon he
  encountered former &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; who reviled his intentions, and
  frustrated them. It was a good joke, they told him, that notion of his of
  working for a livelihood. &ldquo;Did he,&rdquo; they asked ironically, &ldquo;really
  think of turning honest? What a funny idea!&rdquo; they exclaimed. They persecuted
  him in various modes. They would demand money from him, and if he hesitated
  they would threaten to &ldquo;split&rdquo; or &ldquo;peach&rdquo; upon him.
  He had to give them on such occasions all he had, and promise more than he
  had or could perform as the price of their forbearance. Dogged on every hand,
  and finding it impossible to earn an honest livelihood in this country, he
  fled from it, with the aid of money supplied him by his sister and brother-in-law
  (for by this time Clara had become the wife of a good-natured, easy-going
  fellow, who held an appointment in her Majesty&rsquo;s Customs); and I lost
  sight of him amid a crowd of steerage passengers on board an emigrant ship
  bound for Australia, where I hope he is now living as a creditable member
  of society.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  The Workhouse Doctor</b></h2>
  <p>OF all scoundrels in society, there are none so bad as disreputable or dishonest
  lawyers&mdash;unless it be unprincipled doctors. And I think that the palm
  of villany, if there be such a thing, might be claimed by a few of the latter
  class in any competition with the former. There is no limit to the mischief,
  and no fathoming the depths of crime which a surgeon may commit. Few men,
  perhaps, have also such ample opportunities for eluding detection. It is
  fair to say that I believe the crime of dishonesty, or malfeasance, is rare
  among that most honourable profession of medicine and surgery; but the exceptions,
  although few, are terrible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor, you have been very good to me,&rdquo; said an old woman, &ldquo;and
  I have done wrong to you, and hope you will forgive me, and be kind to me;
  for I am a poor lone old woman, with no friend in the world but you, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor smiled blandly at the compliment here paid him.</p>
  <p>This old woman was a pauper patient. The doctor attended her by order of
  the relieving-officer of the &mdash; Union; the locality of which, it is
  enough for the reader to know, was on the south side of the metropolis.</p>
  <p>The doctor had been many years a parish surgeon; and at this time he was
  also the medical attendant at the workhouse of the union. He was accounted
  a successful man. He was in large practice, but his gains were not commensurate
  with the extent of his business; and owing to a somewhat large family, with
  expensive habits of his own and his wife&rsquo;s, he had not made, after
  all, very much way in the world. I think I may describe him as a poor doctor,
  although he lived in a big house and kept up a liberal establishment. Yes;
  I may call him poor. There were unmistakable, although negative, signs of
  comparative poverty. He kept no carriage, and had to trudge on foot from
  the beginning to the end of his daily rounds. He rarely indulged in the luxury
  of a cab, which, I take it, showed either an extreme prudence, not consistent
  with some other habits I have mentioned, or very straitened circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Goody, I hope I have been kind to you, and I will be kind, as
  I know a doctor ought to be to all his patients, but especially to all the
  poor and old ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I ought to have mentioned, incidentally, that the doctor had obtained a
  reputation for his urbanity to all people, and his especial affection to
  the poor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;ah, I have something on my mind.
  I don&rsquo;t think I have acted properly by you. Will you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she spoke these latter words her wretched crone-like features betrayed
  a ghastliness which appalled the surgeon, and he could scarcely, for several
  moments, answer her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will forgive me, doctor, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive you, Goody! What have I to forgive you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it was very wrong to deceive you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how have you deceived me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it was very wicked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As the doctor uttered this last interrogation, in soothing accents, he drew
  a chair near to the old woman, and, in the extremeness of his urbanity, or
  with the desire of a confessor to lighten the load that weighed upon her
  conscience, as he so drew his chair by her side, he actually took her lean
  and withered hand in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, tell me all about it, Goody. In what way have you wronged me?
  In what deceived me? In what respect acted as a poor woman should not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, doctor,&rdquo; she stammered, in reply to this kind and confidential
  inquiry, &ldquo;indeed I have a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t expose me. I shall die if I am found out. Kill me,
  doctor, if you won&rsquo;t forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A fortune! and you for so long have been living on charity; obtaining
  relief and medical attendance from the union! Oh, that is wicked indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this moment there passed through the doctor&rsquo;s mind a thought more
  wicked than any of the thoughts or acts of the pauper patient. He was then
  walking the streets of London, attending his patients, earning his own bread
  and his family&rsquo;s bread by the sufferance of a Christian usurer, who
  had obtained judgments against him on bills of exchange, and who extracted,
  as the price of what he called forbearance, enormous interest and costs for
  a disreputable attorney, who (let me say in confidence) I have reason to
  know divided them with his client. The bitter poverty of the man was his
  strong temptation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could I manage to get this woman&rsquo;s property into my hands?&rdquo; he
  asked himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the answer of his conscience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be an enormous blessing to me if I could get a little money
  just now, and pay off that infernal Tompkins, who threatens and harasses
  my life during the twenty-four hours in every day; whose sheriff&rsquo;s
  officer ghost haunts my steps from the moment I leave my door in the morning
  till the moment I return at night; who disturbs my repose at home, and the
  fear of whom disturbs my sleep. If I could get the use of the money, I would
  repay it. To wrong this wretched pauper would be a crime I am incapable of;
  but to use the money of the old sinner for a while, and make it up again,
  would do nobody any harm. I will try if I can get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Such was the train of thought, interrogation, and reply, and of resolution,
  which passed through the mind of the doctor, with more rapidity than it has
  passed under the eye of the reader.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good woman, as you say, you have acted very wrongfully, not alone
  towards me; but you have, in that respect, done a great injustice towards
  me. By what means can I live and maintain my family than by the exercise
  of my profession? If you could have paid my fees, you should have done so.
  I would willingly have attended upon you as long as you lived, without charge,
  if your necessities had required it; but as you could pay, I think you ought
  to have paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor, it is but little I possess, and I have always been afraid
  of spending it or reducing it. It is only 500<i>l.</i> that I have; and if
  I lost it I should lose my all. How do I know that I shall not want it, every
  farthing? And I have a son, for whom I have kept it these ten years. Where
  he is now I don&rsquo;t know. He left England in a ship for the Indies. He
  ran away from his home during his father&rsquo;s lifetime, and I believe
  he helped to break my husband&rsquo;s heart. But he used to write me long,
  long, and such nice letters; and used to tell me that he would come home
  some day. It is a very long while since I heard from him, and maybe he is
  drowned. But I don&rsquo;t think he is. Sometimes I dream of him, and in
  my sleep I think I hear a voice telling me that I shall see him again. When
  he comes home I will give him all I have, and I am sure he will be kind to
  his old mother, and keep me happy and comfortable as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While the old crone thus garrulously related the secret of her miserly thrift,
  the doctor was pondering over a scheme which he had already matured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my good woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not my business
  to tell upon you. I will not bring you into disgrace. I will not reproach
  you. From me, at least, you shall suffer nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear, kind, good doctor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not pay me something on my account?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she spoke she rose from her seat and went to a cupboard, from which she
  took a little box and unlocked it. In this box were contained two savings-bank
  books. How extremely cunning this old lady had been! How well, for one in
  her position, and at her age, did she understand that difficult rule of prudently
  investing money! She laid these books before the doctor, again imploring
  him not to let any body know of her hoard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will give you 10<i>l.</i>, doctor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as soon
  as I can draw it out from the savings-bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; observed the surgeon meekly.</p>
  <p>The old woman was struck, perhaps flattered, by the comparative humbleness
  with which the doctor acknowledged the proffered money. That acknowledgment
  reduced him to something like the level of his patient. The confidence at
  this moment became that of friends; and, when the sea of conventionality
  had been bridge over, the two talked <i>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
  <p>The doctor pointed out to the old woman the perils she ran, by fire, robbery,
  or other accident, of having her books destroyed, and the evidence of her
  investment, or that investment itself, obliterated. She listened to this
  demonstration with greediness and anxiety. She saw the force, not to say
  truthfulness or disinterestedness, of the suggestion. He pointed out to her
  the comparative profitlessness of the mode of investment she had selected.
  He told her that money was worth twice, thrice, fourfold, or even tenfold,
  under careful, judicious management, the amount she was receiving for it.</p>
  <p>The greediness of the old woman was aroused. There is nothing so tempting
  to the over-thrifty and penurious or miserly person as the offer of large
  interest. This is a weakness they share with the common usurer, who is met
  with in the ordinary walks of society. I believe it would be possible to
  cheat an ordinary Jew bill-discounter, or the most subtle and acute of Christian
  usurers, by the temptation of large interest, and a little manipulation of
  their great ruling instinct of greediness.</p>
  <p>The pauper patient, before this interview had been concluded, entreated
  her good kind doctor to lend her the benefit of his extreme practical sagacity,
  great worldly experience, and unmistakable judgment, in the investment of
  the moneys which had been saved up by her. After a little hesitation, he
  agreed to comply with her request.</p>
  <p>Within a fortnight the money was withdrawn from the savings-banks in which
  it had been distributed, in order to evade those regulations which prevent
  more than a certain sum being at any one time invested in any one bank. And
  after being withdrawn from this channel, it was placed in the hands of the
  surgeon, for him to lend or employ as he might deem expedient, and upon those
  securities that would yield a larger return.</p>
  <p>The doctor used the money thus intrusted to him in payment of claims which
  pressed upon himself, and in reduction of his own embarrassments. He paid
  the old woman, or rather carried to her account, an interest of twenty per
  cent. per annum with the greatest regularity; and his conscience was satisfied
  by a belief that he was conferring upon her an essential benefit, by enabling
  her to obtain this liberal usufruct in preference to the scanty dole of interest
  she had been receiving. He satisfied scruples, or rather prevented her distrusting
  him, by from time to time showing her bills of exchange, documents, or papers,
  which he called bills of sale, and slips of paper which he denominated scrip,
  railway shares, &amp;c. &amp;c., all of which, he explained to her, were
  bringing interest at a rate more than four times that she had been previously
  obtaining.</p>
  <p>Goody thus learned to regard the doctor, who alone possessed her secret
  and stood in the relation of her confessor, as her best and sincerest friend.
  She occasionally rewarded him, as she thought, by purchasing little presents
  for his children, and by an occasional visit to the hosier&rsquo;s or glover&rsquo;s
  to make some slight purchase for his own benefit or comfort.</p>
  <p>After two years or thereabouts had rolled away, Goody, whose physical infirmities
  increased, whose mental knowledge became more and more warped, whose miserly
  vices had become more intense, also became dissatisfied with the irregular
  mode in which she obtained the charity upon which she continued to live,
  while in her imagination she saw her investment increase.</p>
  <p>One day the doctor called upon her, to explain that the interest upon a
  railway debenture fell due to-morrow, and 4<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> had been
  thus obtained, which he was prepared to either hand over to her or hold for
  her investment. She told him she would much rather that he kept all of it
  except a shilling, which she needed for some purpose, and which sum he gave
  her. He promised to lay out this further amount, as he had laid out all the
  rest, in a way to increase its store.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she then continued to say, &ldquo;I have been thinking
  that I feel very lonesome and very uncomfortable here by myself, and I should
  like to get into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! the union workhouse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid it cannot be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so sorry. I wish it could. Can&rsquo;t you manage that for
  me, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Goody, somebody might find out that you have money,
  and I might be ruined if it were to transpire that I had assisted you, or
  even suffered you to become an inmate of the workhouse, and to live out of
  the ratepayers&rsquo; money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman was crest-fallen. The idea which she had nursed for many months
  seemed dashed to pieces. Her hopes were destroyed.</p>
  <p>The doctor continued: &ldquo;I am afraid it would be hardly right, Goody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody could know that I had money, doctor, unless you told them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should not, of course, think of disclosing it, and perhaps, after
  all, it might not be so very great a crime for me to let you take your own
  course. Only, mind, I won&rsquo;t help you. My conscience will not let me
  do that. It would ruin me, if found out. No, Goody; if you can get into the
  house, I will not be the man to tell upon you; but you must get in by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor by this time had begun to tremble, lest every moment the old
  woman should demand the delivery up of her securities, and should discover
  that he had used the greater portion of her money. He knew that he could
  not recover or replace it. He was at his wits&rsquo; end oftentimes to determine
  what he should do in such an emergency. He therefore liked the idea of this
  old woman&rsquo;s going into the house, where he knew she could get, because
  the additional falsehood and imposture of her position would be an added
  security for her silence. While there, she would hardly dare to claim from
  him the money or the documents. He would have far less difficulty in maintaining
  the secret of his fraud upon her than he had hitherto done.</p>
  <p>It will be enough to further state that the old creature made application
  for admission into the union workhouse, and that the relieving-officer investigated
  her case; that a report was laid before the board of guardians; and that,
  without much difficulty, she obtained an order of admission. So the fraud
  upon the ratepayers was effected and prolonged; so the doctor&rsquo;s crime
  was further concealed.</p>
  <p>The old pauper was accustomed in the house, and out of the house when permitted
  to go beyond its walls, to laud the praises of her kind doctor, who, on his
  visits to the place, would inquire after her, who would find her very often
  ailing, and who very frequently ordered her luxuries that did not fall to
  the lot of other paupers not so cared for.</p>
  <p>Three years rolled away, and during this time the pauper grew richer and
  richer (as she thought) out of the usufruct of her savings. The doctor all
  the while continued with growing certainty to look upon the fund he had employed
  for his own advantage as money he would never be called upon to replace.
  He had only to keep up the deception a little longer, and the real owner
  of that fund would pass into her grave unnoticed and unknown.</p>
  <p>One day the old woman obtained her customary leave of absence, and wandered
  beyond the usual track of her accustomed visitations when so liberated. She
  called first upon the doctor, and obtained from him a small sum of money&mdash;a
  few shillings&mdash;and afterwards among the places she visited was the miserable
  home of an old acquaintance. Here she took dinner and tea, and after tea
  drew out the money, which she said had been given her by her dear kind friend
  the parish doctor, and insisted upon standing treat for her companion.</p>
  <p>About nine in the evening a conversation took place between the two women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goody,&rdquo; said her friend, &ldquo;you know I don&rsquo;t want
  to hurry you. You know I am very glad to have you here. I am very fond of
  you; but it is getting late; and if you don&rsquo;t make haste, you will
  get shut out,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The speaker was what is called a little the worse for liquor, and Goody
  was more than a little intoxicated.</p>
  <p>She spluttered out in reply something about not caring for the porter, or
  the relieving-officer, or the board of guardians, or the overseers, or the
  church-wardens, or any body. That if she was late, it did not matter, and
  that she would not stand any of their nonsense. That if she was late, why&mdash;she
  was late. If she could not get in the house, she must stay out; and if they
  did not care to keep her, why, she could keep herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What nonsense you talk! What would you do, at your time of life,
  to keep yourself? Why, if they were to turn you out, you must starve. You
  could not work, and you have not got any thing to live upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, haven&rsquo;t I, though!&rdquo; the old woman incoherently exclaimed. &ldquo;That
  is all you know about it. I don&rsquo;t care for them all. Dr. Jalaype has
  got my money. He takes care of it for me. Why, I tell you, I have got a fortune;
  that is, I mean he has got it keeping for me. I have got more than a thousand
  pounds. Is not that a fortune? Would not you like to have it, old girl? I
  dare say the chairman of the board would like to have it, but he won&rsquo;t.
  No, that he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t go back to the house. I will
  stop here. There, go and get a quartern more gin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With the shilling now produced another quartern of gin was fetched, and
  the old lady imbibed a further quantity, and got considerably worse, and
  was soon reduced to a state of beastly, hopeless, and helpless intoxication.</p>
  <p>After having drunk themselves into this condition, the two wretched creatures
  left the scene of their dissipation and endeavoured to toddle in the direction
  of the workhouse. They had not gone far, when two riotous boys, returning
  from their work to their homes, saw them reeling, and began to poke fun at
  them. The female pauper, smarting under a rude juvenile insult, endeavoured
  to rush forward and seize one of the delinquents, but instead of effecting
  the capture of the offender, fell flat on her face. Her companion endeavoured
  to pick her up, but rolled over; and while the sympathetic woman maundered,
  in her intoxication, words of consolation to the disfigured pauper, a policeman
  came up, and, observing their condition, took them both to the station-house.</p>
  <p>Next morning, on being brought before the magistrate, they told an artful
  tale, which that worthy functionary accepted as true, about having met an
  old friend, who treated them to a half-quartern of gin (they were sure it
  was no more), and it overcame them. They were discharged with an admonition,
  and toddled off to the house, at the gate of which they parted,&mdash;the
  one to find her home, like an independent woman; the other to sneak into
  her ward, and bear the gibes of her associates as best she might.</p>
  <p>It was some time before these women could meet again. When they did so,
  among other things, they talked about the fortune. Goody the pauper would
  have liked to have said nothing about the matter, but her companion was not
  to be put off in that way. She had a principle which led her to argue that
  what people said in their cups might be regarded as their most sincere belief,
  and that the words uttered in drunkenness had a truth not always attaching
  to the words of soberness. She persisted in her inquiries, and the result
  was that the pauper Goody took her friend into confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you see here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;nobody knows what may
  turn up. I have been a lone woman these many years. I have got a son, leastways
  I believe I have, and some day <i>he</i> may turn up, you see. I love that
  boy, and I have screwed and contrived for him; and in case any thing should
  happen to me, why I should like to have a little money by me; so I saved
  and put my money in a savings-bank. But, then, one day I told the doctor
  about my money, and he told me not to let it be there. I asked if so be he
  would be so kind as to look after it for me, which he said yes, he would
  do so. So I gave the money to him, and he lays it out, and gets me the best
  interest for my money, and I place that interest along with the money, which
  makes the money bigger, do you see, every year. I have done this for many
  years, and now I have no doubt I have got hard upon a thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lor! You don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;pon my honour, I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I wish I had got a hundred pounds, that&rsquo;s all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A hundred is not much,&rdquo; said Goody, whose ideas were prone
  to expand on financial theories.</p>
  <p>In this way the couple chatted, until Goody&rsquo;s friend became almost
  as wise as Goody herself upon the matter of the investment, and the doctor&rsquo;s
  fiduciary relationship became equally well known to two females as it had
  previously been known to one.</p>
  <p>Now, it is said that women cannot keep a secret. I believe this doctrine
  is not to be accepted or taken as a rule without exceptions. But it is certain
  that Goody&rsquo;s friend prattled and tattled long and pertinaciously, although
  in solemn confidence, to a variety of people. At last the fact or fiction
  of the pauper&rsquo;s fortune became known to Mr. Doe, a popular baker, and
  chairman of the board of guardians of the union which had the honour of maintaining
  out of its public funds the wealthy pauper.</p>
  <p>Mr. Doe was a man of independent mind. How he won his way, as he frequently
  had occasion to say, to the distinction of a member of the vestry and chairman
  of the board of guardians, was by his own talents (sometimes he said genius),
  and his untiring energy, and his uncompromising honesty. He was not the man
  to overlook any abuse; he was the last man in the world to permit a fraud
  to go unnoticed or unpunished. When he heard of the case of this female pauper
  with a fortune, he determined to sift it to the last. He told the story as
  he received it to his colleagues or subordinate members of the board of guardians;
  and a sub-committee was appointed to investigate the matter. The clerk to
  the board was directed to write to the doctor demanding from him an explanation.
  Upon that the board dropped the subject for a fortnight, in order that, as
  Mr. Doe said, every body might have ample opportunity for their proper defence
  against the grave charges he had to make against them.</p>
  <p>The doctor still held his situation of medical adviser and attendant to
  the workhouse.</p>
  <p>The female pauper was unfortunately ill, and at the time when this outcry
  arose she was an inmate of the infirmary or sick-ward. The doctor was then
  in attendance upon her.</p>
  <p>When the surgeon received the letter, he was of course naturally amazed.
  Long-continued success and concealment had led him to confidently believe
  it was unknown to any body but himself that he held the money. How the secret
  had leaked out he could not tell or guess. A conversation, which he found
  no difficulty in obtaining, with the patient did not help the solution of
  the mystery; for she, like an old sinner that she was, denied having mentioned
  the thing to a living soul. She affected to be as much in the dark as he
  was as to the mode in which the intelligence had reached the board. She did
  not affect to be, but really was, terribly alarmed by the discovery. The
  doctor heightened that alarm by telling her she would be prosecuted and punished;
  no doubt sent to the treadmill; or, it might be, transported for fraud upon
  the board of guardians. He told her that the only course for her to adopt
  was one of entire secrecy. She must deny every thing; she must declare she
  had never said that she had money; utterly deny that he had received any
  from her for any purpose; and if she did so, he would back her statement
  up by declaring that he had none of her money in his control. The poor deluded
  wretch saw that she was placing herself entirely in the hands of her doctor,
  and that he might turn round upon her; or at least she thought so. But still,
  as between the treadmill and transportation, she hesitated to run the risk
  of the doctor&rsquo;s possible fraud upon her.</p>
  <p>The meeting of the board took place. The doctor, in reply to the letter
  sent him, wrote a short pithy answer, declaring the statement touching him
  and the female pauper and patient to be a flimsy fabrication, which he thought
  it beneath him to answer in detail. He gave his unqualified denial, and should
  do no more. As for entering on a defence against such accusations, why, his
  character was before the world, and he left the guardians to judge the mere
  probability of such a statement as that which had been made by somebody to
  his discredit. If the guardians felt inclined for any further information,
  perhaps he might be disposed to give it; but his present opinion was, that
  he should not.</p>
  <p>The female pauper on being brought up before the guardians for examination,&mdash;or,
  to speak more correctly, a deputation of the board, or its committee, waited
  at her bedside,&mdash;she stoutly denied every thing. She declared most solemnly
  that she had no money, and asked the inquirer, if she had such money, would
  she be there, in that wretched infirmary, on their bed, in unsavoury pauperism,
  and taking the noxious workhouse physic? One member of the deputation was
  convinced that the chairman had led them on a wild-goose chase: that the
  woman had no such fortune as had been represented; that the whole affair
  was a bag of moonshine. Another had no opinion at all; he said, in frankness,
  that he did not know what to make of the matter; and a third had a notion
  directly contrary to the first, and thought the ratepayers had been swindled
  for a long while; that the chairman of the board was quite right, and that
  the matter ought to be further looked into.</p>
  <p>It unfortunately happened between the date of this inquiry of the baker
  and the deputation that the pauper died. Poor creature! she expired under
  the treatment of her friend and conspirator against the ratepayers,&mdash;the
  Workhouse Doctor. That death was a godsend to him, for it practically stopped
  all further investigation.</p>
  <p>The chairman of the board of guardians, Mr. Doe, at the meeting when the
  report of the committee was brought up, expressed himself dissatisfied; he
  said he thought he smelt a rat; he had his suspicions that the doctor had
  got the woman&rsquo;s money; he was sure, almost certain, that the ratepayers
  had been robbed. He would like to have the whole thing out, and at once.
  He did not like that evasive letter of their surgeon&rsquo;s; he should like
  that gentleman brought before them at once, and be asked to explain. If he
  came, and did explain, well and good; Mr. Doe would not object to apologise
  when he had been convinced that he had been in the wrong. Until he was so
  convinced, he should hold his own opinion, and vindicate it. The upshot of
  the whole investigation of this worthy, and energetic, and prosperous, and
  dignified tradesman was, that the surgeon was sent for by a special messenger,
  and that he attended their deliberations at the board meeting I have last
  referred to. He manifested a lofty spirit of mock dignity. He protested against
  the outrage to which he had been subjected by their suspicions and by their
  demand, and by having him arraigned before them like a criminal at a public
  tribunal. He did not know that he was doing at all right in noticing these
  charges; but concluded by laying his hand melodramatically upon his heart,
  offering many objurgations, and ultimately, in the most familiar way, offering
  to prove&mdash;as he did prove, to the satisfaction of the majority, and
  the dissatisfaction of the minority, of the board&mdash;that the tattle of
  the chairman&rsquo;s informant was a tissue of falsehood, or the wild imaginings
  of a lunatic.</p>
  <p>The sequel to the whole of these incidents and this investigation was a
  resolution, passed by a majority of the board, expressing confidence in their
  medical officer, embodying an opinion that he had been unjustly aspersed,
  and requesting him to continue to bestow upon the paupers of the union under
  the control of that board of guardians his eminent services and truly Christian-like
  mercies.</p>

  The Missing Will</b></h2>
  <p>MR. FRANKLIN was a solicitor in good practice at the West End of London,
  having offices at &mdash; Chambers, Regent Street, and a private residence
  near Fulham. He was a man of somewhat peculiar habits, although very shrewd,
  able in his profession, and generous towards his friends&mdash;who were not
  a few. His domestic life had been far from comfortable. He had been separated
  from his wife, through incompatibility of temper; and that lady, with one
  of her children, lived in a distant part of the metropolis, upon a liberal
  allowance from his purse.</p>
  <p>This description will cover the life and pursuits of Mr. Franklin during
  a series of about fifteen years. All this while, and probably much earlier
  than the beginning of this epoch, he saved a considerable portion of his
  earnings, and invested it with that success a prudent lawyer was able to
  command. He was not, it is true, what is called a speculative or &ldquo;enterprising&rdquo; man.
  He was rather a plodding or hard-working man. He had a notion that lawyers
  ought not to engage in risks, lest they should be tempted, in the frenzy
  of greed, or to cover some unusual loss, to use the money which clients might
  by necessity or choice leave in their hands. He never made &ldquo;lumps of
  money,&rdquo; but grew rich by slow degrees, as the accumulated instalments
  of his frugality were piled on each other, and as the usufruct thereof, year
  by year, swelled the total of his husbanded gains.</p>
  <p>At the head of his staff or firm was a managing clerk; and at the top of
  his rather small establishment in the country was a housekeeper. In both
  these persons Mr. Franklin had the utmost confidence. That comfortable feeling,
  I suppose, grew out of long experience; but it was not one I found it possible
  to share on my first introduction to these worthy persons. The clerk exhibited
  all the salient features of his calling. He was cunning, reticent, and conceited.
  I dare say he was faithful to his master. Fidelity is a peculiar merit of
  the attorney&rsquo;s clerk. I have known many in my time, but never knew
  one treacherous to his master; and never heard, on reliable authority, of
  one who betrayed a client&rsquo;s secret. I have often had occasion to know
  that bribes have been offered to the wretched copyist, whose earnings have
  probably not averaged a pound per week; and to office-lads, whose wages were
  but a few shillings&mdash;bribes equal to at least a quarter&rsquo;s honest
  income&mdash;but not a secret could be extracted in this mode. I have often
  mused on this phenomenon, but never could fully understand the exact relation
  between the cause and the effect. The reader is perhaps a better psychologist
  than I am, and can explain it. I leave the fact in his hands, or head&mdash;merely
  vouching for it as a fact. As I have said, there was this faithful clerk
  at the head of the staff in Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>The housekeeper who presided over the domestic economy of the lawyer&rsquo;s
  dwelling was a very ordinary sort of person. She was somewhere about forty-eight
  or fifty years of age. She was rather tall, and somewhat bulky in form. Her
  features were a little harsh, her voice was not one that could be described
  as musical, and her manners were not of that order denominated ladylike.
  She also was a faithful servant&mdash;or at least she very often told me
  so, and I have no evidence to the contrary. She declared to me, soon after
  my introduction to her, that she had never robbed the good man (that is,
  her then late master) of a penny. She had always laid out his money to the
  best advantage, never got a commission from the tradesmen who supplied butter,
  cheese, eggs, or other comestibles; and, in fact, never plundered him after
  the manner of her sisterhood. She was in fact&mdash;I take it for granted,
  and ask the reader to assume&mdash;a model housekeeper.</p>
  <p>This is a censorious and scandalmongering age. I cannot, I fear, rely upon
  it that my pages may not fall into the hands of some one or two persons always
  ready to suspect and say ill of their neighbours. Let me, therefore, at once
  clearly and emphatically state, that no relationship whatever subsisted between
  Mr. Franklin and this lady but the ostensible one of master and servant.
  On this head there ought to be no doubt.</p>
  <p>Mr. Franklin one day, after a short illness, died.</p>
  <p>The fact of his death was almost immediately communicated to his relatives
  and friends, who mingled a few natural and conventional tears over his dead
  body, which, in due course, was interred, without needless pomp or ceremony,
  in a churchyard not far off.</p>
  <p>After and before the funeral much surprise was expressed at the non-discovery
  of a will.</p>
  <p>Had he made a will, or had he died intestate? On that head there was much
  speculation, and many decided opinions formed. Some folks argued that it
  was very foolish for a lawyer, above all men in the world, to leave his intentions
  undisclosed, and bequeath a negative legacy of trouble, distrust, suspicion,
  heart-burning, and social war among his acquaintances and kindred. They didn&rsquo;t
  think he could do it. Others contended that there was nothing remarkable
  in a solicitor&rsquo;s not making a will. These persons may be divided into
  two classes. One lot cynically remarked that shoemakers&rsquo; children were
  usually worse shod than other brats; that the offspring of tailors were to
  be usually known by the seediness of their costume; that publicans never
  drank the liquors they vended; that parsons rarely illustrated, by their
  practice the virtues they taught in their pulpits; and that a lawyer should
  betray a crowning want of prudence was not, therefore, wonderful. This was
  the reasoning by which some were led up to the belief that Mr. Franklin had
  certainly not made a will. Another lot sneered at this circumlocutory and
  unsatisfactory process of argument. They said that the thing was plain enough.
  The deceased was a lawyer. He well knew, and was satisfied with, the arrangements
  made by the wisdom of the legislature for the distribution of the personal
  estate of intestates. Against all this speculation there was, however, the
  unswerving and oft-repeated declarations of the managing clerk, who said
  that his late master did, about two years before his death, make a will.
  The draft thereof was in the handwriting of Mr. Franklin. He had also engrossed
  or copied it for the executors with his own right hand. The attestation had,
  however, been made by that faithful clerk and by &ldquo;that rascal Edwards,&rdquo; a
  junior clerk, whose skill in the imitation of autographs had secured him
  gratuitous and comfortable board and lodging at Portland.</p>
  <p>If the deceased made a will, where could it be? That was a knotty and interesting
  question. In its solution nobody took a deeper interest than the housekeeper.
  If it could be found, it would. She was as sure as of the fact of her existence
  (and of this, as she had never heard the Berkleyian theory propounded, she
  had not the slightest shadow of a doubt), that it would secure her the reward
  of long and meritorious servitude. The relatives and friends, who desired
  to find a will, and thought she might aid in its discovery, promised to reward
  her if her faith were not justified by the document when it turned up. The
  clerk was also zealous in searching for it every where that his sagacity
  pointed out as its probable lurking-place. Neither will nor draft of a will
  could, however, be found. The office and the house were ransacked. The safe,
  all the tin cases, drawers, and bundles of papers, were critically examined
  without success. Suspicion, it is needless to say, was rife. It must have
  been destroyed, was the conclusion almost uniformly arrived at; and the delinquent
  was marked out by the imagination of several.</p>
  <p>The lawyer&rsquo;s only son, who had been a riotous youth, and a sore trouble
  to his father, was the suspected criminal. It was notorious that this young
  man had drawn heavily upon his parent from time to time. He did not like
  the honourable profession of the law, and, in order to accommodate his taste,
  Mr. Franklin had paid considerable premiums to men of repute in other professions;
  but the student, or apprentice, forfeited the money thus paid at different
  times for his benefit. He had twice robbed his father of large amounts. The
  lawyer&rsquo;s patience and affection had apparently been exhausted some
  time before his death. The son, deprived of all allowance by which to sustain
  an idle life, was ultimately compelled to gain his living in a comparatively
  humble position, and when the father died he was earning a pound a week in
  a merchant&rsquo;s counting-house. Mr. Franklin, junior, who lodged with
  his mother, heard of his loss as soon as that lady did. He at once threw
  up his engagement, under the vague belief that a fortune had been dropped
  into his lap. He practically took possession of the offices and the house
  of the deceased, and had abundant opportunities of getting rid of any document
  obnoxious to his interests. Uncharitable rumour, therefore, set down as fact
  that this young man, had ascertained that an indignant parent had cut him
  off with or without the proverbial shilling; that the missing will was the
  instrument by which his just punishment had been effected; that he had discovered
  the will, and in it his fate; and that, in order to get the benefit of the
  statutable distribution of the estate, he had destroyed both the document
  and the draft thereof.</p>
  <p>About a fortnight after Mr. Franklin&rsquo;s death I was instructed to probe
  the mystery of this lost will. It was chiefly desired that I should find
  the will itself; but that was thought a hopeless task. The next thing desired
  was, that I should get clear evidence of its former existence, its provisions,
  and bequests. It was also desired that I should get evidence enough to sustain
  a prosecution against the young man.</p>
  <p>My task, which appeared almost hopeless, and not likely to be profitable,
  turned out short, easy, and satisfactory.</p>
  <p>A brief investigation of overlooked circumstances informed me that Mr. Franklin
  had &ldquo;protected&rdquo; a young woman, who, in consequence thereof, bore
  him two children. This attachment he had managed to conceal from all his
  friends and acquaintances; and some of them were greatly scandalised at the
  discovery of such an offence against social morals. I called on this lady,
  and in my first interview went right through the mystery of the will&rsquo;s
  concealment. The poor creature was awfully embarrassed by my inquiries, and
  immediately I thought it wise to let her know the real object of my visit,
  she fancied herself a delinquent. &ldquo;Upon my word, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t take it. He gave it me. He told me to keep it until he died,
  that it would be my only protection after his death, and that I was only
  to give it up to Mr. Thistlethwayte.&rdquo; I saw the whole design of the
  late Mr. Franklin. I asked her to let me see it. She replied by an entreaty
  that I would not take it from her, for she asked, &ldquo;What will become
  of me and my dear children if I lose it?&rdquo; It was plain that the unsophisticated
  woman knew nothing of legal formalities, and hugged the paper as though its
  mere possession would obtain the money it set apart for her. I promised her
  that I would not deprive her of it; that I would certainly aid, rather than
  frustrate, the intentions of the father of her children. Of its contents
  she could know nothing beyond the general statement of the deceased&mdash;that
  all her future protection was bound up in its provisions. The will had been
  handed to her in a closed envelope. The wax was unbroken when she laid the
  packet before me.</p>
  <p>How to act did not require a moment&rsquo;s consideration on my part. It
  was not my duty, and it was repugnant to my feelings, to place this young
  woman at a disadvantage. In finding the will I had done more than was hoped
  for, and all that could be expected from me. I advised her at once to consult
  a respectable solicitor; and she went with me to the office of a gentleman
  in the neighbourhood&mdash;a total stranger to me, except by reputation.</p>
  <p>The erring son of the deceased was cleared from suspicion; the will was
  proved at Doctor&rsquo;s Commons, and the intentions of the testator were
  faithfully carried out.</p>
  <p>One of the persons largely interested in the residuary estate of the deceased,
  which formed its bulk, was much grieved because of the depositary chosen
  by Mr. Franklin for the safe custody of his will. &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; said
  this person, &ldquo;as if he had left the creature a large sum of money.
  I don&rsquo;t complain of the provision he has made for the unfortunate children,
  but he might have spared us the humiliation of asking her for the will. Why
  could he not have left that in the custody of some one of the respectable
  people to whom he has given the principal part of his fortune?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The explanation was, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, my dear madam, that
  although the creature had but a small interest in the estate, that interest
  depended entirely upon the preservation of the document. As the bulk of the
  property was distributed by the testator nearly the same as the law would
  of itself have distributed it, he had small occasion to make a will at all,
  except to provide for the creature and her offspring. He chose the safest
  of all places in which he could deposit it, as of course he did not wish
  it destroyed by any of those respectable people, who would not have been
  much concerned if the mother and her little ones had been left absolute paupers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to suggest that either of us would have destroyed the
  document?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not; but I apprehend that the deceased thought it quite
  as well to preserve you all from temptation.&rdquo;</p>

  The Duke&rsquo;s Mystery</b></h2>
  <p>LITTLE more than five years ago, a series of robberies on a grand scale
  was perpetrated at the West End of London. There was hardly a tradesman of
  note who did not suffer from these depredations, which for a long while baffled
  all the skill and vigilance of the police.</p>
  <p>After a lapse of perhaps six months from the formation of the belief that
  these robberies were the result of a concerted action by the rascaldom of
  the metropolis, the victims and their friends formed themselves into a committee,
  and I was retained to investigate the affair.</p>
  <p>As the matter had by this time assumed great importance, I employed five
  or six assistants, and systematically went to work. The police were also
  on the alert, and special instructions were given from Scotland Yard that
  they should co&ouml;perate with me, or practically, I may say, act under
  my instructions.</p>
  <p>It would be tedious to relate all the disguises and stratagems which I assumed
  and devised. It must suffice to say, that half a dozen men went through more
  variations in their appearance than the chameleon, and were nearly or quite
  ubiquitous during the investigation.</p>
  <p>I saw that a gang had to be crushed. I knew that success or failure was
  but an issue of time and money. Of the former I could give and get as much
  as the associated tradesmen would pay for. Of the latter there would, I believed,
  be no stint. The parties affected, and liable to be affected, by the operations
  of the gang, were prepared to lay out all the cash needful to secure the
  punishment of the criminals.</p>
  <p>The job was not a light one. We made a few mistakes, to the injury, however,
  of no one who had a character worth keeping. We got at times on wrong tracks.
  We were often on the heels of the thieves, and yet failed to grasp them.
  We were none of us faint-hearted, or lacking in patience. Each trip only
  made us walk the more carefully. Each blunder only made us wary. Each divergence
  only made us examine the supposed clues with greater nicety.</p>
  <p>One morning a police constable and one of my men came to me with news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have a clue, sir,&rdquo; said police constable U 99.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well. What is it?&rdquo; I observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At least we think we have,&rdquo; said my assistant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told him of it. I found it out,&rdquo; added the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t say that. I had most to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how much did you know about it before I told you of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how much did you know when you told me of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I saw that there was a pretty quarrel brewing between this pair of worthies,
  and I tried to stop it; but that was not so easy a task as the reader may
  at first be inclined to suppose. If I put a restraint on my assistant for
  the sake of peace, I might be incidentally puffing up the constable&rsquo;s
  vanity, and wantonly injuring the laudable pride of my own staff. If I attempted
  to curb the policeman, I might drive him off to Scotland Yard, where the
  clue would be followed up, and my own professional credit with the tradesmen
  injured. I must put up with a little of this altercation, and endeavour to
  soothe the irritation of both.</p>
  <p>The fact is, that somebody&mdash;an omnibus driver, I believe&mdash;had
  told the police officer that something he was accustomed to see was &ldquo;a
  jolly rum affair.&rdquo; The policeman, being on the beat along which my
  man had to travel, and knowing him, repeated his information, and echoed
  the &rsquo;busman&rsquo;s opinion in his own vernacular. My assistant joined
  in the opinion already expressed, and went beyond it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a rum affair, as you say,&rdquo; observed my man. &ldquo;I
  think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s a clue to what we very particularly
  want to find out. You come up to the governor with me to-morrow, when you&rsquo;re
  off duty, and I&rsquo;ll introduce you. If we turn it to account, mind, he&rsquo;ll
  not be unhandsome. He&rsquo;ll make it worth your while, that <i>I</i> warrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They then chatted over the business, and I dare say my assistant let the
  officer into the secret of our instructions far enough to aid his comprehension
  of the gravity of the effects to which this clue might lead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, then, was this clue?&rdquo; I dare say asks the always impatient
  reader.</p>
  <p>It was a small matter. It did not seem to point directly at the information
  I wanted, but many a real clue has not been more definite or reliable than
  that now to be followed to its end. It was a little nut, which required cracking.
  There might be in it the kernel I wanted, or there might not.</p>
  <p>With nothing like regularity of time or periodicity, but with great frequency,
  a shabby hack brougham might be seen about or after dusk proceeding along
  a road leading through a western reach of the metropolis into the most picturesque
  western suburb. My clue began with the vehicle at the north-eastern corner
  of the Green Park, and ended just on the eastern entrance to the village
  of &mdash;. It was a suspicious fact that this hack brougham was not driven
  by the same man throughout the entire distance. One driver was met about
  half way on the road, when he alighted from the box, and handed the whip
  to the person (always the same) who met him.</p>
  <p>The brougham was one of those registered at Somerset House as a cab. It
  was a private vehicle, which appeared like the property of some indigent
  postmaster or jobber.</p>
  <p>Where could this vehicle go to and come from?</p>
  <p>Among the difficulties in our case was that of tracing the goods. It was,
  I confess, not a little remarkable that no part of the goods could be traced.
  We had searched all the most notorious &ldquo;fences.&rdquo; I do not think
  there was one known place in which goods of the kind in question would be
  brought that we had not examined. Could this brougham be the means of conveying
  the plunder in small quantities to and from its place of concealment to the
  place or places of conversion into money? Those were questions we determined
  to solve.</p>
  <p>A diligent watch was set at stages from the Green Park to &mdash;.</p>
  <p>Next evening the carriage did not present itself, nor the next; but on the
  third evening it was seen to emerge from a lane in Piccadilly, near to a
  street in which there is an inferior livery-stable. It was now followed and
  kept in sight during its entire journey. I saw the driver changed.</p>
  <p>I critically scanned the hirsute visage of the rider.</p>
  <p>Just outside the village of &mdash;, on the high road, there stood, and
  yet stands, a cottage residence, in not the finest state, with coachhouse
  and stabling for more carriages and horses than the occupant seemed to make
  use of. The house was, I may also explain, shut out from the view of travellers
  by a close wooden paling, a high gate, and a tall, dense, leafy hedge.</p>
  <p>At this cottage the brougham stopped. The rider alighted, and the servant
  placed the horse and vehicle in the outbuildings allotted to them, which
  were entered by the rear.</p>
  <p>All this looked to me very suspicious. I determined, however, to pursue
  my inquiries. There was not yet enough evidence, in my own opinion, to justify
  an application for a search-warrant, and less justification for any one&rsquo;s
  arrest on a criminal charge.</p>
  <p>Inquiries in the village and neighbourhood elicited not much; but the few
  scraps of fact that we did get tended to fortify a suspicion that here was
  a dep&ocirc;t of the plunder.</p>
  <p>The tradespeople were pumped, but those wells of gossip or scandal were
  nearly dry. The truth was, this cottage neither excited remark by ostentation,
  nor the reverse. What it required, it ordered and paid for. The trade done
  with its inmates by the shopkeepers who were honoured with their patronage
  was not large enough to arouse the envy of their rivals. It may astonish
  some people, who are tormented by scandal, to know that rumour may be either
  avoided or &ldquo;manipulated,&rdquo; if you know how to go about the task.</p>
  <p>While I was engaged in these inquiries, with two of my assistants, the man
  who had the words with the policeman, as described, had another, and what
  he called &ldquo;a jolly row,&rdquo; with that officer. The matter was, I
  believe, through this, mentioned at the headquarters of the metropolitan
  police, and the authorities took it up.</p>
  <p>An active sergeant of the detective police called upon me, and asked for
  information, which I thought myself scarcely at liberty to refuse to give,
  so gave it. He forthwith set to work, and got warrants to search the premises
  and arrest the inmates.</p>
  <p>The time he selected for pouncing on the suspects was twelve at night.</p>
  <p>That evening the shabby brougham turned out of the livery-stables, wended
  its way through slush and traffic along Piccadilly, and at about the usual
  spot the driver was changed. Away the brougham went again, at a slightly
  accelerated pace, as though the horse&rsquo;s head was lightened. The party
  alighted at the cottage, and the stable was occupied as before.</p>
  <p>About half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock a body of police effected an entrance
  into the cottage by the rear. The whole of the small household was aroused.
  Great was the consternation of Miss Goodwin, and her brother was nearly killed
  by alarm. Of the rest not much different can be said. Groom and coachman
  (one person), housekeeper and general servant (also one person), who completed
  the human establishment, were awfully frightened.</p>
  <p>The highly intelligent sergeant insisted upon ransacking the house, searching
  the stables, and exploring the garden. In the mean time the lady, gentleman,
  and servants were told to consider themselves in custody.</p>
  <p>In vain the gentleman protested against this outrage, and sometimes gently
  threatened to bring down all the vengeance of the law upon his sister&rsquo;s
  tormentors. The sergeant treated the threat with disdain, and ridiculed the
  claim of his prisoner to kinship with Miss Goodwin. All entreaties, menaces,
  expostulations, and threats were answered by references to his duty, or intimations
  that he knew what he was about.</p>
  <p>The search and exploration revealed nothing. The officer was sorely disappointed,
  but not yet discomfited. He saw that, at all events, he was safe if he went
  on, and that if he turned back he might expose himself to the charge of negligence.
  There was enough that was wrong, more than sufficient that was mysterious,
  to cover any excess of vigilance, or any stretch of duty. So on he resolved
  to go.</p>
  <p>When Mr. Goodwin was told that he must accompany the officer as his prisoner,
  and that the lady must also share that inconvenience, they again put forth
  every form of remonstrance. All were useless. The officer was inexorable
  and unbelieving. He rudely expressed his disbelief of the assertion that
  the fair tenant of the cottage was a pure and innocent young lady, of small
  independent estate, and that the visitor was her brother and guardian. Those
  explanations, he said, might do for the magistrate to-morrow, but they would
  not do for the police.</p>
  <p>There was no getting out of the awful mess. Mr. and Miss Goodwin were removed
  by the sergeant, under his warrants, to the chief metropolitan police station,
  and there confined in vulgar cells.</p>
  <p>At times during the wretched journey to London the prisoners were defiant,
  and at others they sank into despair.</p>
  <p>Once, on the way to the metropolis, the lady remarked to her companion,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear George; we&rsquo;re not thieves; they have searched
  my house in every part, but they have found nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; observed the officer, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say any thing
  that&rsquo;ll injure yourselves while I&rsquo;m with you. I don&rsquo;t want
  you to criminate yourselves. Only mind, I shall give all that I hear as evidence;
  and I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I don&rsquo;t like the look of things. &lsquo;Found
  nothing!&rsquo; well, if that sort of talk ain&rsquo;t thieves&rsquo; patter,
  I don&rsquo;t know what is. I ain&rsquo;t found nothing yet; but if I get
  a remand, won&rsquo;t I find nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Goodwin shuddered. Miss Goodwin was eloquent in the form of denunciation.</p>
  <p>The gentleman, by the time of the arrival of the party at the station-house,
  had recovered his self-possession. He demanded the means of communicating
  with a solicitor. This was afforded him. He chose the name of a well-known
  criminal practitioner, one of the cleverest and one of the most respectable
  of his class.</p>
  <p>The professional man recognised his client. He had before been employed
  as the agent of that client&rsquo;s family solicitor in a prosecution.</p>
  <p>Within ten minutes after the arrival of the lawyer at the station, the door
  of Mr. Goodwin&rsquo;s cell was opened, and that gentlemen with his attorney
  were shown into the head private apartment of the officer who lives on the
  premises. Miss Goodwin was also looked after with as much tenderness during
  her stay in this urban hostelry.</p>
  <p>After a short further interview between the attorney and gentleman, and
  a few words with the lady in compulsory waiting, a conference was held between
  the magistrate, his learned clerk, and the attorney.</p>
  <p>Mr. and Miss Goodwin were then next shown into his worship&rsquo;s private
  room, and the brother and sister were liberated on their own recognisances.</p>
  <p>Nothing further was done in the case against the occupants of the suburban
  cottage. Nothing was done by that lady and gentleman against any other person
  for setting the law in motion against them. The vigilant sergeant got promoted.
  On what theory and by what influences, let the reader guess. Was it as a
  reward for past clever and prudent service? Was it the price of perpetual
  silence? Was it the seal upon a mystery?</p>
  <p>I cannot explain why the sergeant was thus dealt with; but as much of some
  other things as I can properly explain, I will.</p>
  <p>First, let me say that I had no further interference by the police with
  my plans for the detection of the real thieves, and that I hunted them down
  to conviction.</p>
  <p>In the second place, I may inform the reader that Mr. Goodwin was no other
  than an <i>alias</i> for his Grace the Duke of Nomatterwhere, a nobleman
  who boasts of a long pedigree, and whose own father was not a little proud
  of the historic traditions of the house of Nomatterwhere. The living duke
  has a large rent-roll, an almost infinitessimal portion of which goes to
  Miss Goodwin, who, although not a sister, is in very intimate relationship
  towards him. He had reasons of his own, I dare say, for the quiet, or, as
  I should say, mysterious manner in which his visits to the cottage in the
  western suburb were shrouded.</p>

  The Attorney And The Smuggler</b></h2>
  <p>TOMMY JOHNSON was a smuggler of the modern school, about which it is hardly
  necessary to say more than that it differs considerably from the old or the
  ideal school. Neither Tommy nor any of his men were the picturesque ruffians
  that school-boy imagination describes, under the tutelary genius of well-known
  romancists; nor did they much resemble the full-booted, rollicking giants
  which low art, in common pictures, invariably makes the bold smuggler.</p>
  <p>Tommy, the smuggler chief, was a short, stout, ruddy-faced, good-humoured
  fellow, who lived much as small tradesmen (of whom he was also one) live
  in that part of the south of England to which he belonged. Every body, it
  is said, liked him, and he liked every body&mdash;except a revenue-officer.</p>
  <p>Of Johnson&rsquo;s kith and kindred nobody knew, and few cared to inquire,
  any thing. Whether Tommy was his real name or not, I am uncertain. When on
  one occasion, being in trouble, he was asked by a local magistrate who his
  friends (perhaps meaning his relatives) were, jovial Tommy, with a show of
  distress, replied somewhat as that eccentric child of the Rev. Mrs. Stowe,
  Topsy, might have done, &ldquo;that he &rsquo;spected he hadn&rsquo;t got
  any.&rdquo; There was, however, too much modesty or a little untruth in this.
  Tommy Johnson had hosts of sympathisers, who were prepared at all times to
  do him any service in their power. Rumour for many miles about his place
  of abode gave him credit for being what he really was&mdash;a smuggler. Tommy
  felt it necessary sometimes to vary the compliment, but not always. He never
  went so far as to repudiate having defrauded the revenue. He was rather pleased
  to hear folks embody in words the popular theory that there was no harm in
  robbing the Custom House. He did not care to hide from some people that he
  did now and then run a vessel clandestinely between a Dutch port and some
  mysterious point off a craggy side of the Isle of Wight. He, however, usually
  preferred to be known as a man who had once been in, but now retired from,
  that business.</p>
  <p>Tommy, who was an otherwise prosperous man, once determined that he would
  indeed give up his perilous and unlawful business or profession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he once observed to his loving wife, on their return
  from church one Sunday evening, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut smuggling. I&rsquo;m
  thinking it&rsquo;s time I did. We can afford it, you know. This here business,
  the butcher&rsquo;s shop, pays; the inn at P&mdash; would honestly pay of
  itself; and the brickfield turns out right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you would, with all my heart,&rdquo; his wife replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will. My mind&rsquo;s made up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have said that before, Tommy,&rdquo; observed his sweet partner; &ldquo;but
  you can&rsquo;t do it. I wish you could. You must be a smuggler. It&rsquo;s
  the fun of it you like, as you say, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I will. I&rsquo;ve quite made up my mind. When I <i>do</i> really
  make up my mind to any thing, you know, I do it. I&rsquo;ll have just one
  more run, just <i>one</i> more, and then I drop the game, and stick to the
  trade on land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said the year before last. Do you recollect
  the time, Tommy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tommy shuddered. He made that promise to himself, and kept it by running
  a lugger from a port in the Netherlands to one of his points of concealment
  here. The affair turned out a bad one. The coast-guard discovered the arrival
  of the boat, seized the craft and its contents, and Tommy Johnson also, and
  ultimately lodged him in the gaol at Winchester, where he had to undergo
  a long imprisonment, pending the arrival of the assizes.</p>
  <p>That the smuggler then had friends was here demonstrated. The facts were
  as plain as they could be, but their interpretation or bearing on the question
  of guilt or innocence was left to the jury, who had the law expounded for
  their guidance with all possible certainty. Tommy Johnson was acquitted in
  the teeth of evidence and the strength of a sympathy between himself and
  every man in the jury-box.</p>
  <p>Let me, however, return to the last conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would have cut it after that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it cost
  such a sight of money. What with the loss of the ship, and all the rum, brandy,
  and hollands, and the hard money I paid Lawyer Swelling, we were almost ruined.
  I couldn&rsquo;t stop then. Neck or nothing, I must go in again; but now
  we&rsquo;re on our legs again, thank God! and I&rsquo;ll drop the game after
  one more slice of luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having made this resolution, Mr. Johnson next day proceeded to execute it.
  He drew out two good round sums of money from different banks; a fine lugger, &ldquo;a
  perfect beauty,&rdquo; as he declared, was soon afterwards bought, and she
  was in due course freighted with liquors on a neighbouring coast.</p>
  <p>I happened, not many weeks after this, to be travelling as an outside passenger
  by the coach from Cowes to Ventnor, in the Isle of Wight, when two revenue-carts,
  heavily laden, passed us on the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed my driver; and addressing a man who swayed
  the whip in the first cart, he inquired, &ldquo;Whose is that lot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tommy Johnson&rsquo;s, we suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor fellow! unlucky again!&rdquo; sighed the coachman.</p>
  <p>The last venture that was to crown the honest resolution had, then, failed,
  and worse had to be encountered.</p>
  <p>The repentant smuggler was again locked up in Winchester Gaol for a weary
  succession of months. The case had already been established against him by
  the clearest evidence. Tommy&rsquo;s heart dropped. His rotund form became
  elongated, his cheeks lost their plumpness and their colour, his garments
  hung loosely about his person, and his mind was ill at ease.</p>
  <p>This was the fourth time Tommy Johnson had been put on his trial for a like
  offence against the laws of his country. Each time his case was, in the opinion
  of his legal advisers, more desperate than before. The facts were not each
  time stronger, but the prejudice against the prisoner increased with his
  reappearance in the dock.</p>
  <p>Tommy and his wife resolved that no expense should be spared over the defence.
  Mr. Swelling, of Gosport, who had been so very successful on former occasions,
  was again instructed, and told to lay out as much money as he pleased in
  briefs to counsel. I reckon that he made a fine thing out of this bold modern
  smuggler. Four hundred pounds sterling were paid to him on account at starting.
  Another hundred were given him before the gaol delivery came round; and there
  was a balance yet to be liquidated, for which, however, the attorney agreed
  to give time. Now, suppose that he gave Mr. Needy, the indefatigable junior
  counsel, in all 25<i>l.</i> (which is far over the mark), and that Mr. Silkyarn,
  the eminent leader, got in all 75<i>l.</i> (which is a vast exaggeration),
  allow 50<i>l.</i> for the slight further costs out of pocket, and it will
  be seen that the attorney made a handsome profit. But there was yet a balance
  to be settled.</p>
  <p>The days previous to trial were days of anxiety to the smuggler and his
  wife. Their intensity, of course, increased as they approached the grand
  ordeal. At last the day arrived on which, for the fourth time in his life,
  Tommy Johnson was placed on his trial for smuggling in the Assize Court at
  Winchester.</p>
  <p>Again, to the surprise of his own attorney and counsel, he was acquitted.</p>
  <p>The explanation of this miscarriage of justice is easily found. The arrest
  of Johnson caused a sensation through the entire county of Hants. He was,
  as I have said, a jovial man, and a kind-hearted fellow, in his way. Rumour
  spread the story of his dashing adventures far and wide&mdash;exaggerating
  and intensifying their commonplace into wild romance. This alone fascinated
  the public mind. But again, rumour having taken Tommy Johnson under her protection,
  just as she wantonly injures so many others, she made the very most she could
  of his merits. Every single act of kindness he had ever performed was magnified
  a hundredfold, and the common smuggler became a hero. I verily believe that
  Tommy Johnson could have got a hundred acquittals, at as many consecutive
  assizes. I don&rsquo;t believe that a jury could be found to pronounce that
  awful word guilty to an indictment preferred by the Crown against him.</p>
  <p>Tommy Johnson, after his acquittal, returned home, in a condition which
  an original mind has described as that of a wiser, sadder, and poorer man
  than he was prior to the last run. He, however, laudably determined not to
  make another adventure. He would not seek, through new perils, to retrieve
  his loss. Without any claims to the character of poet himself, he drew philosophy
  from Hamlet, and resolved to bear the ills he had rather than fly to others
  which, his lawyers told him, he could not fathom the depths of. He would
  stick to the safe pursuit of fortune on land, and not tempt the perils of
  the deep in the way he had done. In one of his soliloquies on this point
  he observed that he had made money at it, but he was afraid that he had used
  up his luck. He couldn&rsquo;t stand those long imprisonments, and he couldn&rsquo;t
  always go on dropping thousands into the hands of the coast-guard and the
  lawyers. On the whole, he was decidedly of opinion that smuggling was objectionable,
  on many grounds, and for various reasons; so he did in fact at last resolve
  to give it up&mdash;and he kept that promise.</p>
  <p>Mr. Johnson, in less than a fortnight (being so anxious, as he said, to
  get the affair off his mind) wrote to his attorney to ascertain the exact
  balance due to that able and worthy man. The lawyer answered by a note, which
  led Mr. Johnson to call at his office with about 150<i>l.</i> in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; observed the attorney, stretching out his
  hands with frigid cordiality, &ldquo;sit down. I am glad to see you, Mr.
  Johnson; very glad indeed. I never thought I should have succeeded in getting
  you off the last time. You owe a great deal to me and to your excellent counsel,
  Mr. Needy and Mr. Silkyarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;m much obliged, sir, I assure you,&rdquo; Johnson
  interposed, with the hope of abbreviating the homily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued the lawyer, &ldquo;I am bound to do the
  best I can for my client who is in a difficulty. I am glad that I did succeed
  in getting you off; but prevention is better than cure, you know, Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; exclaimed the impatient client.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; the attorney went on to say, &ldquo;let me give you a
  bit of sound advice gratis&mdash;moral and religious advice, as well as legal&mdash;Mr.
  Johnson. Let me assure you, that although I dare say you think there is no
  harm in it, it is as wicked to plunder the revenue as it is to rob a private
  individual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it in that light,&rdquo; said the unconvicted smuggler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is so, upon my honour,&rdquo; replied the attorney. &ldquo;Think
  over what I now say. Reflect upon the matter, Mr. Johnson, and you&rsquo;ll
  see I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s an affair for to-morrow. Let me see, what did
  you say your balance was, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ah! Well, I said I&rsquo;d take a hundred guineas in final settlement&mdash;that
  is, a hundred and five pounds, Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Johnson counted the money in notes, and handed it to the attorney, who laid
  it on his table.</p>
  <p>A moment&rsquo;s silence followed.</p>
  <p>It was broken by the attorney, who did not quite understand the look of
  the client; and as he feared that Mr. Johnson might be thinking the costs
  excessive, Mr. Swelling turned the theme.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I hope the next time you retain my services, they will be needed
  for some different purpose. I should like to see you make money, and invest
  it in land or houses, and let me prepare the deeds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, you shall, when I can get the money to buy the land and
  houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, till then good by, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said the attorney, rising
  to bow out his client.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You forgot, sir, I think, to give me a receipt; and I don&rsquo;t
  think I ever had any for the money I paid you in the prison?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, Mr. Johnson. Certainly you can have a duly-stamped
  receipt, if you please; but I hope you don&rsquo;t suppose that I want to
  cheat you? I should not like to think you reward my anxious services on your
  behalf by entertaining such an unjust suspicion of me as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Oh, no. Nothing of that sort. Only, as you were a-saying
  that it&rsquo;s as wrong to rob the revenue as it is a private individual,
  I thought (although I don&rsquo;t see things quite in that light) that you
  ought to give me one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The attorney&rsquo;s moral philosophy cost him 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
  <p>He bit his lip, and sat down; and as penny receipts had not been invented,
  he wrote on a stamp of the above value a receipt for all the money paid him
  by the smuggler, who rather enjoyed the joke he had played off on his legal
  adviser.</p>

  Swindling According To Act Of Parliament</b></h2>
  <p>I THINK that the merchants and traders of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
  or the Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom, might lay out a fair sum
  of money in a worse mode than by retaining me to illustrate, through my experience,
  some defective acts of Parliament, under which, as I have seen, frequent
  palpable and sometimes gigantic villany is perpetrated. Whether this notion
  of my usefulness to the mercantile community and the State is justified or
  not by any thing I can show, the reader may judge from the following, which
  is one sample of a stock in my recollections.</p>
  <p>An honest, struggling, and not rich, but moderately successful, trader in
  the City of London, not long ago, was told that a certain &ldquo;firm&rdquo; (Messrs.
  Voleur and Enlever), who had offices, or a warehouse, not many hundreds of
  yards from the Mansion House, and somewhat nearer to the cold abode of Gog
  and Magog, and who had an establishment in Paris, might do business with
  him in a certain class of goods. The trader, Mr. Brown, although not able
  to bear losses, and therefore somewhat cautious, was, at the same time, naturally
  anxious to do business. He inquired the standing of this firm. His friend
  could not tell him, but said that other friends of his&mdash;Messrs. Downey
  and Grabble&mdash;were traders with these enterprising Parisians; that Downey
  was the very model of scrupulousness; and that Mr. Brown might go and ask
  him to say confidentially what he knew about or thought of the Frenchmen. &ldquo;Downey
  and Grabble are first-class people, I can assure you. If they say &lsquo;right,&rsquo; all
  is right; and if they say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; then I say don&rsquo;t
  trust Voleur and Enlever, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Brown thanked his friend.</p>
  <p>Next day, as a matter of course, Brown called at the London office or warehouse
  of Voleur and Enlever, which, for geographical definiteness, I may also explain
  was not far from the High Court of Relief, in Basinghall Street. He had samples
  of his goods in his pocket. The agent and buyer of the French firm was in
  his proper place behind the counter.</p>
  <p>Firstly a formal explanation and inquiry or two passed between these gentlemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What class of goods do you say you can offer us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alpacas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will do for the Paris market just now, but we must have them
  cheap. We don&rsquo;t want long credit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are a job lot. I can offer them low for cash or short credit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our terms are cash at thirty days; but let us see your samples.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The samples were laid on the counter, critically examined by the intended
  buyer, and approved. Mr. Brown was also content (subject to references) with
  the thirty days&rsquo; credit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, continuing the dialogue, &ldquo;I am quite
  satisfied as to the terms of credit; but as this is my first transaction
  with your house, I should like a reference, which, if quite satisfactory,
  as I have no doubt it will be, I&rsquo;ll send in the goods at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite right. Let me see, who shall I give you? Do
  you know Downey and Grabble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know them very well. That reference is quite satisfactory
  to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask <i>them</i>, then, what they think of Voleur and Enlever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Brown went direct to the counting-house of Downey and Grabble. Both
  members of the firm were out. He called again, and saw the two members of
  this very respectable house.</p>
  <p>The visitor went direct to the business on which he had called.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am told you are dealing with Voleur and Enlever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are good, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We suppose so,&rdquo; said Downey, in silken tones, &ldquo;or we
  should have nothing to do with them;&rdquo; and as he spoke he turned his
  eyes upon his partner.</p>
  <p>Grabble added, &ldquo;Perhaps it would be more satisfactory to this gentleman
  if we showed him our account with the house he inquires about. Here, Clark,
  let me have the ledger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ledger was brought. It showed a large amount as due from Voleur and
  Co. to Downey and Co.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Brown, &ldquo;that you have confidence in them.
  You&rsquo;ll, however, excuse my being a little particular. I am a poorer
  man than you are, and although I am anxious to do business, I must be careful
  not to make bad debts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What goods are they you have to sell?&rdquo; inquired Grabble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alpacas,&rdquo; said Brown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; they are wanted in Paris just now. Voleur&rsquo;s might
  sell an immense lot of those, I should think. It&rsquo;s a good opening for
  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What credit do they want?&rdquo; asked Downey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty days,&rdquo; said Brown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as safe as the Bank. You are sure to get your money at
  the end of the month. I know both Voleur and Enlever. They are young men
  belonging to first-class families, and as sound as Copestakes or Morleys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brown thanked Downey and Grabble, and went on his way to his own little
  warehouse, rejoicing in the confident belief that he had done a good day&rsquo;s
  work&mdash;that he had netted a ten-pound note that morning.</p>
  <p>The goods were sent in with all convenient speed by Brown to Voleur and
  Enlever. By their agent the alpacas were not forwarded to Paris,&mdash;perhaps
  because they were needed in the home market. The Paris house had, as Downey
  and Grabble well knew, a means of disposing of all sorts of textile, or even
  fictile products, much nearer to the City branch of their operations than
  the French capital. There was, in the neighbourhood of the London Rialto, &ldquo;a
  house&rdquo; kept by two kind-hearted members of one of the tribes of Israel,
  in which any conceivable quantity of goods that any other firm or house could
  buy on credit might be taken care of; and these benevolent Hebrews would
  at all times not only warehouse the aforesaid goods, but they would also
  oblige trading Gentiles by advances (of course for a consideration, under
  the name of interest) up to a certain proportion of the value of these goods.
  Now, reader, don&rsquo;t call this process by an ugly name. If you have read
  the former stories in my volume, you will be aware that this mode of disposing
  of goods is not called pawning. That is an obnoxious word&mdash;never breathed
  among City men, or allowed to taint the air between Temple Bar and Aldgate.
  This mode of raising cash, and getting off commodities, is called hypothecating.
  Is it not a nice phrase? The process is undoubtedly sanctified by the title.</p>
  <p>Now it so happened that a man who traded in the City of London, and had
  done business with the firm of Voleur and Enlever, and whose goods had been
  hypothecated with the Hebrew benefactors, did not admire the process. He
  had seen his goods, supplied to the enterprising Frenchmen on the strength
  of one of Downey and Grabble&rsquo;s oral testimonials, safely housed by
  the Israelites; and he determined that he would exert his utmost power and
  influence to prevent other men&rsquo;s wares, intended for Paris, from a
  like diversion of their route. This man, by watching and inquiry, found out
  that the goods lately belonging to Brown, and now the lawful property of
  Voleur and Enlever, to do as they liked with, had been sent to the hypothecators.
  He called upon Brown, who he saw had been made a victim of, and gave explanations
  which reflected upon the character of the houses of both Voleur and their
  reference. Brown was a little alarmed, but philosophically remarked that
  the mischief had been done, and there was no help for it. In fact he yet
  hoped, on the strength of Downey&rsquo;s testimonial, that the money faithfully
  promised in thirty days would be paid in due course.</p>
  <p>Before the day when Mr. Brown&rsquo;s money became due, the English branch
  of the house of Voleur and Enlever was shut up; letters addressed to the
  chief establishment in Paris were returned through the Dead Letter Office.
  The firm had become dissolved, the house had run away, and no man could discover
  its whereabouts.</p>
  <p>Mr. Brown saw that his money was lost, unless he could make those rascals
  Downey and Grabble pay. To this point all his thoughts were directed. He
  felt quite convinced that these &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; traders knew all
  about their Continental friends, and that it only needed a searching investigation
  to prove the complicity of the houses through whom he had been defrauded.</p>
  <p>At this state of the affair I was employed.</p>
  <p>My inquiries soon unravelled the whole plot. It turned upon a simple fact;
  but the surrounding incidents of the narrative were remarkably unique, and
  interesting to the mercantile community.</p>
  <p>In fact Downey and Grabble were in the first place taken in, and nearly
  done for; to a large amount, by Voleur and Enlever. The persuasion of the
  Frenchmen had been more than a match for the craft of those Englishmen, who
  originally hailed from the county of York.</p>
  <p>One day&mdash;about a fortnight before Mr. Brown&rsquo;s visit to the London
  warehouse of the Frenchmen&mdash;M. Voleur and a fair countrywoman, who was
  not Madame Voleur, were proceeding along one of the quiet streets of the
  City, in the afternoon, not many hours before the departure of the tidal
  train, by which they intended to quit the British metropolis, when that elegant
  gentleman was tapped on the shoulder in the politest manner by a man who
  turned out, on further acquaintanceship, to be an officer of the Sheriff
  of London. The Frenchman was conveyed to the sponging-house over which this
  officer presided, despite his protests and the lady&rsquo;s tears.</p>
  <p>The creditors, Messrs. Downey and Grabble, had made an affidavit that the
  debtor, M. Voleur, was about to leave the country with the view of hindering
  and delaying the recovery by them of the money to which they were entitled;
  and, upon the strength of this oath, one of the learned judges had authorised
  the detention of the Frenchman until he paid the demand, gave bail for its
  payment, or liquidated the obligation in bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>Messrs. Voleur and Co.&rsquo;s agent rushed to the office of a skilful attorney,
  who was instructed to do his best for the prisoner. This gentleman met Mr.
  Downey and his lawyer in the reluctant lodgings of M. Voleur, that unlucky
  man being present. A quarrel was cut short, or nearly prevented, by considerations
  of prudence.</p>
  <p>M. Voleur&rsquo;s attorney led the discussion into a practical current by
  saying to his opponents,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you plainly, that my client can&rsquo;t put in bail, and he
  won&rsquo;t lie in prison. If you don&rsquo;t voluntarily release him, I&rsquo;ll
  file his petition in bankruptcy. It was foolish on your part to lock him
  up. He can&rsquo;t get the money to pay you while he is here; but if he had
  his liberty, he might do so. He&rsquo;s a clever fellow, and will not stop
  yet awhile, unless you are silly enough to stop him. If you let him alone,
  taking care not to trust him any more yourselves, but not thwarting him or
  destroying his credit, you may easily float out in the course of a month
  or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Downey and his attorney were struck by the ingenuity, if not force,
  of the argument, but not quite persuaded to release the debtor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you offer us any security?&rdquo; Mr. Downey&rsquo;s adviser
  asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the terse rejoinder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see the advantage of liberating your client,&rdquo; added
  the creditor&rsquo;s attorney.</p>
  <p>The negotiation would have broken off at this point, but for the Frenchman&rsquo;s
  ready wit. He had a resource. He had a small contingent property in France.
  It was valuable enough to cover the debt of Downey and Grabble, although
  not to be easily realised in this country. He did not like to part with this,
  his only fortune, to a stranger.</p>
  <p>A Frenchman is literally and absolutely nothing, if not always sentimental,
  and occasionally lachrymose.</p>
  <p>M. Voleur shed tears when he agreed to part with this little contingent
  estate to his inexorable creditor; then, having exhausted his natural emotions,
  he returned to business, and the negotiation was renewed.</p>
  <p>It was ultimately settled, on Downey&rsquo;s giving his assurance, upon
  the honour of a gentleman, that he would afterwards do what he could to prop
  up the house of Voleur and Enlever&mdash;that is, by giving favourable references
  as to them&mdash;he and his partner should have an assignment made to them
  of this contingent estate. The sentimental Frenchman further stipulated,
  that when he paid the amount due to Downey and Grabble, as he expected to
  do very soon, the creditors should re-transfer the estate.</p>
  <p>The compact was ratified by solemn pledges of honour.</p>
  <p>To save appearances, it was arranged that one of the firm of Downey and
  Grabble should go to France, pretend to make inquiries about the respectability
  of Voleur and Enlever, and telegraph back &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; as an
  excuse for the liberation of M. Voleur. The reader will see the necessity
  for this. Downey and Co. could not venture to speak favourably of the man
  they had arrested unless some excuse could be found for an altered opinion.
  Downey and Co. would not, of course, tell any body of the arrest of Voleur,
  but that ugly fact might withal leak out. How to reconcile the contents of
  the affidavit, which led the judge to order the Frenchman&rsquo;s arrest,
  with the subsequent eulogiums, was the moral difficulty to be surmounted.</p>
  <p>It is needless to say that the argument of the Frenchman&rsquo;s attorney
  must not be repeated, and the security they had obtained must not be mentioned.
  The possession of that document was a palpable sign of a want of that confidence
  upon which ordinary credit rests. An inquiry on the spot into the respectability
  of the French house seemed to all parties the most effective way of getting
  up a show of justification for a good character to be lavished on the swindlers.</p>
  <p>Downey started by the next train and boat to Paris. He had for his companion
  M. Voleur&rsquo;s madame. This little circumstance was not, I believe, mentioned
  to Mrs. Downey, because she had a jealous disposition.</p>
  <p>Within an incredibly short space of time Mr. Downey made all the inquiries
  he deemed requisite, and was enabled to despatch the welcome message, &ldquo;all
  right,&rdquo; by the harnessed lightning, as he promised.</p>
  <p>Next day Voleur met Downey in the French capital, and the next and the next
  were spent in the same place. During this time Voleur and Enlever introduced
  the English merchant to theatres, caf&eacute;s, casinos, and more recondite
  places, by way of further evidence of their respectability, prudence, and
  commercial trustworthiness.</p>
  <p>Downey had gone through all this circle of inquiry, and returned home to
  London, before Brown called upon him to ask his opinion of the Frenchmen.
  It is a pity that the respectable British merchants, when they gave Mr. Brown
  the testimonial by which he lost his goods or his money, did not expose the
  bases of their faith in Voleur and Enlever. They surely ought not to have
  concealed the security in their possession, the arrest of their debtor, or
  a few other small incidents.</p>
  <p>I thought the respectable members of the house of Downey and Grabble deserved
  punishment as criminals. It appeared, however, that no part of the criminal
  code could touch them. As yet, moreover, it was, on the authority of a lawyer
  of repute in the City of London, not possible to recover, by an action at
  law, the value of the goods supplied to Voleur and Co. on the strength of
  their English reference. But I had not yet finished my investigations.</p>
  <p>I soon after this alighted upon a grand discovery. I got hold of all the
  confidential correspondence between M. Voleur and the English manager of
  their house. This young man, who had been more sinned against than sinning,
  also assisted me in tracing the delinquencies of his masters, and their confederates
  or supporters.</p>
  <p>The correspondence was exceedingly interesting. M. Voleur, who was the principal
  correspondent, knew English as well as his mother tongue, or he was entitled
  to rank among the highest of French <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>. The pathos
  was fine. The letters had such passages as these: &ldquo;We are in sore distress
  for money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Buy goods any where; sell or dispose of them any
  how; and send us here to Paris the money, or we are ruined quite.&rdquo; Then
  there were worldly maxims, that would have done credit to Captain Barabbas
  Whitefeather, such as, &ldquo;Pay no cash. It&rsquo;s a bad principle. Get
  every thing on credit.&rdquo; The most unique passages were, however, those
  in which the Frenchman explained to his English agent how the trade-protection
  societies were to be managed, hoodwinked, or bribed. In the interests of
  trade I must, however, conceal this part of the swindle.</p>
  <p>It now appeared to me that, by gathering up all the items of fact, and uniting
  the written with the oral evidence, my case against Downey and Grabble was
  complete. A solicitor was consulted, and he took counsel&rsquo;s opinion
  on the matter. That authority pronounced that the evidence would not sustain
  a criminal prosecution, and in truth Mr. Brown did not much care about that,
  to him, barren remedy. He wanted to promote the welfare of society in a mode
  that would recoup his loss. He wanted to compel Downey and Grabble to pay
  the amount they had induced him, solely by their representations, to trust
  the Frenchmen. In the way of even this there were, it was thought, some difficulties.</p>
  <p>That eminent old lawyer, Lord Tenterden, had been, many long years ago,
  at the pains to provide a statutory immunity for people like Downey and Grabble.
  Mr. Brown, as an Englishman, ought to have known the laws of his country&mdash;it
  is presumed that every man has all the written and the unwritten, the common,
  the civil, and the criminal codes engraven on the tablets of his memory&mdash;but
  Mr. Brown did not know it was requisite for his safety that the many representations
  of the English firm should be written down in unblushing ink. Even if he
  had known so much as was requisite for his security, he might have relied
  upon the mistaken supposition that Downey and Grabble were truthful men.</p>
  <p>In the hope that this case had features which took it from under the mischievous &aelig;gis
  of Lord Tenterden, in reliance upon a notion that Downey and Grabble would
  not dare to allow the cause to reach a public trial, and also prepared to
  risk something in the interest of the mercantile community, Mr. Brown brought
  his action against these &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; men. It cost him something,
  did this resolution. He had to employ first-rate counsel, whose fees were
  not small. The cause was defended. Downey and Co. knew that this was but
  one of a series of claims, which, under the like circumstances, might arise
  against them. At the trial all the facts I have mentioned were clearly established.
  The learned counsel who led the plaintiff&rsquo;s case denounced, in terms
  of just severity, the conduct of the defendants. The judge, the jury, and
  the spectators would have been glad to see financial equity enforced against
  the wrong-doers. At the conclusion of the evidence Mr. Brown was able to
  offer, the counsel for the defendants argued that he had no case to answer.
  He took his stand upon the Act of Parliament. He did not attempt to deny
  the merits of the plaintiff&rsquo;s case. He could not answer the damnatory
  facts. Upon the dry technical question, whether or not Messrs. Downey and
  Grabble were shielded by the obnoxious statute, there was a long argument,
  which ended in the judge&rsquo;s expressing an opinion that he was afraid
  they were; and the plaintiff was nonsuited.</p>
  <p>The respectable house of Downey and Grabble did not long survive its damaging
  triumph. It has ceased to appear in the <i>London Directory</i>, and its
  members have found it requisite to their comfort to emigrate beyond the limits
  of a most unenviable notoriety.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Matrimonial Espionage</b></h2>
  <p>AMONG the curiosities of my experience I reckon the incidents of the narrative
  I am about to relate.</p>
  <p>A few years ago, a gentleman of considerable estate, one of the untitled
  nobility of England, called upon me, and explained that he had reason to
  suspect the fidelity of his wife. I did not recognise the force of these
  reasons. The facts on which this gloomy, although partial, faith in the lady&rsquo;s
  impurity or falseness had been raised might, with strict literal accuracy,
  he described as &ldquo;trifles light as air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This suspicion was, however, not to be wholly disregarded by a stranger,
  at the first blush of the case. My visitor&rsquo;s station in life, his intellectual
  qualifications, and his affection for his wife, appeared like guarantees
  that he would not condemn her without cause. He did not, however, assert
  with confidence that she was guilty. All he had, or professed to have, was
  a doubt. He told me that nothing would give him more delight than a perfect
  conviction that he had been under a delusion about the lady.</p>
  <p>Perhaps it would be well to describe somewhat more fully the actors in this
  curious little drama. Mr. Percival was the only son of a wealthy and improving
  land-owner in the county of Sussex. He had, in consequence, inherited his
  father&rsquo;s whole landed estate, together with a large sum of money, and
  considerable investments in public funds and other reliable securities. His
  education had been well cared for. He lost his mother when only about fourteen
  years of age, and his character had, it is probable, suffered from want of
  the chastening influences of maternal care. This was, however, the only defect,
  if it were a defect, in his training. His father had anxiously watched the
  conduct and the development of his youth. He had been educated at Eton, where
  he excelled in more than one branch of study. At Oxford he took honours.
  He was a superior type of the class known as &ldquo;country gentlemen.&rdquo; His
  habits were those of a man of culture and a man of fortune.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Percival was a lady of good, although comparatively poor, family. Her
  father rejoiced in the title of an Irish landlord; but the rent-roll of the
  estate was not very considerable, and it needed dexterous management to keep
  it from the withering grasp of the Encumbered Estates Court. Still, out of
  their slender resources, Mrs. Percival&rsquo;s parents had given her a superior
  education. She could draw, she was a skilful and a good musician, she was
  an elegant horse-woman, and otherwise accomplished. Her manners were free
  and natural,&mdash;sometimes a little child-like or hoydenish. She was a
  little, and but a little, above the average stature of her sex; had a graceful
  mien, and a sweet face. If I were expert in drawing pen-and-ink sketches,
  after the manner of a novelist, I should describe this lady as an almost
  perfect woman.</p>
  <p>The reader will understand that I have, in this description, anticipated
  the narrative so far as to let him know more of the lady and the gentleman
  than I could learn within a period of two months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will excuse my candour, sir, I hope; but I fail to see the grounds
  for your suspicion of your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like your candour. It is reassuring. I may be mistaken. I devoutly
  pray that I am. You have, I am told, had great experience in such painful
  domestic affairs as that I now trouble you with. It is already a source of
  much comfort to me that I have consulted you. If you can remove the horrid
  doubts which oppress me, I shall esteem you my benefactor; but let me know
  the truth, whatever that may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I again begged him to be a little more precise than he had been in detailing
  the cause of his suspicions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In solemn confidence, I may say that we were at a dinner-party at
  the house of Mr. Tallboyes, in Seymour Place, the week before last, and it
  was impossible to avoid noticing her freedom with young Lord Swellington
  and Colonel Foreshore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The colonel!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;he is a man of sixty. He has seen
  much hard service; and is &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; in every party just now, I
  have heard. Were not your wife&rsquo;s attentions the mere courtesies which
  all true women find pleasure in bestowing upon age and bravery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That might be; but what do you say about her pleasantries with that
  conceited and empty-headed young fop, Lord Swellington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These might be the innocent raillery and badinage of the purest woman.
  Ladies sometimes take a cruel pleasure in trifling with, just to mortify,
  the fop, in whatever grade of society he may be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope you are right; but, unhappily, these have not been
  the only causes of my grief. My wife is too fond of pleasure. We have lately
  been at two public breakfasts,&mdash;one given by Lady W&mdash;, at Kew;
  and another by the Marchioness of L&mdash;, at Chiswick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;pardon my suggesting, under the most adverse, and at the
  same time rational, estimate of human character&mdash;betrays only something
  of levity, quite consistent with purity of heart and the strictest rectitude
  of conduct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not, I am glad to say, an uncharitable interpreter of human
  conduct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I hope not; for although I have seen much wickedness, and
  a vast deal of subtle, as well as patent, crime, I have met with many instances
  in which unjust suspicions have provoked calamities. But was there any thing,
  and if so what was there, in the conduct of your wife to justify your suspicions
  about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she flirted with every gentleman present at each party, young
  and old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With every one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, or nearly so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is enough to show the groundlessness of your apprehensions.
  Mrs. Percival may have been too richly endowed with vivacity, but <i>my</i> suspicion
  is that her freedom arises, in great part, from her conscious guilelessness
  and her moral self-possession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again I say I <i>hope</i> you may be right, and I wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why so emphasise that word <i>hope</i>? Have you observed any other
  instances of what you deem your wife&rsquo;s impropriety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Relate them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The other day my wife induced me to take her to the flower-show held
  in the gardens of the Botanic Society, Regent&rsquo;s Park.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She asked you to take her?&rdquo; I interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and I did so. I yield every thing she desires; and why not,
  as I am not certain that her affections wander?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite correct; but did any thing occur there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you deem it nothing. She hung on the arm of Colonel Foreshore
  for a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old Indian colonel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, really, I do not see any thing in that. I happened to be at
  that show myself with Mrs. Forrester and a distinguished relative of ours.
  I remember that among the flowers were several Oriental plants, which our
  florists have succeeded in naturalising. This is one of the most common incidents
  of a flower-show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could look upon these things as you do. A single incident
  of the kind might not have aroused my apprehensions; but so many, and at
  various times furnish a collective evidence impossible to resist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A little more than two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was quite convinced, as the reader must be, that there was really nothing
  in the conduct of Mrs. Percival to justify the cruel suspicions of her husband.
  His employment of me would, I saw, be one of the absurdest things he could
  very well do.</p>
  <p>Should I allow him to employ me? Ought I to permit myself to be used as
  a spy upon his wife&rsquo;s movements&mdash;being so firmly convinced, as
  I was, of her innocence?</p>
  <p>The mystery of this jealousy was capable of a simple explanation. The lady
  had been endowed by nature with a somewhat mercurial disposition, which her
  education had done little to check. The very scenes in which her girlhood
  had been spent had inspired her with a wild or playful tendency. Nothing
  in her married life had yet happened to curb or control the innocent gaiety,
  or it might be waywardness, of her disposition. Had her union with Mr. Percival
  been blessed by offspring (of which, it is needless to say, there was yet
  no ground for despair), it is most probable that at dinner-parties she would
  have been a less attractive member, at public breakfasts she would have been
  less chatty or facetious, at flower-shows a less anxious inquirer.</p>
  <p>But should I, or should I not, undertake to confirm or remove the unjust
  husband&rsquo;s suspicions?</p>
  <p>Upon this I could not make up my mind. I required time for consideration.
  It was arranged that Mr. Percival should see me again in three days.</p>
  <p>During the interval between his first and second visits, I carefully balanced
  reasons for and against the engagement, and at length resolved to accept
  it. If I did not undertake it, I knew others would, if it were offered them.
  If they took it in hand, I was not at all sure that they would perform their
  task with becoming delicacy and consideration. I thought it not improbable
  that some rude or vulgar man might be instructed, and that he might, by starting
  on his inquiry with a foregone conclusion of the lady&rsquo;s guilt, so interpret
  what he saw of her free conduct as to increase her husband&rsquo;s jealousy.
  On the other hand, if I undertook the affair, I doubted not the result would
  be a vindication of Mrs. Percival in her husband&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>Mr. Percival punctually kept his appointment with me.</p>
  <p>He was the first to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have agreed to assist me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I shall feel grateful to you when you have probed the truth&mdash;doubly
  grateful, if you can prove that my doubts about my wife are unfounded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I expect to earn that double gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; he said, with great emphasis. &ldquo;It is no drawback
  on your professional merits, to my mind, that you have already formed an
  opinion that my wife is as good as I could wish her, and that I am a jealous
  fool. I should not like to know that you had condemned <i>her</i> beforehand.
  I am persuaded that you will do your duty faithfully towards me, and considerately
  towards her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I promised him that much.</p>
  <p>There was a ball at Almack&rsquo;s the very next day. Mrs. Percival was
  to be there, and so was her husband. They would go separately, after the
  manner of the <i>ton</i>&mdash;she in her brougham, and he in his cab.</p>
  <p>I did not think Almack&rsquo;s a desirable place to begin my inquiries in.
  It would not be easy for me to gain admission into this closest of all assemblies,
  although I could have encompassed that, as I had before. I preferred a stand-point
  of observation where etiquette was less rigid.</p>
  <p>Next week there was to be a grand fancy-dress ball, under a potent body
  of lady patronesses, for the relief of starvation in Whitechapel; and Mrs.
  Percival, acting under the feeble light of conventional charity, thought
  it her duty to buy a ticket (price one guinea, of which an infinitessimal
  portion was netted for the indigent), and to largely patronise her dressmaker
  and milliner, in proof of her intense sympathy with the famishing poor.</p>
  <p>I attended this ball, and was sickened by its palpable mockery of the distress
  it was ostensibly designed to relieve; but I must not get off the track of
  my narrative to moralise.</p>
  <p>At this ball I saw nothing to justify a suspicion of impropriety on the
  part of Mrs. Percival; nor did I at a flower-show which was held in the grounds
  of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham; nor at a public breakfast which the Marchioness
  of L&mdash; gave in her grounds at Chiswick. A more private scrutiny of the
  lady&rsquo;s movements also went to prove her strictly virtuous in character.</p>
  <p>I now got wearied and half-disgusted with my task, and brought it to an
  end by reporting to Mr. Percival my absolute conviction of his wife&rsquo;s
  innocence and purity. He received my statement without offering any opinion
  upon it, and it was evident that he was not quite satisfied with it. It had,
  I dare say, weakened his suspicions, but it had not destroyed them. I was
  sorry for the imperfect result, but I could do no more than I had done for
  his satisfaction.</p>
  <p>I often mused and reflected over this curious case. What could have given
  rise to these suspicions in the mind of such a man as Mr. Percival? I set
  it down to incompatibility of temper. He was a somewhat studious and retiring
  man. His wife, although as good a woman as ever drew breath, was a light
  and somewhat volatile person. In many respects, I argued, this is an incongruous
  union. I thought I saw inevitable misery for both husband and wife in the
  future.</p>
  <p>About a year after I had finished my proper business with Mr. and Mrs. Percival,
  I was waited upon by an eminent London solicitor, who knew nothing of my
  former engagement, for the purpose of tracing the retreat of that gentleman,
  who had deserted his wife, and was hiding from all his friends. My visitor,
  the private solicitor of Mr. Percival, had not heard from him since or about
  his flight. It was not supposed that any violence had befallen him, although
  it was hard to say what harm might befall him. His physician had advised
  that he had been suffering from one of the thousand forms of one of the hundred
  branches of that disorder known by the familiar collective title of insanity.
  It was a mild and harmless type of the disease&mdash;a species of melancholia.
  The friends of the unfortunate gentleman were anxious to discover, and perhaps
  secretly watch over, him; at the worst, place him under gentle and temporary
  restraint. As he was known to be a man of high and honourable ambition&mdash;very
  likely to obtain and worthily fill a seat in Parliament, unless his prospects
  were marred&mdash;publicity, scandal, or gossip, on the subject of his bereavement,
  was to be deprecated.</p>
  <p>I accepted this engagement, and I thought it desirable to let the solicitor
  know of the previous retainer given me by Mr. Percival, so that he might
  re-state the facts to the physician, who would thereby gain some insight
  into the secret of the gentleman&rsquo;s misfortune.</p>
  <p>We had no clue to Mr. Percival&rsquo;s whereabouts. Certain facts led us
  to imagine he had not left this country; but I put myself in communication
  with the French and Belgian police, as the best mode of tracing him if he
  had crossed the sea. I had all the provincial papers filed at Peele&rsquo;s
  and Deacon&rsquo;s Coffee-houses critically scanned, so that if any harm
  befell him I should hear of it. This was a precaution I added to the usual
  police inquiry through the <i>Hue and Cry</i>.</p>
  <p>One day I got intelligence through a West-of-England paper that a gentleman,
  answering to the description of Mr. Percival, had been found wandering along
  the coast, in a state which indicated mental disorganisation. I lost no time
  in proceeding to the spot, with the doctor, and with Mrs. Percival, who insisted
  upon being of the party.</p>
  <p>We claimed the poor man, who yielded himself up to our control like an infant.
  We brought him to London, and took apartments for him in a western suburb,
  so as to be out of the eye of gossips, and near to that of his physician.
  It is, perhaps, needless to say that his wife attended on him mainly with
  her own hands, and would let none but the rudest offices be performed by
  any other person. Carriage rides, gentle exercise, and tonic medicines told
  beneficially on the patient day by day; so that in a few weeks, under the
  doctor&rsquo;s advice, arrangements were made to take him, in his own yacht,
  to the north of Europe.</p>
  <p>The physician explained to me that the secret of his malady was disappointed
  or impatient ambition. He was an only son. He had inherited, with his father&rsquo;s
  property, that gentleman&rsquo;s desire to establish a house. He feared that
  the curse of sterility had fallen on him or his wife, and the constant brooding
  over this thought had curdled jealousy in his heart.</p>
  <p>In the north of Europe Mr. Percival&rsquo;s mental health was completely
  restored. On his return to England he called upon me, and thanked me very
  sincerely for the part I had played in the narrative I have described&mdash;stating
  that if any thing could exceed the claims I had upon his gratitude for the
  attention I had bestowed upon him, it would be the faithful manner in which
  I had combated and sought to destroy his unfounded suspicions of his wife.
  A better or nobler woman did not, he said, exist. She had, he feared, impaired
  her health by her vigilant attention to him during his illness; and the only
  grief he now had was the apprehension that, being <i>enceinte</i>, the change
  of air, and Continental travel, which had just been recommended for her sake,
  would be inadequate to restore a vigour and tone to her delicate system.
  I am happy, however, in being able to state that these fears have not been
  realised. Mr. and Mrs. Percival, who are among the very happiest people in
  the world (the health of both, in mind and in body, being as nearly perfect
  as they can be), have two sons, with the prospect of contributing more guarantees
  against the termination of their pedigree in this generation.</p>
