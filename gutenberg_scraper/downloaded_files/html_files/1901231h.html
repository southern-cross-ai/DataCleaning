<h2><a name="ch1"></a>1. THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN</h2>

<p class="first">THE Circle G herd, twenty-five hundred long-
horned cattle out of Menard County, Texas, had passed the
Arkansas and were bedded down off the trail two miles from Dodge
City. The chuck-wagon fire traced an orange spiral in the night,
at occasions fitfully illumining a puncher's face. There were
eighteen in the outfit, counting the colored cook whose giant
figure slid to and from the circle of light with the supper
dishes. From the near distance floated the night rider's
lament:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Sam Bass was borned in Injianna, it wus his native home,<br>
And at the age uh seventeen, young Sam began to roam&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>Cigarette tips gleamed; a dry voice broke the spell of
silence.</p>

<p>"Had music wings that song would fall an' bust its neck."</p>

<p>The remark stirred the fluid of speech; a lazy rejoinder
passed over the flame tips. "Yo' ain't no Jenny Lind yo'se'f,
Quagmire. Fella can't tell they is a tune when yo' soothe the
bulls."</p>

<p>Quagmire rose on an elbow and brought himself into the light;
a skinny man, the colour of butternut, with drawn features and a
spray of crowfoot wrinkles around each eye; a sadly sober man
whose words seemed to escape from some deep pit of despair. "Who,
me? I sing bass."</p>

<p>"It's God's mercy then they ain't more bass singers in this
outfit."</p>

<p>Quagmire elevated his thin shoulders and turned his palms
upward, Indian fashion. "I was borned durin' the War o' Secession
when corn pone got all-fired skase. Not havin' any provender to
support my voice it fell into the pit o' my stummick and it ain't
come back sence. Go 'way 'long, yo' East Texas oat munchers. It
takes starvation to make a genius."</p>

<p>"Well, by&mdash;"</p>

<p>Horse and rider moved into the light. Astride the horse, a
stocking-legged bay with a shad belly, was Major Bob Gillette,
owner of the herd. The firelight played on his face, strongly
outlining the granitic ruggedness of chin and brow. He wore no
beard, nor so much as a goatee&mdash;itself a sign of
unconformity in a land where nearly every adult male went
whiskered. In his fifties, this stormy petrel was indelibly
stamped with the effects of a rough border career. Beneath the
brim of his felt hat his hair showed an iron-gray in keeping with
the uneven transverse lines of his face and the bold modeling of
his cheek bones. His eyes were set far apart and considerably
back in the sockets; thus hidden they deprived his features of
the ordinary light and mobility and made them appear both harsh
and uncompromising. It was a legend back in Menard County that a
Gillette rider was the best in he state, not only excelling with
horse and rope, but also with the gun. He worked his men hard,
kept almost military discipline, and played no favourites. It was
quite significant that talk ceased when he rode among the
group.</p>

<p>"San Saba."</p>

<p>A brittle, slow answer came from the rear of the circle, "Yes,
suh."</p>

<p>"I'm going to town. Keep about while I'm away."</p>

<p>"Yes, suh."</p>

<p>Major Gillette rode off. For some time the silence held, then
Quagmire's rumbling, drear tones broke it "Well, I'm perishin'
for a little fluid. They say Dodge is a wicked, sinful city. Who
am I to deprive it o' lawful trade? If they's anybody else wants
to liquefy, le's go swell the population."</p>

<p>San Saba was still immersed in the shadows&mdash;a place he
always liked to be. But he challenged Quagmire with just two
words, these seeming to crack over the fire like a lash. "Stay
put."</p>

<p>Quagmire stared at the fire a long while, features coming to a
point. Replying, he threw his words over one shoulder. "Now, who
said so?"</p>

<p>"Orders," droned San Saba. "Trouble on the trail. They's
others drivin' north asides us."</p>

<p>"Man&mdash;few o' years and full o' trouble," murmured
Quagmire. "A wise hombre issued that remark."</p>

<p>Conversation lagged. The early to bed rolled in their blankets
and slept Quagmire edged nearer the fire and began poking at it
with a stem of sage. Once, when his eyes met those of another
across the blaze, there was a point of flame in them. Just for a
moment it was so; his chin dropped, and he traced an endless
pattern in the glowing ashes.</p>

<p>The moon, full and bright, swung down from the sky as a silver
pendulum. Major Bob Gillette trotted across the swelling prairie
with the carriage of a cavalryman on patrol. To his right hand
the river lay against the shadows like a shining ribbon. Ahead
winked the lights of Dodge; ahead was the stench of Dodge and its
buffalo hides. Major Bob passed a scattering of corrals, followed
a trail into the dim clutter of buildings on the south side of
town, and crossed the tracks. Turning, he rode down a dusty
street a-swirl with life, a street across which fell yellow
patterns of light from the building windows. These buildings
marched beside the street sagging and rising with it as it took
its ungraded course through the town; they were, for the most
part, bolstered up with a peaked or square false front as if
conscious that their rickety substance needed some prop of
dignity. A board sidewalk, treacherous to the high boot heel,
undulated between street and buildings. Hitching racks were
crowded with drooping ponies. A freighter lumbered by the Major,
bull whip snapping; saloon lights were bright and alluring,
pianos jingled. A woman screamed, a gun cracked, yet the men
passing and repassing on the walk paid no attention. Life flowed
here in a narrow and boisterous stream.</p>

<p>Major Bob Gillette wheeled, nosed the pony to a hitching rack,
and for a moment studied his surroundings with a kind of grim-
lipped pleasure. Then, dropping to the ground, he threw over the
reins and marched into the Dodge House, confronting the clerk
there with a short and clipped question.</p>

<p>"Is my son, Tom Gillette, here?"</p>

<p>The clerk's thumb pointed upward. "Room two. Been here a
week."</p>

<p>Major Bob climbed the stairs and walked down the bleak hall to
where he saw a crack of light seeping through a keyhole. And here
he stopped, for the moment seeming to hesitate. It was quite a
queer proceeding for one who was so forward and abrupt of manner,
yet he actually appeared to dislike his mission, and he stood in
the darkness and scowled, breath coming a little hard. In the end
he turned the knob without warning, walked into the room and
faced his son.</p>

<p>Tom Gillette had been reading, feet hooked on the table top.
The unannounced entry of his father caused him to look up
swiftly&mdash;and thus they met each other after five years of
separation, two men of the same flesh and blood who over so long
a time had been nearly a continent apart. Obviously, they were
cut in the same pattern, for upon Tom Gillette there was the
tribal stamp&mdash;the same big-boned frame, the same wide,
deeply set eyes, the same cast of gravity. Still, there was a
difference: the difference of thirty years' rough and tumble
against the difference of five years' Eastern training. To Major
Bob there was a certain softness in his son. His sharp eyes saw
it immediately, before a word had been passed, and the fear that
had been in him through the day grew more oppressive.</p>

<p>He was a man short of speech, he had no way of expressing what
rose in him. So he spoke crisply and casually, as if his son had
been away but a week. "Got in ahead of me, I see."</p>

<p>Tom laid away the book, marking the page. And the old man's
heart lightened a little when he recognized that methodical
Gillette trait. "Yes," said Tom, "I've been here since last
Sunday. Didn't want to hold up the herd."</p>

<p>"We travel slow," replied Major Bob. "Don't wish to run off
any more tallow than I can help."</p>

<p>Tom stood up, and the Major inspected him top and bottom as he
would have inspected a horse. Good heavy muscles, fine shoulders,
and a neck that coupled short. The boy had a broad barrel on him
too, and he planted his feet on the floor as if he meant to take
root. All these points showed through the ridiculous worsted suit
that passed as fashion in the East: that suit with its short
lapels, its white collar, and four-in-hand tie. Nor did the
Major's eyes miss the low, flat-heeled shoes. Impractical dam'
things.</p>

<p>There was a trace of humour in Tom Gillette's eyes as he stood
there. "Pass muster?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" answered Major Bob. "Turn to the light.
You've lost your accent."</p>

<p>"It will come back. A month with the boys and I'll have it
again."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," grunted Major Bob, studying Tom's face by
the lamplight. The boy had left him immature, unformed. Well, he
was a man now. He had been shaken down, he had filled out. He had
a bearing, an element men would recognize and obey. That was his
birthright. But what was in his head? How sound was his wind, how
clear his eye? What did he think? The Major was almost afraid to
ask, and he felt relieved when Tom, seeming to catch these
unspoken queries, broke the pause.</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"Moving north," replied Major Bob. "Dakota Territory's been
opened farther west. Free grass. Indians put on the reservation.
We can't flesh up a cow in Texas, and the fever's been bothering
us. Better grazing north and a better access to the market. So we
are going, the Circle G, lock, stock, and barrel."</p>

<p>"The old home no more, eh? Kind of hate to think what's being
left behind."</p>

<p>Major Bob heard the slight accent of wistfulness, and his
fears rose afresh. There was no place for softness in a Gillette.
He said so, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Dam' sentiment. You will get no place with that in this land,
my boy. I was afraid the East would soften you. I told your
mother as much. But she would have you go. Might as well be
honest with you&mdash;I'd have yanked you back as quick as a
flash when she died, but she took my promise to let you finish.
Understand it&mdash;you have nothing to thank me for. Your
freedom was her doing."</p>

<p>Tom sombrely studied the floor. "That I know. I'll give her
credit for whatever I have learned."</p>

<p>"And what have you learned?" challenged the elder
Gillette.</p>

<p>Again a flicker of humour. "Among other things that the West
will do for me as long as I live."</p>

<p>Major Bob was too old a poker player to reveal the pleasure
that remark gave him. He only nodded, and pressed his
questioning. "What else?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I think I can say Eastern whisky is better than
Western, and that the no-horn saddle makes a poor rocking-
chair."</p>

<p>Trivialities. There was more than this, but the boy had not
developed into a loose-jointed talker. He buried his thoughts,
for which the Major was exceedingly thankful. Then and there a
part of his doubt vanished. And yet, being a shrewd judge, he
also understood the younger man had something on his mind.
Something lay cloudy behind the eyes. And thereupon he came
directly to the issue.</p>

<p>"You've had your woman affairs? Got your fingers burnt? Made
the usual fool of yourself&mdash;like all men must?"</p>

<p>Tom squared his shoulders at this and spoke with laconic
definiteness. "Reckon that's gospel."</p>

<p>"Over with now?"</p>

<p>"As much as anything on earth can be over with."</p>

<p>Still vague. Major Bob bristled. "You have left no broken
promises behind you, my boy?"</p>

<p>Silence. Silence in which Major Bob's breathing could be heard
plainly. Tom swung, one hand lying open. "I think not."</p>

<p>Major Bob came forward. "My son," said he, very solemn, "if I
thought you had dishonoured any pledge of yours I would break you
into bits and send you back."</p>

<p>"I made a promise," explained Tom, a kind of sudden fire in
his eyes. "It was accepted. Later it was rejected. I'll say no
more. Wouldn't have said this much except to satisfy you. Judge
for yourself."</p>

<p>"Then your obligation is cancelled," decided the Major with
something like eagerness. He turned half away, sighing like one
whose breath had been held over-long. And to cover what was
perilously close to sentiment he relapsed into casualness.
"Expected I might have had to hunt through town for you."</p>

<p>"Thought maybe I'd be down with my paint bucket?"</p>

<p>The Major raised and lowered his broad shoulders.
Unconsciously he exposed the main beam of his career&mdash;a
career marked by turbulence. "You will never find life up in a
hotel room, my boy. It's out there," and he pointed his fist
toward the street.</p>

<p>"Shoulder to shoulder, fist to fist," mused Tom. "Play your
own hand, ask no favours, ride straight, shoot fast. Keep all
obligations."</p>

<p>The Major nodded; a stray beam of light caught his eyes and
kindled. "You have learned to express yourself well. Glad to know
that. What you have said is all I ever tried to teach you. That
you still abide by the code is my greatest pleasure. I had feared
you would forget&mdash;that you would absorb ideas less worthy of
a Southern gentleman. I will not preach&mdash;God hates a smooth
tongue&mdash;but you must see the distinction between sections.
The East is settled, it is orderly, it is governed by women's
ideas. This is still a man's country. Make no mistake about
that."</p>

<p>Tom bent his head. His father had struck to the core of the
whole matter; had touched, unwittingly, the fear and the
uncertainty within him. For he had departed from Texas with one
set of ideas; in a quieter and more staid Eastern land he had
discovered another. They set a value on human life there, they
guarded it with jealous laws. Softness, his father called
it&mdash;and softness it might be. This country to which he
returned was a prodigal land, and five years had almost made an
alien of him. What would he do when the time came for him to
choose between codes?</p>

<p>His father's summary phrases recalled him. "We roll out in the
morning. This will be your last night on a bed."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Might as well sleep on the ground
tonight." He moved to his Gladstone and took out a roll of
clothes. Stripping off his suit he got into an ancient wool
shirt, faded trousers, boots, vest, and a battered felt hat. It
was the apparel he had worn out of Texas five years before. The
Major, recognizing this, blew a great blast of air from his
nose.</p>

<p>"Saved 'em, I see. Small for you now." Then he moved forward
and unbuckled his revolver belt, holding it out to his son with
an ill-concealed pride. "You'll be needing this again. It is your
old gun. Brought it up for you."</p>

<p>Tom strapped the harness around him; his fingers touched the
cold butt, and again he had the fleeting and unpleasant sensation
of being alien. It seemed impossible he once had cherished the
weapon with a fiery affection and shot pecan nuts off the trees
in practice. He wondered suddenly whether he had lost the trick
of swinging low and making a moving shield of his pony while
firing under the animal's neck. Once he had been like an
Indian.</p>

<p>He laid his new suit on the bed, smiling a little. "The next
man may need it. I never will. Now, when I round up a maverick
we'll be ready to travel."</p>

<p>The hallway resounded with some kind of a cry, the door flew
open, and a burly young giant, larger than either of the
Gillettes, rolled into the room shaking a shining yellow head. He
was a pink and roly-poly Hercules, irrepressible and drunk. The
love of life shone on his round, bold face, and exuberance
babbled off his tongue. "Ha&mdash;wassis, Deerslayer? Dam' awful
liquor ever I drank! What a night! Tom, my rebel, now I know what
made you such a screamin' savage. Whooey! Drop that gun, Jack
Cade, or I'll pierce you with a needle! What was that song you
taught me?</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"But the dirty little coward that shot Mister Howard<br>
Laid poor Jesse in his grave."</p>

<br>

<p>"Sad&mdash;awful sad." Then, seeing Major Bob standing
immovable in his path he drew up and regained a measure of
gravity. "Let's see. I haven't got to the double-sight stage yet,
so you must be the old man. Pater, in other words. Well, you
certainly sired a tough piece of beefsteak for a son. I'm
delighted. Maybe you don't know it yet, but you've hired another
cow hand. Love cows. Lord, yes! Love 'em still more if I could
get another drink down without fryin' the linin' of my stomach.
How, Pontiac, announce me!"</p>

<p>Tom Gillette nodded. "It's the Blond Giant," he explained to
the elder Gillette. "True name is Claude Lispenard. Blondy, this
is my father, Major Robert Gillette."</p>

<p>"Don't hold the first name against me," adjured the Blond
Giant. His big hand struck the Major across one shoulder. It was
fraternally meant, but Major Bob straightened like a ramrod. It
was not the custom of the country to be over friendly at first,
and the Major had all the Western dislike for loose-tongued
liberties. His steely silence further sobered the Blond Giant. He
stood his place, hands dangling helplessly.</p>

<p>"A friend of yours, Tom?" inquired Major Bob.</p>

<p>"One of my best," replied Tom. "But in certain respects he is
as weak as water. I have brought him west to buck him up." And
with the bluntness of long acquaintance he added, "He's made
God's own fool of himself. Three months on the trail is the
cure."</p>

<p>The Major extended his hand. "A friend of my son is a friend
of mine. You are welcome to a place with us."</p>

<p>The Blond Giant took the hand somewhat sheepishly. Tom broke
the silence. "Get your possibles. We are going to camp."</p>

<p>Lispenard found his bag, the meanwhile looking to his friend.
"Not taking yours?"</p>

<p>Tom Gillette shook his head. "I'll never need it again. We
pack our stuff inside the blanket roll."</p>

<p>"Well," grumbled the Blond Giant, "I'll stick to my Gladstone.
Be some time before I can go without soap and water or part my
hair with thumb and forefinger."</p>

<p>The Major thrust a single glance at his son&mdash;a somewhat
grim glance&mdash;and he led the way out. Passing into the
street, Tom pointed toward a saloon. "We'll christen the
occasion, sir." Lispenard muttered a small oath and followed the
Gillettes into the place. Together they elbowed to the bar and
ordered drinks.</p>

<p>The place roared. Smoke eddied up from the crowd and hung like
a storm signal against the ceiling. The gaming tables were
crowded, chips rattled; a piano strove to carry its thin melody
above the racket, and lights flashed brilliantly on the tinselled
costumes of the girls. One of them was singing, and toward her
the crowd restlessly eddied&mdash;cowboy and buffalo hunter,
railroad hand, desperado and trapper. Lispenard's animation
revived at the sight of it, and he lifted his glass with the
Gillettes. "I give you Westerners credit. You do it
well&mdash;dam' well."</p>

<p>Tom spoke across the rim of his pony. "The prodigal returns,
sir."</p>

<p>Major Bob studied the red fluid. And it could only have been
his relief that caused him to speak as he did.</p>

<p>"My boy, I didn't know whether I would find a son this night
or not. I think I have. We will drink to the Circle G."</p>

<p>The screaming of a woman cut through the turmoil like a knife.
Men swayed and backed against the walls. Tables went down, and
across the smoky lane thus formed another tragedy of Dodge
marched to its swift climax. Lispenard dropped his glass and
gripped the bar. "My God!"</p>

<p>Two men faced each other, each bent, each weaving; their
features seemed out of proportion. White teeth gleamed against an
olive skin, sweat beaded across a narrow forehead, glistening
like crystals. Somebody's breath rose and fell asthmatically.
There was a grunted word and another swift and slashing
word&mdash;and in the light the opposing duellists seemed to blur
and merge. Again a scream shrilled throughout the house, striking
Tom Gillette's heart cold. It rose to an unearthly pitch, then
was drowned by the echo of a gun thundering and crashing against
the four walls. Nobody moved, nobody seemed to breathe. But
presently the man of the olive skin hiccoughed and fell. The lane
began to close; through it the victor fought his way, hatless,
wild of eye, waving his gun. In a moment he had passed out of the
place, and the drumming of his pony's hoofs beat down the street
and grew faint. Bedlam rose, like air rushing into a vacuum.</p>

<p>"Good God!" muttered Lispenard. He turned to the Gillettes,
the ruddy colour quite drained from his cheeks. "That turns my
stomach. Why don't they do something? Why don't they go after the
fellow? Everybody standing around like a lot of stone
images!"</p>

<p>Major Bob ignored him completely. He raised his unfinished
glass, speaking to his son in the same grave and courteous
manner. "To the Circle G." And while Lispenard stared, shaken to
his depths, they drank. At that moment father and son never
looked so much alike, both with a hard granite impassivity
printed from cheek bone to cheek bone; the kind of an expression
made with muscles tightly set. Meeting Tom's eyes, Lispenard was
shocked to see the bleakness therein. It was as if he faced a
complete stranger.</p>

<p>"We had better be going," said Major Bob.</p>

<p>The trio marched out and back to the Major's horse. He swung
up and turned into the street. "I will go ahead. The camp is a
mile beyond the corrals. Doubtless you will want to explain a few
things to your friend."</p>

<p>This last sentence had no meaning to Lispenard, but Tom nodded
soberly. "I will do it."</p>

<p>The two of them walked away from Dodge, past the corrals, and
along the rolling prairie. To their left lay the river; above
them swung the full disk of silver. Lispenard breathed heavily,
and the scene in the saloon oppressed him until he could no
longer hold his peace. "And you all took it so cursed cold! I
begin to see the meaning of that flint and ice look you sometimes
wear. The whole set of you put it on like a mask."</p>

<p>"Blondy, let me give you a single piece of advice. In this
country, never give yourself away. Play poker with a blank face.
Never tell a man anything about yourself, never ask him about
himself. And no matter how you are hurt, never reveal it to a
living creature."</p>

<p>"By the Lord, I'm not made of stone!" cried Lispenard.</p>

<p>"No," agreed Tom. "None of us are. But hereabouts men must
carry themselves as if they were. Once a fellow started crying
about his hurts he would never quit. This is a rough country.
Nobody wants to hear about your feelings."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that that murder left you cold?"
demanded the Blond Giant.</p>

<p>Tom travelled fifty yards without replying. Of course it
hadn't left him cold. It had cut him to the very marrow and again
made him seem an alien. And not long ago he would have confessed
it to Lispenard. But somehow he no longer felt inclined to the
old exchange of confidences. He was going back to the old ways
already, beginning to judge once more by the standards of the
country. And according to those standards the Blond Giant had ill
conducted himself.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference at all," said he, seeing the chuck-
wagon fire ahead, "what a man feels. Somehow, when you get under
the stars, it isn't important."</p>

<p>Lispenard fell to silence as they approached the light. Major
Bob stood by the fire, around which the punchers were assembled.
He had summoned them, and as his son came into view he spoke
briefly, abruptly.</p>

<p>"This is Tom Gillette, my son. He rides with us. He asks no
favours, he will receive none. If anybody wishes to challenge his
mettle, that's not my affair. The other gentleman's name is
Lispenard, a pilgrim and a guest of the outfit. San Saba!"</p>

<p>Tom swept the circle with a curious eye. None of these men had
been with the Circle G in his time. It was a hard brand to work
for, and the riders came and disappeared in quick succession. But
he instantly recognized the calibre of the crew. His father
picked only the best. Tall and short, lean and heavy&mdash;they
were of all descriptions, yet they all fell into one type.</p>

<p>The Major's voice plunged into the darkness. "San Saba!"</p>

<p>"Comin', suh."</p>

<p>The Major meanwhile pointed to Lispenard. "I will tolerate no
hazing with this gentleman. He is a guest. Remember that."</p>

<p>San Saba crawled reluctantly from the shadows, and Tom
Gillette, seeing him for the first time, felt his muscles draw
up. The man was as tall as any in the outfit and distinctly
rawboned. His arms were gangling and hung to his sides as if
useless to him; he slouched toward the group with his head tilted
forward. It was a head too small for his body and indeed all his
features seemed shrunken, from his narrow chin up to his sloping
forehead which in turn slid back into sandy red hair. Tom
Gillette thought he never had seen a more cruel mouth or such
gimlet eyes. The colour of them he could not tell, but a reddish
pall seemed to hang over the surface, and the lids were likewise
rimmed with the same colour.</p>

<p>"This," said Major Bob, "is my foreman, San Saba."</p>

<p>San Saba met Tom Gillette with a hurried, expressionless
glance and dropped his head in scant recognition. Nor did he
offer his hand until Tom first extended his own. Then there was
only a slight pressure and a quick withdrawal.</p>

<p>"Han'somely pleased," drawled San Saba in flat, monotonous
syllables. That was all; he backed away and was lost in the
shadows. Major Bob disappeared from view and then most of the
crew returned to their blankets. The introduction was over. Tom
and Lispenard squatted before the flames, hearing Quagmire's
rumbling voice take up some yarn he had been spinning.</p>

<p>"So them greasers staked me out on the ant hill an' let the
bugs get a good feed. I was there twelve hours when the Rangers
come up. We caught them renegades later, an' I skelped me the
cuss what tied me down."</p>

<p>Lispenard was sober and morose. He stared at Quagmire, then
spoke to Tom in a tone meant to carry across the fire.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll be hearing all sorts of fool fish stories from
now on. Do I look green?"</p>

<p>Quagmire appeared not to hear. But presently he swung his head
a little, and the light played upon the left side of his face; it
was nothing but a great pocket where some injury had scored him.
Lispenard sprang to his feet, swearing. "Where do we sleep? My
nerves certainly must be in a hell of a state."</p>

<p>The colored cook met them on the edge of the shadows, throwing
two bedding rolls from his massive shoulders. He had no attention
for Lispenard, but one fist gripped the younger Gillette's arm.
"Marse Tom, yo' don' know me no mo'?"</p>

<p>Tom's voice sang upward. "Why, Old Mose! You ornery
rascal&mdash;I've been wondering about you! Mose, remember the
time we trapped the bear in the caves?"</p>

<p>The Negro's head bobbed like a cork in water. "Ya-as, ya-as. I
been waitin' fo' yo', Marse Tom. Sho' seemed like a mighty long
spell. I'll sho' see yo' coffee cup am allus full. Sho'!"</p>

<p>Quagmire watched and listened. And when the two newcomers had
faded into the darkness he spoke cryptically, announcing his
conviction as to them. "One range hoss come back to the old
stampin' grounds. Once a man gets the smell o' fire smoke in his
nose it's hard to stay away. But as fo' sugar-fed pets, half
broke, half wild, I nev' had any likin'. Man, short o' days an'
full o' trouble."</p>

<p>The fire died to a golden glow. The camp settled to rest save
for Quagmire, who was a notorious nighthawk. His thin and
brooding face peered into the ashes as if seeking the mystery of
creation there. Overhead the moon swung on its vast arc. Tom,
once more sleeping under the stars, felt again the throb of the
universe. It came to him out of the fathomless vault, it bore up
on the night wind. He felt the presence of the herd, he made out
the mutter and the snuffle of the animals on their bedding
ground. The tuneless drone of the punchers on circle wavered up
from the distance. A match flared, and he saw a face illumined
for one moment. Again the drone:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"He was only a cowboy, gone on befo',<br>
He was only a cowboy we'll see no mo'..."</p>

<br>

<p>Lispenard turned on his blankets and muttered an irritable
question. Tom never heard it. Five years he had been away from
all this. Now he was back home. Back home! Why had he expected to
be a stranger in his own land? The old life, the old sounds and
smells, the old mystery of it returned to him as if he never had
been away. The current picked him up and carried him on. Near the
border of sleep he seemed to see San Saba's little red eyes
staring at him out of the shadows.


<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>2. ON THE TRAIL</h2>

<p class="first">IT was yet starlight when Old Mose, drumming his
knuckles against a wash pan, sang out reveille. "Arise, yo' sons
o' sin! Mo'nin' comes, the sun will shine, an' the little dogies
am ready fo' to go! Rise to beans an' biscuits!"</p>

<p>One by one the Circle G riders shook out their blankets,
rolled bedding, and helped themselves to breakfast. Fog hung low
over the ground; the damp sage rendered up its pungent smell.
Already the cattle were stirring and the nighthawk was in with
the cavvy. It was no time for lagging, no time for talk. Men
drank their coffee in morose silence and went to the improvised
rope corral for their ponies. Sharp profanity crackled in the
cold air, loops whistled, dust rose; saddle gear jingled and
squeaked, the horses crowhopped under their riders&mdash;and the
day's work began.</p>

<p>Tom found his old saddle in the supply wagon and lugged it to
the corral, shaking out his rope. Major Bob, already mounted,
came up. "I brought an extra string for you, Tom. Catfish,
there&mdash;Slit Ears&mdash;the Lawyer&mdash;the buckskin with
the straight belly&mdash;that leggy roan. We had no time to do
more than to break 'em rough. They'll carry you if you haven't
forgotten how to ride."</p>

<p>Tom picked the buckskin with the straight belly, roped him and
led him aside. The crew had scattered, but Tom, tightening his
cinches, saw them covertly watching, and he grinned wryly. He
stepped a foot in one stirrup, flipped over the reins, and was in
the saddle. The buckskin's muscles quivered, snapped together.
Tom felt the pony's back hump; and as the animal's head dropped
forward he was swept by the old emotion of wild, half-savage joy.
"Pitch, you crowbait, pitch, or I'll rake hide!"</p>

<p>He was carried fifty yards in a series of weaving,
necksnapping jumps. Dust obscured him, the earth disappeared,
leaving him high and lonesome in his seat. He weaved like a
drunken man, hearing himself yell. That yell came back to
him&mdash;it was Quagmire's bullfrog croak. The buckskin wound
itself into a last wicked bundle of knots, lurching sidewise,
always sidewise to loosen and throw the rider off balance. Trip
hammers pounded on Tom's skull, the pit of his stomach was a ball
of fire. Then it was over and the buckskin swept across the
prairie like the wind. Tom shook himself together and assembled
his grin. "What a man learns, he never forgets. You old
sidewinder, you're going to be a spunky horse. Swing around
now."</p>

<p>When he got back to the chuck wagon Major Bob had only a
silent nod for him. Tom spoke laconically, unconsciously falling
into the old way of speech with its slurring softness. "Reckon
he'll be tole'ble."</p>

<p>Lispenard had switched into more appropriate
clothes&mdash;bought in Dodge&mdash;and stood watching Quagmire
saddling another horse. The aftermath of his celebration in town
was a fretful humour. He shook his shoulders, grumbling, "Here I
am, dressed like Simon Legree. Now I suppose I'll have to board
that vicious rack of bones and get my neck shook off."</p>

<p>Major Bob looked sharply at Lispenard, yet spoke with unusual
courtesy&mdash;always a sign that he struggled with his temper.
"You are a guest of the outfit, sir. Be assured. Quagmire is
saddling the gentlest beast. If you were a rider, like my son,
you would have to take your chances. In this country we don't
break horses for other men. I will permit no hazing with
you."</p>

<p>Lispenard walked slowly toward Quagmire. "I'd feel better
about it if I had a drink. It's a hell of an animal to be called
gentle."</p>

<p>The pony was an undersized brute, coloured like grandmother's
blanket. It turned a scrawny neck and looked at Lispenard from
two expressionless glass-green eyes, dropping one ear. The man
rubbed his hands along his pants. "Never think a horse has no
brain. That creature is openly sneering at me."</p>

<p>Quagmire cast a glance back at the Gillettes. As he gave over
the reins he whispered sibilantly, "Don't like the way he holds
his ears. Plumb bad sign. If he starts groanin' like a los' soul,
you pile off hell bent fo' election. It means he's des'prit."</p>

<p>Lispenard scanned Quagmire's face. Nothing but solicitude and
benevolence appeared on the puncher's warped features. The Blond
Giant said, "Oh, well, here goes," and stepped gingerly into the
saddle, holding the reins with one hand and clutching the horn
with the other. Quagmire backed hurriedly off as if expecting
trouble. The glass-eyed calico stood with his eyes to the earth
like a bemused philosopher for a moment, then gave vent to a
long, dreary sigh. His rider clawed at the saddle horn and struck
the ground on all fours. The horse turned a puzzled face, moving
not an inch.</p>

<p>Quagmire's countenance was as bland as a summer sky. In the
distance one of the crew bent over, seemingly having trouble with
his stomach. Major Bob spoke in a silken voice. "Quagmire, get
out of here! Mister Lispenard, that horse stopped pitching twelve
years back."</p>

<p>Lispenard muttered something and mounted again. Riding past
Quagmire he gave the man a cold look. "Dam' funny, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>But Quagmire only shook his head. "Nev' trust a
hoss&mdash;nev' trust a stranger's word," was his answer. And he
rode away.</p>

<p>Tom galloped toward the herd with the Blond Giant in pursuit.
The Circle G riders had spread out, making a long line on either
side of the herd; the wagons were moving on. Major Bob, far to
one flank, raised his hat and dipped it. Swing and drag riders
pressed against the fringes of the herd. It moved, imperceptibly
at first but with gaining momentum, stretching into a long,
irregular, formless mass. The drive was on.</p>

<p>Tom stood aside until the tail end of the procession passed,
then fell in with the drag&mdash;those riders who ranged to the
rear and kept the slower or more stubborn animals from straying.
The sun rose out of the east all in splendour, the prairie stood
forth in the clear morning's light, rolling league after league
to the horizons. Dust curled against the sky, dust choked the
drag. Bandanas were raised over faces; the day grew warm.</p>

<p>"Now watch, Blondy," said Tom. "Watch all this. It's a sight
you never saw the like of before. By Godfrey, it's a
picture."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a drink," replied Lispenard fretfully.</p>

<p>It was a picture&mdash;a picture flung prodigally across a
sweeping canvas. Twenty-five hundred Texas cattle stretched in a
long, sinuous line, dipping and rising with the ground, flowing
onward at a steady yet apparently aimless pace; gaunt kine with
big eyes and enormous horns that clacked tip to tip as they
collided; here and there pausing to find a clump of grass; now
and then bunching up and widening until the swing men closed in
and pinched the line narrow again. Moving thus onward across a
Kansas prairie green with grass newly born of the warm April
rains and the warm April sun, across a prairie seemingly as
boundless, as vast as the sea.</p>

<p>Quagmire sidled up, nothing showing above the bandana but his
shrewd eyes. "They was spooky brutes when we lef Menard. Tell a
man. We walked 'em plum' hard till they got out o' the idee. Now
ain't they trail-broke?"</p>

<p>Tom pointed to a brick-red steer that travelled as far out on
the flank as it could get, tossing enormous horns into the air at
every step. "There's a trouble maker."</p>

<p>"It's Jedge Lynch," said Quagmire. "He ain't got but one eye,
so he keeps out where he can see the rest o' the herd. Shore he's
a trouble maker. Spooky to boot. He'll raise hell sometime. Ort
to be shot." Then, spacing his words farther apart and looking
directly into Tom's eyes, he added, "You'll find more'n one
trouble maker on this drive." He swung about and dropped to the
rear, leaving Tom thoughtful. Quagmire was an old head, a wise
head. And after the custom of the country he often cloaked shrewd
sentiments in seemingly guileless words.</p>

<p>"Funny face," grunted Lispenard. "He's certainly got a stale
sense of humour."</p>

<p>Tom pointed his pony out of the dust and motioned to the Blond
Giant. Together they rode past the swing men and galloped toward
the head of the column which was now dipping from view. In the
remote distance squatted a sod shanty; elsewhere the land seemed
tenantless, left to the wild creatures that crawled or ran. The
smiling sun struck the earth with the first hot rays of the
season, the sky was azure, and afar to the left a string of hills
stood clearly silhouetted.</p>

<p>"So this is the country you've bragged about for five years,"
muttered Lispenard. "Well, if I had to live in it I'd go
crazy."</p>

<p>"Not unless you were crazy to begin with," said Tom. "Buck up,
amigo. You'll feel better when the headache wears away. Didn't I
tell you Western whiskey was poison for the uninitiated?"</p>

<p>"Mean to tell me," demanded Lispenard, "you actually like this
desolation?"</p>

<p>Tom turned, vehement phrases forming on his tongue. But he
could not express them. This man, once his bosom friend, was
becoming strange to him. The barriers were up. So he contented
himself with saying, "I'm just beginning to live," and put his
horse to a faster pace. A jack shot out of their path as they
fell over a roll of land and came upon Major Bob and San Saba
riding side by side. Point men were ahead, not directly in front
of the herd, but flanking it. Thus being unknowingly guided, the
bovine vanguard ambled along. At the fore was an ancient and
scarred steer with a broken horn who seemed to understand he led
the parade. Major Bob pointed him out to Tom.</p>

<p>"Roman Nose. He took charge of this drive the third day out.
That steer is as valuable to us as three top hands."</p>

<p>Tom fell in with his father. San Saba dropped back a little
and thus paired with Lispenard. By daylight the foreman seemed
even more taciturn and ill-proportioned; Tom was again struck
with the incongruity of so small a head on so tall a body. It
reminded him of a ball set atop a flagpole. Looking back, he met
San Saba's eyes and nodded. But there was no response other than
a short, impassive glance from those little red-rimmed eyes. No
more than that, and the foreman had turned, ignoring him. Tom
heard the man's dry voice questioning Lispenard beside him.</p>

<p>"Hope, suh, yo' are findin' it pleasant?"</p>

<p>"Me?" grunted Lispenard. "I feel like an empty wine vat. When
did prohibition hit Kansas?"</p>

<p>Again the foreman's laconic drawl. "Don't let the boys fool
yo' with their antics. Any time I can he'p yo', let me know."</p>

<p>It was apparent that San Saba made an effort to be friendly.
Tom thought about it awhile, then turned to a more important
matter.</p>

<p>"Any particular spot in Dakota we are heading for? Or is it
just a matter of discovery?"</p>

<p>The Major shook his head. "Last year news reached us that some
territory around the headwaters of the Little Missouri was
opening. I may say I got first word of it and immediately sent
San Saba and Big Ruddy up to locate suitable range. Owing to our
promptness, we have got the best of the ground. San Saba came
back, leaving Big Ruddy to hold it. Since then other outfits have
likewise sent scouts out and are driving north. But ours is the
choice of the picking."</p>

<p>San Saba, hearing his name mentioned, swept the pair of
Gillettes with a quick, wry glance.</p>

<p>"Can Big Ruddy hold it?" questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"Squatter's right," answered the Major. "It's free grass, but
I shall file on the water. Meanwhile Big Ruddy has ample
cartridges and a good gun. I have faith no one will try to jump
the claim on him. However, I started early to avoid trouble in
the matter. I believe we are the first outfit north this
season."</p>

<p>Satisfied, Tom reined about and walked his horse down the
line. Lispenard was talking to San Saba and didn't follow.</p>

<p>Onward they travelled. North, always north. Sunrise and
sunset. Beans and coffee in the starlight. Night after night with
the infinite heavens for a canopy and the yellow firelight
playing upon Quagmire's twisted, solemn visage. Twenty-five
hundred cattle trampling a broad trail across the lush earth,
Roman Nose plodding to the fore, wise with years. Hot sun beating
down; swift spring rains pouring out of the sky, flooding the
coulees and vanishing as quickly as they came. And again the hot
sun playing on the wet prairie and the steam rising up. Five
miles a day, eight miles a day, sometimes fifteen miles a day.
They crossed the ford of the Smoky Hill, they crossed the Saline
and the Solomon. Kansas was behind, and the plains of Nebraska
beckoned them north&mdash;level, limitless.</p>

<p>Lispenard settled into the life with a kind of resignation.
Riding pulled some of the flesh off him, the dust and hot winds
erased his ruddiness. And since shaving in alkali water was no
less than torture he let the stubble flourish on his face. When
well kept he was nothing short of handsome; now he seemed all at
once slack and untidy. The long hours in the saddle, the short
sleep, the never-ending monotony of the food bore heavily on his
spirit. Now and again a flash of his humour bubbled up, but
rubbing elbows day by day with the tight-lipped stoics of the
Circle G frayed his nerves and left him grumbling. He had not
learned to lock his lips as others did.</p>

<p>"How long is it going to take us to reach Dakota?" he asked,
one night.</p>

<p>Tom spread his palms upward. "Twenty days&mdash;forty
days&mdash;sixty days."</p>

<p>"And not a drop to drink," murmured Lispenard. He scanned the
circle with gloomy eyes. "I begin to understand what makes you
fellows look like mummies. A drop of liquid would bloat the whole
crew."</p>

<p>Quagmire stirred the fire. "Once was a fella down on the
Brazos by name of Dode Leener who bragged he nev' had tasted
water. Nothin' but whisky. One o' the boys goes out, ketches a
rattlesnake, an' squirts a little venom into a cup, mixin' it
with a thimbleful o' water. Takes it to Dode an' says it's the
purest water in the state. Dode, he drinks it. By'n'by he sorter
perks up. 'Men,' says he, 'if that's water I shore been missin'
somethin' good all these years.' Nex' day he happens to ride
acrost the Brazos, an' rememberin' what a treat he'd had the day
before he squats down an' drinks his stummick full. Plain
water."</p>

<p>Silence pervaded the circle. Quagmire continued to prod the
ashes with his twig.</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Lispenard impatiently, "what happened
then?"</p>

<p>"He died," said Quagmire, voice breaking.</p>

<p>Lispenard threw up his head. Grave faces looked back at him.
San Saba stood on the edge of darkness, and San Saba's head
jerked a trifle. Lispenard waited a little while before rising
and going into the shadows. The assembled punchers sank back into
the blankets one by one. Presently he came back, a transformed
man. He was smiling broadly and his eyes rolled. Nobody paid him
attention as he went to the chuck wagon and drew the gun from a
suspended holster there. Of a sudden his voice yipped across the
silence, the gun crashed twice.</p>

<p>"All dam' lies! Anyhow, I know Kansas ain't dry yet!
Whoooopeeee!"</p>

<p>Tom sprang to his feet and knocked the gun out of Lispenard's
hand. Blankets flew through the air as every cowpuncher raced for
his horse. Out of the distance came an ominous rustle, a sound of
horns clicking and feet stamping. Major Bob ran into the light,
words lashing them all.</p>

<p>"Who drew that gun?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did," grumbled Lispenard, quickly sobered. "Wass
trouble?"</p>

<p>A steady stream of profanity droned and sputtered beyond the
fire. But a clear call stopped the feverish saddling. "All
right&mdash;all right. It's God's mercy they ain't spooky to-
night. Somebody give that gent a fire-cracker to play with."</p>

<p>Major Bob said never another word, but his glance went through
and through Lispenard. He swung on his heel and disappeared.</p>

<p>"It only takes the snap of a finger to stampede a herd when
they're restless," explained Tom briefly.</p>

<p>The crew returned. Lispenard went over and dropped the gun in
its holster. Tom, watching him, saw his arms wobble and knew then
what had caused the trouble. He raised his eyes to find San Saba
peering through the darkness, taciturn, unwinking, and at that
moment a chill shot down Tom Gillette's back and he felt the
hackles rise. San Saba disappeared.</p>

<p>It was on the following morning that Tom, high on a ridge, saw
a small herd of buffalo feeding quietly in the plain. Turning, he
raced down upon the outfit.</p>

<p>"Fresh meat," he called. "Buffalo boudins."</p>

<p>Major Bob slackened pace. "San Saba&mdash;Quagmire, go along.
Tom, better take Mr. Lispenard for the excitement."</p>

<p>The quartette assembled and galloped back up the ridge. "Hold
on," said Tom. "The wind's quartering away from us. We'll swing
into that ravine."</p>

<p>Doubling back, they crossed the ridge farther down and got
below the surface of the plain. Rifles came out of their boots.
Lispenard's eyes snapped. "What now?"</p>

<p>"Stick with me," adjured Tom. "We could bring down meat by
squatting here and taking a long shot. But it's your party, so
we'll ride among 'em. Stick with me. Pick a bull and follow him
down. Ready?"</p>

<p>The cavalcade gathered reins and shot out of the depression.
Three hundred yards off the buffalo grazed peacefully. But as the
hunters came to view their heads came up and immediately they
raced away. Quagmire's horse forged ahead. San Saba veered
slightly and lost some ground. Tom and Lispenard pounded on,
gathering up the interval. Quagmire was riding like an Indian,
and his pony flung itself directly into a breach of the herd. The
puncher's bull-frog voice roared across the prairie, and his
lithe body bent far in the saddle.</p>

<p>Lispenard seemed to find a road for himself, and Tom, aiming
at a piece of open ground, shot alongside a shaggy bull. He was,
of a sudden, in the midst of confusion, dust all about him. A
rifle cracked at his side, and he heard Quagmire yelling again.
Giving his pony loose rein, he brought up his gun and took a
fleeting aim. But he never pulled the trigger. Another shot sang
through the pounding, bellowing melee; his horse stumbled, went
down, heels over head. Tom, wrenching himself clear, fell ten
yards away. The herd roared by, sand sprayed in his face, and
though the wind was out of him, he tried to find his gun. In a
moment it was all over. Crawling to his feet, he saw the herd
galloping westward, Lispenard still in pursuit and losing ground.
Quagmire was coming back; San Saba had already dismounted and was
using his knife on a carcass.</p>

<p>"Gopher hole?" asked Quagmire, dropping from the saddle.</p>

<p>Tom stood by the dead horse. Blood welled out of a bullet hole
just above the shoulder, and Quagmire studied it with an
absolutely impassive countenance. After a time his shrewd eyes
rose, and it seemed to Tom that the heat of some internal fire
warmed them.</p>

<p>"Call it a stray shot," said Tom briefly. "The dust was
high."</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;call it that," agreed Quagmire. In a lower tone he
added, "I allus did say that one-eyed steer ort to be killed.
They's trouble makers enough in this outfit without him." And he
turned to skin his game. San Saba had nothing to say. Silently
they packed the choice meat in the hides and rode back to camp,
Tom doubling up behind Quagmire.</p>

<p>Five days later the Circle G lay on the north side of the
South Platte, camped outside of Ogallala. They were seventeen
days from Dodge, they had suffered no disaster, and now the
lights of a far-famed rendezvous beckoned. Half of the crew rode
in to see the sights, and foremost went San Saba and Lispenard.
Friendship of a kind had sprung up between them, and straight to
the first saloon they aimed. The Blond Giant, seizing the bottle
from the barkeep with swift eagerness, poured, saluting San
Saba.</p>

<p>"Now, my lad, do you remember the way to camp?"</p>

<p>San Saba nodded. "Reckon."</p>

<p>"Then don't forget it. When I finish here you'll have to carry
me back. Happy days! I'm blotting out two weeks of dry
misery!"</p>

<p>San Saba drank slowly, rolling the liquor around his tongue.
And with each subsequent glass his gravity increased and the red
pall in his eyes grew the more pronounced. He threw his shoulders
back, went through every motion with preciseness. As for
Lispenard, he was lost to these niceties. He swallowed the
whisky, pony after pony; his fist pounded the bar, his eyes
rolled and flashed wildly. San Saba studied him like a judge.
After a long interval he leaned forward, speaking
impressively.</p>

<p>"My mammy was a Kentucky belle. My pappy was a Virginny
kunnel."</p>

<p>"Let their bones rest," said the Blond Giant.</p>

<p>"Suh," proceeded San Saba, "I am the son of quality. And I
know quality when I see it. Yo' are like me, damnably like
me."</p>

<p>"We will christen that statement. San Saba, I see the devil
hidin' in your eyes. You're an unregenerate piece of humanity.
I'll bet you're the man that drank rattlesnake juice and liked
it."</p>

<p>San Saba's face relaxed and he smiled, a sparing smile that
never reached his eyes nor parted his thin lips. "I see yo' got a
little more intelligence than ordinary." And when he saw
Lispenard's head droop in weakness he said something more. "It
takes a dam' rascal to know another dam' rascal."</p>

<p>"Wha' that?"</p>

<p>San Saba shrugged his narrow shoulders, seeming to weigh his
partner. Casually, he looked about the room. Almost immediately
his attention was affixed to a far corner where a paunchy,
middle-aged man with dead white hair happened to be standing.
Their eyes met; the elderly man nodded his head, and San Saba,
glancing around to see if he was observed, returned the nod and
walked out of the saloon. At the next alley he paused, retreating
into the shadows. Presently the elder man marched out and
followed. San Saba's arm reached out and arrested him.</p>

<p>"Where's yo' camp, Kunnel Wyatt?"</p>

<p>"West three miles. San Saba, why the devil are you here? I
thought you agreed to keep Gillette back on the trail."</p>

<p>"Time enough yet. Go on, suh. My boys are in town. Don' want
any to see me with yo'. I'll follow yo' to camp."</p>

<p>They separated. San Saba returned to the saloon door.
Lispenard was in a poker game, in the process of being
professionally trimmed. San Saba went to his horse and, keeping
to the shadows, rode out of Ogallala westward.

<hr><h2><a name="ch3"></a>3. LORENA WYATT</h2>

<p class="first">TWICE during the short ride from town San Saba
swung off his trail, back-tracked a hundred yards, and listened
for the sound of pursuit; and when the chuck-wagon fire of the
Wyatt outfit winked across the prairie he again hesitated,
seeming to weigh his inclinations. Whatever this man's actions
and thoughts, he consistently surrounded himself with a wall of
caution. He liked to stay in the shadows; he never rode boldly
into a camp, but, as at present, stalked and circled until he was
sure of what he was to find. He possessed all the caginess of an
animal that once had been trapped&mdash;he perpetually looked
back over his trail, no matter where or when he rode. By nature
he was a taciturn, isolated creature, seldom speaking a blunt or
decisive word. He talked as he moved, warily, never giving
another man more than a hint of what went on in that little
nutshell head.</p>

<p>Thus, when a few paces from the firelight, he paused to scan
the faces he saw. He knew those fellows, he recognized Wyatt's
paunchy figure standing by the flame. But not until he had thus
covered the group did he expose himself to the light Wyatt threw
up his grizzled mane, speaking impatiently. "What took you so
long?" A scattered greeting rose from the recumbent punchers.</p>

<p>"It's San Saba, by Joe. Cornin' back fer to work this brand
again, Red?"</p>

<p>"Well, if it ain't the same smilin', sunny gent. Ain't yo'
pritty far no'th?"</p>

<p>There was little enough warmth in the reception. These men had
worked with San Saba, and they knew him. San Saba nodded his
head; a brief, sparing smile flitted across his lips. "Howdy,
boys. Diamond W looks both f'miliar an' prosp'rous. Kunnel Wyatt,
suh, if yo' will step away a minute..."</p>

<p>San Saba retreated beyond earshot of the crew and slipped from
the saddle. Wyatt followed, still impatient. "God's Kingdom, man,
will you ever quit burrowin' like a groundhog?"</p>

<p>San Saba's reply was flat, singsong. "A man playin' two hands
ain't in no position to march at the head o' the parade,
suh."</p>

<p>"Let it go&mdash;let it go. Hell's pit&mdash;what brings
Gillette along so fast? I had a hundred miles less to go, I
started a full week earlier. Yet here he is&mdash;here you are.
What about it?"</p>

<p>"Suh, Major Bob is a fast traveller."</p>

<p>"Meaning, I suppose, I let my cattle drag all over Satan's
half acre? By the beard o' Judas..."</p>

<p>"No, suh&mdash;no, suh. I meant nothin' like that. It's just
that he makes us march like a troop o' cavalry."</p>

<p>"It's his cursed military style! I've heard of it before.
Well, what are you doing? What about all those ideas you had? San
Saba, did I not know you better I would say you broke no eggs.
But I know you. Now, get busy. At this rate he'll beat me two
weeks to the Little Missouri. That won't do. By the gates of
Paradise, it won't do!"</p>

<p>"Yo'-all sent yo' men no'th to perfo'm a certain chore,
Kunnel?"</p>

<p>"I did!"</p>

<p>"Is that chore done?"</p>

<p>"How am I to know? Neither man can write a letter. I presume
they did. They understood exactly what I meant, and they're old
hands. Even so, supposing Gillette beats me to the spot and finds
my men on it where his men should be? Think he'll take it like a
Sunday-school preacher? I'll be eternally fried in mutton grease
if he will! He'll shoot my men and&mdash;there you are! I have
got to get there first! You start your part."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll delay the Circle G, suh. Don't worry. Plenty of time
yet. You know Major Bob, pers'n'lly, Kunnel?"</p>

<p>"Met him once in Austin."</p>

<p>"He's a hard man, suh. He has a son, suh." Here San Saba's
words grew drier. "A son like the name."</p>

<p>Wyatt grunted. "I recognize the qualities of the name. But
once I get my outfit established on that particular piece of
range St Peter's own crowbar won't pry me loose!" The Colonel
slapped his hands together, and by that token San Saba knew the
interview was over. Climbing into the saddle, he followed Wyatt
back to the circle of light. Somebody had been telling a yarn,
but it stopped as the Circle G foreman came within hearing, and
nothing more was said. San Saba appeared on the point of
speaking. Whatever the sentiment, it fell back from the barrier
of his thin, tight-pressed lips. Gathering his reins, he turned
about.</p>

<p>Hoofs thudded across the prairie. San Saba's head came up
quickly and he put a spur into the flanks of his animal. But
before he could get again into the concealment of the night a
rider slid in front of him, blocked his path, and he had to pull
aside. Colonel Wyatt planted his feet apart, grumbling.</p>

<p>"Lorena, where in the name of the Twelve Apostles have you
been?"</p>

<p>It was a girl&mdash;a girl on that vague border across which
lie womanhood. Her face, revealed by the reluctant firelight
formed a small oval; her cheeks were pink where the night air had
touched them, her eyes sparkled, catching flame from the chuck-
wagon blaze. And that was about all of the feminine about her,
for her small body was encased in the clothing of a man, she wore
a man's boots and a man's broad-brimmed hat, beneath which
strayed a wisp of black hair. The bright beads of her gauntlets
glittered as she sprang from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Why, I've been to Ogallala. Do you think I'd go through
Nebraska and not see Ogallala?" Then her eyes discovered and
recognized San Saba, and all the gay exuberance vanished.
Standing between her father and the Circle G foreman she turned
first to one and then the other.</p>

<p>"Now what's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Trouble?" echoed her father. "There's no trouble."</p>

<p>"Then what's this man doing here?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Why, San Saba, he dropped in to pay a friendly call."</p>

<p>Her boot heel sank into the sandy earth. "Friendly? What
friends has he got here?" And, turning toward San Saba, she threw
up her chin, crying, "Get out of here you&mdash;renegade."</p>

<p>Colonel Wyatt roared, "Lorena, you talk like a lady!"</p>

<p>"Pop, don't call me a lady. It sounds ridiculous. Get out, San
Saba!"</p>

<p>San Saba looked over her head to Wyatt. "One more thing, suh,"
spoke he in a level voice, "you better stay west of the trail a
few days. I reckon yo' understan' why." Removing his hat, he
bowed to the girl, swung, and galloped off.</p>

<p>"Notion to tan your back," grumbled Wyatt,</p>

<p>But Lorena was smiling again, smiling and humming a tune. She
turned out her horse, threw her saddle to the ground, and
prepared to climb inside the wagon that was her home on the long
trail. "Don't you try it, Pop," she called back. "You'd lose a
good cow hand&mdash;and you can't afford that. Good-night. I've
got some questions to ask in the morning."</p>

<p><br>By the light of the waning stars the Diamond W was under
way. It was an earlier start than Colonel Wyatt usually made. He,
despite his impatient spirit, had not the faculty of whipping his
men through the preliminary chores or of overriding the unending
series of petty obstacles always lying athwart a cattle drive.
Nor, for that matter, did he have enough men. Counting himself
and his daughter, there were but eight in the party. But the
interview with San Saba had warned him to be up and doing; thus,
sunrise found the herd well away from Ogallala and somewhat west
of the main trail. Colonel Wyatt and Lorena rode to the fore, on
point, while the rest of the crew were strung out behind.
Nineteen hundred cattle wound northward to Dakota's greener,
lusher grass.</p>

<p>From time to time Colonel Wyatt threw a covert glance across
the prairie toward his daughter. She was a splendid horsewoman,
her slight and supple figure swaying easily in the saddle; now
and then, when a steer broke from the herd, she swung her pony on
its heels and hazed the steer back to the main body in swift,
darting moves, dust rising around her, bandana whipping out. On
these particular occasions Colonel Wyatt felt proud of his
handiwork. He had raised her as he would have raised a boy, he
had talked to her in the rough, shoulder-to-shoulder manner he
would have talked to any other man, sparing few words. It was his
boast that she equalled any puncher he had ever hired. And when
he saw her streaking across the ground as if she were a part of
the pony, or when he saw her drop her loop over a cow and send
the animal to the earth a-bellowing, he understood her very well.
She had his blood, his recklessness, she had his love of life; at
such moments it blazed from her dark eyes, it betrayed itself in
the manner she held her nether lip between her teeth.</p>

<p>But there were other times when she was utterly fathomless,
when for hours she rode with her glance fixed on the horizon,
never speaking, never changing expression. This mood made Colonel
Wyatt quite uncomfortable and incompetent. Invariably it caused
him to make excuses for the training he had given her. After all,
it took a mother to raise a girl&mdash;and a mother she had owned
only for her first four years. She was a woman now&mdash;the
Colonel had discovered it only recently and with mixed
emotions&mdash;and what did a woman think about, living and
riding with men, day after day, year after year?</p>

<p>Glancing in her direction again he saw she was restless. And
presently he pulled his wits together and prepared for a bad five
minutes. Her gauntlet swung upward, beckoning a man to close in
and take her place.</p>

<p>"Hell's pit!" muttered Wyait. "By the body o' Judas!"</p>

<p>She made a wide circle around the head of the herd, charging
upon the Colonel. Her pony sat on its haunches, pivoted; Lorena's
voice stabbed through the dust, and the Colonel, hearing how
crisply those words fell across the intervening space, knew she
was on the warpath.</p>

<p>"What did San Saba want?"</p>

<p>"Want&mdash;want? Why, girl, I told you he come on a friendly
visit!"</p>

<p>"Pop&mdash;don't lie. Keep your fish stories for business
deals."</p>

<p>"Lorena&mdash;I got a mind to tan your britches! Are you
saying I'm crooked with my tongue?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded vigorously. "You'd hemstitch the truth
whenever it suited you. But I'm not deceived. What did San Saba
want?"</p>

<p>"Girl, I raised you to be a lady! Now act like one!"</p>

<p>"Pop, if you call me a lady once more I'll shout. Bury
it&mdash;burn it!"</p>

<p>Colonel Wyatt shrewdly saw a chance to shift the subject, and
his voice fell to melancholy tones. "Your poor mamma. I promised
her I'd raise you to be genteel."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;sing the sad songs. Blame my mother. Cut
it out, Pop. If you wanted to make a lady of me why wean me with
a horse and a rope? Say, I haven't worn but one dress in six
years. I'd feel like a squaw in nice clothes."</p>

<p>The Colonel squinted at the sun and dropped his white mane. "I
did the best I knew how, Lorena. I guess maybe it wasn't such a
good job at that."</p>

<p>That roused her sympathy instantly, and her hand fell on his
shoulder. "Now, Pop, I'm not blaming you a bit. Texas Fever, I
like the way you brought me up!"</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled his best. "All right, honey, that's a nice
word for the old man."</p>

<p>And so the subject was closed and the dangerous topic avoided,
as he thought. But five minutes later she turned upon him and the
same crisp question startled him: "What did San Saba want?"</p>

<p>"Blisterin' liniment, can't you get that off your mind? Why do
you keep askin'?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to know," replied Lorena placidly. "What's he
after?"</p>

<p>The Colonel groaned. "None o' your business, girl. It was
private an' personal."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lorena, "it must be awful dirty."</p>

<p>"Dirty! Use that word again and I'll tan your britches!"</p>

<p>She was not to be turned. "Why did he tell you to stay west of
the trail?"</p>

<p>"Because the herds ahead of us are spreadin' the fever, an' he
warned me to stay clear of the beaten track. Also, the water's
better out this way."</p>

<p>The girl digested that, Colonel Wyatt meanwhile praying for
peace. It was not to be; Lorena shook her head. "How could San
Saba know about the country off here? He's a Southerner, like us.
Pop, you're too clumsy at greasing the axle."</p>

<p>He assumed an air of mystery. "Well, since you're so all-fired
smart, I guess I got to say there's apt to be trouble ahead of
us."</p>

<p>"What trouble?"</p>

<p>The Colonel rose in his stirrup. "Beard o' Judas, get back to
your place! I'm sayin' no more!"</p>

<p>She saw he would go no farther and so abandoned her direct
attack. Experience had taught Lorena that her father was an
exceedingly dangerous man when fully aroused. There were pieces
of his business she could never discover. Sometimes she heard
stray reports, sometimes she made shrewd guesses and in each
instance it left her troubled, uncertain&mdash;She was, above all
else, loyal to the very core; but even loyalty could not subdue
the distrust that occasionally&mdash;and more frequently of
late&mdash;came to her heart. The Diamond W had not prospered
these last six years or so. Why this should be she could not
tell. All she knew was that the Colonel had grown more nervous,
more secretive, and that there was an air about the outfit she
liked little enough. San Saba, for example. Her father had kept
the man season after season...</p>

<p>"Trouble is what I guessed," she shot back. "Trouble always
comes with San Saba."</p>

<p>"Seems like you have an undue distrust of him, Lorena. I never
had a better foreman."</p>

<p>"Nor a more crooked one. He's got a bad face. Always made me
feel like I was stepping on a snake. A renegade, that fellow. I
never was so glad as when he quit. What's he doing now?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," grunted Colonel Wyatt.</p>

<p>The girl studied his face for quite a while. In the end she
pressed her heels against the pony's flanks and sprang away.
Wyatt had sight of open rebellion on her clear features. Nor did
she resume her place on the left of the herd, but raced up and
over a ridge and vanished from sight.</p>

<p>"She'll ride it off," murmured Wyatt, trying to convince
himself. Yet he was not so sure. Lorena had stubborn blood; she
had curiously straightforward ideas that on occasion confounded
all his plausible explanations. "She'll ride it off. The girl has
got to learn it's a tough world and maybe it takes fire to fight
fire. By the stones o' Peter&mdash;yes, she will!"</p>

<p>Lorena's pony, given rein, fled over the rolling ground. The
girl swayed in the saddle as if to relieve her muscles, and
presently her doubts went away. Up the swelling folds of earth
and down the coulee sides, with the sun pouring its heat out of
the sky. Cloud castles floated across the blue. Afar she could
see the frosted peaks of the Rockies. North, beyond that cloudy
strip that was the horizon, lay Dakota. North was
adventure&mdash;north was another world. Already she felt the
difference in climate; the air was lighter, it brought up a sense
of utter freedom, it had the power to make her giddy.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish I were a man. I'd never stop&mdash;I never
would. Ho&mdash;what's over there, Mister Jefferson Davis?"</p>

<p>The horse, hearing its name, promptly applied weight to its
front feet and came to a stop. Lorena was on a hump of land that
curved across the prairie like a swell of the ocean. A mile
distant horse and rider stood immovable on another rise of
ground. Lorena stood in the stirrups, shaded her eyes, and
studied this intrusion.</p>

<p>"Not an Indian. Well, let's go see."</p>

<p>She proceeded at a sedate pace, noting that the strange rider
likewise advanced. A white man, all right; riding erect and free.
But not a trapper. Good horse&mdash;puncher's
clothing&mdash;young and no whiskers. Lorena stopped and waited.
The newcomer trotted on, wheeled to approach on Lorena's gun
side. That was manners. His rope, she saw, had one end tied to
the horn, his saddle was double cinch. He had a familiar face, a
rather blocky face with big features and wide-spaced eyes set
rather far back. Not that the face bore resemblance to any family
she knew, but that it was a stamp familiar in the South. And
strangely bleached for a Western man. Lorena's curiosity leaped
to immense proportions. The stranger stopped ten yards off and
raised his right hand.</p>

<p>"How."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;you're from Texas!"</p>

<p>"That's right." Then she saw him bend over the horn, eyes
flashing surprise. "By George, a woman." And his hat came
off.</p>

<p>"Of course," said she. Adding with a trace of wistfulness,
"Just so you don't call me a lady it's all right."</p>

<p>"Ma'm, in Texas&mdash;as elsewhere&mdash;all women are
ladies."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddlesticks! You sound like Pop. However did you get so
pale?"</p>

<p>"I've been East awhile."</p>

<p>"Sho' enough?" inquired Lorena eagerly. "I'd like to see Omaha
some day, myself."</p>

<p>"Well, farther east than that. Say New York&mdash;or
Boston."</p>

<p>Quite a long silence. Lorena gravely considered this, her
features puckered, owlish. "That's different. Too far east. But
I'd like to see Omaha or New Orleans. Where you bound?"</p>

<p>"North&mdash;let's ride that way."</p>

<p>So they fell in, side by side, and ambled leisurely across the
broad prairie. Lorena still was occupied with the remoteness of
New York and Boston, turning the matter over and over in her
mind, weighing the sound of it, the possible truthfulness of it.
The stranger seemed content to keep the silence, riding with his
eyes sweeping the distance. Lorena tallied up a mark in favour of
this silence. She had known Easterners, and they talked a heap
too much. Piece by piece she checked his rig. Well, he was from
Texas, no doubt. And maybe he was telling the truth about having
been to New York, though she allowed herself a small reservation.
There was many a grave-faced liar out of Texas. Suddenly she
thrust a question at him.</p>

<p>"What kind of saddles do they use back there?"</p>

<p>"Mighty flat things with no horn and stirrups, something like
a chicken's wishbone."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I've heard of 'em. Guess you've been there all
right."</p>

<p>He smiled, and Lorena marvelled at the change it made. The
difference between daylight and darkness. "No law against the
truth west of the Mississippi, ma'm."</p>

<p>Her small, rounding shoulders lifted. "I was brought up on
Texas lies. Some of the men in our outfit do it smooth enough to
believe themselves."</p>

<p>He seemed to find fresh interest in her. "What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Lorena."</p>

<p>"Lorena&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>And she, who had always been a candid, out-and-out girl,
striving for masculine directness, suddenly discovered a
contradiction in her heart. The first impulse was to satisfy his
question. The second&mdash;and it puzzled her why she should feel
so strangely about such a simple matter was to make him guess a
little.</p>

<p>"Lorena's enough."</p>

<p>He shook his head, thoughtful. "Now, you don't look like a
fugitive from justice with a past to conceal. I tell
you&mdash;we'll say the last name is Smith. If anybody should ask
me about a girl with a different name I wouldn't be lying when I
said I didn't know her. Lorena Smith. Why, it's a pretty
combination."</p>

<p>She rode in stiff, dignified silence. Nor did she unbend until
he went back to the original subject. "Whoever told you not to be
a lady? Or that you weren't a lady?"</p>

<p>"Hmf. What is <i>your</i> name?"</p>

<p>"Tom Gillette."</p>

<p>"Wait," she commanded, halting her pony. "That's
familiar."</p>

<p>"Menard County."</p>

<p>"Knew I'd heard of it. As to being a lady&mdash;what is your
idea of a lady, anyhow?"</p>

<p>This seemed to strike him unaccountably hard. Her watchful
eyes saw him turn sombre; there was a metallic ring in his words,
a vibration that did queer things to her pulse.</p>

<p>"A lady? One square enough not to trade on her
privileges&mdash;one straight enough not to disobey her
mind&mdash;or her heart."</p>

<p>It seemed oddly at variance with all her own notions, and she
said as much. "And she must sit straight in a chair, keep her
hands white, and lie politely to all menfolks to keep 'em in good
humour. Haven't I seen many a lady?"</p>

<p>"Unessentials," murmured Tom.</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not. Anyhow, I can't do those things."</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"I can do a man's work without complaining, rain or sun. I can
shoot. I can rope anything with four feet."</p>

<p>Once more that warming, transforming smile. It reminded Lorena
of raising the curtains of a dark house and letting the sun
stream in. Tom scanned the prairie. "We might locate an elephant
and try out that ropin' proposition."</p>

<p>His definition she turned over and over, examining its various
facets, testing it with preliminary acids of experience. "Where
did you learn that much about ladies?" she demanded. All her
questions were thus&mdash;sharp and short, striking fair at their
target.</p>

<p>"History," said Tom. "Ancient history."</p>

<p>That time she paid no attention to the meaning of his words,
but instead listened to the sound of them. Her head dropped a
trifle, her eyes swept the prairie in one broad inspection, and
she did something then she had never yet been guilty of. She
showed her skill to please a man&mdash;to impress him. Her pony,
under the reins' touch, sprang off, running a circle around the
stationary Tom. Twenty yards away a crimson flower stood above
the buffalo grass, nodding on its tall stem. Lorena threw her
compact little body completely out of the saddle, plucked the
flower as she swept by and came upright. When she had completed
the circle and was back beside the man that flower was imbedded
in her hair, a trace of that femininity of which she had never
heretofore given thought.</p>

<p>She believed she had never seen so sharp a glance, so
penetrating a glance from any human being. And of a sudden she
was afraid, both of him and of herself. The pony whirled and
broke away. A few yards distant she brought up. Laughter bubbled
brimful in her eyes, her cheeks were deep pink, and her nether
lip, imprisoned between her teeth, was like a cherry. The
exuberant, vivid current of life would not be concealed under the
drab clothing, nor behind the poker expression she liked to
maintain.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll see you up North," said she.</p>

<p>"If I should meet the posse," he called back, "I'll tell 'em I
only saw a fellow by the name of Smith&mdash;and that Smith was
heading south."</p>

<p>She flung up a hand, tarried only to see him return the
signal, and galloped over the ridge. The day was hot and still.
She thought she had never seen it so beautiful. The rolling
prairie, marching its countless miles into the blue strip of
haze, surrounded her with the rising incense of things growing.
How many centuries had it lain so, how many living creatures had
passed across its fecund, smiling expanse? Feeling its warmth as
she felt it, heady with bursting instincts as herself?</p>

<p>The Diamond W was twenty minutes west. When the long dusty
lane of cattle came into view, a dun ribbon against the green
carpet, she had overridden her gaiety. She was bitter with
herself. "Why did I make a fool display? He'll think I wanted him
to notice me! Oh, darn!"</p>

<p>Her father called, but she shook her head and passed to the
left flank. For the rest of that day she rode with her eyes
ahead, her lips pressed together; by turns pensive and
turbulent.</p>

<p>One thing stuck to her mind, its meaning enlarging with each
dusty mile. "A lady is square&mdash;a lady is honest. Mister
Jefferson Davis, is that <i>all</i> it needs to make a lady? Oh,
I don't believe it is that simple. Still, he's been East. He
<i>ought</i> to know. Darn it, Mister Jefferson Davis, sometimes
it would be a great help if I knew how to cry a little! No,
that's awfully foolish."</p>

<p>The red flower in her hair bobbed with the pace of the pony, a
vivid signal.

<hr><h2><a name="ch4"></a>4. SAN SABA STRIKES</h2>

<p class="first">FIRELIGHT threw its orange arc against the
night's steel-black pall. Dark banners whipped across the
silvered half-moon. The stars were shrouded, the ceiling of
heaven had dropped earthward, and thus imprisoned the gaining
wind swept over the earth with a hollow, droning reverberation.
At sunset it had been both clear and warm. Now a raw dampness
touched men and beasts. Sand sprayed across the prairie, a stem
of sage sailed into the light and dropped by Quagmire's crossed
boots. Eerie voices beat through space&mdash;like that of a rifle
shot. The canvas on the chuck wagon slatted against its ribs. One
solitary drop of rain fell hissing into the coals.</p>

<p>Quagmire turned his wizened face and nosed the air. "Trouble
comin' hell bent out o' the east. Why has they got to be an east,
anyhow? Ain't south an' west ample? I think I'll tie my ears down
afo' they float away."</p>

<p>A rider cruised around the near side of the herd, and the echo
of his improvised song reached the fire. "Lie down, you brutes,
lie down. Oh, a Texas gal is the gal for me&mdash;Lie down, you
measly, locoed receptacles o' sin. The wind is risin' an' so are
the dogies' tails&mdash;lie doooowwn."</p>

<p>"It takes a good bass voice to soothe 'em," opined Quagmire
sagely.</p>

<p>"If this keeps up," murmured his near neighbor, "yo'll be
singin' soprano outen the corner o' yo' mouth befo' mo'nin'."</p>

<p>Quagmire crushed this innuendo impressively. "Billy, yo' ort
to know I nev' sing soprano lessen I'm vaccinated to the eyebrows
with that filthy mescal." A burst of rain struck the fire, frying
in the flames. Quagmire reached around and squirmed into his
slicker. "Guess I'm goin' to get that bath I fo'got to take las'
winter. Dakota, howdedo."</p>

<p>The flat Nebraskan plain stood behind. Both forks of the
Platte, that river a mile wide and an inch deep, had baptized the
herd. The Niobrara had seen their camp fire; they had passed one
stretch of the bad lands and put the Belle Fourche to the rear.
Due west lay the dark, granitic folds of the Black Hills; due
west lay Deadwood, born of gold fever and now thundering along on
the flood tide of prosperity. Indian country. Once they had
sighted a brave on a parallel ridge, sitting like a statue on his
horse, watching them; and since they were schooled in the red
man's thievery they loosened the flaps of rifle boots and doubly
guarded the horse herd.</p>

<p>Sand and rain swirled about the group. Tom heard the tempo of
the wind rising. Thunder rumbled away off. Things movable began
to shiver and strain, and the old cook slid around his wagon,
battening down the canvas. Quagmire, true to his ingrained habit,
hovered by the fire and nursed it jealously.</p>

<p>"Talk about soprano," mused Quagmire, "that wind will shore be
singin' it in a minute. I hope them cow critters have got a clear
conscience this night."</p>

<p>"Stampede?"</p>

<p>It was Lispenard speaking. He had come out of darkness and
squatted across from Quagmire. Tom Gillette, studying the man,
had difficulty in realizing it was the same gay and debonair
classmate he had once so freely confided in. In the flickering
light the Blond Giant looked as ragged and unkempt as any other
of the party. The soft protecting flesh had quite disappeared;
under the stubble of his whiskers his jaw bones ran grimly to the
jutting button of his chin. And since the night San Saba had
brought him back from Ogallala, both drunk and viciously angry,
he had adopted a kind of brooding reserve. The man was in
splendid shape. At every gesture he made Tom saw the muscles
rippling and flexing. Otherwise, Tom was not so certain. It
occurred to him that Blondy's big and rolling eyes no longer
attracted him, nor did he like the way Blondy's lips now and then
slid back from his teeth. In school, his friend had cut quite a
swath; sundered from that atmosphere, he seemed never yet to have
shaken himself together.</p>

<p>"Stampede?" echoed Quagmire. "Well, I ain't wishin' to draw
down any lightnin' by speakin' that word too loud. Who knows what
goes on inside a critter's mind? I've seen 'em stand through
weather so plumb bad yo' couldn't draw breath. Turn right around
on a ca'm peaceful night an' they'd roll tails if a leaf budged.
Critters ain't reasonable&mdash;no more'n a man."</p>

<p>The crew, unable to sleep, had drawn near the fire. San Saba,
a mere silhouette in his gleaming slicker, stood in the
background while all the others squatted on their haunches. Tom,
himself a little removed from the fire, saw the foreman's small
red eyes dart from man to man. Billy, the skeptic who adjoined
Quagmire, thrust a sidling glance at Lispenard and of a sudden he
chuckled, slapping one hand across his knee.</p>

<p>"Quagmire, yo'-all remember that twister we bucked down by the
Nueces? I wouldn't ever have believed sech a thing could happen
if I hadn't seen it with my own two eyes."</p>

<p>The rest of the crew, almost in unison, nodded confirmation.
Quagmire studied Billy with a long, mild glance before replying.
"Mean the time it picked up Anse Loving's herd an' carried it
acrost the river?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't Loving's herd atall," denied Billy. "It was a bunch o'
Hogpen stock."</p>

<p>"No such thing. It was Loving's outfit we worked for that
year."</p>

<p>"Why, by..."</p>

<p>Lispenard threw in his contribution. "You trying to fool me
again? Some dam' fish story about wind picking up cattle
bodily..."</p>

<p>Profound silence. Quagmire vainly stirred the fire. "Ever hear
of a twister? Don't they teach it in Eastern gee-og-ruffies?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but..."</p>

<p>"Ever hear of 'em liftin' buildin's offen the ground?"</p>

<p>Lispenard raised his shoulders. "Well, go on, then. That's
straight enough. But a whole herd doesn't sound possible."</p>

<p>Quagmire pointed into the darkness. "It's only blowin' mild
right now. But yo' go out there an' try to stand up in it. Then
imagine a twister."</p>

<p>There was no answer. Quagmire brooded over the remnant of
flame, water sluicing down his hat. He appeared to have forgotten
the story, yet ever and anon he lifted his thin and wrinkled face
to listen to what the wind told him. Slight uneasiness rode the
shoulders of the crew.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it was the Hogpen outfit," muttered Billy
somberly.</p>

<p>That roused Quagmire. "Why, man, don't yo' recollect that
wall-eyed buckskin I rode with the blaze?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe so," assented Billy, now dubious.</p>

<p>"Sho'" proceeded Quagmire. "I'm tellin' yo' I rode him that
night. Black? Say, it was blacker'n the inside o' a crow's
windpipe. Never saw a twister come up faster. We was on the east
bank of the Nueces."</p>

<p>"West bank," corrected Billy.</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;west bank. On the west bank when it come.
Right by that barn, yo' remember? No time to shove the herd
aside. Funnel bearin' down on us hell bent. Every man for
himself. Me, I lights out on that buckskin. Hadn't gone fifty
feet when it struck. Heard an awful crash&mdash;must've been the
barn&mdash;and then I sorter feels like yo'd feel after too much
mescal. Yo' understan'&mdash;kinda feather-headed. I digs in my
spurs, but I wasn't on no horse atall. I was fifty feet offen the
ground, goin' over the river. The buckskin had vamoosed. Thought
I'd lost him. Figgered I was dead when that twister let me go an'
I dropped. Sho', but it's a queer feelin' to get up with the
birds."</p>

<p>There was a rumble in the outer darkness, and the crew, to a
man, straightened. A puncher rode in, dripping wet. "Still
peaceable," he announced briefly, and disappeared. Tom relaxed,
grinning when he saw how Lispenard's attention fastened to
Quagmire's tale.</p>

<p>"Must've been a mile farther along," continued Quagmire, "with
me gettin' higher all the times when I hears a sound like an
express train comin' by. It was that dam' barn, with the top
ripped off. They was ten ton o' hay in that shebang, yet it
sailed by me like a shot. Then I hears a mos' piteous nicker, an'
it's the buckskin, right behin' the barn. I remember I sorter
prayed the saddle wouldn't fall offen him. Silver inlay saddle,
an' it cost a heap.</p>

<p>"Well, we was a good six miles east o' the river by then, an'
the twister begins to slide away from me. Me, I falls faster'n a
shot duck. Had a watch on me, an' I recalls I takes it out an'
throws it clear, not wantin' to light on glass. I knowed I was as
good as extinct right then, an' I figgered I'd better pray. But
how's a man to pray what ain't never learned the Commandments?
Anyhow, I was worryin' about that silver inlay saddle. Down I
went, head first. Saw the ground smack below. But that barn had
lit befo' me, an' me, I struck the top o' them ten tons o' hay,
bounced a couple times, an' slid right down into a manger. An'
you may chalk me up as a bald-faced liar if I didn't find..."</p>

<p>He stopped, shaking his head from side to side. Lispenard
leaned across the fire. "Well?"</p>

<p>Quagmire spread his hands, palms upward. "The buckskin had
ketched up with the barn while both was in the air. The cuss had
walked inside to get a free ride. When I slides down to the
manger there he was, munchin' oats."</p>

<p>Billy collapsed first, moaning. The crouching punchers swayed
back and forth, arms flailing, like priests performing strange
rites. Wild laughter ricochetted up and against the whirling air.
Lispenard jumped to his feet. "I told you it'd be another cursed
fish story!"</p>

<p>He had to shout to make himself heard above the shrilling
tempest. Quagmire still sat cushioned on his heels, water pouring
down his slicker and pooling at his feet; still a sober, bemused
figure. Alone of the Circle G crew, San Saba had not joined the
hilarity, and now he stepped into the waning arc of light,
unfriendly, brittle-voiced.</p>

<p>"It's an old, stale yarn to tell a gent."</p>

<p>Laughter died. Quagmire looked up. "Old? What's new in this
ancient universe? But seein' as yo' speak of old things, I reckon
I could relate a few."</p>

<p>"Personal allusions, suh?"</p>

<p>Quagmire got to his feet, but the foreman's height made him
tilt his wizened face; it was a face upon which solemnity loved
to dwell, yet on occasion it could be as hard as granite, as
bleak as death. So it was now. "Once upon a time, San
Saba..."</p>

<p>Lispenard stepped ahead. "Thanks, San Saba, but this is my
quarrel."</p>

<p>Quagmire snapped at him. "It only takes two oars to row a
boat! Yo' ain't got no quarrel!"</p>

<p>The Blond Giant fell silent, full lips twitching. Quagmire's
thin chest laboured to shove his words against the wind. "Once
they was a bad night&mdash;like this one. Looked as if they might
be trouble&mdash;like it does now. Boss comes up to the boys and
says, 'Boys, we are apt to have a stampede. Somebody's like to
get killed afo' mo'nin'. Now yo'-all better write yo' true names
on a piece o' paper an' tuck in yo' shirts.' That's what he said.
Mebbe <i>we'll</i> have trouble. But they's only one man here
which needs to write his true name on a paper. An' that's
yo'&mdash;San Saba!"</p>

<p>"Quagmire&mdash;yo' lie!"</p>

<p>"I pay no attention to a dawg when it barks at me," replied
Quagmire somberly. "Yo' past history may be unf'miliar to others,
But <i>I</i> know it!"</p>

<p>"Yo' lie!" droned San Saba. "Eat those words, hear me?"</p>

<p>Tom Gillette stepped between the men. "Drop it! There'll be no
fights in this outfit. We're on the drive."</p>

<p>Quagmire turned away. But San Saba craned his nutshell head
forward. "This ain't yo' affair. What yo' hornin' in for?"</p>

<p>"I'll make it my quarrel, San Saba." The wind swept Tom
Gillette's words high up, and he had to throw all his power into
them. "As for quarrels&mdash;you ought to know whether I've got
one with you. Wait until the drive is finished if it's in your
mind to settle."</p>

<p>The Major rode out of the dark pit, followed by the cavvy
herder. "Saddle up! Everybody ride! Lightning striking half a
mile off!"</p>

<p>The last flame guttered and was extinguished. Tom reached
Lispenard shouting. "Stick with me! If there's trouble, keep away
from the herd!"</p>

<p>He felt Lispenard's hand knock his arm away. "Don't worry
about that. I'll look out for myself."</p>

<p>Confusion in the horse herd. Tom threw the dripping saddle on
his pony, cinched it tight against the knowledge he might have to
depend utterly on the solidity of those double bands, and swung
out of the melee. A hundred yards off he struck the flank of the
herd. The brutes were up, moving uneasily, heads tossing. The
force of the wind was shifting them; they were turning
spooky&mdash;in that frame of mind where any unaccountable sound
or sight might set them running. Tom walked his pony along the
rim of the straggling circle, rain driving against his slicker
and pounding on his skin. He was in no humour to sing, but sing
he must; anything to give those uneasy, forboding kine the
reassurance of his presence.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse"><br>
"Oh, Buffalo girls, are you comin' out to-night<br>
Comin' out to-night, comin' out to-night,<br>
Oh, Buffalo girls, are you comin' out to-night..."</p>

<br>

<p>The drums and trumpets of the storm rolled out a prolonged
fanfaronade. Thunder rocked the heavens, and an instant later a
sinuous, wavering bolt of lightning cracked the pit-black sky and
hung suspended one long second. In the pale blue twilight thus
cast over the earth Tom saw the herd massed together, tails and
horns and bony backs moving like the wind-whipped surface of the
sea. Stray members of the crew were silhouetted ahead, bent
against the lashing rain. Then it was dark, abysmally dark, with
a phosphorescent glow running across the thousands of horn tips.
Thunder again, coming closer; wind and rain struck down against
the earth with tenfold force. Tom's pony stood still, bracing its
feet on the slippery soil.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Oh, Buffalo girls, are you comin' out to-night,<br>
To dance by the light of the moon..."</p>

<p><br>
College&mdash;law and order&mdash;elm trees shading green
lawns. What was all that but a dream, a faint echo of life? Here
on this tempest-torn prairie animate creatures struggled to
survive. And some would not.</p>

<p>Lispenard had not left the chuck wagon, though he, like the
others, had saddled his pony. The time might come when he would
want to get away in a hurry. San Saba warned him of that after
the rest had ridden off. The foreman had waited until he was
alone with Lispenard, and even then he spoke as softly as he
could manage.</p>

<p>"You stick here, amigo. If they should be a sound like hell
bein' pulled up by the roots, skin out."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>And then San Saba grinned, though it was too dark for
Lispenard to see this cheerless contraction of lips. "Ain't no
call fo' thanks, friend. Mebbe I will be askin' yo' to return the
favour some day."</p>

<p>He vanished, trampling the last dull ember of the fire. Nor
did he fall into the usual drone as he skirted the herd. He went
silently, with the picture of the herd as he had seen them at
sunset in his mind. Judge Lynch, the one-eyed hermit, was over on
the west side somewhat near the rear. Judge Lynch usually bedded
down a little removed from his companions and seldom moved far
from the original spot during the night. The critters were all up
now, but the foreman was betting strongly that this morose and
distrustful animal would be standing in his tracks. Barring
earlier developments, he had business with Judge Lynch.</p>

<p>The first streamer of lightning found him half around the
circle. Two riders were directly in front, but they were
travelling in the same direction and thus didn't see San Saba.
The foreman quickened his pace and on the ensuing flash looked
behind him. Nobody within fifty yards. At the same time he
located Judge Lynch, marking the spot in his mind as the darkness
closed down. He bent forward, slipping his quirt; Judge Lynch's
vague outline fell athwart his path. The quirt flailed out,
struck the steer's rump. San Saba's voice teetered shrilly on the
driving wind. "Hyaaaa!" Judge Lynch snorted, whirled from the
blow, and lumbered off.</p>

<p>San Saba turned the pony and galloped recklessly into the open
prairie. Through the wild beat and roar of the storm came the
distinct echo of the herd breaking away. A rumble of those
thousands of hoofs, a clamour of bawling and bellowing, a
clicking of horns. The reverberation of all this trembled along
the earth and up through his pony's pounding feet. San Saba
grinned his humourless grin and aimed away from the path of the
stampeding brutes. For that path was one of destruction.</p>

<p>Tom Gillette had rounded the windward side of the herd when he
felt a shock pass across the darkness. Once experienced, it was a
sensation never to be forgotten. He had often been told by old
hands that the fright of a single steer could strike through five
thousand cattle with all the speed of an electrical impulse. He
never had quite believed it until this moment. It came from he
knew not where, the cause was equally obscure. Nevertheless, he
felt the impact of that surging, milling mass of brutes as they
swung, collided, and then struck off with the wind behind them.
The babble of their throats drowned even the storm; and when the
next flash of lightning played its smoke-blue gleam upon the
prairie he saw them running, tails up, horns weaving; here and
there they had become trapped by their blind fright&mdash;piled
together like logs jammed up in the eddy of a river. But they
were running away, and Tom saw Quagmire and Billy outlined just
for an instant in the glare, trying to circle around to the front
of the mass. Darkness dropped; he sank his spurs and raced after
them.</p>

<p>Guns cracked. Somebody in front was trying to turn the flight.
He heard a shrill yell beside him, and he wondered which one of
the crew it happened to be. Not that it made any difference; yet
his mind played queer tricks as he found himself on one ragged
flank of the racing brutes. Queer tricks; for all the while this
night and its fury hammered at his senses he kept remembering the
last dance. Even the music of it came back to his memory. There
had been a summerhouse out in that green and peaceful yard; a
summerhouse open to all the fragrance of a June night. And where
was she now, and what dumb man&mdash;for it seemed all men were
humble and helpless at her hands&mdash;was receiving the favour
of her provoking and elusive smile? Oh, she knew the game she was
playing. What else could it be with her when every gesture and
every word had so led him astray? And in the end it was her cool,
scornful dismissal. "Tom, you Texan savage, why must you be so
ridiculously serious? You ought to command your heart better.
Thank you, my dear man, but I'll be no chatelaine out in the
wilderness."</p>

<p>It was over, thank God! He found himself shouting the very
words into space. He'd had enough. Enough of play acting and fine
manners and&mdash;falsity. He had been a gentleman. What good was
that? Why, those people never knew what living was. And they had
infected him with their code, with the specious reasoning of
their commandments. Good enough for them, but what would any of
them do if they saw San Saba's little red eyes staring through
the shadows, like the eyes of a reptile ready to strike? Curse
that code, it had tainted his blood. It had made him feel cold
fear on matching San Saba's dead, lusterless glance.</p>

<p>The muffled echo of a shot. The racing pony drew well toward
the head of the stampede. He felt the steady surge of its
muscles, and he thought of the cinches he had drawn so tight.
Well enough, so long as the horse kept its feet out of a gopher
hole.</p>

<p>The storm maintained its fury. They had gone miles from camp.
Of a sudden Tom saw a jagged fragment of the herd break off, then
he was surrounded and riding neck and neck with a racing shadow,
feeling the touch of a horn against his stirrup. He drew his gun
and fired point-blank, shouting at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>"Pile up, you brutes, pile up!"</p>

<p>On and on he raced. It seemed many hours, it may have been
many hours. But he was well ahead and he had company. Quagmire's
bullfrog croak came to him at intervals, like the sounding of a
foghorn. More shots, more wild incantations. His pony raced down
a hollow, up the farther side; the rhythmic jolting of its hoofs
lost a beat, the animal stumbled, caught the stride, and pounded
on.</p>

<p>"Good boy. This is no place to die."</p>

<p>Gradually, as the time passed, Tom detected a lessening of
speed, a kind of faltering among the cattle, a raggedness in
their hitherto compact formation. Instantly, he slackened his own
pace until he rode abreast of the lead steers. The other punchers
along the vanguard likewise had discovered this and were crowding
together. Guns flashed in the blackness, voices rose shrill and
profane. Tom ranged abreast a steer and pressed against it,
sheering it off from a straight course. He heard Quagmire's
rumbling cry of encouragement "Now she goes! Swing
'em&mdash;swing 'em!"</p>

<p>They swung, brute following brute in a giant circle. More men
rode in, shoving against the swirling wall of flesh. The circle
dwindled, the herd milled around and around; they fell from a
gallop to a shambling trot and presently that trot declined to a
walk. Mischief still swayed the more unregenerate, but the fright
had worn off, the flight was checked. The stampede was over.</p>

<p>It was a smaller herd by half. Cattle were strung out the many
intervening miles, but there was nothing to do but wait the
miserable night through. Thus the crew wearily stood guard, wet
and tired and uneasy. Rider came abreast rider, establishing
identity.</p>

<p>"Where's Mex?"</p>

<p>"Dunno. Last I knew he was 'way back. Had a slow horse. Don't
'spect he could keep up with this hell on wheels. That Carolina
over yonder?"</p>

<p>"Yeh, him an' me stuck together."</p>

<p>One by one they mustered. The names of the absentees were
repeated in gruffer accents. "That you, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Billy was last man from camp."</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was right aside me up until ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Well, he's all right."</p>

<p>"Shore&mdash;shore. Prob'ly trailin' some strays. Show up by
daylight."</p>

<p>Somebody began to sing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie,<br>
In a grave six foot by three..."</p>

<br>

<p>It was protested instantly. They were jaded, and an uneasy
fear rode each of them. "What fool is that? Lord a'mighty, shut
up! Cow critters don't deserve no melody tonight."</p>

<p>The crest of the storm had passed some little while ago; the
rain lessened. Thunder echoed from a remote distance, and it
seemed to be getting lighter. And so the hours dragged by, the
Circle G crew sodden to the skin, riding weary paths in the
trampled earth, and every now and then one of them would announce
discovery of another member, only to be contradicted. Talk came
in shorter spurts. Silence grew the more prolonged, though on
occasion there was a crackling rapid-fire exchange of comment.
Anything to relieve the tedium.</p>

<p>"What started this cussed party, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Somebody spit over the wrong shoulder, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Yo' ain't funny, Baldy. Say, did anybody hear a sorter yippy-
yip about ten seconds before it happened?"</p>

<p>"Ask Joe Priest. He was on circle then."</p>

<p>"I oughter been out there singin' bass," opined Quagmire,
riding into the conversation. "It never would of happened.
Tom&mdash;hey, Tom."</p>

<p>"Present and accounted for," drawled Tom.</p>

<p>Quagmire drew alongside and his arm rested on Tom's shoulder.
"Knew yo' was ridin' with me. But I kinda lost yo' fo' a piece
and I..." But he was not given to sentiment. That was as far as
he would go.</p>

<p>Tom swore at him. "You galoot, I'm riding a good horse."</p>

<p>"Sho'. An' the good Lord was watchin' yo' too. Else yo' pony
wouldn't he'ped none."</p>

<p>The squealing of the chuck-wagon wheels announced Old Mose's
approach. He had smelled them out somehow and was coming on the
dead run. How or where he had found his horses no one knew. His
falsetto voice assailed them.</p>

<p>"Ain' yo' boys got nuthin' else to do but run offen the earth?
Gittin' sho'ly tough when doctor has to foller with the
grub."</p>

<p>The rain still fell, and there wasn't a dry twig within twenty
miles. But the cook knew his business. Presently a fire twinkled
directly under the wagon bed, shielded from the downpour. When it
had grown enough to threaten the vehicle, Old Mose drove clear of
it, threw on the coffee pot, and in ten minutes hailed them.
"Come an' wa'm yo' gizzards."</p>

<p>The first gray beam of false dawn crept out of the cast. In a
half hour it was light enough to take stock and recount noses.
Nothing was said for a good five minutes, and in the end it was
Major Bob who brusquely broke the silence. "Guess Billy's out
followin' a stray bunch. We'll look. Quagmire, Tom, Joe
Priest&mdash;you&mdash;Carolina&mdash;light out that way. Rest of
you spread."</p>

<p>They strung to the four corners of the gray and sodden
morning. Tom galloped directly back upon the trail&mdash;the
broad trail flailed by the stampeding herd. The mark of ruin was
on the earth, the grass churned into the mud, here and there a
cow that had gone down in the rush. Tom rode steadily, tired
clear to his bones. Drab tendrils of rain hung raggedly from the
dark sky; it would be a sullen day.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he came to a coulee half awash with water. And he
stopped dead, his eyes fastened there. Then he turned, pulled his
revolver and shot thrice, spacing each shot. The extended riders
swung and converged toward him. Those tarrying at the chuck wagon
sprang to saddle and came on the dead run. Tom waited until they
had assembled before pointing to the coulee.</p>

<p>"Pony threw him, I guess. Must've been tangled in the herd.
Never had a Chinaman's chance."</p>

<p>Billy&mdash;the skeptic Billy who forever liked to contradict
Quagmire&mdash;was sprawled in the coulee's bottom, half covered
with water and mud, arms outflung, face down. And it was Quagmire
who first got from his horse and descended. Somebody broke back
for the chuck wagon, returning with a pair of shovels. And while
the rain sluiced over the earth the crew stood grimly about as
the grave was dug and Billy lifted into it. It was a hard silence
to break, a difficult place to say what had to be said. When the
last shovel of earth had been tamped down, Major Bob took off his
hat.</p>

<p>"If anybody wants to say a prayer, let him do it. I reckon
nobody wants to, though. Well, men have got to die, and men have
got to be buried. Where is a better place than here? We'll see
the boy again, make no doubt of that. It's the same story for us
all. The candle burns strongly, but the candle burns fast."</p>

<p>Quagmire's voice rose angrily. "Well, Billy was a good
gent&mdash;a good gent! Put another shovel o' dirt on that grave,
Red. He shore was a good gent. He'll ride in marble halls!
Dammit, Red, put another shovel o' earth on that grave! It's
awful cold this mornin'!"

<hr><h2><a name="ch5"></a>5. MURDER IN THE CIRCLE G</h2>

<p class="first">THE Circle G herd was flung to the four corners
of the compass. Fifteen hundred of them were with the leaders;
the other thousand had scattered over an area of ten miles, and
for three days the outfit camped, rounding up the strays. In they
came, by pairs and squads and fifties; gaunt-eyed kine that had
left Texas with no flesh on their ribs and now were nothing but
bone and skin. They grazed on the open prairie, they were off in
the pockets of the broken land. From starlight to dusk the men of
the Circle G rode a widening arc, following the plain prints in
the soft and sandy soil. Tom counted a dozen dead animals along
the path of the stampede, and later, when he rode into the rugged
country to the west, he came upon a cutbank where a hundred of
them had gone over and piled up, tier on tier, all dead. But on
the morning of the fourth day Major Bob called a halt and flung
his arm ahead, signal to be on with the drive.</p>

<p>"We're still shy a hundred or more," said Tom. "Give us to-day
and we'll find most of 'em off there in the coulees and cedar
brakes."</p>

<p>Major Bob shook his head. "I'll take the loss. No more time to
be wasted. Riding north this morning I found the tracks of
another herd. Somebody's before us, cutting west. San Saba!"</p>

<p>The foreman rode slowly to the fore, eyeing the Gillettes
warily. "Yes, suh."</p>

<p>"Time for us to be watching our direction," said Major Bob.
"Seems to me we ought to swing westerly somewhere round here. You
remember the country from last year?"</p>

<p>San Saba swept the horizon. "Yes, suh, tole'bly well."</p>

<p>"Lead out, then. There's a party ahead of us. Steer as
straight a line as you can."</p>

<p>The foreman nodded. The swing and drag pressed against the
herd. It moved forward, on the last leg of the journey. The
sullen skies gave way, the sun beat down day after day, the
prairie steamed and grew dry, the coulees were bereft of water
once more. North they travelled, arrow straight, with San Saba in
the lead, never saying a word, never revealing what thoughts
stirred behind his small red eyes. They crossed the trail of the
other herd and lost it at a point where it swung directly into
the dark and timbered land westward. Tom kept his peace. Yet all
the while a vague suspicion stirred in the back of his head. And
one day he came alongside his father and spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"You said you were bound for the country around the head
waters of the Little Missouri, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it seems to me we're going too far north. We've passed
the Grand and it sticks to my mind the Little Missouri makes an
ox bow and sweeps south. I think I remember it from a map I've
seen."</p>

<p>Major Bob rode for a mile without speaking. But his eyes were
fixed on the back of San Saba, who was a hundred yards in front.
"San Saba has been there. He's been a capable foreman to me. I
have trusted him." He turned to his son. "You don't rub well with
the man, do you?"</p>

<p>"I'll say nothing against him," replied Tom.</p>

<p>"No, of course you wouldn't. Matter of principle. East didn't
wholly convert you. I hope, Son, you have never lost your eye for
the centre of a target."</p>

<p>Tom held his silence, and Major Bob shook his head, just a
little sadly. "Men must be as they are. God knows there is little
enough softness in this world. Not that I would have it
otherwise. San Saba!"</p>

<p>The foreman checked his horse and waited until the Gillettes
came along. "Is it not time to swing west?" asked Major Bob,
studying the foreman keenly.</p>

<p>San Saba appeared to verify his surrounding from the visible
landmarks. "Not yet, suh, fo' a day. I am lookin' fo' a table-top
butte with red streaks through it."</p>

<p>"Well, you know best. Remember, we can't afford to lose
ground. That trail we passed makes me very uneasy&mdash;very
uneasy."</p>

<p>San Saba raised his shoulders, saying nothing. His inscrutable
eyes rested momentarily on Tom and the latter thought he saw a
point of light break through the red pall. A point of light that
gleamed and was suppressed. Then the foreman dropped his narrow
chin, murmuring, "I'm doin' the best I can, suh. If yo' aim to
turn west I'll say nothin'."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," replied Major Bob.</p>

<p>Tom dropped to the rear where Quagmire rode. Upon the wizened
face was imprinted the sorrow of the universe. But he grinned at
Tom and threw a leg around the saddle horn.</p>

<p>"Was a fortune teller once what told me I'd take a long trip.
Paid him a dollar. Well, look what I got for my dollar. He said I
was a gent that liked life. Hell, I got to like it! He tol' me
I'd meet up with a dark lady an' she'd be a great influence to
me. That gipsy sho' read my periscope."</p>

<p>"Met the lady, did you?" inquired Tom.</p>

<p>Quagmire squinted at the sun, the earth, and the remote
horizon. "Rode a pitchin' hoss down by El Paso one year. Broke
both collar bones, sprained a laig, an' bit myse'f in the middle
o' the back. Laid up three months."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with a dark lady?"</p>

<p>Quagmire spread his palms upward. "It was a black lady
hoss."</p>

<p>Tom smiled. "Well, we live and we learn."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," amended Quagmire lugubriously, "we only
live."</p>

<p>"It's the only life we've got," mused Tom.</p>

<p>Quagmire shifted his weight. "Now you spoke like my own
son."</p>

<p>"If you'd had a son. Ever tried the institution of marriage
for a reasonable length of time, Quagmire?"</p>

<p>"Shucks, no. I'm too stingy to divide my affections."</p>

<p>But much later, after a brooding study of the matter, he
amplified this. "'Tain't exactly that, either, Tom. But, I tell
you&mdash;I can sleep on grass and I can eat navy beans until
said navy quits makin' 'em. Sorter hate to make a woman share
that. My mamma was death on havin' me comb my hair. Mebbe that
got me shy. Company ahead."</p>

<p>The herd came to a straggling halt Over an adjacent ridge came
a solitary rider clad in fringed buckskin. Tom trotted to the
fore to join the ensuing parley. Major Bob rode out to meet the
stranger. The man's skin was like so much parfleche, and a beard
draped itself from cheek bone to collar, out of which glittered
two intensely black and exploring eyes. He raised a hand, Indian
fashion, and kept his peace.</p>

<p>"Know this country?" asked Major Bob.</p>

<p>"Ort to," responded the man. "Yallerstone Bill be my
name."</p>

<p>Major Bob signalled to San Saba, meanwhile pursuing his point.
"Then you'll know in what direction is the junction of Red Willow
Creek with the Little Missouri."</p>

<p>"If you be goin' thar," replied the plainsman, "ye sh'd of
turned due west couple days back."</p>

<p>San Saba arrived in time to overhear this and immediately
spoke up. "They's a table-topped butte with red streaks
hereabouts, ain't they, suh?"</p>

<p>The plainsman spent one very short and noncommittal glance on
the foreman. "Dunno of any."</p>

<p>Major Bob's face turned unexpectedly harsh. "Will you guide
us?"</p>

<p>The man nodded after a little reflection. San Saba again broke
in, a trace of heat in his words, "Major, suh, it strikes me
oth'wise," but Major Bob shook his head.</p>

<p>"We'll depend on this man. Forward, now. By Godfrey, we have
lost time! Forward."</p>

<p>San Saba held himself very straight. "Suh, if yo' mean to
doubt my..."</p>

<p>The Major cut him short. "Never mind&mdash;never mind! Get
back with the herd!"</p>

<p>The long line of cattle formed a dun-coloured crescent across
the prairie. The speed increased, dust rose higher. And still
Major Bob was unsatisfied, ranging back impatiently. Tom saw the
mood of angry recklessness riding his father then, and it was
with something akin to a shock that he discovered the same
stirring impulse in himself. And when Lispenard, who seemed to
hold himself aloof these days from all men but the foreman, came
up with a subdued warning&mdash;"I'd trust San Saba sooner than I
would that tough-looking fellow"&mdash;Tom broke in with unusual
curtness.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust San Saba out of my sight, Blondy."</p>

<p>"Oh, look here! He's my friend, and I don't like to hear that
said behind his back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then," said Tom, "you are at liberty to tell him I made the
statement."</p>

<p>They left the level prairie behind, wound in and out of what
seemed to be an old buffalo trail through the black, tree-studded
hills. The guide kept almost out of sight, never stopping. Hour
after hour, on the trail long before light until long after dusk.
It even wrung a dismal groan from Quagmire.</p>

<p>"They say death is a long sleep. Mebbe that's why we ain't
doin' none of it now."</p>

<p>But the day at last came when the guide poised himself on a
ridge and waited for them to catch up. Major Bob galloped ahead,
beckoning to the men nearest him. When Tom arrived, the guide was
pointing to the west. "Thar she is."</p>

<p>The rugged land formed a kind of bowl, the bottom of which
made an isolated valley. In the distance, one side of the bowl
gave way to the banks of the Little Missouri. Directly across the
grassy plain ran a creek, sparkling under the sun. Cottonwoods
fringed the edge of the distant rive and above the trees wavered
a spiral of smoke. That caught and held their attention. Major
Bob studied it long and in tently. "Must be Big Ruddy's
fire."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it won't be that," muttered Tom. "Look over to the
right&mdash;right where the ridge breaks into small pockets."</p>

<p>Cattle! Cattle browsing peacefully along the slopes. And by
their number and the compactness of their position it seemed to
indicate they had only been thrown on the land a little while
before. Major Bob rose in his stirrups, shaded his eyes. When he
swung to the others there was danger in his eyes. In passing, his
glance fell upon the foreman and rested there one long, grim
moment. San Saba appeared to catch up his muscles, to draw off;
his features became pinched. But the Major had nothing to say to
him at that time. "Quagmire," he cried, "get back and bring the
crew! Bring them with their guns! By Godfrey, if anyone's jumped
this valley from me they'll have to fight! Come on!"</p>

<p>It was not the guide's fight, and he let them go. Three
together&mdash;the Major, Tom, and San Saba&mdash;they galloped
down and across the little valley. Grass stood high along the
ponies' legs, the creek was crystal clear; Tom surveyed this
little paradise, acknowledging to himself in a wistful moment
that it was worth driving a thousand miles to possess. All that
man could want was right here, and though the land to either side
might be equally fertile, it didn't seem to him possible there
would be another site as ideal as this. The Major seemed to think
so, too, for his eyes kept roving across the ground, and his head
jerked from side to side as he flung out his few bitter
words.</p>

<p>"I was uneasy about those tracks we saw! Very uneasy! Well,
it's mine by squatter's right. Mine, by Godfrey! If they've
shoved Big Ruddy off they'll have to fight! They'll have to fight
me!"</p>

<p>San Saba lagged, saying nothing at all; his face was quite
set, quite unusually devoid of expression.</p>

<p>They came to a thicket and followed single file through it and
on into the cottonwoods. The path broadened. Tom's eyes saw fresh
ax marks and, as they went onward through the trees, his eyes
discovered a lane leading into a clearing. There were wagons
ahead, the smoke of a fire&mdash;and men standing in a group with
rifles cradled. His father was to the fore and seemed not to see,
so he called out.</p>

<p>"Watch close there. I think they've got a reception
committee."</p>

<p>"They'll have to fight, I tell you!"</p>

<p>A moment later the three of them had left the trees. Sharp
warning fell athwart their path.</p>

<p>"Stop where you are!"</p>

<p>They reined in. In the moment of silence ensuing Tom took in
the whole scene at one sweep. Eight men stood in a semicircle,
each armed. To the front of the group was one who seemed to be in
command&mdash;a short, paunchy gentleman with grizzled whitish
hair and an excitable face. They had not been here long, for a
dozen freshly peeled logs were rolled in a pile, the beginning of
a cabin. Beyond the clearing were the banks of the Little
Missouri. Still farther beyond stretched the naked hills. It was
all very peaceful&mdash;all save this crew who stood so stolidly
by their guns.</p>

<p>Major Bob was in a thundering temper, yet he mustered a
semblance of courtesy. "And why, sir, this exhibition of
guns?"</p>

<p>The paunchy gentleman spoke in rapid-fire phrases. "Hell's
pit! You come swarming in on me like renegades! Got to watch out
for 'em. Country's full of that kind. If you're peaceable, I'll
down guns."</p>

<p>"What outfit are you?" shot back Major Bob.</p>

<p>"Colonel Jefferson Wyatt&mdash;Diamond W. Migrated from Texas.
Sir, I believe I hear the Southern accent in your speech. To whom
am I indebted..."</p>

<p>Major Bob broke through this parley. "Don't you know you are
jumping my grass?"</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried Wyatt, turning purple. "By the whiskers of St.
Anthony, that's a fine come-ye all! Your grass? Why, curse me,
it's free grass, not your grass! Territory of Dakota belong to
you? Not by a bag full of shot!"</p>

<p>Major Bob seemed to grow calmer as the interview progressed,
and Tom knew this to be an ominous sign. "I lay not claim to the
territory of Dakota, Colonel Wyatt. But I most assuredly lay
claim to this ground. I had my men locate it last year. I kept
one man on it to hold my title. That man is here. He represents
me. You will have to move, sir."</p>

<p>Colonel Wyatt barked out, "Where is your man, then, eh? Where
is your man, if you had one here?"</p>

<p>"I do not see him, very true," admitted Major Bob, every
syllable dripping formal politeness. "It may be, sir, you can
produce him quicker than I could."</p>

<p>"'Postles and prophets!" shouted Wyatt. "You are trespassing
on my honour, sir! Now, look here. If you had any man on the
ground, he ought to leave some mark. D'you see blessed sign of
improvement, a single scrap to indicate. Any cabin, any sheds?
You know you don't. But I will tell you something more, sir. I
will tell you I had <i>two</i> men here these three months,
waiting for me. Now, let's see what they say. Anse&mdash;Rob,
step up."</p>

<p>Tom's attention never left Wyatt's face. That anger might be
real. Probably it was real, for the man seemed to have little
control of his temper. And yet it seemed to him there was a
furtive watchfulness in those shifting black eyes. When he
summoned his two punchers it smacked a little of stage play, as
did his examination of them.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, did you see any man on this ground when you came
here for me? Answer straight now. I'll have no lies out of
<i>my</i> camp."</p>

<p>One of the two took it upon himself to reply a surly, "Nope.
Saw nary a soul."</p>

<p>"There you are. I will not say, sir, that you had no man. But
I will say that if you <i>did</i> have one here, he mos'
assuredly skinned out. That's not my fault. I will remind you
again it is free grass. First come, first served."</p>

<p>He was on the point of adding more, but the appearance of the
rest of the Circle G crew threw him into plain uneasiness. With
one arm he motioned his own men to spread farther apart, at the
same time warning Major Bob, "No more about it. I'll stand on my
rights. Don't want no trouble, now. You had better withdraw your
men."</p>

<p>"I am going to have a look," decided Major Bob calmly. And
suiting the action to the word he rode toward the river.</p>

<p>Wyatt moved over, spreading his arms. "You will do no such
thing. My word is good enough for you. Get off my land."</p>

<p>Major Bob leaned forward with just a piece of a smile on his
face. "I will ride to that river, sir, or I will blow every man
in your crew to pieces. Step aside!"</p>

<p>Tom had been watching the crew for the first open sign of
hostility, and there was something on the remote corner of his
vision that bothered him. Something to the left, beside a wagon.
He ventured a swift glance in that direction, to discover the
girl of the prairie, the girl who had called herself Lorena,
standing with one hand grasping a pistol. And yet every line of
her small and boyish figure seemed to reveal that she would never
use the gun, that she hoped only to be unobserved. When she found
that Tom was looking directly at her, her pistol sagged and
dropped and the hand came upward by slow degrees until it rested
against her bosom; her cheeks were bereft of their pinkness; all
her features were pretematurally sharp and sober. She was rigid,
like some small animal on the verge of flying for shelter if
discovery came too close.</p>

<p>Challenge thrust upon challenge. Colonel Wyatt was shaking his
grizzled locks; yet for all his determination he was quite pale.
"I repeat, I will not permit you to come another step. My word as
a Texan gentleman&mdash;we know nothing of your man. Not a thing!
Stay back, sir!"</p>

<p>"I am not questioning your word, sir," replied Major Bob, more
precise than ever. "I only expressed a wish to see the river. I
shall see it."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind. Men, see to your guns!"</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Major Bob, and he turned to his own crew. "I am
going to the river. The first one of them that raises weapon you
will kill. After that, answer them bullet for bullet." And he
rode forward.</p>

<p>"Take aim!" cried Wyatt, trembling visibly.</p>

<p>Tom moved in the saddle. "Stop it! There'll be no fight. Come
back here, Dad. It's their argument."</p>

<p>The Major swung around. "And how is it their argument?"</p>

<p>"What if Big Ruddy did pull out on us? It's too small a prop
to start a fight on. There's got to be more proof than that to
kill men. Let it go. If it is free grass, it's their grass
now."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to offer, Son?"</p>

<p>Tom's arm raised toward the girl; and from the manner of the
Major's glance it was plain he had not seen her before. Silence
hung oppressively over the clearing, a silence in which Tom
distinctly heard Colonel Wyatt's breath rise and fall. A stubborn
man, yet made of shoddy material. As for the crews, they sat
quietly&mdash;faded and weatherbeaten figures ready to fight on
the spot.</p>

<p>The silence was at last broken by Lispenard's murmured
astonishment. "My word&mdash;a beauty! A beauty out in all this
desolation!"</p>

<p>Major Bob lifted his hat to the girl and turned his horse. Not
a word, not so much as a change of a single muscle to indicate
the tremendous disappointment. At his gesture the Circle G swung
about and took the path back toward the valley; and it would have
been a wordless withdrawal had not the girl, suddenly coming to
life, sprung away from the wagon, pointed her finger at San Saba,
and cried out:</p>

<p>"San Saba&mdash;you're a renegade cur!"</p>

<p>To a man, the Circle G riders whirled. Wyatt cursed his
daughter. "Shut your fool mouth or I'll knock your teeth down
your throat!"</p>

<p>"I've got no use for a traitor," said she stubbornly. "That
man never did a decent thing in his life!"</p>

<p>San Saba sat in his saddle like a sack of meal, not meeting
the girl's accusing face; a trace of colour tinged the sallow,
malarial cheeks, and once he swept his own crew with what seemed
to be fear. All attention was upon him, and he appeared to find
it necessary to speak. So, venturing one brief look at Major Bob,
he defended himself.</p>

<p>"I've done my duty by this outfit. Nobody's got a call to give
weight to anything <i>she</i> might say."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Tom. And again they passed down the trail.
Not until they were completely out of the valley and on the ridge
overlooking their own cattle did Major Bob pull himself from his
profound reverie. "My heart was set on that location. I studied
this country from end to end. There'll never be another like
it."</p>

<p>San Saba tried to soften the Major's attitude. "Well, it's
tough. But they's plenty more land in Dakota, suh. Just as
good."</p>

<p>"There'll never be another piece like it," reiterated Major
Bob.</p>

<p>The guide filled his pipe and spoke emphatically. "That be
right. But since ye was beat out, foller me and I'll show'ee
another spot. It ain't the same, but I reckon it'll pass
muster."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," directed Major Bob. He had nothing more to say,
either that day or the half of the next that they were on the
trail. It seemed he wrestled with some bitter problem, a problem
that he worried over and over in his mind, trying to reach a
conclusion. Whatever the nature of his thoughts, he displayed no
outward signals, but Tom made a shrewd guess, and when sunset
came he drew Quagmire aside and spoke a brief phrase. Between the
two of them they saw the night through, and never for a moment
was San Saba beyond the range of their attention.</p>

<p>It was noon of the following day when the guide halted some
twenty miles distant from their original destination and pointed
at the rugged land ahead. "Thar she be. Water an' grass. Little
Mizzoo off yonder two miles."</p>

<p>Major Bob no more than glanced at it. "Very well. Tom, look
after things. Throw off the herd. Better ride along a piece and
find a place fit to throw up cabins." Then his attention turned
to San Saba and his voice filled with tremendous energy. "San
Saba, come with me."</p>

<p>San Saba threw up his little head, the tinge of red filming
across his pupils. It appeared for a moment that he meant to
refuse. But in the end he nodded briefly and followed Major Bob
over the ridge. Tom watched them go, stirred by an almost
irresistible impulse to pursue the pair. Quagmire must have felt
the same emotion, for he crowded toward Tom, muttering, "I'd
never trust that gent to my back. I never would."</p>

<p>"No," acquiesced Tom. "But it's Dad's play right now. I can't
interfere."</p>

<p>There were other things to do, and he beckoned Quagmire to
come with him across the rolling ground on a tour of inspection.
It might have been twenty minutes later when they heard the
single gunshot come rolling over the ridge, and at the sound of
it both their horses turned and raced northward in the direction
whence it came. Quagmire shouted at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"By God, I told yo' I wouldn't trust..."</p>

<p>"Stay back, damn you!" cried Tom. "It's my quarrel now!"</p>

<p>Quagmire reined in, a figure of wrath. Tom raced on up the
ridge and down the farther slope. He had less than a mile to go,
and he knew the answer to that shot before he slipped from the
saddle and went running toward the single figure sprawled on the
ground. It was his father; his father trying to hold himself up
on an elbow, the blood staining his shirt front and a dimming
light flickering from his deeply set eyes. At that precise moment
Tom never knew what words came rioting out of his throat, but
they caused Major Bob to shake his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"He's out of sight now. Never mind going after him. The world
is a short and narrow trail for a murderer. I'm done. Gave him a
fair break, but he played crooked. Bend down, Son..."</p>

<p>"Which way did he ride? Oh, by God, I'll tear his black heart
out of his ribs!"</p>

<p>"In due time, Son. In due time. But I want your promise on
that. You'll get him?"</p>

<p>"You've got it!"</p>

<p>"Well, the old flame's in you, Tom. I thought maybe the East
had about killed it. Some girl took the sap out of your heart.
Watched you on the trail. Wasn't the same boy I'd sent East.
Don't go back there any more. Stick to your country&mdash;good
country for men of our kind. We've got to have air to
breathe."</p>

<p>He had only a few words left, and he nursed them along
carefully. "Get him. Not just out of spite, Tom. But the Lord
hates a traitor, and there ain't any room in the world for his
kind. I gave him a fair break. The fool&mdash;I knew some of his
past history, but I didn't know he was hooked up with Wyatt on
this deal. He's always been a good foreman&mdash;and I'll forgive
a man anything if he does his work well. Trusted him too far.
Listen, my boy, it's your Circle G now..."</p>

<p>He stopped, peering at a sun that grew darker for him; a sun
he would never see again. "Your Circle G. Good brand. I made it.
Carry it on. Something tells me you'll have to fight to hold it.
Never mind. Carry it on. That girl&mdash;she called the turn on
San Saba. Spunky kid. Listen. When you go after San Saba, watch
for a trick. Pay no attention to the gun in his holster. He
carries another&mdash;in his armpit. Got me that way."</p>

<p>After that, the interval of silence was longer. "One of man's
duties is to live so's he won't be afraid to die. I'm not afraid.
But, by Godfrey, I hate to go! Takes a long time to understand
it's a beautiful world. Better make Quagmire your foreman. Good
man. Just give me another ten minutes..."</p>

<p>But the angel of death was already laying a cloak over him,
leading his spirit down that infinite corridor whither all mortal
creatures travel. He gripped Tom's hand, whispering out of the
remote distance, "Takes a little bit of Texas blood to christen a
new country. I'll&mdash;tell&mdash;your mamma..."


<hr><h2><a name="ch6"></a>6. AN ADVOCATE OF TROUBLE</h2>

<p class="first">MAJOR BOB was buried at sunset on a knoll just
back from the river. And after the subdued moment of farewell,
his name was completely erased from the lips of the crew. Nor
would they ever again utter it until time had made a tradition of
his memory. Grimly the men went about the infinite chores ahead
of them; Tom walked into darkness and was not seen again that
night by a living soul. For him there would be always the ring of
his father's last words, the memory of the promise he had made.
Yet, like the rest, he would give no sign of what that crashing
moment of disaster had meant to him. This was a land of the
living, a land wherein men displayed a firm countenance to the
world and kept their emotions locked away in deep vaults. Not
that they were unfeeling or unemotional, for, if the truth were
told, the members of that outfit possessed beneath their rough
exteriors a womanlike sense of delicacy. But to have openly
showed it would have been a confession of weakness. And weakness
was fatal.</p>

<p>Of all the outfit Lispenard was the only one to transgress the
rule of silence. Possessing no sense of loyalty toward the Circle
G, the whole affair left him unmoved. In fact it struck him as
being grimly grotesque, a parody on a play he had once seen back
East. And he utterly missed the significance of the crew's
holding aloof from Tom that night. At supper he marked Tom's
absence, and it made him suggest that the cook bang the pan a
little louder. "Nobody likes cold beans and coffee."</p>

<p>Not a word was said in answer, and presently, irked by the
unresponsiveness, he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I used to think a man was batty when he got to the stage of
talking to himself. Now I know different. Either I talk to myself
or I howl at the moon like a poisoned wolf. Ever hear that
story..."</p>

<p>Quagmire flung his emptied tin plate on the ground so hard
that it skipped into the fire. "Oh, shut up! Ain't you got a lick
of sense?"</p>

<p>Lispenard reared his head, and the sudden access of fury
within him made his heavy lips tremble. He would have called
Quagmire to account on the spot save that every eye was bent upon
him in cold disfavour; it was the same expression he had met with
ever since the second day from Dodge. He had no friends in that
outfit, and well he understood the fact. If San Saba were only
here now...At the thought he called himself to account. The
foreman was a murderer and a fugitive. No, that wasn't exactly
so, according to Western standards. San Saba had only exercised
his privilege of shooting first; the man had gotten good and
tired of the oppressive Circle G atmosphere&mdash;just as he,
Claude Lispenard, was beginning to tire of it. And San Saba had
been man enough to give vent to his feelings. The Blond Giant
mildly applauded him for the act. Rising, he walked into the
shadows. According to the Western code, a man was responsible
only to his conscience, and at the thought Lispenard grinned up
to the sky. It was a comforting thought, especially to one whose
conscience had always chafed a little under restraint. A
comforting thought.</p>

<p>"By George," he muttered. "I like this country. Not all the
cursed work and grit of a cattle herd, but I like the free-and-
easy idea. Some of these days I'll drift away on my own hook.
After I get better acquainted with that little spitfire. Wasn't
she a beauty, though!"</p>

<p>Dawn and work. Let dead men rest; this land laid down its
challenge&mdash;struggle or be defeated. And in the subsequent
two days Tom Gillette recalled the ominous phrase his father had
voiced. "Something tells me you'll have to fight to hold it." So
it would be. To begin with, this little corner of Dakota seemed
more barren than almost any piece of ground they had traversed.
The water holes were few and already dry. The bluffs of the river
admitted but two trails down to water level within a space of ten
miles. So much for summer; when winter came he prophesied he
would lose many cows in the boxlike draws that broke the rugged
surface.</p>

<p>"I'll do no more exploring," he murmured. "Here we camped and
here we stay."</p>

<p>Lispenard, riding glumly alongside, bent an ironic glance at
his companion. "What was that subterranean threat?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Aha! The abysmal silences of a strong man. Volcanic emotions
beneath an iron mask. Really, Tom, I'm beginning to falter. A set
of building blocks would afford me the thrill of a lifetime."</p>

<p>"You'll come out of it, Blondy."</p>

<p>The Blond Giant swore irritably. "Good Lord, don't talk as if
I were a kid to be humoured. I'm twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Then act like it," replied Tom. But he followed this by
laying a fraternal arm across the man's shoulder. "Just forget
that, Blondy. We all get short tempered now and then. Best way is
to keep a tight tongue."</p>

<p>Lispenard drew away from Tom's arm and rode along silently.
Tom, sweeping the terrain, saw a dust cloud kicking up to the
east, and for the next half hour he watched it trail up and down
the ridges, coming nearer. Presently the figure of Lorena Wyatt
became visible, riding like an Indian. The Blond Giant's whole
attitude instantly changed.</p>

<p>"By gad, there's our prairie flower! Tom, for the Lord's sake
introduce me&mdash;introduce me! Did you ever see so compact a
little beauty?"</p>

<p>She drew up and waited until they had approached, her face
maintaining a gravity that her black eyes were forever
threatening to dispel. She had but one noncommittal glance for
Lispenard's sweeping bow and his broad smile. It was to Tom she
paid attention.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you alone a moment," said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," protested Lispenard, "we're blood brothers.
Cross my heart if that's not the literal truth. Am I to be denied
the sunlight altogether?"</p>

<p>A swift glance flashed between the girl and Tom. She
straightened in the saddle and waited; Lispenard tarried, still
smiling. "Formal introductions seem to be <i>de trop</i> out in
these broad stretches. Who am I to fret over the fact? My lady,
you have one more humble servant. Fact..."</p>

<p>"Have you no manners?" interrupted the girl scornfully.</p>

<p>That stopped the Blond Giant and, for all his sunburnt colour,
a flush spread over his cheeks. "Manners? Oh, come. Who is there
to judge manners out here? This is no drawing room, is it?"</p>

<p>"Most Easterners make that mistake," said she. At which Tom
turned to Lispenard and cut off further parley. "Stay here." He
and the girl rode along the prairie a hundred yards or so before
she came to a halt.</p>

<p>"I've heard. Oh, I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>"Thank you for that."</p>

<p>She hurried on. "I never knew until we got to the river that
the two outfits were racing for the same spot. San
Saba&mdash;he's crooked, he's a born traitor! If I'd had any idea
he was with you I'd have warned you."</p>

<p>He turned that over in his head. "Would you have told me even
against your father's will?"</p>

<p>Storm swept out of her small body. "I would! I hate
crookedness, I won't stand for it. Dad hired him&mdash;I don't
know why&mdash;some years ago. Kept him even after I wanted to
fire the man off the ranch. If I had been a man I'd have used a
gun on San Saba. He's a snake. There's been things lately that
have made me suspect..."</p>

<p>But her sense of honesty came in conflict with an ingrained
loyalty, and she stopped a moment, proceeding wistfully. "When I
saw you near Ogallala and gave you just my first name, it
wasn't&mdash;it wasn't because I was trying to conceal anything.
I just wanted to tell you that."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "You couldn't be crooked."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she demanded with that characteristic frank
curiosity.</p>

<p>The sunlight made a playground of her face, sparkling against
the black eyes, losing itself in the dark hair beneath the hat
brim and in the hollow of her throat. Most women he knew, looked
out of place in riding habits, no matter how fashionable. But
this girl, dressed in the roughest of men's clothes, couldn't
hide the rounding freshness of her body or the upthrust of
vitality that came with every gesture and word.</p>

<p>"I know it," said he.</p>

<p>She appeared suddenly confused and dropped her eyes, whipping
her quirt across the saddle skirts. "A woman can ask some foolish
things," said she. "That's why I'd like to be a man. Anyhow, I
wasn't trying to rope any information out of you."</p>

<p>"We're going to be good neighbours," drawled Tom.</p>

<p>"Just you know it," she said with a lift of her chin. "It's a
darn big country to be fighting in. Or&mdash;to be lonesome in."
She nodded toward Lispenard, who sat moodily in the distance.
"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"An old Eastern friend of mine."</p>

<p>She smiled, a frank, sweet smile that seemed to ask pardon.
"Then I'm sorry for having been so abrupt with him. I thought at
first he was just&mdash;just another specimen. There's plenty of
them nowadays. Just tell him, though, that manners are always
welcome."</p>

<p>"He's got much to learn."</p>

<p>"Haven't we all?" she asked. And the two of them looked at
each other until the girl's horse moved restlessly. She raised
her small compact shoulders, gathering in the reins. "If ever I
hear of San Saba I'll let you know. So-long."</p>

<p>"So-long."</p>

<p>She fled across the uneven ground and disappeared. Tom
returned thoughtfully to his companion, and they cruised
homeward. Lispenard held his own counsel as long as he could,
which was no great length of time:</p>

<p>"Well, what's it all about? What's the secret?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," drawled Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, by gad! Tommy, I'm truthful when I say this Western
taciturnity galls me like the devil! Have you forgotten all the
old fraternal confidences?"</p>

<p>Tom Gillette had not meant to reveal the conviction that had
matured in his head over the long northern drive. Nevertheless,
it slipped out now. "Blondy, the time for that is all behind us.
The time and the place as well. Men change&mdash;all things
change."</p>

<p>"I have sensed as much," replied Lispenard drily. "A severance
of diplomatic relations, as it were?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all," said Tom. "Our past four years were years
for talking. From now on it is the time to be doing. God knows
there's plenty of that ahead."</p>

<p>Lispenard relapsed into one of his sullen spells; his big lips
were splayed in a kind of a pout and his whole face mirrored
dissatisfaction. At the chuck wagon he abruptly left Tom and had
nothing more to do with him all the day. As for Tom, he regretted
speaking out as he had done, and he would have made
amends&mdash;save that he couldn't make headway against the
conviction that his one-time friend was in the process of a
mighty transformation; that the man's impulses for good and
bad&mdash;always hitherto more or less evenly matched&mdash;were
being forged by some kind of internal fire. The dominant traits
would triumph, the lesser ones would crumble. Tom was afraid of
the result; he had more than once wished Lispenard were back East
where the restraints of a more complex social order would take
hold.</p>

<p>Quite promptly more important affairs put the man from his
mind. Foremost was the matter of getting some legal claim to
water rights along the river. Next was to get trace of San Saba.
Then cabins and pens were yet to be built against fall and
winter. Leaving Quagmire in charge of this last chore, Tom struck
out for town, thirty miles north, early next morning. The route
led him down the river until he was within Wyatt's new range,
then across a ford and over the undulating prairie. By eleven he
was at Nelson, seeking out a surveyor.</p>

<p>Nelson was a cattle town on the boom. Along the solitary
street ranged a double row of buildings not yet old enough to
have lost the sweet, aromatic pine smell, and at the same time
old enough to have received a baptism of bullet holes through the
battlemented fronts. But one structure boasted paint; and
naturally enough this was the saloon. At the end of the street
three or four tents were up; beyond marched the prairie. Railroad
tracks skirted one side, and a depot squatted a hundred yards
distant, a little removed from which were rows of cattle-loading
pens. Considering the size of the place, it seemed crowded this
day as Tom Gillette laid his reins over a rack and cruised slowly
through the street; crowded with every taciturn and picturesque
type of the frontier. Cow hands, nesters, trappers, and Indians
strayed from the adjoining reservations, each man wearing
whatever suited his taste, from buckskins to four-point Hudson
Bay blanket capotes.</p>

<p>Tom finally found a surveyor and described his location along
the river. "What I want is the section, township, and range
lines, so that I can find them on the land-office plats. After
that I want you to come over to my place and lay off the
corners."</p>

<p>The surveyor, whose skin was like a piece of yellow cloth long
faded in the sun, explored his maps. "That ford you say is in
front of your place must be Sixty Mile Crossing. And sure it is.
Well, then"&mdash;writing a set of figures on the back of an
envelope&mdash;"there will be your claim. 'Tis the fourth man you
are who has come to me this week on the same business along that
river. The country is settlin' up, make no mistake. You
understand, of course, that this land all lies along the river.
Back from it the country is open and unsurveyed. You've got only
squatter's right there."</p>

<p>"That's all that's necessary just so I get legal claim to my
water right. The rest is safe enough on squatter's right."</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;to be sure," relpied the surveyor. There was
a lingering note of doubt in his words, and Tom tried to pin him
down.</p>

<p>"Well, where's the catch?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the surveyor, winking. "And where is the catch?
I'd like to know it as well. I'm sayin' nothin', mind me. Uncle
Sammy is a grand uncle, but it happens sometimes he's short-
sighted. Some o' his nephews an' adopted sons ain't above
cheatin' him. Never mind. You want me to come out, then? All
right&mdash;I'm all-fired busy, but I'll make it tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Good enough," said Tom, rising. But the surveyor gave him a
sly glance, murmuring:</p>

<p>"D'you happen to know who might be your neighbour on the north
side o' the river?"</p>

<p>"Directly across from me, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Directly across? I can see you ain't long in the country. Not
only directly across from you, but in every direction your eye
might happen to extend. Up and down the north side a good hundred
miles. Mebbe fifty miles in depth. Dunno, eh? I will be tellin'
you."</p>

<p>His mouth closed like a rusty trap. Tom fancied he could even
hear the surveyor's jaw muscles squeak with the sudden action.
Through the open door of the surveyor's office walked a compactly
built fellow wearing Eastern clothes and a stiff-brimmed hat. His
was a pleasant face&mdash;or one upon which pleasantness had been
forcibly imprinted. There was nothing much about him to catch the
eye, no singularities of habit or gesture. He looked at the pair
with a faint smile, raising his arm.</p>

<p>"Hope I'm not intruding."</p>

<p>The surveyor's left eyelid, turned away from the newcomer,
fluttered at Tom. "Now, it's the same old politeness, Mister
Grist. I was just tellin' this man he'd be havin' you for a
neighbour. Might as well be gettin' acquainted. Mister
Gillette&mdash;another Texan&mdash;will be facin' you at Sixty
Mile Ford from now on until..."</p>

<p>"Until what, you mysterious Irishman?" asked the newcomer,
still amiable.</p>

<p>But the surveyor shook his head. "I'd better be mindin' my own
business. Sure. Mister Gillette, this gentleman's name is Barron
Grist. He's resident agent&mdash;ain't it a fancy name for a
foreman?&mdash;of the P.R.N. Land Company. It's the P.R.N. your
eyes will get weary with lookin' at on the north side of the
Little Mizzoo."</p>

<p>Tom shook hands with Grist, the man offering him a limp grip.
"You Texans certainly are swarming north this season, Here we
were, a wild set in a wild land. And all of a sudden here comes
the great migration. Oh, well, we couldn't expect to have it to
ourselves forever. Who led you Texans out of Israel?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you," said Tom. "Our Southern
prophets have none to sing their songs."</p>

<p>"Singin', ha!" grunted the surveyor. "Little good singin' will
do a livin' soul in this country."</p>

<p>Grist laughed. "Don't let this purveyor of scandal influence
you too much, Mr. Gillette. I bear a bad name in this country,
and he'll tell you many things. But as a neighbour I wish you
luck. If at any time I can help you..." Without finishing the
sentence he nodded and backed out. The surveyor winked
portentously.</p>

<p>"Mark him well," said he. "Whether you want it or not, you'll
have business with him. Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"I didn't know land was valuable enough to speculate in,"
offered Tom.</p>

<p>The surveyor passed him another knowing glance. "Land? Well,
it ain't land the P.R.N. profits by. It's cattle. Eastern money
back of it. They've got a beef contract with the gov'ment.
Deliverin' all their stuff to the Indian agencies. The redskins
have got to be fed now that we've licked 'em and corralled 'em on
reservations."</p>

<p>"Sounds profitable," mused Tom.</p>

<p>"It's rotten with profit," broke in the surveyor with a trace
of energy. "Now, you'll be thinkin' to try that scheme, eh?
Forget it. Takes a pull to land a beef contract. No, it's
cattle&mdash;not land. But they're hell on wheels to get all the
range they can. I'm tellin' you. Beg, borrow, and steal. How they
get title to all this unsurveyed stuff is beyon' me. But they do.
An' moreover, they put dummy homesteaders on every piece they can
north o' the river. See?"</p>

<p>"But not south of the river in my country?"</p>

<p>The surveyor shook his head. "Guess it's a policy o' theirs
not to bother with that country. Not now at least. But the way
they're spreadin' it looks as if they mean to corral half of
Dakota."</p>

<p>"I'm obliged," said Tom, starting for the door. "I'll see you
on the ranch tomorrow, then."</p>

<p>"So you will." And as a last word, the surveyor added a
warning. "Don't tell the land-office fella any more o' your
business than's necessary. See?"</p>

<p>Tom grinned and turned into the street. Every section had its
gossip, and quite evidently the surveyor fulfilled that function
here. He discounted the man's warning fifty per cent by the time
he had gone a block and an additional twenty-five per cent when
he reached the land office. But after he had seen the official
therein and had wrangled twenty minutes over a host of minor
regulations he dropped the last discount. Petty rulers have a way
of standing on their book of instructions and exercising their
little quota of authority; the land-office agent at Nelson was
inclined to ruffle Tom's fur the wrong way. Later, in the street
again, he swore mildly to relieve his anger, mailed a pocketful
of eastbound letters, and came squarely against his next piece of
business.</p>

<p>It was a grim business, this canvassing of saloon keepers and
merchants. Each time he put the question to them he understood he
sowed another seed of trouble. It would be public knowledge
within the hour that he sought San Saba, and thus a public feud
was developed and nurtured. Nevertheless, he pursued the search
until the train whistled across the desert and the town abandoned
its chores and went out to the depot. At that point he gave up,
got on his horse, and left Nelson. The engine dragged its string
of cars to the depot and stopped, panting like a dog after a long
chase. Smoke billowed from its funnelling stack. A scattering of
gunshots announced the civic greeting, and a bell clanged through
the sultry air.</p>

<p>From a distance Tom watched the train disgorge its travellers,
then went on. And not until he was halfway home did it strike him
he had avoided putting the question to the likeliest of all
people&mdash;the United States Marshal. Why not? According to
Eastern standards it should have been his first move. Weren't the
law and the officers of the law for the purpose of maintaining
justice? Theirs was the right to seek and&mdash;and perhaps to
kill&mdash;San Saba. It wasn't his right.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, he knew the argument from end to end. And throughout
four or five years it had become a part of his belief. Yet how
swiftly the West had reclaimed him&mdash;how strong was the grip
of the frontier code! A man must take care of his own quarrels,
never delegate them. To shirk this was to confess weakness. And
that weakness would follow him like an accusing finger wherever
he went. He was the son of his father, a citizen of the land. For
good or bad he had to live according to Western ethics. For good
or bad.</p>

<p>The struggle was so strong in him that he stopped the horse
and turned about, facing Nelson again, wistfully eyeing the
horizon; all very well was this complicated reasoning in a
complicated society. Back there they were sheltered by that thing
they chose to call the law. Out here it was the other way
around&mdash;the law's mantle never quite reached far enough.
Beyond its fringes each man rode as a judge and a jury.</p>

<p>"No," he muttered, "I can't do it. It's my quarrel. I've got
to settle it with San Saba myself. Now or twenty years from
now."</p>

<p>And he went on toward his ranch, well knowing he had at that
point thrown overboard most of what the East had give him.
Somehow he felt the better for it. Life became less difficult;
the face of the wide prairie seemed to be fairer, seemed to say,
"you are mine." The guideposts of his life were few, but they
were distinct, immovable: never to go back on his word; to give
all humans the right to live the way they wished to live in
return for that same right to himself; to uphold this right with
the last breath of his body.</p>

<p><br>The train from the East brought Nelson's mail. And among
other letters was a long set of directions for Barron Grist. He
got these things weekly from the Eastern owners of the P.R.N.,
and usually they were but reminders of old instructions or slight
additions. Going to the hotel with his ranch boss, who had ridden
in a little before, he settled into a chair for a half hour's
hard reading.</p>

<p>"Soon as I get this digested I'll go out with you," he told
the ranch boss. "Wonder they wouldn't quit this nonsense. I know
every syllable before I break the seal."</p>

<p>But he found, from the very first paragraph, that the P.R.N.
had arrived at a new fork in the road and were ordering him to go
out and accomplish certain chores. As he ran into the carefully
detailed pages his smile vanished. Once he glanced up to the
ranch boss with genuine amazement, murmuring, "My God!" Upon
finishing, he sat in a study and, not satisfied, reread the whole
letter. Suddenly he jammed it in his pocket and rose. "Come on,
let's get away from this mess." Together, the pair rode west from
town, following the same path Gillette had taken for a good
distance. The ranch boss kept his peace a good two miles before
asking, "Well, what's the excitement now? More cows, more
contracts?"</p>

<p>Grist answered indirectly. "Sometimes I think those fellows
back East are stark, staring crazy."</p>

<p>The ranch boss, who himself never had owned anything more
valuable than a sixty-dollar saddle, felt he understood
capitalists better than that. "Crazy? Well, I guess not. Not
more'n ten per cent crazy, which is the rate of interest they
risk their dollars on."</p>

<p>Grist shook his head. "The P.R.N. has got to make it twenty
per cent, or consider business very poor. Now, do you know what
they calmly tell me to go and do? Not satisfied with the land
they own or control on the north of the Little Missouri, they've
decided to take in the south side of the river. In other words,
I've got to squat on both banks."</p>

<p>"Just like that," mused the ranch boss. "Just reach out an'
embrace it atween both arms. Don't they know they're about three
months too late to buy or scare the existin' occupants?"</p>

<p>"As to that," replied Grist, "I've got full authority to deal
with the Texans. To purchase or to threaten."</p>

<p>"Do they say 'threaten'?" inquired the ranch boss.</p>

<p>"Of course not. You never heard an illegal sound issue from
that bunch. But I'm supposed to read between lines. That's what I
draw my pay for. Why didn't they spring this a couple of months
earlier? Now I've got to argue and bargain&mdash;and Lord knows
what else."</p>

<p>"That what else part of yore speech is correct," asseverated
the ranch boss, rolling a cigarette. "Lessee&mdash;they's six
outfits south o' the river now. Eapley, Diggerts, Love,
O'Morrell, Wyatt, and Gillette. You'll pay high, Grist."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't worry about spending money," was Grist's
irritable answer. "It's their money, and they don't mind spending
it on land. But it's the definite way they tell me to get it. No
ifs or buts about the matter. Just go and get it. That bunch is
up to something. By Joe, I feel sometimes like pulling out and
letting the other fellow do all this drudgery&mdash;"</p>

<p>The ranch boss chuckled. "You'll think twice on that. Grist.
The pay is plumb too good." He squinted at the sun. "It sure gets
me. Now supposin' they pay the top price for every man's squatter
right. Top prices for every man's herd, to boot. How do they
expect to net a profit? I don't see it. Even sellin' rotten beef
to the gov'ment won't pull 'em out of the red.</p>

<p>"It's not beef," said Grist.</p>

<p>"Then what is it?" demanded the ranch boss. "Gold? Shucks, no.
What else is val'able?"</p>

<p>But Grist had no answer for the question. They had come to a
lower ford of the river, and here he parted from his ranch boss.
"I don't know the answer. All I know is that I've got to get it,
one way or the other. If they won't sell..."</p>

<p>The foreman was very matter of fact about it. "Well, we've
done it afore and we can do it again. Ain't we gettin' good
wages?"</p>

<p>Grist nodded and turned into the ford. "Here goes. Might as
well start early."


<hr><h2><a name="ch7"></a>7. THE NET DRAWS TIGHTER</h2>

<p class="first">THERE met, in the city of Washington, one
summer's night, three men whose names and fortunes stood behind
the P.R.N. Land Company; to wit, Prague, Randall, and Noonan. The
crystal chandelier sent down its refracted light upon the table
by which they sat and across the centre of which was spread a map
of the territory of Dakota. Description of these three is
unnecessary; indeed, they would not have wanted to be described.
For, in spite of the evident luxury of the quarters, the whisky
glasses, and the tapering cigars they had ventured the sodden
heat of the capital city on business of considerable import and
great privacy. None of these three gentlemen had any illusions to
speak of, for they dealt in a traffic that demanded quite
questionable practices. And this very night they were about to
consummate something just a little more questionable than that
which had gone before. At this precise moment, while awaiting a
caller with a distinguished title, they were casting over the
ground to be covered. And like the amiable gentlemen that they
were, no overt word, no incriminating phrase sullied the staid
dignity of their presence.</p>

<p>It was Prague, the florid and substantial and jovial Prague,
who did most of the talking. And it was he whose index finger
traced an imaginary boundary across a strip of western
Dakota.</p>

<p>"You see it, I trust. Dammee, you can see it? Look at all that
land&mdash;and here we have been overlooking the greatest of our
opportunities. It is the venture of a lifetime."</p>

<p>"Entirely legitimate," chimed in Mr. Randall.</p>

<p>"Oh, entirely&mdash;entirely," corroborated Prague with
considerable haste. "At the same time, caution must be observed.
You understand how these things are."</p>

<p>They quite understood. Prague nipped the end from another
cigar and chewed it with the relish that is born of expensive
luxuries. "And it is for that reason, gentlemen, I have made
contact with a&mdash;ah&mdash;er certain person who can
materially aid us."</p>

<p>"Legitimately," quoth Randall.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Prague. "There must be no smell or taint of
illegality about the affair. You know how those things are. And
this&mdash;er&mdash;person is in a position to render us that
particular service which is utterly essential to the
venture."</p>

<p>"Ah," was Mr. Noonan's contribution.</p>

<p>"Then," went on Prague, "we are quite agreed."</p>

<p>And amid the nodded approval the door of the room opened and a
gentleman slipped through, taking care to close the portal behind
him. At once the three rose to their feet with the courtesy due
so illustrious a figure.</p>

<p>It was that gallant tribune, Senator Ignacius I. Invering,
whose tones of patriotic devotion had more than once rung
passionately through the land. They always rang passionately,
these tones, and they were always patriotic. He was a herring-
thin man, the colour of a pressed rose petal, and a stogy
projected skyward from his lips. The stogy was unlighted, for the
Senator had dedicated his health to the service of the nation and
therefore nursed it assiduously. He took off his hat, bowed with
a ceremonial politeness to the assembled three, and amid a
scraping of chair legs and a muttered, "Pleased, Senator," "An
honour from such a distinguished gentleman, Senator," the ice was
broken and the Bourbon gleamed against the light of the
chandelier and vanished on its appointed mission. Senator
Ignacius I. Invering stood, as if poised to flee, while the
others took their seats. One chary eye skittered across the
outspread map and immediately forsook it, quite as if
contaminating influence rested there. Then, in a dry wisp of a
voice he said, "Now, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Prague rose, fingering some papers before him. "You
understand, sir, the nature of our company. That has been
explained to you. Needless to enlarge upon it. All we wanted to
accomplish at this meeting was to present to you formally your
share of stock in the P.R.N. Land Company&mdash;as per previous
agreement."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the Senator, fiddling with his finger
tips.</p>

<p>"Now, it so happens that we are about to declare a dividend.
Quite a happy occasion for us, I'm sure. And we are more than
pleased to announce that the dividend on your number of shares
will amount to&mdash;ah&mdash;ten thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Profitable investment," murmured the Senator.</p>

<p>"Yes. The dividend will be dispatched to you at your office in
the morning."</p>

<p>"In cash," specified the Senator. "You understand. Not that
there is any unscrupulous angle to this. Not at all, sir. But I
have many enemies who would try to trump up a scandal if they
could. A mastiff always has the lesser dogs baying at his
heels."</p>

<p>Prague agreed that this was true and unfortunate, but that
those fearless of duty and pure of spirit had to endure mud
slinging. Then he paused a moment, glanced at his associates, and
went on.</p>

<p>"Now, being a partner of our enterprise, so to speak?"</p>

<p>"A silent partner and quite unadvertised," broke in the
Senator.</p>

<p>"Just so. Being a partner, there are certain affairs in which
you can&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;guide us."</p>

<p>"Precedent for it," said the Senator. "Precedent dating to the
very foundation rock of our union, sir. Quite within a public
official's right to have business interests on the side. Were it
not so, I could hardly serve the nation. Proceed."</p>

<p>"Senator," proceeded Prague with emotion, "you see eye to eye
with us. Now, our business has been the raising and disposing of
cattle to the government for their Indians, in which business you
have so kindly assisted us in the past. But lately we have
conceived an enterprise which will be profitable to us and, we
trust, of signal service to our country."</p>

<p>"Entirely legitimate," murmured Randall piously.</p>

<p>"What we have in mind is this," said Prague, pointing to the
map. "Our holdings abut on the sides of a reservation. Now, as
time goes on, it seems probable the government will need more
lands in that reservation. Therefore, as a public service, we are
willing to sell our holdings to the government at a fair and
decent profit for that purpose. We are also acquiring other near-
by lands in order that small ranchers and settlers will not rob
the government when it wants to acquire additional land. You
understand, sir, we are actuated by business considerations, but
with a thread of altruism also involved. But, being unsurveyed
land, title cannot be acquired to it in
the&mdash;ah&mdash;ordinary way. It would take, say, an act of
congress to give us this title."</p>

<p>Silence. The Senator pursed his lips and twiddled his fingers.
The care of a nation rested heavily upon his frail shoulders.
Heavily but securely. He nodded once&mdash;twice. "A bill
attached as a rider to some appropriation would do the trick.
Yes. I shall see about that."</p>

<p>"I have always said the nation underestimated your worth,"
breathed Prague.</p>

<p>"But," went on the Senator, "you must have possession of the
lands you wish title to. Can't evict squatters. Legal, perhaps,
but dangerous. Cause a stink&mdash;that's the bald word for it.
Must be entirely in your possession. Then no attention would be
focussed on the rider. The less attention the better."</p>

<p>"I think we can adjudicate the matter of squatters," said
Prague. "We shall."</p>

<p>"And then," pursued the Senator, "when you have title, I can
perhaps speed up the government's desire to appropriate your
lands for Indian reservation use. That will be another bill,
later."</p>

<p>There it was, pat and perfect. And since perfection cannot be
improved upon, the four of them drank silently and in comfortable
understanding. The Senator retrieved his hat, the three partners
scrambled to their feet. At the door the Senator swung.
"Remember, you must settle with any squatters on that territory
you wish. See that you are alone in possession. Then send me the
boundary lines and I shall incorporate it into a rider."</p>

<p>Three studious bows. The Senator had one more word. "Caution,
gentlemen. There are those who would tear me limb from limb.
Ravenous beasts, sir. All this is legitimate, legal. But a
reformer will torture the truth to any length. I detest
reformers."</p>

<p>And though he named no names, each of the other three silently
thought of Senator William Costaine, whose beagle nose scented
fraud and corruption at a tremendous distance&mdash;especially if
that fraud and corruption were in the opposite party.</p>

<p>The Senator whisked himself out of the chamber; the three
gentlemen drank with that mellow spirit that comes of deeds well
done. And then Randall drew paper and ink to him and began to
write in a copper-plate hand those directions which Barron Grist,
the resident foreman of the P.R.N., was later to receive, while
about him hovered Prague, adding fodder to those directions from
time to time. "Be sure to make it plain enough that he must
settle with any squatters now on the land we want. Remove 'em.
Make it plain."</p>

<p>"Plain, but legal," agreed Randall. "He will understand."


<hr><h2><a name="ch8"></a>8. EAST COMES WEST</h2>

<p class="first">A MONTH passed, the year turned its apex and
swung down the farther side of its arc. The broiling heat of a
forenoon's sun blasted the land; all things withered beneath it,
all things were turned to a dun and henna colouring. The hardy
pines were coated with a dust that hid their natural greenery,
and they appeared to suffer a suspension of life. Fog stretched
across the horizon, the surface of the river was like glowing
brass. Tom Gillette, from his vantage point a half mile removed,
saw the new Circle G cabins shimmering and rising with the heat
mirage. He turned to Lispenard.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Blondy, it's a fertile land, and we've got our
footing. Let winter come. Let anything come. We can fight."</p>

<p>Lispenard shrugged his shoulders. He was clean shaven once
more, and he had let his yellow hair grow until it fell below his
hat brim, plainsman's style. "Winter? It's a devil of a time to
be thinking of winter, my lad. And why should you be so cursed
proud of a few clap-daubed huts?"</p>

<p>"It means..." began Tom, and then caught the words before they
ran past his lips. After all, Lispenard wouldn't understand how
much those few cabins and corrals meant in a raw country.
Achievement&mdash;security&mdash;the onward march of a dream. So
he murmured, "It means shelter," and let it go at that. He
wondered of late why it was the man seemed to arouse in him a
defensive mood. It appeared that his friend had shaken himself
into a certain state of mind, a kind of taciturn aloofness and a
veiled antagonism that couldn't be penetrated. The old smile and
jest had returned to the Blond Giant, but there was no charity in
either. He had quite distinctly hardened; and he had grown
secretive.</p>

<p>Tom turned about. "I'm going to town. Coming along?"</p>

<p>"No. I want to explore the north side of the river," said
Lispenard. And he grinned. "But give my regards to the prairie
beauty, old man. Ah, touched! Of course I know you'll see her
along the way. I could even tell you where she makes her stand.
Don't you suppose I have ridden over there myself on occasion?
She's a spitfire&mdash;but the time will come when she'll see me
in a better light."</p>

<p>Tom returned the man's smile with a sharp glance, wondering at
the flare of anger he felt. "Still the lady's man, Blondy?"</p>

<p>"It's a weakness," replied his companion. "Give her my regards
and say to her that there are other desirable types of men in
addition to the rockbound and frowning creature tramping across
the footlights."</p>

<p>"What's the nubbin to that, Blondy?"</p>

<p>The Blond Giant raised his shoulders again and spurred off.
Much later, when Tom had gone eastward, he swung to see the man
outlined on the bluff north of the river a moment, then dip from
view.</p>

<p>"What draws him over there so much?" The question stuck to his
mind for several miles and then vanished before a kind of
expectancy. Halfway to the Wyatt range he saw Lorena&mdash;Lorena
loosely poised on her horse and watching him approach. Her hand
swung upward, and of a sudden her pony sprang to life and raced
across the prairie, the girl's compact body weaving from side to
side. Without ceremony she wheeled alongside&mdash;and thus they
rode for a good half mile, saying not a word. Neither of these
people made conversation to order, neither of them seemed to feel
the necessity of it. Presently she waved her arm around the
compass points.</p>

<p>"Guess my dad's fixing to sell out."</p>

<p>"To Grist and the P.R.N.?"</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"He's been after me," replied Tom. "Seems to want this country
pretty bad."</p>

<p>"Then that's why both Eapley and Diggerts have sold. And I
guess we will too." She struck her gauntlet against the saddle,
crying, "I don't want to leave&mdash;I don't want to!" With that
same disconcerting swiftness she faced him. "Are you going to
sell?"</p>

<p>Gillette shook his head. "No, I guess not. Where would I go?
This is my land now. I'm stickin' to it."</p>

<p>"It's the way I feel," she explained wistfully. "But Grist
offered Dad a lot of money&mdash;and where does he think to make
a profit?&mdash;so I think Dad will take it. No idea just where
we will go next. I don't want to leave."</p>

<p>"Corporation money," said Tom, "is cautious money. It may seem
as if they are paying a fancy price, but don't you doubt they'll
get it back twice over."</p>

<p>They came to the lower ford, across which lay the road to
Nelson. The girl studied the sandy earth for a long interval,
then swept Tom's face with a quick and shrewd glance. "I don't
want to go. I won't. If Dad leaves here I'll go to Nelson and
work in the restaurant."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to think of you doing that," protested Tom.</p>

<p>There was another short silence, in which Tom silently
applauded. The girl in the East would have made a marvelous play
of his sentiment. She would have coquetted with him, would have
softly asked, "Would it make any difference to you, Tom, what I
did?" But not Lorena Wyatt. This clear-featured girl&mdash;whose
eyes now and then so arrested and troubled him&mdash;had nothing
of the coquette about her.</p>

<p>She spread her hands apart; the white V of her throat slid
beneath the bandana's knot. "I'm strong. I'm not afraid. What
harm would there be? Oh, I know what you think. You've got all
those queer ideas as to what a lady shouldn't do. But, you see,
I'm not..."</p>

<p>"Don't say it, Lorena." He wasn't aware that he had used her
given name for the first time; and perhaps that explained why he
was so puzzled to find the quick glow in her black eyes. It
bothered him so much that he turned into the ford, calling over
his shoulder. "Blondy sent his regards."</p>

<p>He heard a sound of impatience. "How very kind of him. But you
can tell the gentleman I don't need his company."</p>

<p>Tom's horse took the water, veering aside. And it was then the
quiet of the land was broken by the crack of a rifle, and a jet
of sand shot lip on the bank, just behind horse and rider. The
girl cried an abrupt warning. "Behind the bluffs rim. Above
you&mdash;see the smoke? Come back!" Even before he drew his own
gun she fired at the thin trail of powder smoke eddying from the
summit of the bluff. A second shot ripped the water. Tom bent
over and put the shelter of the pony between himself and the
unseen marksman. The powder smoke was a poor mark, but he threw
two bullets up that way and raced through the deep part of the
ford to the farther bank. He was now in a bad trap, for the trail
led sharply up between a cleft in the bluff, and he was exposed
to whoever lay along that rim and watched him. Still, he galloped
on, hearing the girl crying at him from behind, hearing her horse
splash through the ford. He twisted in the saddle, half angry.
"Don't follow me! Get to shelter!"</p>

<p>His pony took the steep grade at great irregular jumps and
came out on high ground several hundred yards from the edge of
the cliff. He stopped, seeing nothing. The land on this side of
the river was tortured with pockets and folds of
earth&mdash;excellent concealment for the ambusher. Moreover,
this rugged terrain led away to the right into a series of
ridges. Possibly by now the man was retreating. Tom slid from his
horse and spent some time inspecting the ground. The sing of
those bullets had come from the barrel of a rifle; here he stood,
a blessed fine target. So he dropped to a knee as the girl raced
out of the mouth of the cleft and flung herself down beside him.
"Oh, that was foolish!" she lectured him. "He could have killed
you out there in the river! I saw his hat rising up. Made him
duck, too! Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Think he's pulled back for shelter. I'm going over to find
out."</p>

<p>She protested so sharply that he delayed the move. "Supposing
he's still lying in those pockets? He'll kill you the first shot.
Let me ride around to that ridge on the right and scout from the
high ground while you close in. I can keep him entertained if
he's still opposite us."</p>

<p>"No. My Lord, Lorena, this isn't your fight. What made you
cross the river?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, this is a free country, isn't it? You talk like
all the other men! I can take care of myself."</p>

<p>"It's not your quarrel," he repeated, irritable. "Now lie flat
while I inch along."</p>

<p>"If you are going to be that foolish, then I'll circle toward
the ridge."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," was his flat answer.</p>

<p>"I will so!"</p>

<p>That stopped him. Turning on his side he looked back to where
she lay; her eyes were snapping and a rose colour filled her
cheeks. He had never seen her so aroused&mdash;or so striking.
And presently he crept back, reaching for a cigarette and broadly
smiling.</p>

<p>That definitely took the edge from her temper. "Well," she
demanded in a fainter voice, "what are you laughing at? It's a
Chessy cat laugh."</p>

<p>"You'd think we'd been married ten years the way we scrap.
Lorena, don't you reckon I can take care of my own skin?"</p>

<p>"You'd been shot down in the river if I hadn't made him duck,"
said she.</p>

<p>"I'm thanking you for it now."</p>

<p>He said it so gravely and so humbly that her resentment
instantly evaporated. "Well, it was a rash thing to do&mdash;but
I liked it. Tom, I'll apologize."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"When I saw you first I thought you didn't have too much sand.
It's been bothering me&mdash;up till now." She hesitated. "Seemed
to me you rode around sort of doubting yourself. I hated to see
it&mdash;truly I did."</p>

<p>That sharp and certain penetration. He flipped the cigarette
through the air, considerably disturbed. "All right, Lorena. Now,
I've got to pay that gentleman a social visit. You can't cross
the river again until I clear the landscape a little. Do you
think I want to pack a dead girl back to the Diamond W?"</p>

<p>She avoided his face, writing lines in the sandy ground. When
she lifted her eyes it was with so troubled an expression in them
that his amusement vanished. Her sturdy little shoulders rose,
and her arm rested a moment on his wrist. "All right, Tom. I'll
be good. But you watch carefully."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;sure."</p>

<p>He crawled across the rolling earth, scanning the rim of the
hillocks for the mark of a hat brim or the gleam of a gun barrel.
Nothing disturbed the profound stillness of the hot day; when he
arrived at the first depression he slid into it for a brief
moment and studied the flanking angles. The girl was prone on the
ground, between the two horses, her chin cupped in her palms. But
he noted that her revolver rested directly in front of her and
even at the distance he clearly saw the pinched intentness of her
oval face. Crawling up and down the contour he at last slid from
her view, and at once commanded the whole sweep of ground as it
marched to the bluffs edge. Nobody there. He relaxed his
vigilance and circled the area until he found the gouged spots
along the soil where the ambusher's boot heels left their prints;
the fellow had swung from one point to another in his effort to
get a fair shot, and then had fled toward the protecting ridges
on the right. The deep set of the toe and the faint mark of the
heel indicated the hurry he had been in. Probably he'd left a
horse beyond that ridge and now was riding for distant shelter.
Gillette thought about pursuing, but decided against it. That
rough country was an effective cloak for the ambusher; the sun
stood well up in the sky, and he had a long trip to town and
back. No time right now for going on a hunt that might take him
several days. He rose and waved his arm at Lorena. She jumped
into the saddle and galloped toward him.</p>

<p>"He's skipped over there, then," said she, indicating the
ridges. "Going to follow?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No time now. More important business on
tap."</p>

<p>"Do you have an idea who it is?"</p>

<p>"Somebody trying to smoke me out, I reckon."</p>

<p>"San Saba?"</p>

<p>He thought not. "San Saba wouldn't stick to this country with
a price on his head."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure," she warned him. "That man is thoroughly
bad. Snaky."</p>

<p>He grinned. "I'll wait right here till you cross the river.
Friends again, ain't we?" And he extended his arm.</p>

<p>She took it, her hand slipping into his greater one and
resting there a fleeting instant without pressure. The touch of
it disturbed him, and he must have displayed it, for she drew
away and turned to her horse. Five minutes later she rested on
the opposite bank of the ford, her arm raised to him in salute;
then the pony fled over the prairie, and Gillette walked to his
own animal.</p>

<p>As for her, all the pent emotions of womanhood broke down the
barriers she had so carefully preserved and gathered into one
passionate cry. "Oh, if it were only so&mdash;if it only were!
But it isn't! He doesn't see me that way! And I won't trick him!
I hate that! He's got to see it with his own eyes&mdash;and he
never will! Some dam' woman back East hurt him! I'd like to see
her for a minute!"</p>

<p>She raced madly over the swelling earth, her teeth sunk into
the nether lip.</p>

<p>After the girl had gone, Gillette swung away from the Nelson
road and took the high ground along the ridge. He saw nothing to
westward indicating the path of the ambusher. But, within five
miles of town he found the dust rising off the main trail to the
east and made out three horsemen and a buckboard travelling
toward the ford. In town he went directly to the post office for
his mail and then to the surveyor's. But before he reached that
purveyor of gossip he came face to face with Barron Grist, the
P.R.N. agent, and immediately that gentleman drew him aside.</p>

<p>"My proposition," Grist reminded him, "still holds."</p>

<p>"So does my answer," said Gillette. "I like Dakota."</p>

<p>"Man&mdash;there's plenty of Dakota left you. I'm offering a
top price."</p>

<p>The foreman was so pleasant, so friendly that Tom betrayed
himself more than he otherwise would have done. "The price isn't
a consideration," he explained. "Grist&mdash;there's a Gillette
buried on my range. Do you see?"</p>

<p>Grist nodded, thoughtfully impressed. "I admire you for it.
Really I do. But here&mdash;my company wants that strip of
ground. Damnably bad. I'll not mince with you. They want it. Here
I stand with an offer. I'll raise the ante a clear three
thousand, pay you for the beef on your own count&mdash;on your
own count, mind&mdash;and give you your own estimate on the
improvements. You stand to gain from every angle. You're free to
prospect Dakota to the four walls. Anyhow, you've got a poor
piece of range. The poorest on the south side of the river. I'm
only buying you out of a bad bargain."</p>

<p>"Then why should the P.R.N. want it so badly?" questioned
Gillette.</p>

<p>Grist smiled&mdash;an unimpressive, unrevealing smile. "Say,
you can search me. I don't know. I only work for 'em. But they
want it."</p>

<p>"Well, just you write and tell the gentleman back East I'm not
selling."</p>

<p>"Persuasion and money won't do it, eh?"</p>

<p>Gillette marked the added sharpness. "It won't," he
agreed.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," broke in Grist "I've got all the other five
sewed up. Taking 'em over right down to the last can of beans.
Eapley and Diggerts already gone. Rest going. Your nearest
neighbour, Wyatt, will be gone before fall roundup."</p>

<p>"It will leave me the less crowded."</p>

<p>"There's where you are mistaken," said Grist emphatically.
"I'm going to throw cows across the stream until the grass roots
groan. You understand what that means?"</p>

<p>"I presume you're hinting that you'll overcrowd the range. All
right, my boy. But remember, when it comes to starving out beef
you'll lose more cows than I&mdash;because you've got more to
lose."</p>

<p>"And can afford to lose 'em more than you," countered Grist.
He had ceased to smile. "Maybe I'll lose ten to your one. All
right. When you're out three thousand head you're ruined."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking war," said Gillette, taking a grip on his
temper. "Talking war to a Texan. I'll call it. Don't ever think I
won't."</p>

<p>"Up to your limit," agreed Grist. "Then you're wiped out.
Listen, I like you and I hate to see you buck a corporation.
Better take your profit. It's a big one."</p>

<p>"I reckon not."</p>

<p>"Why, damnation, but you're stubborn," muttered Grist, half in
anger, half in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to make it war?" asked Gillette soberly.</p>

<p>Grist studied his man a long while. "It's got to be done," he
finally replied. "I'll obey orders. Else I lose my job. There's
the cards on the table. Yes, by George, it'll be war. You're
foolish. Why force me?"</p>

<p>"I won't. I'll let you fire the first shot. And then, God pity
you, Grist. You never have seen Texans fight. It's not a pleasant
experience."</p>

<p>"I can muster a hundred men," snapped Grist, face muscles
drawing tight.</p>

<p>"Eighty-five more than I've got. I'm repeating&mdash;you don't
know a Texas crew. I'm sorry for you and your job."</p>

<p>"You needn't be." Grist stood a moment, an uncolourful figure
who even at a moment like this could not achieve dignity. "Let it
be so," he murmured, and walked away.</p>

<p>Tom watched the resident agent vanish into a saloon.
Forgetting about the surveyor, he bought a sack of stuff at the
store and started home, following the trail of the buckboard and
the horsemen to the ford. Here, he skirted the high ground before
going into the water. Once across it the buckboard tracks still
kept ahead of him. And when he reached the yard of the Circle G
houses he knew he had visitors.</p>

<p>Quagmire rose up from a corral and ambled toward him. Almost
furtively he motioned toward the main cabin. "She's in
there."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>Quagmire stared dreamily at the sky. "Well, if it ain't an
angel then my ideas o' heaven sure are scandalous wrong."</p>

<p>Tom ducked through the door, almost at the same time
muttering. "Christine&mdash;Kit&mdash;my Lord!"</p>

<p>She was seated in a chair with her hands folded sedately in
her lap and the shadows of the room adding to the soft allure of
her face. As always, she seemed to have taken possession of her
surroundings, to have put herself at ease. She smiled&mdash;that
provocative, enigmatic smile that had haunted him for so many,
many months on the trail, and her cool, half-humorous words, so
gentle and yet so certain, reminded him that he was now what he
had always been, an unsuccessful suitor ill at ease in the
presence of a reigning beauty.</p>

<p>"Well, Tommy, here I am. And you shall pay for neglecting me
so cruelly. No letters, no word. Oh, well, I have swallowed my
pride..." A graceful gesture of a hand finished the sentence. How
subtly she conveyed meaning with those small movements, how many
shades of expression she could weave into the dullest word. He
went forward, took the slim hand that stretched up to him. There
was the slightest pressure in it; it drew him down. "Tommy, you
are the same Western barbarian. But I like you in this setting.
Indeed!"</p>

<p><br>Lispenard, upon fording the river, travelled in a direct
line toward the most rugged piece of land within five miles as if
making for a place well known to him. But once lost in the
weblike tangle of pockets and ridges, he proceeded with an
unusual amount of caution; and when the echo of a shot floated
faintly over his shoulder from the rear he instinctively ducked.
Then he turned about, reached a commanding summit, and
dismounted. Flat on the ground he shaded his eyes against the
earth's glare and waited.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. Presently he made out a figure
spurring toward him, travelling as fast as horse-flesh would
allow. From time to time the man fell below a ridge and
momentarily was out of sight, each time reappearing at a
different corner of the compass. Only a man in flight, or a man
extraordinarily cagey would act like that. The Blond Giant traced
him for a good twenty minutes, or until the tall and lank body
had come within hailing distance. And then, though not without a
certain reluctance of movement and a reassuring pat on the butt
of his gun, he crawled to his knees.</p>

<p>If the meeting was to take place it must be before San Saba
got within good revolver range. Up stood Lispenard, one arm
hailing the renegade ex-foreman.</p>

<p>San Saba's horse sat abruptly on its haunches. San Saba's
thin, dust-powdered face screwed into a series of ragged lines.
He made no particular move toward his gun, but his voice, sharp
as the edge of a skinning knife, slit across the interval.
"Well?"</p>

<p>"Oh, drop that," muttered Lispenard. "Don't you know a friend
when you see one?"</p>

<p>The ex-foreman thought on this for a spell, his free arm
akimbo. Lispenard had never before realized just how searching
and cruel one man's glance could be. It touched his nerves.</p>

<p>"How'd yo' know I'd be here?" demanded San Saba.</p>

<p>Lispenard grinned, though his lips were dry and slightly
trembling. "Trailed you for a week. Didn't catch wind of me?
Well, then, I guess I'm not so poor at this sort of thing. Come
on, be neighbourly. I'm not out for your hide. You haven't taken
any of my toys."</p>

<p>For all his treachery, San Saba had grit in his make-up, or
perhaps he read Lispenard well enough to understand. At any rate,
he walked his horse to the top of the ridge and a little down the
farther side before dismounting. Even then he was careless of the
other's presence, his first attention being spent on the skyline
eastward. His hard face relaxed, he squatted and rolled a brown-
paper cigarette, meanwhile studying this unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," mimicked Lispenard. "Hell, San Saba, but you're a hard
fellow to locate. Anyhow, you didn't catch on I was ramblin'
across your trail."</p>

<p>"Don't fool yo'self," murmured San Saba.</p>

<p>Lispenard's satisfaction was destroyed. It made him irritable,
a little sullen. "That being so, why didn't you meet up with
me?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to see what yo' game was."</p>

<p>"Dam' queer you couldn't trust me," grumbled Lispenard.</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;so long as yo' near at hand. Remember what I once
said in Ogallala?"</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;but I was too blessed drunk to catch it.
Explain."</p>

<p>San Saba was not rash with his words. It took time to reach
down and bring out the phrase that at once illumined his own
character and his opinion of the other man's. "Said we was both
rascals an' that it paid rascals to stick together."</p>

<p>Lispenard grinned. "Admirable powers of perception&mdash;and
deception."</p>

<p>"Both good items to have," was San Saba's laconic answer.
"How'd yo' know I was still in the country?"</p>

<p>It was Lispenard's turn to be shrewd. "There's something
sticking in your craw, my boy. And I thought you'd hang around
till you swallowed it."</p>

<p>San Saba's little red eyes were partially curtained behind a
screen of cigarette smoke, but the Blond Giant was startled to
see a film of colour moving across those pupils. The cigarette
suffered destruction; the foreman sighed. "Yo' not such a poor
hand, yo'self, friend. We wouldn't make a bad pair."</p>

<p>"I've thought about that. This sedentary life palls on me. Not
to mention the puritanical atmosphere surrounding the Circle G. I
had enough of that sort of thing back East. Don't appreciate it
out here. My forte is something different."</p>

<p>"Big words," mused San Saba.</p>

<p>"When are you pulling freight?"</p>

<p>"Direct questions ain't stylish," was the man's dry
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Oh, come out of it!" grumbled Lispenard. "If I'm going to
trail with you..."</p>

<p>He felt again the weight of that hard, unfriendly glance. The
light of day was directly in San Saba's eyes, yet it was queer
how little of that light reflected back from the ex-foreman's
face. Something cold and deadly lay coiled behind the brittle,
impassive features; Lispenard had a sudden doubt. The foreman
looked at the Eastern horizon once more; he seemed to be
calculating, his nutlike head bent forward. He rose.</p>

<p>"I'll wait here fo' yo', friend. When yo' come we'll go.
They's still a bone to pick, understan'? But it can wait. Ain't
no hurry. It's a long life."</p>

<p>"Bully. United we stand&mdash;divided we doubt. You'll be
wanting grub, old-timer. Hiding in the hills on an empty belly is
a cursed poor vacation."</p>

<p>San Saba permitted the wisp of a smile to pass his colourless
lips. "Yo' learn fast, friend. I give yo' credit Where'll yo' get
it?"</p>

<p>"I'll drop into Nelson in the morning and load up. See you
here to-morrow at dark. Providing you're not afraid of my
bringing the posse."</p>

<p>San Saba rose. "It's a bet. As to the posse..." He raised and
lowered his thin shoulders, and Lispenard had an uncomfortable
sensation of fitting too snugly with the man's purposes. There
was now and then the hint of death about this character. It
popped out, unsuspected, in those catlike gestures, in the
occasional sidewise flashes of eye. He dismissed the thought. He
outweighed San Saba a full fifty pounds; he had learned something
of the rough and tumble himself. Let San Saba walk the narrow
path with him. He, too, had his plans. San Saba spoke again.
"Then we pull freight, eh, friend?"</p>

<p>"Not to-morrow. Give me a couple more days."</p>

<p>"She's a pretty wench," ventured the ex-foreman.</p>

<p>"Damn your sly tongue, she is," grunted Lispenard. He extended
his arm. "Bargain signed, sealed, and notaried." San Saba's hand
was clammy, there was no pressure to the grip. Lispenard felt the
reservations in that bargain, but he dismissed his fears, got to
his horse, and rode off, flinging back a casual arm. Beyond sight
of the renegade he wiped a drop of sweat from his temple and
grinned.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, I'll have my cake and I'll eat it too. That
gentleman will be good to me. I can be sly as well. And he's an
old enough head to teach me a few things."</p>

<p>He crossed the ford and unsaddled, throwing the horse into a
corral. And when he came inside the door of the main cabin and
saw the girl he threw up both arms in pleased surprise.</p>

<p>"Kit Ballard&mdash;of all the beautiful happenings!"</p>

<p>She bad a brilliant smile for him as he crossed the room and
took both her arms. "Still the same gallant Apollo," said she
gaily. And then, seeing how quiet Tom had turned, she disengaged
her hands. "How like the old times. If we only had another lady
we might put on one of those cotillions."</p>

<p>Lispenard threw his hat across the room. "There is another, by
George! Thomas, I command you to ride over and get the prairie
beauty."</p>

<p>Christine Ballard's smile tightened, though it was wholly
imperceptible to Tom. She threw a swift glance at
Lispenard&mdash;a glance that he perfectly understood&mdash;and
murmured:</p>

<p>"Yes? Tell us about her, Tom. You have been keeping something
from me."

<hr><h2><a name="ch9"></a>9. CONFLICT</h2>

<p class="first">TOM roused himself from a study; and though he
was still a little under the spell of this girl's brilliant,
elusive beauty, he felt a strong irritation at having Lorena
Wyatt's name introduced into the conversation. It put him on the
defensive, and he answered almost curtly, "There is nothing to
tell."</p>

<p>"Ah," murmured Christine, and with her feminine instincts
perceiving the danger signals she turned the subject gracefully.
"It's good to see you, Claudie. The same impetuous hero. Did you
ever know how many hearts you broke with that conquering air of
yours? The figure of romance! Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>Lispenard grinned. "Happy days. Wouldn't it be great sport to
spend that time all over again?"</p>

<p>"No," said she, each word bearing its full burden of
thoughtfulness, "I'm not sure I'd care to." Tom, blunt man as he
was, caught the lingering wistfulness, and it made him the more
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Each day unto itself. Why look backward?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope so," she agreed. Her hand made a slow gesture.
"Claudie, wasn't Tom always the contemplative figure, though?
What was it you men called him&mdash;the barbarian? Why was
that?"</p>

<p>Lispenard rolled a cigarette. "Well, he was always ready to
fight. That overweening Texas honour of his put us all on
nettles. He also had an extremely matter-of-fact way in speaking
of murder and sudden death. A hair-raising calm, so to speak.
Some of those wild, weird yarns I used to disbelieve&mdash;until
I came West."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, appraising Gillette between half-closed
lids, "he hasn't changed a whit except to grow more sober. His
native heath agrees well with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's built for ruling his kingdom," murmured Lispenard.
His smile grew somewhat shorter. "I could always whip
him&mdash;until I touched him too hard. Had more weight, more
science, a cooler head than he ever dreamed of having. But when I
stung him a few times&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The specimen being thus dissected, we will now pass to other
things," drawled Tom. "Render your verdict on Blondy."</p>

<p>"Quite fit&mdash;quite the same debonair heart disturber."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the Blond Giant; he rose, made a profound bow,
and started out. "But you see only the surface calm. On my
honour, Kit, I'm a rough and tough character; a seething furnace
roars beneath this placid mug. Oh, you have no idea."</p>

<p>She waited until he was outside before raising her palms in
plain distaste. "Ugh! How he has hardened."</p>

<p>"Pay no attention to what he tells you, Kit," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I see it!" she flashed back. "Once that boldness fascinated
me. Now it's actually repulsive. How thick his chin is&mdash;how
heavy his eyes!"</p>

<p>Gillette doubled his hands, looking somberly at her. "Why did
you come?"</p>

<p>"I like that, sir! If I am not welcome..."</p>

<p>"Don't fence with me, Kit. You do it too easily."</p>

<p>She seemed half inclined to be sober, yet not for a moment did
she allow the tantalizing smile to desert her. "I told my father
I needed a change of climate. He was shocked&mdash;oh, very much
so. But I have a little Ballard stubbornness in me, you know.
That was my professed reason. But one day I ran across Jimmy
Train, and he showed me a letter you had written him. So I came
to plead."</p>

<p>"Kit!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no modesty left. My suitors are all
married&mdash;I grow old and lonely."</p>

<p>The colored cook stepped inside the place and cast one
comprehensive glance at the pair, vanishing with a twist of his
body. "Boss sho' looks 'sif he got a mizry," he murmured.
Quagmire, loitering by the corral motioned him to stay away from
the house; Old Mose's white teeth flashed.</p>

<p>Gillette's fingers were laced together; he sat forward in his
chair, studying the floor, and the girl noted how his hair curled
back from the temples as well as the dogged and resolute set of
his lips. And for the first time in her life she lost faith in
her ability to command men. No hint of that doubt, however, crept
into her half-bantering words. She was relaxed, her head thrown
back, looking across the interval with a slanting gaze&mdash;such
a look as he had once said distinguished her from all other
women. How was it he did not notice it now? And, fearing his
silence, she broke through it "I would give more than a penny for
your thoughts, Tommy."</p>

<p>"It's good to see you again, Kit. But, my dear, you must not
drag any more string across the floor for me to grasp at."</p>

<p>"Meaning&mdash;I have played with you?"</p>

<p>The answer was so sudden, so vehement that it startled her,
"Can you doubt it&mdash;can you consider it anything else?"</p>

<p>"We all make mistakes, Tommy. Perhaps I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't say it that way, Kit. You are fencing again.
Listen, my dear, I have thought of you all along the trail. Every
day, every night. Never a sunset or a sunrise but what your
picture wasn't somewhere in it. Once there was a stampede, a man
was killed, and even when I saw the boys throwing mud over him, I
thought of you. Do you see? Lord, I couldn't help myself. I
wanted you. Up until the moment I stepped inside this cabin I
wanted you."</p>

<p>"But, Tommy, here I am."</p>

<p>He broke through with a swift move of his hand, and to her
that was another mark of the change in him. Once he would have
been quieted at her least whisper; and now he commanded her not
to interrupt.</p>

<p>"Let me finish. What have I said? That I wanted you until the
very moment I saw you sitting there. But, Kit, you come just as
I've finished the battle. You bring all that&mdash;that damnable
misery with you. Misery! Well, you must not torture me any more.
I've put myself beyond it. I've licked the wounds dry. They're
still in here, understand, my dear. But they're dry. And I won't
have 'em opened again."</p>

<p>Her smile was brilliant, a little as if the light of her eyes
passed through a film. "You are blunt, Tommy!"</p>

<p>"I've gone back to the blanket," he muttered, lowering his
head once more.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means when an Indian has gotten his white man education he
goes back to the reservation, throws away all his civilized
clothes, and takes up the old ways."</p>

<p>"You are no Indian, Tommy."</p>

<p>"No? They called me the barbarian once. It still sticks. I'm
in my own land. I've thrown away every blessed thing the East
gave me. Chucked it overboard. The old gods are mine. And, by the
Lord, Kit, I'm beginning to live once more."</p>

<p>"Have you chucked away everything, Tommy?" she asked quite
softly. "Everything?"</p>

<p>He looked up to her; his eyes betrayed the uncertainty in him,
and the girl, at this unconscious revelation, let her whole body
go limp; laughter tinkled in her throat. She bent forward, hands
making little motions in her lap, and the laughter died. "Tommy,
supposing I haven't come to torture you? Supposing..."</p>

<p>"You gave me my answer once," said he stubbornly. "You've had
your sport."</p>

<p>"Oh, why did you have to be so deadly serious about it all the
while? My dear, did you think to pursue and win in a day? Don't
you suppose a woman has to be shown&mdash;to be convinced?"</p>

<p>"And to be amused," he added. "Remember, Kit, I'm not open to
torture any longer."</p>

<p>But she was wise with Eve's wisdom; she had seen him falter.
So she turned the conversation in her own inimitable way. "Tom, I
heard about your father. Did they ever catch the man?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"But they will," she reassured him. "The law will get him."
There was something so grimly sardonic on his face that she
asked, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"The law out here expects a man to take care of his own
troubles. I shall get him&mdash;I shall kill him."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, isn't that&mdash;isn't it murder?"</p>

<p>"I told you I had gone back to the old gods, didn't I?"</p>

<p>She bit into her lip; a tinge of colour stood against the soft
whiteness of her flesh. "I thought it was only woman's privilege
to be unfathomable, Tommy. I'm sorry I mentioned it."</p>

<p>The colored cook's shadow fell athwart the door again, and Tom
nodded at him. Presently the grub pans and the dishes were on the
table. One by one the men of the outfit came dismally, sheepishly
in. Tom put Christine at the head of the table and amid a dead
silence introduced her.</p>

<p>"Boys, this is Christine Ballard of New York. She has come on
a visit. Now, behave yourselves. I have already pointed out to
her which of you are the lady killers. So beware."</p>

<p>The charge was so manifestly outrageous that the agitation
only increased; not a man raised his eyes from the dead centre of
his plate. Lispenard came in and took his seat. Tom, quite
cheerful, began to relate the salient points of the more
outstanding members. "That's Quagmire. Yes, the one with the
extremely guilty look. Oh, they all look guilty, but he seems to
look guiltier than the rest. He has a wife in each state and
territory between here and Texas, Montana excepted. The reason he
has no wife in Montana is because he has never been to Montana.
Whitey Almo, the one with the bad sunburn&mdash;or is that
sunburn, Whitey?&mdash;collects interiors. Jail interiors. I have
never known Whitey to pass a new jail without entering to see the
wall decorations. Usually he doesn't pay much attention to these
walls until the next morning, when his eyes begin to function
again. Why did they cease to function, did you ask? Well, it has
been rumoured that Whitey drinks water with his whisky. I'd shoot
him like a dog if I thought it were the truth."</p>

<p>There was the sound of somebody strangling in his coffee.
Thirteen heads bent nearer the table; a knife dropped, and
thirteen bodies started. Tom grinned affectionately. "I have
probably the most completely assorted bunch of liars and
scoundrels ever gathered under one roof. Quite possibly I shall
be neatly shot in the back before break of day. Slim, it you
stoop any lower you'll dye your moustache in that coffee cup. Oh,
don't mention it. You're quite obliged."</p>

<p>The proximity of a woman utterly ruined the meal; Tom
Gillette's frank lies and pointing finger served to reduce them
to a state from which air and solitude only could effect a
recovery. The first to finish eating slunk out of the cabin with
the countenance of one who hoped he wasn't watched but was sure
the spotlight played upon him. Thus they departed; and presently
from the corral came a high skirling of words from a man whose
soul was in labour. Lispenard, who had been wrapped in his own
thoughts throughout the affair, quietly left.</p>

<p>Tom grinned. "It has taken me a long time to get even."</p>

<p>"But what have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered, rolling a cigarette. "No finer outfit
ever rode. I love 'em like brothers. That's why I'm abusing
'em."</p>

<p>The old cook slipped away with his pans; the lamplight strayed
against the girl's soft face, accenting her utter femininity; she
sat quite still, hands folded and seemingly placid. Yet beneath
the surface a hundred cross-currents of thought ran free. The
puzzle of this familiar yet so startling unfamiliar man was being
attacked from a dozen different angles. She loved a conventional
world, as all women do; even so, she could on occasion be both
reckless and daring. Daring enough to tell Tom she had come west
to plead her case&mdash;and then to hide the stark truth of it
beneath those quick and subtle changes of spirit that were so
much a part of her. It didn't matter what had changed her mind
regarding him. She wasn't sure she knew why, or if she did know
she refused to be truthful with herself. It didn't matter. What
mattered was that, once having changed her mind, she meant to see
the affair to the very end; to play the game with all the skill,
all the shrewdness and impetuousness she owned. The shrewdness
had always been a part of her, but the impetuousness was new, and
born, perhaps, of the knowledge that she had made a mistake
concerning Tom Gillette and that she grew no younger. It was even
new enough to disturb her whole outlook upon life and to set her
off on a trip half across the continent unchaperoned. And it was
disturbing enough to have created in her one irrevocable
decision: she would win back Tom Gillette if she could,
surrendering as little as she must, but if parsimony failed then
she was willing to throw every last coin and possession upon the
table and say, "There it is, I will not haggle. Take it." That
was the story of Christine Ballard, as much as it was given
anyone, even herself, to know.</p>

<p>The room grew cold with the coming of night. Gillette touched
the kindling with a match, and she relaxed to the heat, one hand
idly trailing over the chair arm. "That
one&mdash;Quagmire&mdash;I thought was quaint."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Wrong word, Kit. Quagmire's been hurt so
bad he couldn't cry. He's loyal down to the last drop of blood. A
more scorching pessimism never came from the lips of a mortal,
but that's only a false front to cover a heart as soft as a
woman's."</p>

<p>Silence a moment; the girl made another long detour and came
to rest on a distant topic. "Tom, I remember once something you
told me about what your father had said. When you left for the
East. I've often wondered, often thought&mdash;something about a
man's word."</p>

<p>Gillette dropped the cigarette. Fine lines sprang along his
face&mdash;a rugged face and handsome in a purely masculine
fashion. There was a flash down in the deep wells of his eyes.
And it took just such a shrewd observer as Christine Ballard to
detect how he held back the upthrust of feeling; held it back so
rigidly that his words were dry, almost bleak.</p>

<p>"He told me always to remember that a man's word was a piece
of the man himself and never to betray it."</p>

<p>Of a sudden she rose. "I'm tired, Tommy. Do I sleep in front
of the fire or up in the attic?"</p>

<p>"Doctor's already put your possibles in my room." He went over
and opened the bedroom door. Passing through, she turned and
hesitated. The perfume of her clothing clung to his nostrils, and
for one long moment he was carried back to the days of his
schooling. Her arm fell against his shoulder. He kissed her; and
then as the door closed, her tinkling, elusive laugh escaped
through. "<i>Au 'voir</i>, Tommy. Are you quite sure you've
buried all the old bones?"</p>

<p>It was not for some time that he realized why she had brought
up his father's remark about the word of a man. His fist struck
the table resoundingly. "By God, I will not be stripped for
torture again!"</p>

<p>The cabin became too small to hold Kit Ballard and himself at
the same time; he passed out, glancing up to the full, lemon-
silver surface of the moon. The bunkhouse light cut a clear path
across the river. Quagmire stepped athwart that pathway,
advancing.</p>

<p>"Hey, Tom. Yo' been ridin' to'rds that black butte to-day or
yestidy?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"Tracks," answered Quagmire succinctly. The tip of his
cigarette made a crimson trail in the darkness. "Somebody's been
havin' a look at our stuff. Question is, what for do they want to
look?"</p>

<p>"There's a fight coming up, Quagmire. We'll be one man against
ten."</p>

<p>Quagmire digested the remark. "Man is mortal. An' numbers
don't mean nothin'. What yo' aimin' to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I told Grist I wasn't selling out," said Tom. "Starting
to-morrow we'll keep a man hidden on top of that butte. Just to
see what he can see. No use in being played for a sucker."</p>

<p>"It was my idear, likewise," murmured Quagmire. "Then, of
course, it might've been the tracks o' yo' friend."</p>

<p>"Blondy? Yes, it might. He circles the country quite a bit.
I'd better ask him."</p>

<p>But Quagmire only brought up the supposition to introduce a
new fact. "It mighta been him, but it wasn't Last three days
runnin' he's travelled across the river." And after another long
silence, he added an entirely unrelated and cryptic thought. "I
hate a talebearer."</p>

<p>Tom divined that Quagmire possessed information he wished to
divulge and that it troubled both his habit of secrecy and his
sense of loyalty. He could have made it no plainer he stood
willing to speak if pressed. Gillette watched a cloud sail across
the face of the moon. "Well, Quagmire when the clothes are all
washed the dirt will come up. Let it ride like that."</p>

<p>"Yeah," grunted Quagmire and turned toward the bunkhouse. Tom
followed. Lispenard, he noted, already had rolled in.</p>

<p><br>Exercising her prerogative, Christine Ballard slept
through breakfast. Gillette, having business over on a corner of
his range, carefully instructed the cook to keep a hot meal
simmering until she rose. On his way out he met Lispenard. "Tell
Kit I'll be back within two or three hours and we'll go for a
trip round the place."</p>

<p>"Good enough," agreed the man. He seemed extraordinarily
quiet, on the borderland of one of his fits of sullen humour. Tom
grinned. "What's the itch, Blondy? Dees she remind you of the
fleshpots you have left behind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil," grunted Lispenard. He was about to add
that he was infernally sick of his former comrade's tolerant
amusement, but he checked this churlishness and scowled at
Gillette's back until the latter was out of sight. Turning into
the main cabin he settled himself by the table, his heavy,
bulging eyes staring at nothing in particular. When Christine
came from her room he appeared to be unaware of her presence
until she spoke.</p>

<p>"Claudie, why the sulks?"</p>

<p>He raised himself from the chair&mdash;a trace of politeness
that remained from his former training&mdash;and fell quickly
back. "It bores me," said he, in all frankness. "Bores me to
extinction."</p>

<p>The cook arrived with the girl's belated breakfast, rolling
his eyes at Lispenard as he retreated. "The king has been
gracious enough to command me to inform you," grunted Lispenard,
"that he would be back in a couple of hours and take you for a
ride."</p>

<p>"How very nice of him&mdash;how unpleasant of you. Claude, you
don't display your talents in such a temper. Why do you call him
that?"</p>

<p>"I mean it quite literally, Kit. Don't for a moment doubt his
power over this ranch and the yokels on it. It's a blessed feudal
estate. He is the law. Oh, quite so! Quaint Western manner. He
drives 'em like a pack of dogs. Why they stand it I don't
understand. Observe, when you ride with him, how he'll stop on a
ridge and look over the country. A king could do it no better. As
much as to say, 'This is mine. I command.'"</p>

<p>She made a wry face at the coffee and observed the heavy slabs
of bacon with evident resignation. "I must be a Spartan," she
murmured, and then smiled at the man. "Well, Claudie, why not the
grand manner if it is all his own?"</p>

<p>"Rot! It irks me. I detest self-sufficiency. They shout about
equality out here&mdash;every man as good as another. More tosh.
I've been an alien every blessed minute&mdash;made to feel like
one. They dislike me as much as I dislike them."</p>

<p>She moved her hand slightly. "Do you know something about
yourself, Claudie? You played the conquering hero once, and now
you hate to see another go above you."</p>

<p>"Above me!" cried Lispenard. "Don't be ridiculous."</p>

<p>She put down her coffee cup and turned toward him, serious.
"Let me tell you. Tom Gillette has grown head and shoulders above
you. Unpleasant, isn't it, my dear boy? Then you shouldn't be
discourteous to a woman before breakfast."</p>

<p>"So you come to be another herald at his court?" He rose.
"What did you come here for, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I answer no direct questions before ten o'clock," said she,
gay again.</p>

<p>"Work fast," he muttered, grimly amused, "or you'll lose
him."</p>

<p>"Claude!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't assume your airs with me, my dear Kit. I know you
quite well. Much better, in fact, than friend Tom knows you."</p>

<p>Colour stained her cheeks. "Once that manner became you. It
doesn't now."</p>

<p>He brushed it aside, bold eyes looking down at her. "In fact,
you are much like I am. So much so that I can tell you what's
below those fine gestures and that charming smile."</p>

<p>She bit her lip, anger glowing in her eyes. "You deserve to be
whipped, Claude!"</p>

<p>He laughed at her; a high, mirthless laugh that rang against
the poles and died. "Let anyone hereabouts try it. I'd welcome
the exercise. Well, my dear Kit, wish me luck. I'm going to rid
you of my unwelcome presence before the week is out. Fact. I
imagine you'll feel easier to have me gone."</p>

<p>"Going back East to cadge off your friends again,
Claudie?"</p>

<p>"Quite a cruel thrust. I said we were much alike, didn't I?
No, I'm not going East. They'll never see me again back there.
I'm going&mdash;God knows where." The fresh sun flamed through
the window and struck his long yellow hair. The girl had a full
view of his profile&mdash;its hard jaw bones, its over-heavy
outline of eyes and forehead. He disappeared without a backward
glance, and she heard him ride away.</p>

<p>"If I were a man," she murmured to herself, "I'd give him a
fine whipping."</p>

<p>But all marks of anger were erased by the time Gillette
returned. She had got into a riding habit, and when she trailed
across the yard to the horse that was to be hers she was quite
gay and beautiful. Together they cantered east, rising and
falling with the swell of the earth; the sun was a blood disk
beneath the threat of which the land quivered. The river, sucked
into the sands, showed only a rivulet of water. It seemed wholly
impossible that man or beast could find sustenance in the expanse
of tortured prairie stretching its endless leagues into the smoky
horizon; and for all her determination to be a good Spartan,
Christine Ballard felt the weight of that searing, oppressive
day. It was as if some unseen giant crushed her and blew his
breath into her face. Her pleasantries became harder to manage,
and at the end of several miles, when he stopped her on a
commanding ridge and began to point out the extent of the range,
she interrupted. "Tom, it's magnificent. Really it is.
But&mdash;do you ever feel that you are wasting the best of
yourself out here?"</p>

<p>"What's the best of me, Kit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, putting your talents in a place where they'll make you
great. Why, Tom, back East you could be splendidly successful.
How many of our friends have told me you were able to break
through any kind of opposition. You could be in high places."</p>

<p>He drew his arm around the horizon. "I'm humbler than that,
Kit. You can't live under this sky, having it as a sort of next-
door neighbour all the time, and not lose a lot of pretensions.
What good are high places to a man if he's not satisfied? Why
fight for something you've got no heart in? And what more could
any man want than this? Look at the prairie sweeping off there.
It's mine to ride on. I sleep sound at night. I go out in the
morning and look at the sun coming up and I feel as if the day
was made for me and nobody else. A fellow loses himself and his
troubles. Time doesn't count. Everything marches along slow and a
man lives slow&mdash;which is the way folks ought to live. What's
better?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said she, "I think it's criminal in a man not to
achieve all he is able to achieve."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Why, you could go up politically, you could make a fortune of
your own choice. Look at my father."</p>

<p>He shook his head. She thought she had never heard him say a
more solemn word. "I've gone back to the blanket, Kit. Don't drag
out the torture machines again."</p>

<p>It was so definite, so final that she forbore to press him
further. And in one of those swift flashes of wisdom she
sometimes permitted herself, she saw events marching alon to that
last gamble when she would be putting herself up am saying, "Take
me on your own terms." The thought should have dispirited her.
Yet it was otherwise. A current of emotion bore her along on a
flood tide, and with it came a strange pleasure. She who stepped
so carefully around the crater of life was on the point of
throwing herself willingly into it. She, Christine Ballard!</p>

<p>He had discovered something on the ground that interested him,
and they followed it a hundred yards before he spoke again.
"Trail. I think it's Blondy's horse. But we'll just have a
look."</p>

<p>No more was said for a good while. The hoof prints led them
into coulees, over ridges, and through extremely broken pieces of
ground. The girl, obedient to his humour, kept her peace,
wondering at the watchfulness that came over his face. More than
once they galloped away from the trail and into the recesses of a
box canon, or detoured below the horizon and crawled slowly to
the ridge tops again. Somewhat to the right of them stood a
butte, black and forbidding, at which Gillette constantly
glanced. And at last Christine ventured a question. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>He drew himself from his study. "I'm trying to make up the
story in this. There's always some kind of a yarn in a set of
hoof prints. And when you see hoof prints mixed with boot prints
that story usually promises a suprise ending."</p>

<p>Quite of a sudden his head came up, turning sidewise. She
thought she heard a faint sound floating through the morning
drone. And again she marked the strange shift of his expression.
"Come on," he muttered. His horse raced up a slope, Kit lagging.
He stopped an instant on the backbone of the ridge; then she saw
him rise in his stirrups and fling the quirt down on the pony's
rump. When she rode to the crest he was a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Directly in his path and another fifty yards to the fore a
pair of horses stood idle. Her eyes caught them first; then, as
Gillette swerved, she saw two figures locked together,
struggling. Gillette was off his horse, sand spurting up beneath
his boots, and racing onward. The pair had split; two men in a
fight. One of them was Lispenard. Kit galloped ahead.</p>

<p>The other was not a man, but a girl dressed in man's clothing;
quite striking of features and at this moment trembling with
exhaustion. Certainly it wasn't fear, for her black eyes sparkled
with outraged emotion, and she was crying, "You dam' dog! I could
kill you! I could!" Then Christine Ballard heard Gillette break
in; and there was such a suppressed fury in his words that she
felt the stab of an emotion hitherto quite
alien&mdash;jealousy.</p>

<p>"I am going to whip you, Blondy," he was saying. "It ought to
be a gun, but I'll give you your own weapons. Put up your hands,
you damned yellow cur! You are going to get a lesson you have
needed all your life."</p>

<p>Lispenard's heavy lips pulled back from his teeth; a spotty,
purplish colour stood along his cheeks. He was sullen,
vindictive. "You fool!" he cried. "I've had enough of your fine
manners! I'm weary of 'em, hear me! By heavens, I've sickened on
your cursed air of superiority!"</p>

<p>"Put up your hands."</p>

<p>"Don't get on a pedestal for the women!" shouted Lispenard; he
flung back his shoulders and the knotted muscles rippled through
his shirt. He had never bulked so immense, so destructively
powerful as at that moment; he stood half a head over Gillette,
he was thicker, more massive in every respect; and as he took a
step forward, knees suddenly springing a little under the weight
of his body, he seemed like a wild animal from the jungle. "I
have always whipped you, my lad! And I'll smash your ribs until
you won't walk so upright and almighty&mdash;And then I'll take
my leave! I'm cursed tired of your ways!"</p>

<p>"Save your breath, Blondy."</p>

<p>The great body went across the interval as if shot from a
catapault. Fists struck so swiftly that Christine Ballard
couldn't follow them. She screamed, but above the shrillness of
it she heard the impact of bodies, the expelling of great
breaths, the shuffling of feet in the sand. It was quite
impossible that large men could move with that agility;
Lispenard's yellow head made a complete circle under the sun;
arms feinted, drew back, feinted again and smashed against their
targets. Tom sagged, supporting himself on one knee; Lispenard's
face blazed with the killer's instinct. "Get up and fight! Always
did lack guts! Get up and fight before I kick you to pieces!"
Gillette was up. Again Lispenard's great frame snapped across the
space. Gillette was off his guard, and he was flung back by a
single sledgelike blow. In falling he caught Lispenard's arm and
together they sprawled on the ground, rolled, arm wrenching at
arm, knees striking like pistons. Body crushed against body. They
were on their feet once more and Tom Gillette's face was crimson
and his shirt had been ripped from collar to belt.</p>

<p>Lispenard came on, crouching, a strangled cry in his throat.
And the rip and smash of flesh so sickened Christine Ballard that
she had to support herself in the saddle with both hands. They
had gone mad, all reason and all sense of pain had deserted them.
They fought as only the most brutal type of animals could fight,
bent on the kill. And now and then, as Lispenard's choking yell
broke the silence of the prairie, she recalled his remark.
"Beneath, I'm a seething furnace. Oh, quite so." He had been
truthful to her; hell could not distill a more insane fury than
that which trembled on his smeared and distorted face.</p>

<p>She was not a man, or she would have noticed, as the fight
drew out, that it was Lispenard whose head went down and whose
charges grew the more aimless and broken; whose breath came out
of him like a sob. Gillette was checking the other's attack.
Through a dimming vision he found his mark easier to strike. He
pressed, he saw his opponent's face at odd angles as his fists
smashed it and rolled it back. Lispenard's bulging eyes lost
their firmness, and at that point Gillette summoned whatever was
left of his strength. He had been taught fine blows once, he had
been instructed in sportsmanship. All that went overboard with
the rest of the Eastern junk. He could not hit hard enough to
satisfy the urge of his will. He could only follow on and on,
past the blur of a woman on a horse, past the blur of a woman
crouching to the ground; lashing out and feeling a numb reaction
run through his arms. To strike again and follow in the endless
circle until, through the red film, he saw only the glare of the
horizon. His throbbing body felt no return blow; and he looked
down in a hazy wonder. The Blond Giant lay senseless.</p>

<p>He turned, seeking his horse. He wanted something to lean
against before his legs gave way, he wanted to see the prairie
again before he went blind. There was a shadow in front of him;
he thought it was Lispenard returning to fight. A girl's voice
spoke in warning. "No&mdash;don't hit at me, Tom! No&mdash;Tom,
it's all over. He's down. Put your arms around me! Your poor,
poor face."</p>

<p>He sat on the ground, a cool hand pressed against his temple
and a cloth skirted across his mouth. It was all over, and Lorena
was on her knees trying to wipe away the blood. The ringing died
out of his ears, he began to feel the ache of his body where
terrific blows had punished him. But they were lesser things.
Lesser things. It was Lorena who kept doubling back the bandana
to find a dry spot; and what was a woman thinking about and what
was a woman feeling whose eyes were like this girl's? God alone
knew, but that expression would trouble him from now on, sleeping
or waking.</p>

<p>"I think," he mumbled, "I'd better smoke. I'm comin' back down
the tunnel. For a time I went twenty feet away from myself."</p>

<p>Talking dispelled the mists. He rose uncertainly. "If he'd hit
me a few more times I'd be knocking on the gates." He felt light-
hearted, without a trace of resentment. The smoke of the
cigarette stung the bruises of his lips, and he threw it away.
Lispenard was reviving; as for Christine Ballard, she sat very
still in the saddle, which reminded him of something.</p>

<p>"Kit, this is Lorena Wyatt, next neighbour to me. Christine
Ballard, Lorena. She's a guest from the East."</p>

<p>It seemed a little queer that neither of them spoke&mdash;only
bowed. He turned away and left them together while he confronted
Lispenard. The latter pushed himself upright.</p>

<p>"I could always whip you&mdash;until you got stung," he
muttered. "All right. No love lost, my boy. And we'll forget
about shaking hands, too. I'm not through with this yet."</p>

<p>"I'll donate you the horse," replied Gillette. "Travel in any
direction you want&mdash;but not back to the ranch. If I see you
on my range again I'll use a gun. You're rotten fruit, Blondy.
I've suspected it for some time."</p>

<p>He followed Lispenard and stood beside the latter's horse.</p>

<p>"They say it's every man for himself out here," mused
Lispenard. "Well, I'll be on my way. But just put this in your
bonnet, old-timer: I don't consider it over with. I'll balance
the ledger if it takes me a thousand years. Put it down in red
ink."</p>

<p>The fight had drained them of animus; so they stood and looked
at each other, a world apart in every respect, utter strangers.
Then Lispenard got in the saddle and spurred away. Gillette
turned to the women.</p>

<p>Neither had spoken a word; all that while they were exchanging
glances, Lorena's clear face thoughtfully wrinkled, Christine
Ballard sitting very straight on her horse. Lorena made a small
motion with her hand and turned to Tom; and it seemed to him she
marked him then for whatever he was and stored it in her memory.
Never before had she touched him, save to accept his hand, and
though he had no reason for it he felt a distinct warning when
she brushed his arm with the tips of her fingers. And smiled a
crooked little smile. "Tom, heat some water for your face when
you get home. And this is the girl?" Her voice sank to the barest
whisper. "Oh, I knew it all the time. Even if you didn't tell
me." His hat still lay on the ground; she stooped and retrieved
it and with just a touch of possession in her gesture she put it
on his head. "You've made another enemy and you've gotten more
scars&mdash;because of me. A woman can cause so much trouble.
That's why I wish I were a man."</p>

<p>She ran to her horse and stepped into the saddle. Dust rose up
from the turning hoofs. Her hand came out to him and he heard a
faint, "Be good, Tom," as she raced away.</p>

<p>Gillette swung up, ranged beside Christine Ballard, and
started homeward.</p>

<p>"She's very pretty," observed Christine.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, turning to look. She was far along the ridge
and dipping from sight. His fingers tightened on the reins, and
the pony stopped. That last phrase sounded like a farewell.
Christine studied him with so queer an expression that he pressed
forward, puzzled and depressed and not knowing why.

<hr><h2><a name="ch10"></a>10. A KILLING</h2>

<p class="first">LISPENARD fled away from the scene as fast as
his pony could be spurred, nor was he anything less than cruel
with those gouging rowels. Physically, he was done up, and the
terrific jolting at Tom Gillette's hands left him momentarily
sick; he felt as if there were iron hoops around his chest, and
the muscles of his face had congealed until it seemed he wore a
plaster mask. The power was out of him, he could scarce raise his
arms. And over and over again he rehearsed the blows he had
struck. His fists had landed; the dull ache that ran from wrist
to shoulder told him he had reached his mark. He knew he never
yet had hit any man as often and as hard as he had hit Tom
Gillette. It hadn't been a boxing match; he meant to kill, he
meant to slash and maim. Yet Gillette had beaten him, knocked him
out&mdash;Gillette whose biceps were not much more than half the
size of his own.</p>

<p>That shook him badly. It roused him anew to a dull, vindictive
passion; and his horse suffered for it. The truth about Lispenard
was quite apparent; he had gone bad&mdash;his was the stuff from
which were made the border's greatest renegades. Back East, under
restraint, he might never have crossed that line of lawlessness,
but rather pursued his way with the aura of his athletic
reputation paving a career for him; unscrupulous perhaps but not
dangerous; a little dissolute, making feminine conquests with his
bold eyes and his gay manner that would grow harder with the
years&mdash;and more threadbare. Society tolerated his kind under
that fanciful pseudonym of "the man about town."</p>

<p>Out here, with no restraints, the uncertain fibre of the man
frayed through. The step across the line was but a short one and
easily taken. He had not yet taken that step, for the opportunity
was not yet come. But he was right for it, spoiling for it. And
thus he rode into Nelson, tethered his horse, and made his
purchases. A gunnysack of grub, cartridges, and a blanket. At the
saloon he tarried some time. The man had an insatiable thirst; he
filled himself full of the trader's whisky and bought a bottle to
pack along. At noon he passed out of Nelson with his purchases
and struck straight back on the trail until he arrived at the
ford. Here, instead of crossing, he paralleled the river a matter
of miles and gained the heart of the broken land. High on a ridge
he took his bearings and advertised his own whereabouts; San Saba
would be watching, that he well knew. So he pressed on, and
within twenty minutes the renegade ex-foreman stood in front of
him, sheltered by an outcrop of rock.</p>

<p>His tongue was a little thick, his perceptions were somewhat
blurred. Yet his wits were enough about him to receive a warning;
he squared himself defensively as he dropped to the ground, and
he took care to keep his right arm free. San Saba's little round
head dropped forward, and the lank face was speculatively grim;
the man was studying Lispenard, turning Lispenard's usefulness
over and over in the cautious recesses of his mind. Something
tipped the balance on invisible scales, and San Saba relaxed.</p>

<p>"Grub?"</p>

<p>"Dam' you, boy," muttered Lispenard, "I'm playin' square. See
you do the same by me. I may look green, but I'm not soft."</p>

<p>"Name yore own contract," murmured San Saba, eyes never
shifting; here was one man whose gaze he could meet.</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty, all the way around, all the way through," was
the reply. "I'm on to you, San Saba. What was it you
said?&mdash;'takes a scoundrel to know a scoundrel.' That's
right, my son. And I know you. I'm not your cat's-paw. We ride
equal in this firm."</p>

<p>"Agreed," was San Saba's laconic answer. Something like sly
humour flickered in the depths of his small eyes, too remote for
Lispenard to see or understand. "Grub there?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>San Saba rifled the sack and brought out a side of bacon; be
took his knife and cut a half pound slice from it as he would
have pared himself a piece of chewing tobacco. Lispenard never
had seen a man eat bacon raw, and the sight turned his stomach.
San Saba grinned maliciously. "Ketch holt of yo'self, boy. Yore
on the prairie from now on. I'll teach yo' things. Wait till we
get a buff'lo&mdash;nothin' better'n liver raw."</p>

<p>"Don't prod me, San Saba," protested Lispenard. "I'm holdin'
too much rotgut in my system."</p>

<p>San Saba took to studying the land with a certain wariness; he
squatted on his heels and drew patterns in the sand, from time to
time looking up at his uneasy companion. "Had a fight, did yo'?
Gillette kind o' battered yo' features, I'd guess. No love lost
atween the two of yo'?"</p>

<p>"I'll cut my initials in his hide yet!" exclaimed Lispenard.
He threw back his head, and the thick lips trembled from the
sudden upthrust of passion. "By God, I'll mark him! I can whip
him&mdash;I can whip him any day in the week! It was a stroke of
luck for that cursed Puritan&mdash;and there he must show himself
before the grand stand of two fine ladies! No, I took too much
from that damned flint face! I hate a man who sets himself to be
an African potentate. Back East he walked humbler, and I'll see
he walks humbler before I'm through. Next time..."</p>

<p>San Saba's saturnine eyes bored into the Blond Giant. Of a
sudden he leaned forward, and his question snapped like a whip.
"Next time, what?"</p>

<p>"I'll use a gun," muttered the Blond Giant.</p>

<p>San Saba rose. "Agreed. Fifty-fifty. Now come along."</p>

<p>"Where?" grumbled Lispenard. "Here, what are you running away
from the man for? By God, has he bluffed you? Sitting out here in
the hills like a whipped dog."</p>

<p>San Saba was in the saddle, his thin, repellent face devoid of
expression. "Time for that. No hurry. Let him drop his guard
before we try any rigs. Never stalk an animal in the
wind&mdash;yo' won't never ketch him. Come on."</p>

<p>Lispenard followed. The outburst left him in a kind of
lethargy. He felt San Saba's will taking hold, and it revived his
uneasiness. The man was unbending, inflexible; behind that
cheerfless mask was a core of flame. Lispenard sensed it, and for
a moment the chill of fear started along his body. He wanted to
protest; San Saba turned and beckoned for him to draw alongside.
So the Blond Giant obeyed, surly and half in rebellion.</p>

<p>San Saba struck straight into the west. Never a word was
spoken. The sun went before them, and the land blazed like the
very pit of hell; the sky was a brilliant brass shield, then the
sun dipped and dusk came with a grateful touch of wind. San Saba
wound in and out of the draws. He accelerated the pace, he slowed
it. They passed a ridge and halted. Lispenard roused himself at
the ex-foreman's whispers to see a point of fire glowing through
the darkness below.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he grumbled.</p>

<p>"I spotted 'em this mornin'." replied San Saba. "Prospectors
from Deadwood. Restin' up."</p>

<p>"What about it?"</p>

<p>"Loosen yo' gun, man. No prospector comes out o' Deadwood
lessen he totes a full poke. We ride down casual-like. When I say
'now'&mdash;yo' understand?"</p>

<p>Lispenard pulled himself together, just short of an oath. If
ever he were to draw away from this gaunt, sinister partner, now
must be the time. San Saba's horse crowded nearer; the ex-
foreman's shadow hovered over him. Words struck him sharply,
imperiously. "By God, suh, if yo' yalla, go back to Nelson; I
trail with no gumpless chicken hearts. What yo' deceivin' me fo'?
It ain't strange Gillette whipped yo' offen the ranch!"</p>

<p>Lispenard's throat burned like fire. He fumbled into his roll
and drew out the whisky bottle; he knocked out the cork and drank
it like so much water. "All right&mdash;I'll match that, you
rascal. I'm remembering those sweet words, my friend. All
right."</p>

<p>"When I say 'now,'" was San Saba's cold murmur. His horse
moved downward. The two of them quartered the slope, drawing near
to the fire. A picketed horse whinnied and a rugged figure of a
man passed the light swiftly. A challenge struck them.</p>

<p>"Who's thar?"</p>

<p>"Friends&mdash;friends," called San Saba. "We ain't struck a
water hole all day. Yo' kin'ly oblige?"</p>

<p>A second voice, unfriendly, joined in. "Man's supposed to
kerry his own fluid in this country, stranger. Ain't you knowin'
the ways? Too many dam' pilgrims clutterin' the Territory. Git
down&mdash;come to the fire."</p>

<p>San Saba dismounted. Lispenard dropped clumsily to the ground
and walked abreast the ex-foreman. The prospectors stood on the
edge of light, a pair of burly creatures full bearded and gimlet
eyed. San Saba spread his hands over the flame points. "Gits cold
almighty sudden after sundown. No, suh, we ain't pilgrims.
Texans, suh. My pardner is a-lookin' for a man this way. Got a
impo'tant letter. Blondy, yo' got that letter in yo' breeches
pocket, ain't yo'?"</p>

<p>The Blond Giant stood uncertainly in his tracks. What was San
Saba driving at now? He licked his lips, feeling the weight of
the man's little red eyes. And of a sudden he understood San Saba
was giving him a chance to drop his arms nearer his holster. He
obeyed. San Saba muttered "now" in a husky, remote voice. Half
blind, Lispenard clawed for his weapon. The two figures of the
miners seemed to blur and weave aside. A carbine flew up in his
face. There was a shot, and he felt his own kicking back in his
hands, time and again. And still this scene was but a blur, and
he was sick at his stomach, and the blood pounded in his head.
Somebody still fired, but the miners had disappeared from his
vision.</p>

<p>San Saba's brittle voice warned him. "That's enough. Yo'
killed him. Pull up&mdash;don't he'p none to scatter bullets in a
co'pse."</p>

<p>Lispenard dropped his gun, seeing one of the miners aprawled
at his feet, face downward and dead. He stumbled around the fire
trying to find something to lean against. But San Saba was bent
over the men, and presently the ex-foreman stood up, grimly
triumphant. "No prospector comes from Deadwood lessen he totes a
full poke. Here's yo' poke. Now, come away. We ride all
night."</p>

<p>Lispenard's mind grew clearer. The poke weighed considerable.
He slipped it into his coat pocket and groped back toward his
horse. If that was all to killing a man&mdash;San Saba already
had passed beyond, and Lispenard spurred in pursuit.</p>

<p>"I'd protected yo' case it was nes'arry," murmured San Saba.
"But yo' did well. First fight is allus blind. Nex' time keep yo'
wits. Aim straight an' don' use more'n one bullet. We ride fo'
Deadwood."</p>

<p>"What was the idea of this?" muttered Lispenard. "Cold murder,
man! We could have done it without that."</p>

<p>"Sho'. I told you I'd teach you tricks. First kill is allus
hardest. I picked miners for yo' to try on. Miner's shoot pritty
poor."</p>

<p>Lispenard was stone sober and chilled to the bone. "Some day,
my friend, I'll have to kill you. By God, I will have to do it or
be killed myself."</p>

<p>San Saba's dry chuckle reached him. "Mebbe&mdash;when yo' get
too big fo' me. Meanwhile, we got a stake, and Deadwood is full
o' chances. Fifty-fifty."</p>

<p>"See you don't forget that," growled Lispenard.</p>

<p>"We'll come back to Mister Gillette later," murmured San Saba.
"Prick that pony."


<hr><h2><a name="ch11"></a>11. THE RAID</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a windstorm brewing in the south; Tom
Gillette, poised on a ridge, saw the gray screen of sand in the
distance. Presently it would be on him, beating against him like
so many needles, choking the wind down his throat. Reluctantly he
turned ranchward; for a week the far edge of his daily ride had
brought him to this high point separating his range from that of
the Wyatts. And here he tarried, not sure why he waited, yet
always looking eastward for a telltale fluffing of dust against
the sky and the view of Lorena's lithe body swaying in the saddle
like that of an Indian. She had formerly kept a casual rendezvous
with him, and the sight of her clear, grave face had always made
the day a little more pleasant, even though she had the trick of
puzzling him with odd emotions now and then mirrored in her black
eyes. But for a week, since the fight with Lispenard she had
forsaken this ridge; and no news came from the Wyatt ranch.</p>

<p>He travelled back, uneasy and dissatisfied. In the distance he
caught a glint of the river, a thin trickle above the porous
sands; alkali dust stung his throat, the blazing, blistering sun
beat against the dun earth until the eye wearied of the sight The
prairie quivered under shimmering heat waves; southwest the dark
folds of the Black Hills reared against the brazen sky. Over
there in the heart of the hills men dug yellow metal and a town
was in the full tide of a boom.</p>

<p>News came slowly to his section of the territory; he heard
that all the Texans along the river were gone, save Wyatt.
According to the P.R.N. resident agent Wyatt likewise had sold,
but Tom Gillette only half believed the tale. Wyatt had been too
anxious to acquire that strip, and Lorena, who swayed her father
to some extent, bucked the idea of moving. Why was it she kept
away from him? Whatever she thought of Christine Ballard and his
relations with the girl was wrong. He wanted to tell her she was
wrong.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" he muttered. "But couldn't she
see for herself there's nothing between Kit and me?"</p>

<p>It left him irritable. He was a man; he didn't understand
women, and he knew he never would be able to understand them.
They muddied up the current of life, they cut across the
established order of things, they acted out of impulse&mdash;or
if it were not impulse then it was some obscure motive he
couldn't grasp. Kit always had been elusive and enigmatic, but he
thought Lorena moved more straightforwardly, that she had no
contradictions in her nature. He had thought so until the fight.
And then, when her cool hand slid over his face and those queer
muffled words reached him he knew all women were essentially
alike.</p>

<p>The van of the windstorm swept across the prairie, sage stalks
rolling along before. "Mosey," said Gillette, and raised his
bandana. At the moment of action he saw scuffed hoof prints on
the ground, and he checked his horse, bending over to study them.
They came out of the northeast and struck directly into his
range. Slightly stale hoof prints. In another ten minutes the
wind would erase them completely. Tom touched his spurs, and the
pony bunched to a gallop. That made the second time he had found
strange spoor on his territory; Circle G men didn't often travel
in pairs, and they didn't cover this end of the range.</p>

<p>"Mosey!" The wind bore down of a sudden, and the word was
whipped out of his mouth. There was a sound like canvas slatting;
the perspective of the land changed, the horizon was wiped out. A
gray driving pall slanted past him, the spraying sand sheered
against his neck. Breathing became more difficult.</p>

<p>"Mosey!"</p>

<p>The horse raced on, pushed by the storm; up and down the
rolling prairie. A gray row of skeletons marched through the
unnatural dusk, and he was in the heaven of his home buildings.
He left the pony in a shed and himself quartered to the house.
Christine Ballard stood in the middle of the room, one hand
pressed against her breast, white of face. "What is it, Tom?"</p>

<p>He lowered his bandana and shook out the sand. "Dry storm.
Nothing to get worried about."</p>

<p>She had been reading a book. One finger marked the page.
Stirred by fretfulness, she threw it across the room and sank
into a chair. She had a peculiar manner of drawing herself
together, of tucking her legs beneath her; and thus she sat, chin
cupped, staring at Gillette while the shadows weaved across her
expressive eyes. Gillette loaded his pipe and smoked, sitting on
the table.</p>

<p>"And this is your country, Tom?" Her slim shoulders rose.
"Well, a man can find pleasure in odd places. I was frightened
out of my mind until you came in. It's too raw, it's ungenerous.
There's no sport to it. It's cruel. Listen to that wind&mdash;do
you hear what it says, Tom?" Suddenly she threw back her head and
the white triangle of her throat gleamed; one fist was clenched.
Tom Gillette marked that picture well, for there was beauty in
it. And Christine's eyes were sombre, a rare mood for this girl
who seldom let herself be touched by too deep an emotion. "It's
telling me I'm small, I'm nothing, and that I can be crushed.
Hear it?"</p>

<p>Gillette nodded. "It's been in my ears all my life, except the
time I spent East. You bet. But what's wrong with knowin'
yourself to be a humble thing, walkin' under a canopy that's got
no corners and no ceilin'?"</p>

<p>Her answer was almost aggressive. "I hate to be reminded of
it. I like to think I amount to something."</p>

<p>"Sho'. In the East folks lose sight of the truth. Inside a
house they're little tin gods&mdash;but the house makes a servant
of 'em. Out here we walk abroad. We know we're small potatoes,
but we're free."</p>

<p>"Do you really like it that well?" she asked, bending forward.
"Or are you just talking?"</p>

<p>He knocked the ashes from his pipe, the old reticence
returning. After all, she was an outlander. She couldn't catch
his point of view. No more than Lispenard did. "All I am belongs
to it. It made me. It's in my system, and I couldn't get rid of
it if I wanted to. If you lived here long enough you'd feel the
same way."</p>

<p>She was gay and provocative instantly. "I haven't been invited
to stay indefinitely, Tom. Are you meaning to invite me now?"</p>

<p>He met her glance stubbornly. "I'm reachin' for no strings,
Kit. That's over."</p>

<p>"Oh, why must you be so stolid, so dense?" she cried. "Look at
me!"</p>

<p>He shook his head. The wind ripped at the house savagely, a
voice trailed past the eaves, weird and meaningless. It was
growing darker.</p>

<p>Christine's laugh was like the touching of crystal pendants.
Her question barely carried to him. "Am I, then, so
undesirable?"</p>

<p>"It's apt to be the other way around," said Tom, turning. And
after a moment he flung a hot phrase at her. "Do you think I'm
made of wood, Kit? What have you come here for&mdash;under the
same roof with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no pride left. I have come a-begging to make up
for a mistake." Then she slipped away, in one of those
characteristic changes, to another topic. "Back home at this time
I would be going out. And there would be a dance at the Coopers.
Do you remember those dances, Tom?"</p>

<p>He nodded. It was quite dark and he lighted the lamp.
Christine lay back in her chair, relaxed, studying him. "Do you
recall Harry Cooper? He stood for the assembly in the eighth
district. My father backed him, and now Harry is at Albany and
well on the way to political honours. My father always helps a
good man, Tom."</p>

<p>"Every fellow to his liking."</p>

<p>"You could do anything you set your mind to do," was her quick
answer. "Anything."</p>

<p>She stopped there. Tom was smiling at her, humour wrinkling
around his eyes. She caught her breath, the colour rising to her
cheeks. Still, she displayed a courage and a directness he had
not suspected she owned. Her tapering fingers spread apart; a
diamond flashed in the amber light. "Must I surrender everything,
Tommy? Isn't it generous in the winner to allow a little?"</p>

<p>He stood up, tall and rugged against the lamp's glow. "Kit, I
have always said you were more beautiful than any woman I knew. I
begin to think you are brave as well. But you surrender nothing.
Don't do it. You are only tormenting a man meant to be a
cowpuncher the rest of his days."</p>

<p>She was out of her chair and before him, one hand striking his
chest again and again. "You are a fool, Tom Gillette! You are a
fool!"</p>

<p>The door rattled. Christine moved back to her chair as
Quagmire let himself inside, coated with sand, red-eyed. "I rode
over to where yo' stationed Baldy Laggett, Tom. He met tracks
this mo'nin'&mdash;two hosses tailin' around the broken top
buttes. It's the second time a-running'. Night work, Baldy
says."</p>

<p>"I saw those tracks away east of the buttes not more than an
hour ago," replied Gillette. "Looked as if the parties were
travelling fast. You get the idea, don't you, Quagmire?"</p>

<p>Quagmire nodded; his homely face pinched together. "I
comprehend plenty, as the parson would say."</p>

<p>"How many cows have we got over that way now, Quagmire?"</p>

<p>"Three-four hun'red." After a pause the foreman added, "They's
sorter bunched up the last few days. Driftin'. Baldy Laggett says
they shifted overnight to'rds them arroyos that fork."</p>

<p>"Tracks there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah&mdash;tracks. 'Sif somebody was scoutin'!"</p>

<p>Kit Ballard stood in a corner and watched them. She sensed the
undercurrent of conflict behind the words, the slow gathering of
a decision; and she admired the casualness with which the two
covered themselves. Tom's head dropped forward, there was a
tightening of his features and a harder glow down in the wells of
his eyes. She saw him in a fighting mood, and this new point of
character left her with mixed emotions. He was beyond her power
to sway, beyond her ability to cajole. Quagmire's hand described
an Indian sign that meant nothing to her but seemed to impress
Gillette. "P.R.N. cattle crossin' the river four days ago. Saw a
travellin' puncher this mo'nin' headin' to'rds Deadwood. He told
me. All Tejanners gone from the south bank. Wyatt lef las'
week."</p>

<p>Gillette's head came up. "Where to?"</p>

<p>The girl caught the bite of that question; she stirred,
wanting to speak yet not able to break in. How much aside they
placed a woman out here&mdash;how much of a man's world it was!
No time for philosophy, no time for that exchange of wit she was
so accustomed to. No time for playing at all. They moved slowly,
they seemed to drift with the elements. But she began to see they
were not drifting but fighting. Always fighting the treachery of
nature and the treachery of man. Struggle was the warp of their
lives, it left its stamp on every one of them.</p>

<p>"Dunno," murmured Quagmire; "puncher didn't remark. All gone,
though. An', like I say, they's P.R.N. stock with P.R.N. punchers
on all them ranches now."</p>

<p>Gillette's pipe disappeared in his pocket. He was drawling,
"Tell Whitey Almo he's to stick on the ranch. Rest of us
ride."</p>

<p>Quagmire's eyes strayed toward the girl and bashfully dropped.
"Yo' hunch runs with mine," he murmured and went out.</p>

<p>The wind was dying, it was dark, and the day's heat had gone.
Tom Gillette touched a match to the kindling in the fireplace;
the colored cook entered like a shadow and stood questioningly on
the threshold.</p>

<p>"Get it on the table, doctor. We pull out early."</p>

<p>The black man left. "Where to, Tom?" asked Christine.</p>

<p>"Out along the range, Kit."</p>

<p>"Trouble?"</p>

<p>"Just a little night riding, Kit."</p>

<p>They stood at opposite corners, looking at each other across
the interval while the old cook slid in and out with his dishes
and his platters; they seemed to be unconscious of him. Christine
had a trick of putting her hand up to her breast when disturbed.
She did it now, and the yellow light revealed the trouble in her
eyes. Once, when the black man was out of the room, she half
whispered to him, "You are not the same man I knew back
East."</p>

<p>"Clay to clay," muttered Tom Gillette, cheek muscles
snapping.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you are bigger. I am sorry&mdash;you will never know
how much&mdash;that I made you dance to my tune. Tom&mdash;isn't
it Western to forget and forgive a mistake?"</p>

<p>The crew came filing in, and there was no more between them.
Christine took the head of the table, and even her wit was
damped; they disregarded her this night, they ate with intolerant
haste and they were gone again; twelve homely faces grim set,
twelve sets of eyes burning in the lamplight; rough men,
illiterate men&mdash;men whose lives made queer and sometimes
shameful patterns along the past. Intuition told her that. Yet
they were brave. The wind had gone, and outside she heard a
slapping of saddles and a murmuring&mdash;a soft murmuring and
now and then a slashing oath in the darkness. Quagmire's face
appeared a moment in the doorway, his head dropped and he was
gone. Tom's cigarette sailed into the fireplace; he squared
toward her.</p>

<p>"Be back before midnight, I'm thinkin'. Whitey Almo and doctor
will be camped outside this door."</p>

<p>"I am not deceived," said Christine, coming forward. "You are
going out to fight."</p>

<p>"I'll not be denying it," said he, soberly. "We've got no
constables to summon hereabouts, Kit, when the law is broken.
Maybe a fight&mdash;maybe only a false alarm. My back's to the
wall. I'm not crying about it, understand. I'm only doing what my
dad would have done, or any other man would do. That's the law of
the range."</p>

<p>"To kill or be killed!" she cried. "I don't understand it!
Here in America in this century&mdash;I don't believe it! You are
not cold enough to take a life, Tom!"</p>

<p>"The fellow that rustles another fellow's cattle dies. I'm
telling you it is range law. You're a long, long ways from New
York, Kit. Do you know what the old fur trappers used to say?
North of Leavenworth there is no law. Well, there's law
now&mdash;but it never catches up with us folks running
west."</p>

<p>"How many are they, Tom?"</p>

<p>He turned to the door, broad shoulders rising. "Ample, Kit.
But they don't know the temper of Texans. They don't know..."</p>

<p>She was in front of him. Her hand fell across his arm. "God
keep you, Tom! Oh, it's a brutal land! I hate it! Be
careful!"</p>

<p>Again that pressure drawing him down toward her lips and the
sweet smell of her hair and the gripping beauty of her face. It
was like wine to him, it brought back every old memory, and some
of the old desire. He pulled himself free and crossed the
threshold, half blind. Quagmire murmured. "All set." He swung up
to his saddle and reined around. The cavalcade led off, and the
cold air cleared his brain. "Stretch out," he muttered; they
galloped southward into the night, and the girl, supporting
herself in the doorway, listened until the drum of their ponies'
hoofs was absorbed in the vast vault. She turned inside then,
oppressed by the stark blackness of the heavens; there was a
power pressing, her down, sapping the courage from her veins.
Mystery swirled just beyond the threshold. Out beyond lay men
waiting to kill other men. The colored cook entered, muscles
rippling beneath his torn shirt; Whitey Almo's face appeared
vaguely across the doorway, taciturn and watchful.</p>

<p>The Circle G riders swept steadily onward through the swirling
shadows, silent save for the chafe and tinkle of their gear and
the rhythmic pound of the horses. Arrow straight for an hour;
Quagmire rode abreast Tom Gillette, stirrup touching stirrup, and
it was the pressure or withdrawal of Quagmire's thigh that gave
Gillette the course. He knew the land well; but Quagmire, who
loved the night and who seemed to be able to see through the
utter blackness of it, knew it even better. And it was Quagmire
who gradually turned the cavalcade from south to southwest and
then slowly eastward. The moon was a thin arc of silver, the
ancient stars grew more and more remote. Onward they galloped, up
and down the swells, the night breeze cold against their faces
and the sound of the coyotes in their ears, howling out of the
distance with the sadness of ages quivering in that lonely song.
Ahead, the shadows piled thicker and the dim strip of the horizon
was broken. They were falling downward, or the presence of the
butte in front made it seem so. Gillette sat back in the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Halt."</p>

<p>They stopped. He got to the ground and pressed his ear against
the sand. The invisible telegraph carried no messages. Quagmire's
voice croaked mournfully, "Not far now. At a walk, uh, Tom."</p>

<p>"At a walk."</p>

<p>They swung along a circle, the massed shadow turning their
right flank. Twice they stopped to listen; and presently the
shadow was behind and they were in the bed of an arroyo. Cattle
moved directly to the front. They dismounted and stood
silent.</p>

<p>"My shoulder aches," murmured Quagmire, following a long
quiet. "It's a plumb bad sign. Was a man once in Tucson with a
trick toothache. Trouble allus follered. He got to depend on it
and sorter bragged about it. First time his mother-in-law died.
Second time his wife died. Third time it ached nothin' happened
and it sho'ly aggervated him. Looked like the dam' tooth wasn't
nowise dependable. But they took him up an' hung him fo'
murderin' said mother-in-law an' wife. On the scaffol' the gent
says: 'I die happy. Didn't I tell yo' somethin' allus happened
when it ached?' That's what yo'd call infallible." He moved
nearer Gillette. "Reckon I overlooked a bet. Didn't know yo'
wanted Wyatt's new location or I'd of asked."</p>

<p>"I'll find her, Quagmire."</p>

<p>"Woman&mdash;the star which leads up the hill. And sometimes
down the other side. The gent which classed 'em with wine an'
song must've been an old burnt fool like me. If a woman looked at
me twice she'd faint. If she didn't faint I would."</p>

<p>"Which side of the slope is Baldy Laggett on?"</p>

<p>"He ain't more'n three hundred yards off at this moment, I'm
bettin'."</p>

<p>Silence again, the silence of infinity pressing down. And then
a whisper and a hint of things moving out beyond the arroyo's
rim. Gillette's arm touched Quagmire in signal. Circle G mounted,
the soft rubbing of leather running along the line. The moments
trailed one upon the other, and a shadow appeared a moment and
sank back into the screen of darkness. Presently riders moved
along the earth in faint silhouette&mdash;a line of
them&mdash;and passed to the right. One soft phrase exploded like
a shell in the stillness. "Easy, boys."</p>

<p>Quagmire's murmur was in Tom Gillette's ear. "We're bunched
now. Set?"</p>

<p>"Wait for evidence. Hold it, Quagmire."</p>

<p>And beyond, men spoke more freely. "What's the idea, Gib? How
many of 'em? Which way?"</p>

<p>"Never mind all them questions. Save yore breath. Spook an'
Ray&mdash;you circle and push. Easy&mdash;plenty of time."</p>

<p>Quagmire's arm touched Gillette twice, impatient Gillette
reached for his gun and pulled himself upright And he spoke in a
tone that carried across the night like the clapper stroke of a
church bell. "Guns out, boys! Let's go!"</p>

<p>A challenge spat across the interval. "Who said that?"</p>

<p>"Rustlers die!"</p>

<p>"Still hunt, huh? A trap! Damn the Texans, let 'em have
it!"</p>

<p>"Let's go! Come on, Circle G!"</p>

<p>The Circle G line tore up the arroyo side; and without parley
the shroud of this black summer night was pricked in twenty
places by mushrooming purple flame points, and the smash and the
beat and roar of that crisscross fusillade twirled around the
area like the funnel of a cyclone.</p>

<p>"Let's go!"</p>

<p>"No Texans wanted in Dakota! Come on, boys! Down the skids to
hell!"</p>

<p>Gillette shoved himself directly onward and into the
flickering muzzle flames; as for the rest of his men, he gave
them free rein. They were old hands, they had survived border
feuds, they were schooled in range war. Gun smoke rolled against
his face, a thick and passionate cry beat against his ears; he
was struck broadside by one of the rustlers slanting across the
debated ground; the man's horse reared and came down with its
front feet hooked over his own pony's neck. The rustler rolled
against him, a gun barrel slashed along his flank and as he
jerked away a bullet tore into the saddle horn. The rustler's
shadow was broad and fair; Gillette raised his piece and fired at
that shadow. The man was down, soundless; the man was dead.</p>

<p>Quagmire's yell bore up from a remote quarter. Gillette sent a
reply ricochetting back. He had drifted off from the Circle G
men, he was barricaded from them by the rustlers, and now,
hearing his yell, they closed in, twisting shapes ringing him
around. A bullet's backwash fanned his cheek, and on the instant
he was in the vortex of a whirpool and men were baying like
bloodhounds.</p>

<p>"By God, knock him down there!"</p>

<p>"Watch that cross fire! Crowd 'im&mdash;crowd 'im!"</p>

<p>He brought his horse dead about. Then he was thigh to thigh
with them. An arm struck and stunned him, another arm hooked
about his neck, and somebody's breath belched against his face.
He let the reins go and clung to the horn, weaving and bending,
fighting clear of that encircling elbow. Quagmire's boom came up
as from a distance, but for Gillette there was no breath to
waste. They were trying to knock him beneath the trampling
hoofs.</p>

<p>"Drop that guy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, pull the trigger!"</p>

<p>"Hold that wild talk, yuh fool!"</p>

<p>He shook himself free. Somewhere else was a sudden spattering
of fire; a man screamed. They were crowding closer, trying to
pinion him once more. Point-blank he pulled the trigger, and the
spewing bullets made room for him; there was a ringing of angry
oaths and the guns broke loose in fresh fury, but he was clear,
and Quagmire's voice thundered near at hand. Gillette turned
back.</p>

<p>"Come on, Circle G! The rustlers die!"</p>

<p>Confusion. The purple points of light flickered and faded.
Saddles were empty this night, and men were down, some dead, some
crying up out of the dust. And the echo of all this grim, bloody
strife straggled into the sky and was lost in the cold immensity
of creation. The stars were remote, remote...</p>

<p>"Oh, for a crack o' light!"</p>

<p>Quagmire thundered back. "Go repo't to yo' corporation, yo'
yaller dawgs! Better thank yo' Lord it ain't light!"</p>

<p>The gunfire crashed to a climax; somewhere was the sough of a
man's last breath. Once more was the shock of men and horses
locked together while the very dregs of rage came spewing up. A
riderless pony careened by Gillette; of a sudden the tide turned
and the rustlers were in flight.</p>

<p>"Light?" yelled Quagmire. "Yo' light is sulphur an' brimstone!
Who tol' yo' to fight a Texan, daylight or dark?"</p>

<p>"Come on," said Gillette. "This is a lesson for all Dakota
rustlers. Pull in these flanks, boys. Let's ride."</p>

<p>They raced in pursuit, and now and then the stray flash of a
gun showed them the way. They crept up, they lost ground. But
always they kept to the trail as the night deepened and the miles
dropped behind. The rustlers stopped firing altogether. At this
point Gillette halted his party and heard the drum of hoofs
receding.</p>

<p>"They's splittin' a dozen ways," advised Quagmire.</p>

<p>Gillette called roll, snapping at the names. Two were without
answer, though he called them a second and a third time. Quagmire
sighed like a man dog-tired.</p>

<p>"Man is mortal. It's the only lesson I learnt in forty years.
Man is mortal."</p>

<p>"Quagmire, you take five of the boys and go back. Hunt around
and see what you find. Then strike back to the ranch. I'm taking
the rest with me to finish this job."</p>

<p>A moment's parley. Gillette renewed the pursuit, though the
sound of the rustlers had dwindled and died in the distance. He
veered north and after a half hour came to a ford of the river;
he stopped there and went to the edge of the water, striking a
match. The stream ran clear, but along the moist sand were deep
prints with water standing in them. Fresh. Single file the Circle
G riders crossed and held their course until the lights of Nelson
glimmered up from the prairie. They swept into town and down the
street. Gillette dismounted before the principal saloon and
strode inside.</p>

<p>The place was nearly empty; but up at the bar two men stood
side by side&mdash;Barron Grist and his foreman. Grist was angry
and erect; the foreman's body sagged against the bar for support
and his head was down on the mahogany top, rolling from side to
side in evident pain. A bottle, half empty, was gripped in one
fist. They were talking when Gillette entered. And then, aware of
his presence, both of them turned toward him, Grist in a rage
that lifted him out of his negative self and put a definite
character upon his smooth cheeks. The ranch boss pulled himself
together, one hand whipped away a patch of blood congealed on his
temple. The very sight of Gillette affected him like the presence
of a ghost; he crouched.</p>

<p>The light played on Gillette. He was gray with dust, his face
was a mask&mdash;a mask once seen not to be forgotten. He had
harried the rustlers as he would have harried a pack of wolves,
he had killed, and the fury of all this was settled along the
rugged features. He was like his kind, slow to wrath and slow to
forgive and the lees of the fight flared out of the deep eye
sockets; his words sang resonantly across the dead, silent
room.</p>

<p>"I told you, Grist, I didn't want war. You're a powerful
outfit, we're just a handful. But you started it, and we'll see
it to a finish. The kind you'll remember to your last day."</p>

<p>"Don't know what you're talking about!" was Grist's irritable
answer. "You're drunk."</p>

<p>"You sent your men to rustle my cattle and break me. Well,
some of those men are still out there. And they'll be there till
you go bury 'em. Down in Texas we kill rustlers. This is a lesson
for Dakota renegades, Grist."</p>

<p>"You're crazy," muttered Grist. "Trying to pin something on me
to cover up your own dirty tracks? Don't stare at me like that,
man! I resent it."</p>

<p>Gillette turned his attention to the ranch boss. That man
swayed and his elbows straightened; a pinched gravity covered his
face; his half-closed eyes clung doggedly to Gillette's right
arm. "Maybe you've had your medicine, friend. Who told you a
Texan wouldn't fight? We called your bluff tonight. How did you
like it?"</p>

<p>The ranch boss was rigid from his shoulders to his hips; his
head tipped. "It ain't finished yet," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snapped Grist. "You talk too much."</p>

<p>But the ranch boss was beyond bridling. "It ain't finished
yet! Somebody's goin' to pay. You foot the bill, you wild, blood-
swillin' savage!"</p>

<p>His arm blurred in the light; Gillette swayed on his heels. A
table crashed to the floor, chips scattered, and Barron Grist
pulled himself backward, crying: "I'm out of this&mdash;I'm
out..." Whatever else he said was lost in the roar that ran along
the space and up to the ceiling. Gillette's gun tilted upward.
The ranch boss of the P.R.N. staggered and tipped against the
bar, elbows hooked over it. He seemed to be nodding, and then his
head sagged and he fell to his knees and for another instant
tried to gather himself. It was of no use. He was dead before the
gun dropped from his fingers.</p>

<p>"I'm out of this!" repeated Grist.</p>

<p>"If you've got a conscience, may God give you pity," said
Gillette. "These fellows died at your orders. If you try to
rustle another Circle G cow I'll come after you personally."</p>

<p>He passed out. In the darkness of the street he stopped and
leaned against the saloon wall. The sand trickled out of him, and
the cold air went through him like a knife. He was sick,
physically sick, and the muscles of his arms and legs trembled.
He wanted a drink, yet he hadn't the heart to go back there and
see the ranch boss lying in the puddling blood. What had he done?
Only what the country demanded of him, nothing more, nothing
less. And as be looked towards the heavens he felt a thousand
years old. He was not the man who had come out of the East with
fine ideas in his head. How soon all that insecure stuff faded.
All that remained now was the simple rules he had been reared in:
never to go back on his word, to give all humans the right to
live the way they wanted to live in return for the same right for
himself. To respect rights and to see his own respected. That was
all.</p>

<p>He drew a breath. A man got scarred in the process of passing
through the world. That was inevitable, that was life. Only a
fool expected to dwell in paradise; nobody had a right to dodge
his chores, no matter how dirty they might be. A man paid as he
went. He moved from the wall, seeing his crew patiently waiting.
Boots scuffed along the walk, and a strange voice arrested his
progress.</p>

<p>"You Gillette of the Circle G? Yeah. Was you a-lookin' for a
gent by name of San Saba? Yeah. Fella built like a cotton wood
an' sorrel by complexion?"</p>

<p>The man was old and seamed and obscured in the shadows.
Gillette stared at him. "How do you know?" was his blunt
reply.</p>

<p>"Heard you advertisin' same hereabouts some time ago. Well, be
you still lookin'?"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>The man's voice trailed off. "On the trail to Deadwood. Saw
him four days ago. With a yaller-haired podner." And the man
vanished into an alley.</p>

<p>Gillette mounted and rode homeward with his men. Here was
another chore he had staved off as long as he could. Seemed like
these things came in bunches. Oh, it was easy enough to forget
them, to excuse himself from performing them. Yet if he did he
would never have another moment's peace. A man had to play with
the rules. On over the ford they went, and along the familiar
trail to the ranch house, a light shining out to them. Quagmire
already was in from the prairie, morose and subdued.</p>

<p>"A long ride for Nig Akers. Joe Blunt is only pinked. But
Nig's done. Man is mortal. Tom, this is val'able country. Texas
men is buried in it."</p>

<p>Gillette studied the southwestern sky. Deadwood was over
there. He nodded and went into the house. Kit Ballard waited for
him, framed in the bedroom door; the girl's black hair tumbled
down in rippling ropes, and she held a robe around her.</p>

<p>"Go back to bed, girl. I can't talk to-night."</p>

<p>"To do what&mdash;to sleep? How can I sleep? I prayed tonight,
and I never prayed before. Whatever you have done, I don't care.
Wherever you choose to stay, I don't care. Tom&mdash;come here to
me!"</p>

<p>He shook his head, the weariness pulling his shoulders down.
"I'm leavin' to-night."</p>

<p>"For where?"</p>

<p>"Deadwood. San Saba's in Deadwood."</p>

<p>She knew the story, she knew the purpose of that journey. Her
face went dead white, and when she raised her head the higher
yellow light pooled in the triangle of her throat. As he looked
at her all the loneliness and hunger of his solitary nature rose
to torment him. No man living could miss the beauty or the allure
of Christine Ballard. What was lacking in her for such a man as
he was? What more could he want? The sacrifice was all hers, the
surrender all hers. So he thought while the hunger grew to an
obsession. A man was only flesh and blood. He pivoted on his
heels and started for the door. She was in front of him
instantly, throwing herself against him. He had never known what
strength lay in a woman's arms once they were around a man's
neck; he had never heard a woman cry in this suppressed manner.
It seemed to put her on the torture rack. And all the while the
incense of her hair and the warmth of her body assailed his
senses.</p>

<p>"Kit&mdash;why couldn't this have happened a long time
ago?"</p>

<p>The crying stopped. She stepped aside, and her echo of his
question rang passionately through the room. "Why couldn't it
have happened, Tom? People have to live to learn, don't they?
Where else will you find another woman any better?"</p>

<p>He stood divided. And it took a full mustering of his strength
to walk to the door and let himself out.</p>

<p>"Quagmire&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;right in front o' yo', Tom."</p>

<p>"Get me the buckskin. Get it in a hurry. You're boss here. San
Saba's in Deadwood."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he rode from the ranch on into the
darkness lying southwest. He was running away as much as anything
else, and he knew it. There would come a time when he must return
and face it. But not now. He needed to break the chains Christine
was forging around him. He tipped his head to the remote stars
and seemed to see there the clear, grave face of Lorena Wyatt
looking down at him. He felt the pressure of her hands wiping the
blood from his mouth. Where was she?

<hr><h2><a name="ch12"></a>12. DEADWOOD</h2>

<p class="first">BEYOND dusk five days later Tom Gillette stopped
on a ridge and studied a camp fire glimmering beside a creek
below. He had ridden hard, and his own buckskin was in a strange
corral away behind; the pony carrying him now was the second
traded horse. Deadwood, according to his estimate, could be no
more than ten miles distant, and it drew him like a magnet. Yet
he was weary and hungry, for which reasons the light of the fire
had pulled him off the main trail&mdash;a tortuous, rutted artery
along which the freighters carried supplies into the mushrooming
mining camps of the hills.</p>

<p>A pair of men sat beside the blaze. Others moved away the
moment he topped the ridge, retreating beyond the rim of light.
From this distance he saw nothing of the two in view but a blur
of bearded faces beneath drooping plainsmen's hats, and for a
time he debated about riding down. Out on the prairie every
stranger was welcome to the chuck wagon, and hospitality was the
unwritten law. A mining camp was something different; another
breed of men, a hundred breeds for that matter, inhabited it, all
bent on riches and all suspicious.</p>

<p>In the end hunger got the best of him. He quartered down the
slope within hailing distance and stopped again.</p>

<p>"Hello, the camp."</p>

<p>One of the figures by the fire spoke over a shoulder. "Come on
down, then."</p>

<p>He advanced, swung his horse so that it put him directly
toward the fire, and dismounted. He was instantly aware of a hard
and prolonged scrutiny, and further aware of the others out in
the shadows. It was a quick camp; horses stood a few yards off. A
shotgun rested within arm's reach of the nearest man, and
Gillette's questing eyes noted that each of the two wore a Colt
on each hip. The ivory tip of a knife stuck from one fellow's
boot. Heavy armament, even for prospectors.</p>

<p>"Saw your fire," explained Gillette. "I'm bound for Deadwood,
from Nelson, and it's strange country to me. How much farther to
town?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles."</p>

<p>"Straight along that road?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>He squatted at the fire, warming his hands. A frying pan
filled with bacon lay against a rock and a coffee pot sat beside
it. Casually he turned his attention from one man to the other
and out of the brief survey he received a warning. He knew his
own kind, and he also knew the stamp of the border renegade, for
he had been raised in a country where outlaw factions flourished
their brief day and died suddenly. These men were of that type.
Plainly so. The spokesman's face was heavily pitted above the
line of the beard, one ear was without a lobe. The man met
Gillette's inspection with a sullen, half-lidded counter glance.
Of a sudden he shot a question belligerently across the small
interval.</p>

<p>"From Nelson, huh? Travellin' almighty light, ain't yuh?"</p>

<p>"In a hurry," agreed Gillette. "Travelling light."</p>

<p>The spokesman's hand rose to signal to someone out of sight
"Look at his pony, Kid."</p>

<p>Spurs jingled. Faces came into the fire's glow, ill-stamped
faces, the sweepings and trash of the desert. Without turning he
felt himself to be covered from behind. His muscles bunched as he
recognized the trap he had let himself into. A sallow youth
ambled up, briefly murmuring:</p>

<p>"He's travelled all right. Hoss dusty." And the youth crouched
in the circle, staring at Gillette with open antagonism. Gillette
turned about; a giant of a man stood a pace to his rear, arms
akimbo.</p>

<p>"In my country," said Gillette evenly, "it isn't polite to
cover a man's back."</p>

<p>The giant shifted, but the spokesman flared. "Nobody invited
you here, fella. How do we know who yuh are or where yuh come
from?"</p>

<p>"When a man announces himself that's usually ample. As to the
invitation, I'll relieve you of my presence in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Don't be in no rush," growled the spokesman. "Yuh came and
yuh stay till we see what's inside yore coco. Sounds like another
damned fishin' party to me."</p>

<p>Gillette held his peace. The giant barred his retreat. He
understood, however, that the sooner he made his exit the better
and the easier it would be. He had fallen in with an errant band
of cutthroats and they were weighing him for what he was worth.
Six of them, all before him, save for the giant. He heard the Kid
mutter a short phrase about the time, and the spokesman, looking
sidewise at Gillette, pulled a watch from his pocket and tilted
it against the light. At that point the giant moved around until
he stood behind this apparent leader of the crowd. "Better do
somethin', Hazel."</p>

<p>"Do what?" snapped the leader.</p>

<p>"Don't bite my nose off, old-timer," rumbled the giant, "or
I'll pull yuh apart."</p>

<p>Hazel turned to Gillette. "Lemme see yore guns."</p>

<p>"Not my guns," drawled Gillette. "Do I look that green?"</p>

<p>Hazel threw up his head, and a swift anger pulled at the
corners of his mouth. "Yuh tryin' to ace me, fella? Do I see 'em
or do I take 'em?"</p>

<p>"No powder-burning' around here and now," warned the giant,
both to Gillette and to his chief. "It ain't the time."</p>

<p>Gillette was cross-legged; he had done this trick before, he
could do it again. He swayed his torso a little forward, seeing
in a glance the loose posture of each; they were confident enough
of themselves. The Kid spat into the fire. "Oh, hell, let's see
what he totes in his pockets an' throw him in the creek. Who's
gettin' religious around here now?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to take 'em," snapped Gillette. His legs carried
him up in one swift surge and the firelight ran along the blued
barrel of his piece. All this in a single sweep of his muscles.
"You damned rascals, does a traveller have to show a passport to
get into Deadwood? There's where I'm goin', and all you're going
to see of my gun is the front end. I'm no deputy and I'm not
chasing him, understand? Now swallow it. If you want to make an
argument, go ahead."</p>

<p>"You're a dead man," cried Hazel, swaying on his haunches.</p>

<p>"So are you, then," drawled Gillette. "We'll be two of the
stillest corpses around Deadwood. Keep your hand away from your
belt. Kid&mdash;don't teeter like that. Have I got to argue my
way to Deadwood?"</p>

<p>"No powder-burnin'," muttered the giant, who seemed to be more
peaceably inclined. "Let 'im go&mdash;what's it matter?"</p>

<p>"I'm going," muttered Gillette grimly. He stepped backward,
retreating foot by foot into the shadows. He had passed one point
of danger, and it left him with the same satisfaction that a man
has in winning a pot on a bluff. He grinned, though it was a wry
grin. "If I see you in Deadwood I'll treat you to a drop of rye.
But don't try to stop a Texas traveller. And I sure hope that
bacon and coffee chokes you." Talk sometimes served a purpose,
and apparently it bridged that parlous interval while he
retreated still farther from the fire and reached his horse. He
was up on the moment. The man named Hazel started to reach for
his gun, but the giant, standing near, kicked his arm away; the
Kid's yellow teeth glimmered in the light&mdash;the Kid was one
of those adolescent white savages turned utterly bad. Tom
Gillette studied the faces a moment longer, engraving them on his
memory.</p>

<p>"Yore spotted!" cried Hazel. "I'll see the word gets out to
bring back yore skelp."</p>

<p>"Something tells me you're a fraud," murmured Gillette. "How
long has Deadwood stood for this foolishness?"</p>

<p>"Go on, get out of here," advised the giant. "Don't crowd your
luck."</p>

<p>"That's advice, too," said Tom and backed his pony up the
slope. The shadows closed about him and the circle, freed of
threat, began to stir. The Kid whipped about, and at that moment
Gillette touched his spurs and raced away, sliding to the far
side of the pony. A juniper bush grazed his face and took his
hat; a single explosion followed after, and then the giant's
voice rose and fell like a maul. "You cussed little nipple rat,
stop that or I'll tear yore lungs outen yuh! Want to
spoil..."</p>

<p>The rest of it was lost to Gillette. His pony carried him up
and over the ridge; the fire winked out. He regained the trail
and galloped steadily onward.</p>

<p>"I stumbled into a convention," he mused. "They've got a piece
of business on their chests and I upset 'em."</p>

<p>Weariness came on the heels of the let-down. It seemed he was
born into a world full of treachery, full of disappointment. His
mother had only thought to make a better man of him in shipping
him East to school; yet it seemed to him he would have been
better off in Texas, toughening himself inside and out. Four
years had left him a little soft, had confused him as to the
elemental facts of existence; and again he remembered a piece of
his father's advice: "East is sheltered, it's a woman's country.
West is for a man, my son, and don't you ever forget it."</p>

<p>How could he forget it? The sight of the P.R.N. ranch boss
sliding forward to the saloon floor still sickened him. So
thinking, he at last sighted the lights of Deadwood, forded a
creek, and rode down the single uneven street of this boisterous
Mecca of the West.</p>

<p>Deadwood crouched between hill and creek, its tents and log
huts and frame structures rambling along the street in a
disjointed double row. There were no sidewalks, and the crowd,
wandering from place to place, kept out upon the pock-marked road
running between. A cordwood pile and a tent nearly blocked this
end of the thoroughfare; Gillette circled around and rode by the
suspended sign-boards: Denver Grocery Store, City Market, The
Senate, and so on past the outflung beams of lamplight. An
occasional tree stood like a sentry on the street. Everywhere was
a clutter of boards and timber and boxes&mdash;the roughing-in
material of a town on the make. Then the street ran up a scarred
slope and wound around stumps into the hills. The straggling
pines marched down to the very building walls of Deadwood.</p>

<p>He halted by a restaurant and got out of the saddle, both
stiff and weary. This was a strange land, and as he met the faces
of the men bobbing in and out of the patches of light he was
conscious of being out of his proper environment. They dressed
differently, they had a different twang to their speech, the
stamp of a distinctive profession was plain upon them. A supply
wagon lumbered past, eight oxen at the traces; a bull whip
cracked like the explosion of a gun, and the wheels groaned in
the ruts. He shouldered into the restaurant and sat up to the
counter. The time of eating was past, the waitress out in the
kitchen. He dropped his head and passed a hand across his face;
he wanted nourishment, and he wanted a long sleep before
beginning his hunt. The kitchen door opened, light steps tapped
across the boards.</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;anything you've got to eat," muttered
Gillette, head still bent. There was a swift intake of breath,
and he raised his eyes.</p>

<p>Lorena Wyatt leaned across the counter. Her hand fell on his
arm, and it seemed to him she looked through and through him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Tom..."</p>

<p>It was astonishing how the depression and the grime of the
long journey vanished. And because he had carried one thought and
one desire in his head for so long a time, the phrase that came
first to his tongue was a question. "Lorena, I&mdash;what did you
run off for?"</p>

<p>Her hand retreated and she relaxed. "What's happened to your
forehead, Tom? You've been in trouble."</p>

<p>He turned that aside. "What did you run away for? Is your dad
here?"</p>

<p>"He went back to Texas. I will never see him again, Tom.
Never. Here I am, making my own living."</p>

<p>"All by yourself&mdash;among these men?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Look at me. Don't you see how strong I am?" She
squared her shoulders and tilted her chin, her cheeks the colour
of pink roses. "Why shouldn't I work? What can happen to me?
Nothing can hurt me&mdash;nothing. Oh, I know what you are
thinking. Men sometimes forget the bridle on their
tongues&mdash;and sometimes they mistake me when I smile at them.
I've quit smiling because of that. But what does it matter? All
that griminess doesn't hurt me. It doesn't get into my heart,
Tom. After work is done I forget it, and I'm free again for
another night."</p>

<p>"If I ever heard a man say..." It shook him profoundly, it
woke a blind anger. What right had some of these guttersnipes to
bully her, to take advantage of their power and her helplessness?
"&mdash;I'd kill him!" Men of the range, no matter how rough they
might be, were trained in rigid courtesy; but the mining camps
brought the dregs of the earth along with the decent.</p>

<p>Her small hands formed a cup on the counter. "I know. All good
men feel the same toward a woman and it isn't as bad as you
believe here. All I'd have to do is speak about it and there are
plenty of fine gentlemen to protect me. But we can't live without
getting our shoes in the mud. Only&mdash;mud doesn't scar. It can
be washed away. And at night I'm free."</p>

<p>"Free for what?" he demanded, half angry. "Are you happy here,
doing this?"</p>

<p>There was a piece of a smile on her lips, a small quirk at the
corners that might have meant anything. She shook her head,
refusing to answer. "You're hungry. But I won't let you eat here.
I'm through now. Wait for me."</p>

<p>She went back to the kitchen. Tom Gillette moved to the outer
door and looked along the street. Deadwood was on the crest of
the night, and the yellow dust gutted from the hills during the
day now passed across the counters and bars in commerce. A piano
somewhere was being hammered, and a crowd roared the chorus of a
popular song while the sharp-edged notes of a soubrette sheared
through the masculine undertone. This was the dance girl's
harvest and the professional man's harvest. And among these men
San Saba stalked. Well, a night's rest...Lorena was beside him
with a basket. He took it from her, and they passed out and along
the street to where the hillside began to climb, Gillette leading
his horse.</p>

<p>"Now where?"</p>

<p>"To my cabin. It's only a half mile along the trail and a
little to one side."</p>

<p>"And you walk it every night alone, in this darkness? Lorena,
you're crowding your luck."</p>

<p>"I have a gun and I've always known how to shoot. Nothing can
hurt me, haven't I told you? Nothing&mdash;any more." It seemed
to him there was a trace of bitterness in the last words, but she
quickly covered it by a more practical explanation. "The diggings
are travelling on up the canon and farther back into the hills.
Some of the old cabins have been abandoned. I use one&mdash;it's
cheaper."</p>

<p>He shook his head. It was dark along the trees, though here
and there the quarter moon shot its silver beams through the
branches and created little lakes of light on the ground. The
trail grew steeper, and once she slipped. Gillette caught her
arm, and her body for the moment swayed against him&mdash;swayed
and pulled away. "To your left, Tom," she murmured. They walked
another hundred yards on a lesser trail. A cabin stood dimly
before them, and Lorena opened the door and preceded him.
Presently lamplight flooded the place; he went in.</p>

<p>"I have a home," said she, with again that wistful pressure of
lips. "It's my own. I don't owe a soul for it. I said I never
again would ask a favour in this world. Sit in the chair, Tom.
It's a guest chair. I'm going to cook you a meal."</p>

<p>The cabin was old, with a hard dirt floor, a cast-iron stove,
a pine bunk, and a pine board table. The chair was nothing more
than a dry-goods box; there was but a single window, across which
hung a square of burlap for a shade. A bare place, this cabin,
yet swept clean and impressed, in the odd arrangements of her
effects, by this girl's hand. She had spread an army blanket on
the floor for a carpet, and somewhere in this corner of a man's
world she had found white sheets and a slip for her bed. The
smell of fresh paint hung over the room, a single red meadow
flower decorated the table.</p>

<p>She built a fire, she rummaged the basket and placed the
dishes with a kind of sweet formality. She was humming quite
softly to herself, and from time to time she glanced toward him,
and again he had the feeling that she marked his features for her
memory. There was a grace to her moving hands, a sturdiness to
her small shoulders.</p>

<p>"Say, you ought to be tired," he protested. "How about my
wrangling this meal?"</p>

<p>"This is my party&mdash;the first party I ever gave. I was
tired. I'm not tired now."</p>

<p>He went to the door. A small wind sighed in the treetops and
eddied into the room. Away down the slope a camp fire cut an
orange pattern in the night; coyotes howled along the distant
ridges. What kind of a place was this for a girl like her? Things
prowled these shadows. And here she was, all that was desirable
in a woman, unprotected except for her own abundant courage. And
that wasn't enough.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Tom. Supper's ready. I ate mine at the
restaurant."</p>

<p>He closed the door. She had drawn the dry-goods box around to
the far side of the table and when he sat down she dropped to the
bunk and watched him.</p>

<p>"Well..."</p>

<p>"Not now. This is my party. You eat. Whatever is to come must
wait. That was the best steak in the restaurant, Tom. I want you
to enjoy it."</p>

<p>All during the solitary supper she watched him, yet when he
came to return the glance her eyes fell away. So it went until he
had finished and made himself a cigarette, the questions rising.
She saw them come, and she staved them off with a trace of
confusion.</p>

<p>"Now tell me what brought you here."</p>

<p>"San Saba's in or about Deadwood," said he.</p>

<p>She sat up. "Here? I haven't seen him."</p>

<p>"Well, he wouldn't be the one to advertise himself. It may be
he turned off the trail before he got this far, but I don't think
so. For a man of his kind Deadwood is too good a hunting ground
to pass."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Tom?"</p>

<p>His shoulders rose. The girl bent forward with so intent and
sober a glance that it bothered him. And she divined his answer.
"You don't mean to gamble on your life, do you?"</p>

<p>"I guess it's not much of a gamble, Lorena."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is! He's a dangerous man, he's tricky. He doesn't
fight fair, he never fought fair in his whole life. He'd throw
you off guard and wait until you weren't looking. Then he'd
shoot. Don't I know the man?"</p>

<p>"Once I see him he'll never get out of my sight," replied
Gillette quietly. Somehow he felt the need of justifying himself
to her. "I'm not doing this for fun; Lorena. I'm fighting against
my grain all the time I hunt for him. But the score's too heavy
on one end to let him go. Either I've got to hold up my end or
I've got to crawl out of Dakota like a yellow dog. The hounds are
yapping at my heels. It's been a bad year for Circle G all
around. Last week the P.R.N. tried to rustle me poor and one of
my men was killed in the scrap. They'll let me alone until they
think of some other pretty scheme." His right arm stretched
toward her. "Look at it. A killer's hand. The P.R.N. foreman went
down before my gun. I didn't ask trouble, but I can't back out
now. And San Saba's got to answer for my dad."</p>

<p>"You're not a killer," was her quick retort. "Don't say it of
yourself. I hate to see you divided against yourself."</p>

<p>"What else does it amount to? I reckon I should have stayed
East and learned to like tea out of a china cup."</p>

<p>"Don't be bitter, Tom. What good is that? You're too much of a
man to be anything else than you are or to love any land but
this. The East never helped you. It only hurt you."</p>

<p>He ran a hand across his face, and she noticed how the brown
skin wrinkled about his eyes, how dogged and unyielding his
features could turn. It was so now; she wanted to go over and
touch his arm&mdash;anything to sweep aside for the time the
troubles he carried.</p>

<p>"But this," he went on, indicating the room, "isn't fit for
you, Lorena. It makes me cold all over to think of you here
alone. You shouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Nothing can hurt me, Tom."</p>

<p>"What's to become of you?" said he, still on the same thought.
"Here you are all alone. You can't live like this&mdash;you can't
travel the trail by yourself. And there's nobody fit for you in
this part of the world. You're wasting the best part of your
life. I'm saying it again&mdash;you don't belong here."</p>

<p>"I've fought that out&mdash;don't bring it back to me. I said
I'd never ask another favour of anybody and I never will. I won't
ever give anybody the power to hurt me again. Here I came and
here I stay until&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Until what?"</p>

<p>She turned her head away, hands moving. "Oh, I don't know,
Tom. This is as good a place as anywhere. Until I'm old, I
guess."</p>

<p>"You were not meant to live alone. It's unnatural."</p>

<p>That brought the rose tint to her cheeks again. And still with
her head averted she asked a muffled question. "Who would want
me, Tom?"</p>

<p>He sprang up, he crossed the small space at a single
stride.</p>

<p>"I want you, Lorena! Can't you see that all over me, as plain
as daylight? I want you!"</p>

<p>She rose, and for the moment he thought she meant to run out
of the place. Such was the passing fright on her white face. It
lasted only a moment, and then she was looking at him in the
manner he knew so well. It took all the fight out of him, it made
him humble. "That's what I've been trying to say," he went on
quietly. "It's been with me ever since you ran off. What did you
do that for? There's nothing behind me I'm ashamed of or afraid
of. I waited a week to tell you that. There's no claims on me.
Whatever you think of Kit Ballard and myself is wrong. It's
wrong."</p>

<p>"I would never have asked you that, Tom. I wanted to hear you
say it, but I'd never have asked. I'll never mention her name.
That's your own affair&mdash;I've got no part in it."</p>

<p>"Well, you know now. I want you, Lorena."</p>

<p>"Tom, it's only pity you feel. And I won't have pity! I'm not
the girl you'd want. I can't be. What am I&mdash;what do I know
or what can I do? I can't help your name any. I see it clearer
every day."</p>

<p>"That's wrong. Look at me and you'll know it's wrong."</p>

<p>She began to tremble. Gillette touched her gently, and then he
was holding her, murmuring something he had no memory of. All
that passed in the succeeding moments was blurred. He knew he
kissed her; he heard her speak once and grow still, and the
silence of that small room was like the pressure of a vise. Her
small hand was pushing him away.</p>

<p>"If it only were true, Tom! What do you suppose I ran away
for? Because I couldn't stand being around you any longer! I
never wanted to see anybody I ever knew. I wanted to be alone.
And now you come and remind me of it again. Haven't I been hurt
badly enough?"</p>

<p>He was helpless. He had no words at his command strong enough
to convince her, he had no way of breaking through that doubt. So
he stepped back, groping for a hat he didn't have. "Time's got to
take care of it," he muttered. "I'm not leaving again till it's
settled. And I'm not going to let you stay here without
protection. I'm sleeping out under those trees."</p>

<p>"That's foolish."</p>

<p>"Let it be. You'll see me till you either get tired of me or
take me."</p>

<p>She was a queer girl. A moment ago she had cried; now the
familiar smile returned. "Well, if you must do it, there's an old
shed beside the cabin with some straw in it. But you only have
your saddle blanket. Take one of mine."</p>

<p>He refused the offer and opened the door. "I'll go into
Deadwood and stable my horse. Be back right off. It sure makes my
blood cold to think of you up in this desolation."</p>

<p>She stood by the table, and as he watched her she threw back
her head and laughed. He knew he would never forget the picture
she made, nor the expression of her eyes. "Tom, I've had my first
party. Whatever happens, I've got that to remember."</p>

<p>"I wish," said he, "you'd be certain of me."</p>

<p>"I've been hurt, Tom."</p>

<p>He said nothing more. Getting into the saddle he rode to
Deadwood and left his horse, immediately turning back. The town
still blazed, men moved restlessly along the street, in and out
of the lanes of light; and as he passed through all this glitter
and empty sound he saw a face bent his way. Thirty seconds later
it struck him he knew that face, and he stopped dead and turned
for a second glance. But the man, whoever it was, had gone. The
glimpse he had of it was blurred and indistinct, yet as he wound
up the slope it worried him greatly and he tried to reconstruct
the features. Coming to the cabin he found the lamplight still
glowing in the window. He called to the girl by way of reasurance
and went around to the shed.</p>

<p>Lorena's voice carried through the cabin walls softly. "Good-
night, Tom." The light winked out. Out of the hills came the
night breeze and the distant cry of the coyotes.

<hr><h2><a name="ch13"></a>13. DEATH AMONG THE PINES</h2>

<p class="first">SAN SABA came into Deadwood that night for the
first time, though he and Lispenard had been camped just outside
the town more than a week, watching its lights by night and
edging around the hills by day. That was the ex-foreman's wary
way. He didn't believe anybody in Deadwood knew him, but he had
no desire to expose himself for identification. San Saba well
understood his was a figure to attract a certain amount of
attention. Somebody would be sure to mark and remember him.</p>

<p>In the back of that little nutshell head was a crafty scheme;
a scheme that amounted to nothing less than a guerrilla warfare
on the roving miners. There were many such men already in
operation around the hills&mdash;in fact, San Saba had
established a kind of informal partnership with the group led by
Hazel. Yet nearly all of these renegades operated with a certain
degree of openness; most of them were known and suspected, and
San Saba's plan was never to reveal himself. He knew the temper a
mining camp could reach, he had experienced mob justice before,
and from this experience he drew his profits. So he would never
have entered Deadwood if the supply of grub hadn't been exhausted
and if Lispenard, an apt pupil but an unruly and sullen one,
hadn't grown restless for whisky. That was the extent of his
mission.</p>

<p>He had bought his supplies and his whisky and was on the point
of leaving when he saw Tom Gillette coming out of the stable. It
was only a fraction of a glance; Gillette's head swept his way
and then turned about. San Saba moved like a cat, a single
retreating lunge carried him out of the light; thus, when
Gillette looked a second time, the ex-foreman was concealed in
the shadows along the building fronts. San Saba's narrow-set red
eyes watched Gillette move off. For a considerable length of time
he stood absolutely still, the thoughts flashing across his
brain. Had Gillette recognized him? Well, it didn't seem likely,
for Gillette would have stopped and closed in. San Saba was under
no illusions as to Tom Gillette's courage or to his state of
mind. Only one thing could have brought the Circle G owner to
this place.</p>

<p>"On my trail, by Judas," muttered San Saba. A party of miners
filed past him, and he retreated farther into the darkness. "He's
caught wind o' me somehow."</p>

<p>His impulse was to follow. Caution stayed him. Gillette was
already out of sight, and there was a remote possibility of a
trap. Time enough to handle this&mdash;to-morrow was another day.
So he turned and quickly put Deadwood behind him. Up the slope
and on foot&mdash;a rare thing for San Saba&mdash;he carried the
gunnysack of provisions; on through the trees and to the edge of
a small clearing where a fire pricked the darkness. Lispenard
crouched by the blaze, a slovenly figure from all this riding and
camping out. The Easterner's hair had grown down over his
shoulders, and there was a thick stubble of whiskers on his gross
face. San Saba paused a moment, and his lips curled in plain
contempt. No matter how hard he lived or how little he valued the
Commandments, San Saba possessed a measure of fastidiousness. He
had a grain to him, a cold self-possession and a certain pride.
Lispenard seemed without any of these elements; he grew more
unkempt each day, and his appetites rode him like a scourge; he
was sullen and spiteful by turns and San Saba in a very short
space of time had grown disgusted with the man. Only Lispenard's
possible usefulness kept him from severing the partnership. Even
so the ex-foreman saw the day when Lispenard would pass a certain
mark and try to kill him. When that time came he must kill
Lispenard.</p>

<p>"All right," he drawled, as a warning of his approach.</p>

<p>Lispenard half rose from his seat, hand falling to gun butt.
"Who's it?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Me," murmured San Saba and advanced. Lispenard swore
querulously. "Next time I go to town, old-timer. By God, I'm
weary of living up here like a rat."</p>

<p>San Saba said nothing. Lispenard's eyes followed the ex-
foreman's hand as it dropped inside the gunnysack, and he reached
for the produced whisky bottle with plain greediness. San Saba
watched the man gouge out the cork and tip the stuff down his
throat. He drank himself, on occasion he got drunk, yet only by
degrees. This avid guzzling added to his sardonic contempt.</p>

<p>Lispenard let the bottle fall. "That's better. Where's the
rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Only one bottle," grunted San Saba. "Figgerin' on takin' a
bath in it?"</p>

<p>"Hell, I told you to get three or four. Have I got to go back
there to-night myself?"</p>

<p>"Yo' won't," was San Saba's short answer.</p>

<p>Lispenard glowered at him. "Don't tell me what I won't do, you
dam' scoundrel. I'll go if I choose."</p>

<p>"Yo' won't go," repeated San Saba.</p>

<p>Lispenard's yellow eyes rolled in a fit of uncontrollable
anger. He was about to rise and start away; but there was
something so cold and so grisly on San Saba's face that his rage
simmered awhile and died. He nursed his bottle again, the muscles
of his great throat standing out like cables.</p>

<p>San Saba dropped to his haunches and stared sourly into the
fire. "Gillette's in Deadwood."</p>

<p>Down came the bottle. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"Yo' heard my words. He's in Deadwood."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Fo' to see me, I'd reckon," murmured the ex-foremaa. "But he
ain't yet, I saw him first. Which suits me fine."</p>

<p>Lispenard swayed over the fire, half drunk. Yet he was still
sober enough to feel the weight of Gillette's name and to nurse
his old grievances afresh. His pendulous lips moved across his
teeth. "Then let's go get him!"</p>

<p>"Fine," was San Saba's dry answer. "When yo' get that Dutch
courage outen yo' guts maybe we will."</p>

<p>"I've got a score to settle, and by Godfrey I'll mark him so
his own mother wouldn't recognize 'im!"</p>

<p>"Two gallant gentlemen see alike," murmured San Saba with the
same ill-veiled contempt. His head turned slightly, and in a
moment he rose and stepped away from the fire, hands dropping to
his guns.</p>

<p>"What's that for?"</p>

<p>"Get away from that light yo' fool."</p>

<p>Saddle gear murmured up the slope, an iron hoof struck stone.
A rider halted along the outer rim of the light and called
brusquely. "Well?"</p>

<p>San Saba came into sight again, walking loosely. "Come on
down, Hazel."</p>

<p>The renegade leader rode into the fire's circle, his
pockmarked face strangely yellow above the coal-black beard. He
looked only once toward Lispenard as he slipped from the saddle.
To San Saba he dropped a covert wink which the ex-foreman
received with a slight drop of his small head. Hazel rolled a
cigarette and lighted it from the fire; Lispenard stared at him
sullenly and went back to his bottle. Hazel grunted in open
scorn. "What yuh doin' with that liver-fed trout, anyhow?"</p>

<p>San Saba kept his peace. Hazel swung quickly to another topic.
"Missed out las' night. Stage took another trail. We ain't got
the right information any more. Need a man closer to town. When
you throwin' in with us right?"</p>

<p>"I'll play it like she runs now," droned San Saba.</p>

<p>"Too good to mix in the shootin', huh?" growled Hazel.</p>

<p>"Too wise," said San Saba. "Let it ride, Hazel. We can be
useful to each other. I'm under cover. I can drag business yo'
way when it's too big fo' me to swing&mdash;me an' that..."
pointing toward Lispenard.</p>

<p>"I can plumb use another old head," muttered Hazel, "an'
another good gun. I got the Kid, an' he's rattle-brained. Us
two'd make a pair. Why can't you stick in Deadwood and augur out
the dope for me?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," was San Saba's noncommittal answer. "First off, I
want a man killed."</p>

<p>"If that's yore price for joinin', all right," acceded Hazel.
"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Gillette&mdash;cowman from Nelson way. He's on my track."</p>

<p>Hazel's face screwed into a knot. "Must be the same gent that
ran into my camp. Tall, black-haired? Yeah, well, by Joe, I want
his number, too. What's so big about him you can't do a pers'nal
chore?"</p>

<p>"Why take a chance?" parried San Saba. "He's a Texas
man&mdash;which maybe don't mean nothin' to yo' but it's ample to
me. He's watchin' fo' me&mdash;he's slick as a lobo."</p>

<p>"We'll get him," growled Hazel.</p>

<p>San Saba nodded. "Keep yo' men near town tomorrow night. I'll
watch him all day an' let yo' know. We'll ketch him outside
somewhere and..."</p>

<p>"Is that yore price for joinin'?" repeated Hazel.</p>

<p>"Make it that," agreed San Saba, adding a silent
reservation.</p>

<p>Hazel pointed toward Lispenard, who was stretched full length
on the ground, in a stupor. "Hell, I can't use him. It's you I
want."</p>

<p>San Saba made a slight motion with his thumb, whereat Hazel
nodded grimly. "Me an' the boys'll be jus' above the far side o?
town, waitin' for yuh." He looked again toward Lispcnard, and for
a moment all the evil in him flashed up to the surface of those
intensely black eyes. Then he turned, mounted, and rode out of
the light. San Saba circled the fire and kicked the unresisting
Lispenard with his boot toe.</p>

<p><br>Deadwood by daylight was half asleep, as if recovering
from the carousal of the night before; the street seemed more
cluttered, and the unpainted shelters more garish. Men moved
sluggishly, the miners were out along the creek and back up the
canon slopes. Here and there a pack mule stood waiting; an
occasional newcomer entered the town, an occasional prospector
trudged up the slope that led into the heart of the hills. Tom
Gillette sat inside the livery stable and watched the street
closely.</p>

<p>All the morning he sat there, his attention roving from door
to door; at noon the street grew crowded again and he drew back a
little farther inside the stable, grimly waiting. If San Saba
were within fifty miles of town he would sooner or later appear
on that street. Gillette understood this well, for Deadwood was
the Mecca toward which all turned, and San Saba was the kind to
be attracted by the vision of easy wealth. It was only a matter
of patience, and Gillette, who had ridden five days with the
fever of haste warming his blood, felt he had time enough to
carry this game to its blazing conclusion; not only because the
desire for retribution had been forged in him like a piece of
steel, but because he played still another game that required
patience. He had spoken the truth to Lorena. Until she accepted
him or drove him away he would be by her; that there might be
another end to the affair he never realized.</p>

<p>Past noon he ate at the restaurant; Lorena had little to say,
nor did he try to make talk. There was something of the bulldog
in Tom Gillette&mdash;once he had established himself he hung on
in silence, letting his fortunes ride with the events. As for the
girl, she seemed reserved, she held herself back from him, her
eyes inscrutable. She understood clearly the main mission that
drew him here, and as she looked upon his tall figure and the
settled determination of his face something like dread took
possession. She knew more about San Saba than he did; she knew
the ex-foreman's uncanny power with the gun, and she had heard
men of the Wyatt outfit discuss his cold and nerveless presence
of mind when in a fight. What chance, then, did Tom Gillette have
in an open encounter? She wanted to argue it, but she checked the
impulse. She had said all she ever would to Tom; anything more
would only make the struggle harder for him. This was the code
Lorena had been born and bred into. Tom would never turn now.</p>

<p>He slipped from the stool. "I'll be ridin' up the gulch," said
he. "See you to-night."</p>

<p>Her cherry lips pressed together; he caught a flash from her
eyes as he swung out the door. Saddling his horse he left the
town and cruised up the slope and through the pines while the sun
went westering. The trail took him along the creek, climbing away
from it until the water was but a ribbon unwinding below,
flashing like silver under the sun. Men toiled down there, men
picked at the hillsides, men moved in and out of the drifts they
burrowed; and always more men moved through the trees. Pack
trains went along the trail bound still farther into the recesses
of the Black Hills.</p>

<p>He studied all this with a shrewd eye; he made note of how
watchful and taciturn were those miners he passed on the trail.
And presently he turned back from his tour and returned down the
grade as the sun dipped beyond the ragged hills. Twilight, then
dusk with its blue shadows swirled among the trees. A halloo
echoed through the woods like a trumpet. Somewhere was a gunshot.
Deadwood's lights winked below. A man passed him on the trail at
a gallop, and he became aware of another horseman sitting silent
in the saddle, twenty yards off the road. All he saw was the
figure welded to the horse and a beard standing around the
lighter skin. He thought the man watched him, but of this he
wasn't sure. Dropping into the street he stabled his horse and
went to the restaurant for supper. As before, Lorena kept aloof
from him. But when he was about to leave she came near enough to
say:</p>

<p>"There has been a man watching along the street all afternoon.
I saw him directly after you left here. He's been across in the
alley looking toward the restaurant and the stable."</p>

<p>He nodded. She added a quick warning. "Don't meet me at the
restaurant to-night. Go on up the trail a quarter mile till I
come. Watch yourself, Tom."</p>

<p>He slipped out. In the next patch of shadow he ducked back
into an alley and circled the whole line of buildings, crossing
to the far side of the street at one end. Once more he travelled
through the cluttered boxes of debris until he stood in the alley
approximately opposite the restaurant. A man stood in the mouth
of the alley, and presently, as he turned and his face was
silhouetted against the light from across the way, Gillette
recognized the Kid, the white savage of Hazel's gang. He withdrew
quietly and later emerged through another alley to the street,
farther along. Here he rolled a cigarette and waited. Was Hazel
trying to get him for last night's affair at the camp by the
creek? If this happened to be the case, it further complicated an
already tangled situation.</p>

<p>"The hounds are on the trail again," he murmured. His life had
been violently turned from its accustomed channel these last few
months. Nothing came easy. At Dodge City his youth fell away from
him, never to return, and he had been plunged into mystery and
deceit and struggle. "Either I'm so soft I notice it too much, or
else I was born to fight. Damn Hazel."</p>

<p>A saloon door opened. Men spewed out, brawling like strange
dogs, and there was the spat of fists against flesh. Somebody
went sprawling backward and fell into the street; when the door
next opened to emit its momentary light a knife flashed in a
weaving hand.</p>

<p>"Stop it or I'll gore yuh!"</p>

<p>"Put that stabber away, yuh yella dago! Get yore possibles and
skin the camp. I'm through prospectin' with yuh!"</p>

<p>"Gimme my half or I'll write my mark in yore fat skin,
Fluger!"</p>

<p>"Go join Hazel's gang," was the hot retort. "It's yore
style."</p>

<p>A cool, unexpected interjection emerged from another angle of
the street. "Better handle that easy, partner. The walls have
ears, an' yore apt to lose yores."</p>

<p>Gillette's muscles tightened at the sound of the voice. He
moved backward, face turned toward the voice. A moment later he
was on the other side of the street and in the deeper shadows. By
and by he made out Hazel. Hazel moved across a lane of light.
Gillette drew a deeper breath.</p>

<p>"The man keeps his promises. Has he got the camp wound around
his finger?"</p>

<p>He travelled on, keeping abreast of Hazel and at intervals
catching a sight of the renegade. Then the man dropped completely
out of view. The restaurant was abreast Gillette, and he saw the
place was dark. Lorena would be about ready to go; he took to the
alleys once more, reached the stable, and got his horse. He rode
through a path of light and arrived at the trail. Fifty yards
farther up he turned in time to see a lantern rise and dip;
horses drummed behind him. Out of a growing caution he drew off
the trail and rested silent while they swept past and galloped on
until the echo of their progress no longer rolled back through
the pines. After this he travelled more discreetly, stopped to
mark some stray movement near by, and went on again. The night
wind rustled through the boughs of the pines, the moon was
shrouded, the notes of a banjo carried across the air. He halted,
judging it time to wait for the girl.</p>

<p>But he remained still only a moment. Uneasiness gripped him so
strongly that he turned and started toward town. The air was
tainted to-night, there was too much traffic on the road and too
many noises in the brush. No woman was safe here. The thought of
the girl breasting the darkness alone, as well as living in that
bleak hut alone, only added to the uneasiness. She was brave. But
that wasn't enough. She judged men too leniently. In this melting
pot there were always a certain number of human wolves
watching.</p>

<p>"It won't do," he murmured. "I can't let her go on. Reckon
I'll have to find some better words or some stronger words."</p>

<p>The wind seemed to rise and shake the scattered bushes. Shapes
sprang from nothing to confront him, and a familiar voice spat
through the darkness, metallic and deadly. "Let him have it!"</p>

<p>It was then too late&mdash;too late for him to escape. And,
like the unrolling of a panoramic picture, he saw a great many
scenes out of his past; foremost was San Saba's evil face
studying him across the tip of trail fire. That was San Saba's
voice over there. He knew it as he knew no other. Even while his
hand dropped and the whole hillside roared to the enfilading
bullet he filled his lungs and shouted:</p>

<p>"San Saba, you dog, I've come to get you!"</p>

<p>Smoke belched in his face, the crack of the guns was in his
ears. San Saba spoke back, but he couldn't hear then what the man
said. He was firing&mdash;that he knew. How many times he didn't
know, never found out. For this was to Gillette one of those
blind passages in life when all things merge to a shape or a
sound or a single vivid impression. He thought something fell on
his head; the sap flowed out of him, and the weight of his gun
became too great to manage. The saddle horn grazed his cheek, he
was lying flat, both arms around the pony's neck, tasting his own
blood. How had he got into such a shape as this? He should be
sitting up. And still they fired. San Saba was speaking more
clearly.</p>

<p>"Not me, yo' don't get. I'm puttin' a curse on yo' soul,
Gillette. May yo' burn in hell a thousan' years. Empty those
guns&mdash;empty 'em! He ain't dead yet. I want him dead! Make
him fall, knock him outen that saddle! That's the last Gillette
yo' trying to kill!"</p>

<p>He heard all this, though it sounded remote and unreal. There
was a trickle of strength in him yet, but life ebbed swiftly, and
his strongest desire was to get away&mdash;to defeat San Saba's
vicious desire to see him stretched dead. All his will went into
one arm. The horse moved downhill; he held on, the horn jarring
on his temple and his feet losing the stirrups. Confusion behind
and more firing. They would never quit, it seemed. Somebody
yelled, Deadwood's lights were below him. He sank his teeth into
his tongue to stay the advancing paralysis, he talked to himself
but heard nothing of the words. One by one the wires went down
and cut him off from life. He fell to the ground, rolled over and
over, and brought up against a stump.</p>

<p>He wasn't dead yet, he wasn't out yet. This he thought with a
dim pride. Of course the Gillettes were tough. They died hard.
Now, where had he been hit? Maybe he could stop the blood and
hold on a minute longer. Astonishing how a man clung to life. He
sent an order down to his arms, but they wouldn't obey, and he
knew that for him the fight was over. More he couldn't do. The
gang was beating around the brush, and there was somebody still
nearer calling his name in a thin and frightened voice.</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>Lorena. Out of all this blackness she came. He framed her name
in his throat with a painful care. One more effort&mdash;that was
all, just one more effort.</p>

<p>"Where are you&mdash;where are you?"</p>

<p>The energy to speak that name was gone. And then in dead
despair be gave up. She was forever lost to him. She was alone
and he would never be able to help her. How a man missed the sun
once it was gone. Nothing but blackness down this new trail,
nothing but blackness...</p>

<p><br>Lorena left the restaurant a moment after Tom Gillette
started away from the town. She knew he was somewhere along the
trail, and thus, when the burst of shots rocketed down the slope,
she instantly understood what was happening up there in the
shadows. She heard San Saba's voice lashing into the night, she
heard him call the Gillette name. At that she dropped her basket
and broke into a run. A horse galloped toward her, more shots
woke the echoes; she sprang out of the trail to let the horse go
by, and she heard Gillette fall to the ground directly to the
rear. She wasn't exactly sure that it was Gillette lying there
until the renegades started in pursuit. Then she ran back and
began to call, muffling her voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer. She marked the spot in her mind and
weaved back and forth in a narrowing circle repeating his name
over and over again, while the very weight of the night smothered
her and her heart pounded unbearably. She found him; found him
all in a huddle on the ground just as the beams of a lantern shot
along the trail. The renegades were at a halt, parleying among
themselves.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;go on, Hazel. His hoss is halfway to town by
how."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but he fell offen the brute. We got him clean. He's
back there, rolled in the brush."</p>

<p>"I brought this lantern so's I'd look in his face and see him
dead," droned San Saba. "Now, we're goin' to find the man and
plant the last bullet in his neck."</p>

<p>"Judas, but I never saw a fella as wanted another man so bad
as you. Well, let's beat around, then."</p>

<p>"Hustle it. Might be a posse collectin'."</p>

<p>Hazel's laugh exploded and echoed up to the tree-tops.
"Nobody's goin' to be in any hurry to investigate a burst of
shots. Not when they know Hazel's night-hawkin'."</p>

<p>All this came to the girl on successive waves of sound, rising
and falling, sometimes plain, sometimes only a murmur. She was on
her knees, her hands running across Gillette's body, touching his
heart, passing over his face. And still again she repeated his
name while the lantern dipped in and out of the trees, its
outflung beams striking a little nearer at each swing. They would
find her in a little while. In despair she caught his shoulders
and shook him. The warm blood trickled across her palm, and it
took all the courage she owned to suppress the cry that caught in
her throat. His horse had stopped the moment the saddle emptied
and now waited on the trail; if she could only get him into the
saddle once more...</p>

<p>He was too heavy to lift. Hazel's gang swept down the incline
at a faster pace, the rays of the lantern touched the ground a
scant ten yards off.</p>

<p>"He ain't far away, bet yore hat. Shucks, man, what's the
itch? I know we got him."</p>

<p>"I'll look in his dam' face befo' I believe it," droned San
Saba. "I got to see him dead with my own eyes. Wait a bit."</p>

<p>The lantern bobbed; they smashed through the brush, back-
tracking. Lorena's hand dropped to Gillette's heart. He still
lived, and that was all.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear God, why can't you help me? Why can't you?"</p>

<p>She made a swift calculation. It was only a matter of yards to
the creek's edge. Once she got him down there she could hide him
in one of the innumerable prospectors' pits and cover him with a
loose layer of gravel. She could hide until they passed. But the
horse was on the trail and they would see it. After that they'd
never leave until they had thoroughly covered the adjacent
ground. And then it would be too late; Tom would be dead.
Nevertheless, she got her arms about his chest and lifted him;
dragged him across the earth five yards before stopping. He was
far heavier than she supposed. She could go no farther.</p>

<p>They were back from the side hunt. Forward swung the lantern,
forward came the trampling boots. Lorena was on her knees again,
both hands stretched across his body. She thought of fighting
back, but there was no gun in his holster and her own was in the
basket she had dropped on the trail. Thus she crouched, a hand
seeming to squeeze her heart. San Saba's voice rose and fell in a
round, savage phrase. "Yo' hear me, Hazel. I'll put my heel in
his dam' face an' grind the sight outen him! It's the last
Gillette. I'm tromplin' the breed out..."</p>

<p>The veering beams almost touched her. Lorena shifted, and one
exploring hand touched and closed about a rock. Closed about it
so tightly that its jagged corners bit into her palm. She rose,
stepped to the trail and threw the rock as she would have
launched a lariat. It went high, carried beyond them and struck a
tree. The lantern twisted and dropped; instantly it was smashed
and the light extinguished by a grinding boot heel.</p>

<p>"Behind!"</p>

<p>"Yo' brash fool, what about a light now?"</p>

<p>"He's playin' possum behind. Stretch back there!"</p>

<p>The horse was a few yards removed. Lorena went toward him
cautiously. She caught the reins, she swung to the saddle and in
a flash she wheeled away from the trail and deeper into the
trees. The noise betrayed her, as she wished it to do. San Saba
was volleying words; words that were drowned by a double
explosion. The bullets were low; she heard them racing toward
their own horses.</p>

<p>All this was blind riding to her, she never had gone far from
the trail or very deep into these woods; but she pushed the horse
as fast as it would go, marking the town lights now and then as
they appeared between the pines. These lights sank as she kept
her course upward. It took time for the renegades to get a-saddle
and in pursuit, and when she heard them smashing along she made a
quick foray at right angles to her course, brought up by the
shelter of a thicket she felt against her stirrup, and waited.
They swept past her, near enough at one moment to have heard her
breathing. Then they were tangled in the pockets and the
underbrush of the higher ground; she waited a moment before
turning back. The sound of their own progress covered hers. And
they wouldn't return&mdash;not for a little while.</p>

<p>The horse took her back to the trail, but the exact location
of Gillette was another matter, and she felt, for a little while
absolutely helpless. Then the animal's shoes crunched against the
glass of the shattered lantern and instantly she was on the
ground, zigzagging through the brush. The renegades were out of
hearing, but a traveller came along the trail from town, his
approach marked by a belled burro. That meant a prospector going
into the hills; directly after hearing this new sound in the
night her foot touched Gillette's body. She dropped.</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;oh, my dear! I can't lift you, I can't let you stay
here!"</p>

<p>There was a smallness to his breathing that frightened her.
The belled burro neared her covert, and she rose and stepped into
the trail. There was no other alternative. This man she would
have to use.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>The bell stopped jingling; a gruff voice answered. "Do'ee hear
now? Ab's cat, is it a woman in this tarnal black night?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Ma'm, what mought be the difference? Gabe's my handle. Old
Gabe. Ask ary old-timer in the Hills about me."</p>

<p>"You've got to help. No questions to be asked, understand? And
you must never say a word to anyone. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Rags an' bottles. Mystication's what it sounds like. But if
it's a lady I'll be singed if I won't."</p>

<p>"Come behind me. There's a man dying here in the brush."</p>

<p>"Better die in the brush than die in a bed," muttered the
prospector. He skirted her and stooped down to run a hand across
Gillette. "Dyin' be about the proper term for the
sitooation."</p>

<p>"You've got to carry him a quarter mile for me. Hurry. He's
been here too long now."</p>

<p>The prospector settled to a knee and expelled a great sigh as
Gillette's bulk fell on his shoulders. The girl led away, up the
trail, and along the lesser path to her cabin. The prospector
murmured beneath his burden, and at the cabin door he let
Gillette down suddenly and whistled. "A hunnerd ninety pounds
solid. Nary ounce less. It'll take a big coffin, ma'm."</p>

<p>"Not here&mdash;inside!"</p>

<p>She guided the prospector through the door and to the bunk.
The man swung Gillette on the blankets. "A leetle light, girl.
We'll see the extent o' the perforations. Old Gabe's looked at a
plenty in forty years. If his lips is putty colour they ain't a
speck o' use..."</p>

<p>"I'm grateful. You can't see him. You must forget this cabin.
Never say anything about it. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Wal..."</p>

<p>Unwillingness trailed through the word. She shoved him back
across the door sill. "Hazel tried to kill this man. I'm hiding
him. If Hazel should ever find out he'd come back..."</p>

<p>"Oh, ay. That's a different set o' drills. Old Gabe ain't
int'rested. Didn't hear nuthin', see nuthin', do nuthin'. Ma'm,
thankee. Yore a fine girl."</p>

<p>"There's a horse standing on the main trail. Take him along
with you."</p>

<p>"A hoss thief? Wal, not yet."</p>

<p>"Take him. Strip off the saddle and hide it somewhere before
morning. Drive the horse away up along your trail and let him
go."</p>

<p>"That's a level head. Fine girl&mdash;fine girl."</p>

<p>She heard him go away. Closing the door she laid the barrier
into its sockets&mdash;a contrivance she herself had made since
living here&mdash;and crossed to the centre of the room. The
burlap curtain wasn't protection enough, so she pulled the
blanket rug from the floor and impaled it on the nails serving as
window rods. Thus secured she lighted the lamp and went to the
bed. What she saw there undid most of the courage she had
summoned this eventful night. Tom Gillette lay face upward,
coated with dust and streaked with blood. It lay freshly
congealed on his temples, and all along one shoulder it fashioned
a crimson badge; one arm was askew, as if it were broken, and it
seemed to her he had dropped down into that deep level from which
the earthborn never return.</p>

<p>She was crying again. She had only cried twice since
childhood, the other time being on the eve of her flight from her
father's shelter when the memory of Christine Ballard was fresh
in her mind. And as she stood there, shaken and helpless, she
thought it a bitter and cruel piece of fortune that of all men he
had to be the one to hurt her so badly. So badly that she had
given way to the emotion she most despised in a woman. Tom
Gillette had the power to make her cry, to break through whatever
armour she might put on.</p>

<p>She lighted a fire. While the water heated in the kettle she
ripped a sheet into strips and with the butcher knife cut
Gillette's shirt away from him.

<hr><h2><a name="ch14"></a>14. GRIST STRIKES AGAIN</h2>

<p class="first">BARRON GRIST obeyed orders because it was
profitable to do so. On his own initiative he never would have
committed an overt act of wrongdoing or dared to skim along the
slim line dividing legality from illegality. He wasn't robustly
crooked enough to face the law on his own account. But with a
corporation behind him Grist was another man. He borrowed courage
from those who hired him, and he fetched and carried the
corporation's dirty tools with the curious yet common philosophy
of his type: he wasn't the originator, but only the agent, and
therefore not bound by his conscience. After all, business was
business, and if the P.R.N. could get away with so many sins of
omission and commission what difference did it make? The strong
survived, the weak perished, and perhaps it was just as well they
did.</p>

<p>Whoever chose Grist for this job understood the man well.
Despite his colourlessness he was persistent in pushing forward
the corporation's affairs, dangerous when he had positive
directions to follow. Bred to Eastern standards, he never fully
realized one fact concerning the West until Gillette woke him to
that fact. Out here men didn't play at life as if it were a game
of chess: behind every transaction stood an alternative an
Easterner seldom dreamed of using&mdash;the appeal to weapons. He
had been discounting this until he saw his own foreman sag to the
floor of the saloon and spit out his last breath. That both
sickened and warned him as nothing ever had before. For five days
he kept to the Nelson hotel, and had he been left to his own
thoughts he might soon have resigned. His book of rules didn't
cover such a situation and he wasn't the kind to take long
chances on his own responsibility. However, he wasn't long left
to himself. There arrived presently the following summary
order:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">MAKE HASTE AS PER INSTRUCTIONS. PRAGUE.</p>

<p><br>
Grist tore the telegram into small squares and paced
fretfully down the dusty street to the railroad office. And,
still shaken by the recent experience, he dispatched an
extraordinarily tart response.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOVEL DAKOTA IN APPLE
BARRELS AND FORWARD TO YOUR OFFICE? GRIST.</p>

<br>

<p>"I'm sick of it," he told himself. "Dead sick. I've a notion
to quit 'em. I'll pull their chestnuts out of the fire, but I
won't set up as a target. Not by a jugful of cider. If they want
the south bank they've got to come into the open and give me
directions I can read. And directions I can show as
evidence."</p>

<p>But his rebellion was brief, and close on the heels of the
above war cry he sent a more explicit explanation.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">ONE PARTY UNWILLING. FINAL. GRIST.</p>

<br>

<p>"Let them do the squirming now. I'll be hanged if I read
between any more lines."</p>

<p>He was mistaken. Back came a telegram in the same enigmatic
style, as plain as a summer sky, and as subtle as three legal
minds could make it.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUR PROGRESS. BE SURE
EVERYTHING IS LEGAL. MUCH CONFUSION AND CONFLICT OF TITLES IN A
NEW TERRITORY. BETTER CHECK UP ON YOUR SURVEYS. ADVISE SEE LAND
OFFICE REGARDS THAT. SALARY RAISED A HUNDRED. USE ALL EXPEDITION
CONSISTENT WITH AIM IN VIEW. RANDALL.</p>

<p><br>
Had this been signed by Prague, Grist would have acted on the
face value of the message forthwith. But Randall's name augured a
different meaning; Randall was a miser with words, he loaded them
double always. Grist settled to a close scrutiny. "He's glad to
hear of my progress. That means get busy. He wants me to be sure
everything is legal. All right. If a man wanted to hit me with
his left hand he'd keep calling my attention to his right one.
That's a plain sign to sift the gold out of what follows.
Conflict of land titles&mdash;um. I know that. He knows I know
it. Check up on surveys with land office. Well, by heavens!"</p>

<p>He gathered the meaning. Why, this was as ancient as gilding a
brick, and as crude. Grist shook his head. "They must want
possession fearfully bad. How do they expect me to surround the
land agent? I rise to inquire. Grist, you'll earn that extra
hundred and live to spend it yet in a Federal jail."</p>

<p>He folded the note, mulling the situation over and over in his
mind. Finally he surrendered. Every man has a dream of creating
an empire. Grist had his dream; as far as that went he already
possessed the empire and was its titular ruler. But the horizons
spread out. More land, more power. And if he didn't do this piece
of work some less soft-hearted fellow would. "Therefore, Grist,
be about the business. Be about it."</p>

<p>He sought the land office. The agent saw him come, and before
the P.R.N. man said anything the agent beckoned him to an inner
room, closed the door, and went through all the motions of
extreme secrecy. The fellow looked harried.</p>

<p>"I know what you're here for," he muttered. "I know what it
is."</p>

<p>"You do?" was Grist's puzzled question. "Well, by Gad, you
know more than I do. I'm in a state of mind."</p>

<p>"I got a telegram from a certain gentleman in Washington,"
explained the agent. "A gentleman who exerts considerable
influence in some quarters."</p>

<p>"And so did I," grunted the P.R.N. man in evident relief. This
made the whole thing easy. How had they managed to pull wires
across all this distance? His opinion of his superiors rose.</p>

<p>The agent struck his knee. "Now, for God's sake, don't give me
away! I owe somebody for this job, and I'm paying my debts."</p>

<p>"With perhaps an added consideration for the case in hand,"
suggested Grist, feeling himself in control of the situation.</p>

<p>"I swear not!" exclaimed the agent earnestly. "Do you know
what would happen to me if...Well, I'd wear stripes."</p>

<p>"Entirely unbecoming to one of your tastes," murmured Grist.
"Well, let's get to our muttons&mdash;or our beeves."</p>

<p>"I do it under duress," said the agent. "If the commissioner
ever got wind of it I'd be crucified and hung up as a
specimen."</p>

<p>"Protest registered. Ever read what Shakespeare said about
protests? Never mind. Go on with the details."</p>

<p>The agent leaned across the desk. "When Gillette filed he
brought the location marks, and they were inserted in the
application. One of those location marks ended in a figure three.
The three has been changed to an eight. I won't say when or where
or how or by whom. But it's been changed. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Therefore," mused Grist, "Gillette is squatting beside water
he has no right to. And that particular strip of land along the
river is open to filing. Just so. But how about the
responsibility of the land office? Weren't you supposed to know
when he filed the location&mdash;I mean the location the
application now shows&mdash;whether or not it was the place he
had in mind?"</p>

<p>"We're not supposed to meet a man's mind," said the agent. "He
gave me the figures. I registered them. As a matter of course I
looked on the record to see if that location had or had not been
previously filed. That's all of my responsibility."</p>

<p>Grist got up. "Very fine. You make out a new set of papers.
I'll bring in one of my riders to sign 'em. He'll be the legal
petitioner. Next in order is a writ of eviction. Squatters right
doesn't apply on entry land, does it? Just so."</p>

<p>"Gillette will contest that," muttered the agent. "There'll be
a stink. But they can't prove malfeasance on me. It's his error,
that's all. Not my error. I'll swear those were the figures he
gave me. And what influence has he in the East, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"That's the essential point. You stick to your story with a
steadfast heart. Virtue is not alone in receiving rewards."</p>

<p>He went out, immeasurably encouraged by the turn of events. It
put him in a fighting humour. There was substantial support back
of him. Gillette couldn't fight Federal authority.</p>

<p>In the course of forty-eight hours he brought a P.R.N. puncher
in to file, also got a writ of eviction, and also by use of
sundry witnesses, had a warrant issued for Gillette on the charge
of murdering his foreman. On the appointed hour and day he met
the United States Marshal, one W. G. Hannery, and rode out of
Nelson, bound toward the Circle G to see the writ executed and
the warrant served.</p>

<p>"You tried to obtain possession of these premises?" demanded
the marshal, not in love with his mission.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not."</p>

<p>"Then what the hell about all this hocus-pocus?"</p>

<p>"Listen, how near that ranch do you suppose Gillette would let
me approach? How long do you figure he'd listen to me?"</p>

<p>"Not much longer'n I'd listen to you, if it was me in the same
skiff," said the marshal. "I'm telling you, frankly, I don't like
to see a white man's country tied up by a bunch of Eastern
highbinders, Grist."</p>

<p>Grist smiled. "How Eastern? That strip is being filed on by
one of my punchers. A son of the range, a product of the glorious
West who never was east of the Dakota line and never owned more
than a silver-mounted saddle in his life."</p>

<p>"Gush," snorted the marshal. "I'm dry behind the ears. That's
the old dodge. Well, if I got to do it, then I got to do it. But
you want to figure a high-power rifle kicks back blamed near as
hard as it shoots forward. Which applies to Gillette. And don't
come running to me if you get hurt. You're going to discover you
can't hide behind the petticoats of Justice all the time."</p>

<p>The two of them arrived at the Circle G houses and were
confronted by Quagmire and Christine Ballard. The marshal, under
the influence of her smile, thawed and reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"I'm inquirin' for Tom Gillette."</p>

<p>"Deadwood," grunted Quagmire. "I'm jef here temporary. Le's
have the hard news."</p>

<p>"Orders to get off," was the marshal's equally laconic answer.
"You ain't on the place you filed on. Said place, apparently, is
nearer the north pole. This fellow"&mdash;indicating
Grist&mdash;"has got the drop on you boys."</p>

<p>Quagmire squinted at Grist until the latter shifted in the
saddle. But the wizened puncher showed no surprise at the news.
He dwelt in pessimism, he always expected the worst to happen. He
contented himself with saying, "Something smells around
here."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask him to come along," explained the marshal. He
got down and tacked the notice to the ranchhouse wall. "Said
movin' orders are meant to be promptly obeyed. But seein' as
Gillette ain't here and it'd work a plain hardship to move
without him on hand to superintend such I'll hold off till he get
back."</p>

<p>"Oh, look here," protested Grist.</p>

<p>"Shut up. I obey my orders. I also got a right to interpret
some of 'em. I'm doin' a little interpretin' now. If you don't
like it write East to them land grabbers." He remounted and
started away. Then yards off he turned in the saddle and added,
as an apparent afterthought, "I also hold a warrant for Gillette.
Murder. Have to execute that personally. When you see him, tell
him to come and get it."</p>

<p>Quagmire met the marshal's sober glance and held it for a long
while. "Yeah. All right."</p>

<p>"Listen," cried Grist, suddenly aroused, "are you trying to
warn Gillette away?"</p>

<p>"A man's got a right to know the law's after him," was the
marshal's blunt answer. "Out here he has. That's another
interpretation. You better be amiable, brother, or I'll let you
ride across Gillette range alone. And how far do you think you'd
get before a bullet slapped you down?"</p>

<p>They went on. Quagmire waited only until the two were decently
beyond talking distance before he turned to read the notice its
full length. Then he ran for the bunkhouse and collected his
possibles. He saddled a horse and he haltered another. He gave
abrupt orders to one of the arriving punchers. "Yo' in charge,
Red. I'm lopin' fo' Deadwood to find Tom."</p>

<p>Christine crossed the yard and put a detaining hand on
Quagmire's arm. "Tell him I'm still waiting."</p>

<p>Quagmire ducked his solemn visage and galloped away. Presently
his path was marked by a faint ball of dust to the southwest.

<hr><h2><a name="ch15"></a>15. FLOOD TIDE&mdash;AND EBB</h2>

<p class="first">FOR seventy-two hours Lorena Wyatt kept her
solitary vigil by the bunk, her eyes watching his face for the
slightest movement, her hands now and then questing across his
heart; and for seventy-two hours he lay in the self-same posture
of death with only the faint rise and fall of his chest to
indicate he still lived. In washing him and binding the cuts
about his body she found the bruises on his temple to be only
superficial, they were not bullet made, although in receiving
them he must have been tremendously battered. On his flank, one
long furrow cut through the outer flesh and left a path more
sinister to look upon than dangerous. This she had wrapped as
well as his head, knowing they would mend, but the deep hole just
below and inside his arm socket was another matter. The bullet
still lodged there, and whether it was seated in solid flesh or
whether it touched his lungs she couldn't tell.</p>

<p>Time was the only mender&mdash;time and this man's splendid
power of body. There was a doctor in Deadwood, but Lorena knew
the medico had gone into the hills a day before to take care of
some distant prospector crushed by a slide. And he wouldn't be
back until the crisis came and passed with Tom Gillette. So she
watched, sitting helpless on the box beside the bunk,
occasionally touching him as if wishing to send some message down
into the deep pit he had descended; watching him grow grayer and
grayer and hearing his breathing shorten and diminish. To Lorena
it was agony. She could do nothing but wait&mdash;nothing but sit
by while he slipped away from her; and through her mind marched
the thousand things she wanted to tell him, wanted him to know
about herself. After that first cry she set her lips together and
never uttered another sound; when she sat her hands locked
tightly together; when she rose to replenish the fire her eyes
kept straying back to where he lay. Thus the hours dragged
interminably. Daylight wasn't so bad, for she could throw open
the door and see the sun and let the wind strike her body. There
was the sight and the sound of life by day, and it seemed to her
Tom held his own during those hours. But at night there were only
the blackness and the silence surrounding her little cell, only
herself sitting beside him and praying passionately to herself
and thinking queer unrelated thoughts...how the shadows fell
across the strong bridge of his nose...how much of a man he
looked...Christine Ballard sitting on her horse while Tom and the
Blond Giant slashed and punished each other. That day Lorena saw
the tiger in Tom Gillette and all his quiet reserve and all his
humour had been laid aside to reveal the primitive depths. He was
a man!</p>

<p>The first night was the longest, for at every stray gust of
breeze and every sound she thought Hazel and Saba were returning
to thresh the woods again; if they did so they would surely come
across her cabin and break in. She put the table against the door
and turned down the lamp until the room was dim and shadowy. But
they didn't come that night, and at early dawn she left the cabin
long enough to run along the trail and retrieve both her basket
and the gun Tom had dropped. She wanted to go on to Deadwood, yet
didn't dare. Anything might happen during the interval. So the
day dragged and the night came once more with her perched on the
box and her fists locking each other. And over and over again she
tried to throw her will and her desire across the infinite chasm
separating them, repeating to herself a thousand times, "You must
get well&mdash;Tom! You must not die! Here I am, right beside
you&mdash;waiting for you! You must not die!"</p>

<p>Sleep was the drug she feared, and she sat in the most cramped
positions to keep herself awake. Even so the time came when she
started out of what had been a sound sleep, to find herself lying
on the hard floor. After that she walked the floor in a kind of
shame. "I don't deserve to have him. What am I? What can I do for
my part in his life? what do I know? Oh, why didn't my mother
live to make me a real woman!" And then she bent over Gillette
for the hundredth time, to pull the quilt higher up, to let her
hands stray across the jet hair; once she kissed him and drew
back startled.</p>

<p>That night the woods seemed full of prowling creatures. She
heard something rustling the underbrush, she heard the scuff of
boots at her very door. And she was swept by all the mixed fear
and despair and cold anger of a trapped animal when she saw the
latch slowly rise and the door give imperceptibly against the
barrier. Then the latch fell back, the brush marked a retreating
body, and she relaxed. The man, whoever it was, was lucky; she
would have shot him before he made his entrance, for there was
something of the wild in Lorena Wyatt these dreary hours. Another
time that same night, well along toward morning, she heard a
cavalcade gallop down the trail, stop, and go on again. Then it
was day&mdash;a long-drawn day that marched into the third night.
And without warning Tom Gillette turned his head toward her, his
eyes clear, and a trace of colour staining the gray of his
features. He spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, Lorena girl. Get some sleep. Roll me over and
turn in." That was all, he fell into a sound slumber. It was rest
this time, not an unconsciousness. The crisis seemed to have come
and gone. He would get well.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" she murmured. She dropped to the floor and was
lost to the world.</p>

<p>She was roused by Tom's voice. "Girl&mdash;get up from the
floor!"</p>

<p>The sun streamed in between the cracks of the cabin; she had
slept the night through, Gillette moved his head slowly. "Lord,
how long has this been goin' on? What day is it, Lorena?"</p>

<p>She rose quickly. "Thursday, Tom. You have been here three
nights and two days."</p>

<p>"An' you watched all the time," he murmured, not quite in
command of his tongue. But he saw the nod of her head, and it
made him fretful. "First sleep you've had, I guess. It won't
do."</p>

<p>"I'm all right. Haven't I said nothing could hurt me? But you
don't know&mdash;you never will know how I felt last night when
you turned the corner."</p>

<p>"Me," he murmured, "I don't seem to be carin'. Feel like a
wrung dish rag. Ain't dead, but I don't feel much alive. What's
the extent of the damages?"</p>

<p>She told him, the meanwhile ripping the blanket from the
window and opening the door. She told him, too, of what happened
after he fell. Gillette moved one arm gingerly and started to
speak, Lorena checked him. "Not now. You've said too much."</p>

<p>"I think I could walk," he muttered.</p>

<p>"No, of course you couldn't. You'll be flat on your back for a
week, perhaps two or three weeks. My dear man, don't you
understand what happened? They left you for dead&mdash;you almost
were dead. Now sleep again."</p>

<p>He fell silent, eyes half closed. Something worried him, she
saw. And she knew what it was before he broached the subject.
"Lorena, I've got to get out of here. I can't be havin'
folks&mdash;. Well, put me in that shed outside."</p>

<p>She stopped by the bunk, her shoulders squaring. "What
difference does it make, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Get somebody to pack me into town."</p>

<p>"And let San Saba know where you are? My dear, I'm going to
take care of you. I don't care what happens or who may ever
discover it later. Now rest."</p>

<p>"Thoroughbred," whispered Tom, and closed his eyes. She put
the room in order, stirred the fire, and poked about the
cupboard; she packed water from the spring and presently
something simmered on the stove. The man moved restlessly in bed,
testing himself joint by joint.</p>

<p>"Legs sound," he murmured. "Right hand and right side in
second-hand workin' order. Shucks, it won't be any three
weeks."</p>

<p>In a little while she had a bowl of soup for him. He ate it
slowly; afterwards he seemed to expand with fresh energy. "It
won't even be a week."</p>

<p>But she saw the danger signals on his cheeks already. "Every
word you say only adds another day to the time you stay in bed.
Sleep now."</p>

<p>He sighed a little and shut his eyes again, instantly he was
asleep. The girl watched him for a while, or until a restlessness
took possession of her and she began tip-toeing about the place
looking for things to do. She wanted to sing, yet dared not, she
wanted to work, she wanted to do anything that would release the
surcharge of emotion within her. Going outside she took up the ax
and chopped boughs for fuel; then she rummaged around the shed
for straw and packed enough of it inside to make her a mattress
on the floor. Tom would not like it when he saw her making her
bed on it, but there was no other way. Strange how simple were a
man's points of honour and yet how complicated. As for herself,
she looked at it with that ruthlessness and that impersonality
most women possess at moments of emergency. Nothing could hurt
her&mdash;and the creed protected her like a mantle. Had she been
a sophisticated girl her thoughts might have travelled a
different line, but all her life she had been bred to look
squarely at the primary facts of existence.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon before he woke again. She was waiting
for him with news.</p>

<p>"I've got to go in to Deadwood, Tom. We've nothing to eat in
the place. And I wanted to see if the doctor was back from the
hills. Do you think it would be all right?"</p>

<p>"What's the danger?"</p>

<p>"San Saba will be scouting around here, won't he? Supposing he
should come to the cabin?"</p>

<p>He studied the ceiling for quite an interval. "Put my gun
beside me."</p>

<p>She brought his revolver and laid it in his hand; his fingers
closed around the butt slowly. She thought she had never seen so
quick and startled a glance in any man as she marked on his face
when he tried the trigger. "Judas, I can't be that weak! Trigger
must've got jammed in the scrap."</p>

<p>She smiled at the unconscious pride he had in his strength.
Even now he couldn't believe himself physically unable to walk.
So she took the gun and cocked it and laid it back beside him.
His eyes narrowed a little when he saw her do it, and a sigh
escaped him. "I guess I'm licked. But there ain't any danger to
me. You go ahead."</p>

<p>"I hate to, Tom. Only, we've got to have things to eat.
Anything you want?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. What I want is a preacher to perform a chore for
us, Lorena girl, but that'll have to wait till I'm able to
argue."</p>

<p>Her hand dropped on his forehead and skittered away. "Perhaps
there won't be an argument, Tom." With that, she got her basket,
closed the door to the cabin and went quickly down the trail.
There had been a prowler around the cabin for she marked the boot
prints in the ground; that worried her all the way to town and
speeded her actions. The doctor was still away, and nobody knew
when he was to return. At the restaurant she explained her
absence on the ground of sickness and arranged for more or less
of a vacation. She filled her basket and talked the cook out of
some fresh apples and a pitcher of milk&mdash;both rarities in
the camp. At the general store she bought a canvas bed tick and a
pair of blue army blankets. Men were gossiping in the store, and
she tarried over her bargaining to pick up the news, for she knew
Gillette would like to hear something of what went on in the
world. Most men did. Then she went back up the slope as the sun
fell and shadows closed around the trees.</p>

<p>She thought she was being followed, and with a swift sidestep
she dropped off the trail and waited a little while; it was only
a man on a horse going upward toward the diggings. A hundred
yards farther she swung from the main trail to the smaller trace
leading toward the cabin. Something moved out from the concealing
shadows, and a man barred her way. It was Lispenard.</p>

<p>His bold, swollen face rolled forward, and as he got a clear
view of her he stepped closer, muttering his surprise. "Well, by
Godfrey, are you the girl they say lives up here alone?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Lorena snapped, muscles gathering. She had
dealt with this man before, and she knew what slack and brutal
impulses stirred behind his heavy-lidded eyes. Somewhat more than
two weeks had elapsed between this meeting and the last; even in
that short interval he had grown more slovenly, he advertised
more clearly the breakdown of what once had been a will. With
this type of man, disintegration was swift once it set in.</p>

<p>"So it's you," he muttered again; she saw the sudden dilation
of his nostrils. "Our prairie spitfire. Gad, what luck!"</p>

<p>"Then you're the one who's been skulking around my cabin,"
said Lorena. "I never knew any human being could be so rotten. If
I were a man I'd be ashamed you belonged in the same..." A sudden
fear stabbed her. "Have you been rummaging around while I was
gone?"</p>

<p>"My interest," replied Lispenard, "is confined solely to you,
dear girl."</p>

<p>"Keep those terms off your tongue. And don't come any closer!
I won't stand being mauled by you again, hear me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come. Virtue so high grows dev'lish wearisome. What am I
to believe? Here you live alone&mdash;you've knocked around the
world quite a bit, I'm bound. Lord, girl, don't be uppish. I'm no
leper. I'm a man, and you'll look a long while before you find
another one able to measure me. Listen, it's a dam' dreary and
monotonous world, and why shouldn't we be agreeable to each
other? Put it this way: I'll apologize for my last little
outbreak and we'll start all over again. There's my word. Give me
that luggage and I'll pack it."</p>

<p>"Get away from me!"</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Lispenard, now within arm's reach and growing
angry, "who is to stop me? You've got no hero hiding behind the
trees this time. I'm going up to the cabin with you."</p>

<p>"No, you are not. Stand aside."</p>

<p>He was grinning. The girl stepped back a pace, her arm dropped
into the basket and came up again, holding a revolver.
Lispenard's head reared, and all the forced pleasantry left him.
"You wouldn't have the nerve to pull the trigger," he jeered.</p>

<p>"Haven't I? Come another step and find out. Let's try that
fine courage of yours&mdash;you filth!"</p>

<p>"Some day I'll punish you for all that abuse!" cried
Lispenard. He stared at her for several moments. "Believe you
would fire, at that. Spitfire is the right designation. But you
can be tamed, my dear, and I'm the man to do it."</p>

<p>"Get out of the path," she insisted. "Go around me and or down
the trail. Don't ever come near my cabin again. If I see you I'll
shoot."</p>

<p>She saw a sudden widening of his bold eyes. "I smell rat," he
muttered. "I believe I've stumbled onto something. By Gad, I know
I have! Who is hiding behind your petticoats? What's all those
blankets for&mdash;and the grub? You'd better be a little nice to
me."</p>

<p>"Must I stand and take all that abuse!" stormed the girl. "How
brave you are to be cruel to a woman, how very brave! You are
yellow clear through to the bone, Mr. Lispenard. I doubt if a dog
would walk beside you!" There was a click of the gun as she
cocked it. Her voice shook. "Go around me and down the trail! If
ever you come again, I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>He said nothing for a time, but he obeyed the order, circling
back of a tree and stepping some yards away. She turned, watching
for trickery. His mocking voice floated through the shadows.
"Don't protest your virtue too much, my dear. You can ill afford
it."</p>

<p>She never stirred until the sound of his retreat was lost
somewhere in the main trail. Then she turned up the slope with a
heavy heart, came to the cabin, and let herself inside. It was
growing darker, and Tom had no word of welcome for her. She
dropped the barrier into its sockets with a quick rise of alarm
and groped over to hang the blanket across the window again. The
lamp wick flared to a match; Gillette was asleep, his hand curled
around the gun.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that some special providence watched over
this man. How could it be otherwise when Lispenard stood within a
few yards of the cabin yet had not entered? And should she tell
Tom of the other man's presence? She debated this silently. He
needed to know it for his own safety, yet the knowledge would
only add another worry to an already long list. She was
strong&mdash;she could fight this thing out until Tom stood ready
to take it over. She wouldn't tell him until he walked again.</p>

<p>After Tom Gillette discovered he was a sick man and a woefully
weak man he made no more attempts to force the recovery. There
was a hard wisdom in him. He knew when to fight, and he knew when
to ride with the current, so he mustered his patience and for
better than a week he rested flat on his back, saying very
little; alternately sleeping and drowsing along with his eyes
half closed. During these latter hours he seemed to be in a
profound study, staring straight up to the ceiling. These were
sombre hours, the girl knew, and she respected his silences. That
was the way he had been fashioned, he was no hand to talk; as for
herself, she had little enough to say now that the crisis was
past. What went on in her heart, what was stored there, would
never come out, and she was content that it was to be thus. But
on occasions she turned to find him looking at her so quietly and
so steadily that a queer runner of emotion swept though her and
the quickened tempo of her heart sent the telltale blood to her
cheeks. Time and again she saw the very words trembling on his
lips, yet he never spoke them. It puzzled her, as the days went
on, and presently a doubt and a dread came to her. What was he
thinking? A man's code was sometimes unfathomable, sometimes
judgments were passed in secret by that code, and then never
again were things the same. What was he thinking?</p>

<p>But she was soon to find out. For, one day in the second week,
he turned toward her, wide awake and with an unusual intentness
on his face. "Come over here, Lorena."</p>

<p>She came beside him. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Take hold of my hand. Squeeze it as tight as you can."</p>

<p>She obeyed, wondering. Gillette seemed to be experimenting
with himself. "Fine. Now let me see what I can do." So she let
her fingers grow limp while his own slowly closed in, then
relaxed. He rested a moment. "I reckon I've been a pretty good
Indian&mdash;played 'possum to help old lady Nature. You go
outside a minute, Lorena girl."</p>

<p>"Now, Tom..."</p>

<p>He barely smiled. "Oh, I'm not going to be foolish. But a lot
depends on this."</p>

<p>She went out and started a few yards down the trail. Presently
she heard him calling, and she whipped around and ran back
inside. He was on his feet, the blanket wrapped around him,
supported by nothing at all save his own strength. And he was
grinning wanly, he was triumphant. "I'm sound. By Joe, I'm
sound."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, that wasn't necessary yet. You mustn't overdo."</p>

<p>"I had to find out," said he, quite grim. Then he sat back on
the bed and rolled himself in. "Didn't I tell you a lot depended
on it? Listen, is there any chance for me?"</p>

<p>She turned away from him and walked toward the window. The
width of the room was athwart them, and to the man it appeared
the width of the universe stretched between. He watched her and,
as always, he was immeasurably stirred by the clear oval of her
face and the round sturdiness of her body. She was
straightforward, she never traded with him, and sometimes he had
seen a light in her eyes that left him humble. At that moment he
thought he never had seen a woman so piquant, so alluring and
lovely.</p>

<p>"I am yours, Tom."</p>

<p>Just that. Spoken slow and just above a whisper. Gillette
gripped his fists together, his whole face tightened as if in
pain. "Lorena girl, you will never want, you will never regret
it. I'd sweep this land..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, I'm not sure I'll ever be any help to you! What am
I&mdash;what do I know&mdash;what can I do!"</p>

<p>"Stop that! There's no man fit for you. Not one! But I'll
try&mdash;come over here, Lorena. I'm sound of body, anyhow.
That's why I had to find out before asking you."</p>

<p>"What difference would that have made to me?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Maybe none, to you. But everything to me. By Joe, but it's a
fine day outside. I'd like to be riding&mdash;I'd like to
warble." He was smiling as she put her arm across his shoulder.
And when they looked to each other there was a kindling and a
flashing of some deep flame.</p>

<p>"Too much has passed between us for it to end any other way,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"I am yours, Tom," she repeated.</p>

<p>It was an hour or so later before she reminded him there was
no food in the cabin. There was another trip to town, and the
sooner it was done the better. She got her basket and brought him
his gun. This time his fingers closed about it firmly. "I can
handle the blamed thing now. Lord, but I hate to see you doing
all this fetch-and-carry for me."</p>

<p>"Why? Won't I be doing it the rest of my life?" She saw his
quick frown of disavowal and a swift, rippling laugh rang across
the small room. "Of course! I want to do it&mdash;every woman
someday hopes to do it. And I'm strong&mdash;nothing can hurt
me."</p>

<p>"I'll make it so you'll never have to lift as much as your
little finger," he promised.</p>

<p>She smiled and went out and down the trail. There was a man
speaking&mdash;so direct and practical in some things, so
thoroughly impractical in others. She was only just across the
border of womanhood, yet she saw ahead of her with that
instinctive clarity of her sex. Men promised to make life easy
and believed they had the power of doing it. Yet life was not
that way. There would always be pain and tragedy and bitterness
in the years, along with the blessings. That was life. But she
was strong, and the future held no terrors. For she had the man
she wanted, she had everything she wanted, and she stood ready to
pay for her bargain.</p>

<p>The day was fresh and clear; the sun shot through the tree
lanes and sparkled on the creek below. She thought she never had
seen a day so wonderful, nor had the joy of living ever surged
through her so powerfully as on this morning. She forgot
Lispenard and San Saba and all the unravelled business yet
hanging over her head. So she walked down the slope, humming an
old trail song to herself, and came into Deadwood.</p>

<p>The town seemed unusually active for a morning, the streets
were filled, and a kind of holiday air permeated the place.
American flags draped the hotel, and a great banner bearing the
single word "welcome" stretched across the thoroughfare. She saw
the prominent men of the camp gathered at the far end, all
dressed to the fashion and Deadwood's band stood near them,
instruments slung up to play. Turning into the restaurant, Lorena
came across the proprietor and asked him what it was all
about.</p>

<p>"Billy Costaine's comin'," said the proprietor, as if that
were all the explanation anybody needed. The name meant nothing
to Lorena, and she shrugged her shoulders, dismissing the matter.
There were more important things to think about than some remote
notable. The proprietor, noting her professed ignorance, was
mildly scandalized.</p>

<p>"Great snakes, girl, Billy Costaine's a U. S. Senator. That
breed o' cat don't stray into the hills very often. More than
that, he happens to be chairman of the public lands committee,
and he can sure help Deadwood. You bet we'll show him the sights.
When you comin' back to work?"</p>

<p>She didn't know when, if ever, and told him as much. In the
kitchen she filled her basket, chatted awhile with the cook, and
reached the street just as the band struck up a tune; the harmony
was a little off, but the volume was sufficient to prick the
nerves of every horse on the street, and for a few moments there
was an informal rodeo and bucking contest. Guns began to crack,
men swept along the way yelling and down at the far end a party
rode slowly into the town as if on parade. Lorena craned her neck
to watch; an arm touched her, and an absymally deep and mournful
voice said thrice over:</p>

<p>"Hey, ma'am&mdash;ma'am&mdash;doggonit, ma'am!"</p>

<p>It was Quagmire, his gloom-ridden, wrinkled face as near a
smile as it ever came. He was travel strained, he was gaunt and
he looked to her almost with appeal. "Doggonit, ma'am, it's shore
elevatin' to see yo'. Deadwood&mdash;shucks, what a town. I been
here six mortal days, stepped on, pushed aside, and about
stranglin' fer fresh air. Ma'am, what you livin' in sech a hog-
waller for?"</p>

<p>"Why, Quagmire! Oh, but I'm glad to see you! Come back here."
She pulled him toward the bulding walls, removed from the crowd.
"Are you looking for Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'll announce it far an' wide I am," he muttered. "About give
up hope, too."</p>

<p>"He's up at my cabin, Quagmire. Sixteen days ago he was shot
and nearly killed. He's just able to move about now."</p>

<p>Quagmire studied her long and earnestly. Something happened
inside him. "Who did it&mdash;San Saba?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "And several other men with him&mdash;Hazel's
gang. I've been hiding him. If they knew where he was they'd kill
him surely. You've come just at the right time. He'll be riding
some of these days, as weak as he is. And they'll try to get him
again."</p>

<p>He turned away, muttering to himself. When he swung about
again his eyes were tinged with red. "Sorrer is the rule in this
here universe, but it ain't no reason why bad luck should roost
on a Gillette forever. Too much has happened to that boy. Now, by
Judas, I'll play a stack in this. Lead the way."</p>

<p>Horsemen swept past, the band flared. Lorena looked out
directly upon the distinguished visitor to Deadwood, Senator
William Costaine. The Senator was a big man with an angular
framework and the face of a bloodhound. There was no fellowship
in the steel-tinted eyes that swept the crowd, no leaven of
humour on the gray fighter's face. Here was a man who had been
through the mill, who had emerged at the top of his profession
with few illusions and no fear. It looked as if he was thinking,
"What's the joker behind this celebration?" yet he was saved from
downright cynicism by an air of intense honesty. Lorena, of
course, was not aware of his reputation; but back in Washington
he was the scourge of the lobbyists. He hunted them with the same
ruthless pleasure he would have hunted predatory animals. His
cold, legalistic brain infallibly sought for the hidden clauses,
the quietly inserted riders; and when he spoke in the Senate men
listened, even while some of them were being stripped of their
reputations. He worked with nobody, he was a hater of compromise;
and therefore the Senator was almost entirely a destructive
force. But because of that very caustic quality he was a valued
and respected servant.</p>

<p>Quagmire shook his head. "Reckon he'd be a bad man to meet out
on the road. Le' go, ma'm."</p>

<p>As the two of them went up the slope, Quagmire leading his
horse, Lorena told him all she knew of the encounter. She even
mentioned her meeting with Lispenard. Quagmire grew more and more
taciturn. "I reckon Tom's got yo' to thank for bein' alive," he
muttered. The girl said nothing, but the puncher saw her face and
nodded to himself sagely. "Yeah, I see." And still he seemed
wrapped in despair until they left the main trail and progressed
along the smaller pathway. The cabin appeared between the pines.
Tom Gillette stood in the doorway, sunning himself. The two men
came face to face, and when Lorena saw how they looked at each
other and struggled to maintain a grave and casual expression, a
lump rose in her throat.</p>

<p>"Well, Quagmire."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Tom."</p>

<p>"Ranch burn up or did you fire yourself?"</p>

<p>"Figgered I'd give m'self a vacation an' go see the flesh-
pots. What's the use o' bein' jef if yo' can't cut a caper? Been
engaged in a little lead traffic, fella?"</p>

<p>"Some. Well, get it off your chest."</p>

<p>"Get what off?" mumbled Quagmire defensively. "Nothin' on it
but a dirty shirt."</p>

<p>Tom shook his head and waited. Quagmire turned to the girl.
"Ain't he a gloomy fool? Why should I have bad news? Ain't we got
enough? An' if I got bad news why can't it wait? Anyhow, they's
lots o' land in Dakota even if we been told to move from present
headquarters. Never did think much of our range&mdash;let Grist
an' his Eastern bosses have it if they want it so cussed bad. Of
course, a writ o' eviction has got to be obeyed, but mebbe they's
ways to flank it. Me, I allus thought we'd filed on the water we
said we filed on, but if they's been a mistake made in
figgers&mdash;like they claim&mdash;why, then whose fault is it,
the surveyor's, ours, or the land agent's? I'm askin'."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a lawyer," muttered Tom gravely. "Come in and
find a chair. Now that you're empty you might float away."</p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted the girl. "What are you telling us,
Quagmire? That Tom is being forced off his ranch?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," drawled Quagmire.</p>

<p>"Come inside," repeated Tom. The three of them went into the
house. Gillette sat on the bunk and rolled himself a cigarette,
never saying a word, but the girl observed a cloud passing across
his eyes, and she felt infinitely sorry for him.</p>

<p>"But how can they do that?" she demanded. "Haven't you filed
on it? How can they take it away from you?"</p>

<p>"Which is what I'm wanting to know," said Gillette.</p>

<p>Quagmire raised his two hands, palms up. "What I sorter
gathered was they was a mistake in figgers, and the water yo'
filed on ain't the water you're roostin' on."</p>

<p>"I've heard of such jugglin' before," murmured Tom. "Well,
Grist said he'd get me, one way or another. Rustlin' didn't work,
so he's turned to another kind of crookedness."</p>

<p>"Yo' better hit home right off," said Quagmire. "The marshal
said he'd wait till yo' returned, but mebbe that Grist fella can
force the transaction."</p>

<p>"I'll have to scotch it," agreed Gillette.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you can't travel for another week, Tom," objected
Lorena. "You're not fit."</p>

<p>"An', by the way," put in Quagmire with marked casualness,
"this Grist hombre's also got a warrant agin yo' fo' killin' his
range boss."</p>

<p>Gillette swung his head. That seemed to touch him more than
anything else. "The man's ridin' for a fall, Quagmire! By Judas,
he's pressin' too far. I'll fight that outfit until something
breaks&mdash;and there's gospel."</p>

<p>The girl, meanwhile, had gone about getting a meal. But in the
midst of this chore she had a sudden idea, and she abandoned
everything and entered the discussion again. "Tom, are you sure
the P.R.N. is behind all this?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely sure."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't all this land in the hands of the
government&mdash;doesn't the government have control of the
disposal of it?"</p>

<p>"That's right, too."</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway, looking down the trail. "I have
heard my father say some queer things about the P.R.N: If they
are crooked, why doesn't the government stop them?"</p>

<p>"Because it's a long way to Washington," said Gillette. "The
people behind the P.R.N. are pretty smart&mdash;and evidently
they've got plenty of influence. Money will go a long way,
Lorena."</p>

<p>"It isn't right," she murmured. "I don't believe the
government would allow it."</p>

<p>Quagmire looked at Gillette; the two of them exchanged faint
smiles. "It won't do us any good to squeal, Lorena. We can't
squeal loud enough. We've got to battle it out the best we
can."</p>

<p>"It isn't right," she insisted. "I'm going outside a little
while."</p>

<p>She hurried away from the cabin and toward Deadwood again,
just a little anxious lest Gillette should divine her intention
and call her back. The truth was, Lorena believed implicitly in
the honesty and the pervading powerfulness of the law. She had
none of a man's cynicism concerning it, and whenever she saw
those two symbolic letters&mdash;U. S.&mdash;she had a picture of
solemn men sitting in a row, covered by black robes and with a
flag hanging above them. She knew state law could be evaded; her
own father had done it. But a national law was something
different, and it seemed incredible that any corporation could
openly steal government land and not be prosecuted.</p>

<p>"It's just that nobody knows," she told herself. "If I can
only see..."</p>

<p>She reached town and went quickly to the hotel. The lobby was
crowded with men, reeking with tobacco smoke. Senator Costaine
sat in a chair at a far corner, listening to some sort of a
delegation. Lorena drew her nether lip between her teeth and
mustered her courage. What would all these men think of her for
breaking in&mdash;what would the Senator say to her for the
interruption? She almost lost heart as she watched the man. He
looked so grim and inaccessible, be represented something so
great. And, after all, she was but a girl. Then she thought of
Tom Gillette, and she squared her small shoulders and slipped
through the crowd.</p>

<p>The Senator saw her standing in front of him. Being a man of
courtesy, he rose, interrupting a flood of talk with a motion of
his arm. For Lorena with her piquant features and her black eyes
made a striking picture&mdash;even more striking at the moment
because of a certain nervous snapping of those eyes. She made a
pleasant distraction. The Senator, as a matter of literal fact,
was tired of the smoke and the heavy jests and the dingdong of
figures and facts and the representations and the pleadings. All
this was an old story. It never varied. He smiled at the girl,
whereat his features became almost pleasant.</p>

<p>"Senator Costaine," said the girl, conscious of a hundred eyes
watching her, "I&mdash;I would like a word with you."</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed the Senator. He took her by the arm and
moved away to a more secluded angle of the room. "You must not be
flustered by men in the mass," he reassured her. "They have no
more power to hurt you than singly."</p>

<p>"But they have," said Lorena, turning. "That's why I've come
to see you. Senator, could you spare an hour and walk a half mile
up the hillside to see a man?"</p>

<p>"My dear lady, if I tried to escape from these gentlemen my
life would be worth nothing. Perhaps if you could state, more or
less briefly, what the occasion was..."</p>

<p>"I know you are very busy," she apologized. "But there is a
man up the slope just recovering from an attempt made on his
life. He isn't able to come here, and even if he were able, I
don't believe he would. I do this on my own responsibility. He
has a ranch over near Nelson. Several Texans migrated there this
year. All were bought out by a certain corporation, except
Tom&mdash;except this man. He refused to bargain. The corporation
has tried to run him away, they have tried to rustle his stock.
And now they are tampering with his water right through the local
land office. Senator Costaine, why doesn't the government stop
such things?"</p>

<p>The question brought a remote smile to his fighter's face. "If
I could answer that question I would be a great man. The
government is composed of human beings, and it is human to
err."</p>

<p>An immaculately dressed young man drew near the Senator,
speaking urgently. "You've only a half hour for lunch, Senator.
We are due to ride into the hills directly after."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," muttered the Senator. He looked to the girl.
"As to this gentleman's affairs, that is a matter for court
action. If there is fraud&mdash;provable fraud&mdash;then I'm
sure it will be taken care of."</p>

<p>She saw he was about to slip away. "Can you always prove the
unjust things that happen? You know you can't."</p>

<p>"True. But how can you expect the United States government to
do much better? I should like to help you, but I'm certain I
couldn't do much good. It's a matter for the district attorney
over there. And now, if you'll excuse me..."</p>

<p>"Senator, do you know of the P.R.N. Land Company?"</p>

<p>His attention had wandered; at the question it came back to
her and his steel-coloured eyes seemed to narrow and focus. It
was as if a powerful light flashed on her face. What little
pleasantry his features held up until then vanished. "Was that
corporation involved?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I shall be extremely interested in meeting your man," he
said, and motioned to the immaculate secretary hovering anxiously
at hand. "Nicholas, I'm going out for an hour. No&mdash;no. I
don't give a rap if lunch does get cold. Ward off these fellows
for me&mdash;keep 'em humoured. And now," turning to Lorena, "I
shall be pleased to follow you."</p>

<p>Lorena led him into the street and toward the trail. Three or
four prominent citizens came along in hot pursuit; Costaine waved
them back, and thus the two of them struck up the slope, saying
not a word. Lorena had fought a battle, she had nothing more to
offer. And the Senator seemed buried in his own thoughts. They
cut off the main trail and went up the short little pathway to
the cabin. The Senator looked to her inquiringly, and she
motioned him inside. Tom and Quagmire apparently had seen them
come, for they were standing in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"Tom, this is Senator Costaine. I have told him about your
trouble with the ranch. I know he can help you if you'll
explain."</p>

<p>With that she turned about and left, hearing the dry, rasping
voice of Costaine carry an abrupt question over the interval. It
was almost as if the man cross-examined a witness. Lorena sat on
a stump and waited. A half hour, an hour; the immaculate
secretary came panting up among the trees. "Where in God's name
is the Senator? What have you done with him?"</p>

<p>Costaine ducked out of the door, grimmer than before. The
secretary spread his arms. "They're waiting for us&mdash;and
you've had no lunch. It will be an all-afternoon trip into the
hills. I can't allow you to neglect yourself like this,
Senator!"</p>

<p>Costaine seemed not to hear the man. He stood a moment in
front of Lorena. "My dear girl, you have rendered me a favour. I
think we have got wind of something that will scorch as big a
scoundrel as ever lived." Then he swung down the trail with the
secretary, and she heard him giving the younger man abrupt
orders. "Never mind, Nicholas, never mind. What's a meal missed?
I've discovered something about Ignacius Invering's peree. He's a
gone goose, Nicholas. As for the trip into the hills, that must
be postponed. We start for Nelson immediately."</p>

<p><br>With Quagmire on hand to keep watch and with Tom mending
swiftly&mdash;and becoming more and more impatient at each wasted
hour&mdash;Lorena was relieved of her long vigil. The men slept
out in the shed and took their meals in the cabin; and during the
following five days she often saw them loitering in the trees,
out of earshot, talking earnestly. She never intruded on these
councils; rather she drew back within herself and went about
those innumerable chores a woman never fails to find. If she had
her worries&mdash;and she understood that as far as San Saba and
Lispenard were concerned there was yet to be a day of
reckoning&mdash;she kept them hidden. No matter what the future
held, it could never by any stretch of the imagination deal with
her as harshly as had the past month. And so she was content.</p>

<p>One day Quagmire went to Deadwood and returned with a horse
and saddle for Tom; and for an hour the latter rode around the
hills, testing himself. When he came back, he slid down with a
kind of tight-lipped triumph. Still he said nothing, but she
observed that Quagmire made a second trip to town for supplies.
And that night at supper the puncher sent a mysterious glance at
Gillette and murmured, "Well, I got it."</p>

<p>At breakfast the next morning Gillette seemed unusually
preoccupied. Quagmire left the cabin and disappeared in the
thicket; and as if that were a signal Gillette came directly to
the issue. "We can't stay put any longer, Lorena. I came here to
get San Saba, and instead he about got me. Well, it's just a
score I'll have to leave unsettled. If I don't hustle back to the
ranch I'm apt not to have one. So we've got to pull out."</p>

<p>She was of a sudden busy at a dozen odd things, and each of
those things seemed to keep her face turned from the man.</p>

<p>"Lorena&mdash;it still goes, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't change overnight, Tom."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't think so, but a man like me can't expect too
much good luck, so I figured I'd better make sure. But&mdash;but
look here."</p>

<p>She turned. Gillette stood with his back to the wall, looking
harried. "You've got to know something. Quagmire only told me
last night, and if it makes any difference to you, the fact is,
Kit Ballard is still there at the ranch, and she told Quagmire
she was waiting. I want you to know I'm free. What's past is
past&mdash;and cold as ashes. I didn't ask her to come, I didn't
want her to come, and I'm under no obligations. You know where my
heart is, Lorena."</p>

<p>"That is your own affair, Tom. I told you once I'd never pry
into it."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got a right to know what you're jumping into.
Fifteen minutes after we get home she'll have to pack her
trunk&mdash;but I wouldn't want you to come up against that
situation without knowing of it."</p>

<p>She walked over to him, and one hand dropped lightly on his
shoulder. She went up a-tiptoe better to meet his eyes. "Whatever
happens, I will never doubt you. Never! And I want you to believe
the same about me. Oh, Tom, sometimes the whole thing frightens
me&mdash;it seems as if it can't be true!"</p>

<p>He gathered her into his arms. "By Judas, what right have I
got of doubting? You bet it's true. Quagmire and I are riding
into town now to settle our affairs. I'll be bringing back a
preacher&mdash;and a spring bed wagon and team for you to ride
in."</p>

<p>"That's not necessary. I can ride the saddle, it will bring us
home quicker."</p>

<p>"Nothing's good enough for my wife," said he gaily. He kissed
her and turned out of the door, red-faced. Lorena's silver laugh
followed him down the slope and from the distance he turned to
grin at her. "You've got to remember I'm not used to this sort of
thing yet."</p>

<p>"Some day it will be so old a story you'll forget."</p>

<p>"Not while sun shines or grass grows!"</p>

<p>Quagmire came out of the trees and joined Tom. Together the
two of them followed the trail to town. Quagmire already had
dickered for a wagon and a team, and Tom verified the bargain,
paid for it, and went rummaging around the stores for
accessories. He bought a light tent, a patented oven, and sundry
dishes. He bought this and he bought that while Quagmire made
relays from store to wagon, gloomy and skeptical. When all the
purchasing was done and Gillette returned to the wagon he was
somewhat staggered at the burden it made. Quagmire only spat on
the ground and echoed a scant phrase.</p>

<p>"Yo' figgerin' to enter the freight business? Better hire six
more hosses."</p>

<p>"Hush," grinned Gillette. "On a day like this I'm apt to do
'most anything. Quagmire, nothing's good enough for that girl.
Now where's a preacher?"</p>

<p>No more than an hour elapsed from the time they entered
Deadwood to the time they crawled upward through the trees. The
smaller trail would not admit the wagon, and they were forced
around in and out of the occasional alleyways. Gillette hallooed
at the cabin and jammed on the brakes impatiently. Quagmire kept
his seat, and the parson gingerly slid down and combed his
whiskers with his fingers. Gillette walked toward the open
door.</p>

<p>"Lorena&mdash;all right, Lorena."</p>

<p>She had no answer for him. When he looked into the cabin all
the humour and the anticipation were swept from his face. She was
not there. And that was only a part of the story, for every
movable piece of furniture in the room was overturned, dishes
were shattered, and his questing eyes saw a piece of her dress as
big as his hand and ripped on all sides lying on the floor. That
room had seen a tremendous struggle. Lorena had been kidnapped!

<hr><h2><a name="ch16"></a>16. A DUEL</h2>

<p class="first">SAN SABA was no fool; he had all of an animal's
perceptions, he almost instinctively knew when to avoid danger
and when to crowd his luck. In no other way could the man have
survived so long his doubtful and shaded existence. Sometimes
those perceptions prompted him to do queer things; more than
once, when in the full tide of fortune, he had quietly taken to
his horse and left the scene of his victories behind him,
apparently impelled by no other motive than that of plain
cowardice. And there had also been occasions when San Saba stuck
to his course when every indication would have warned an even
less cautious man. The ex-foreman was full of seeming
contradictions. He had absolutely no scruples, and it must be
said of him that he had an abundance of a certain kind of
courage; for all of that he was no firebrand, and he seldom took
an open course when a secret one served him as well. What made so
dangerous a figure was that uncanny ability to sense the thoughts
of others and to feel and to interpret the cross-currents
sweeping around him.</p>

<p>Thus he knew that Lispenard harboured some secret design. It
took no great amount of perception to fathom this sullen and
changeable figure, but it did augur uncommon wisdom that San Saba
forbore forcing the issue. He waited as the days passed along and
Lispenard grew more and more restless and more and more given
over to fitful periods of brooding. The man rode out into the
hills a great deal and always came back with a smouldering fire
in his eyes, and after these excursions he always affected a
casualness that only the more plainly warned San Saba. Still the
ex-foreman bided his time. Then one morning Lispenard saddled his
horse earlier than usual and started away without comment, San
Saba's small eyes narrowed, and he called after the man.</p>

<p>"We got a chore with Hazel to-night. Don't forget it."</p>

<p>Lispenard turned fretfully. "To hell with Hazel. What's he
done for us? Oh, I'll be around when the time comes."</p>

<p>San Saba squatted on the ground, listening to the horse's
hoofs crunch across the fallen twigs. The sound scarcely had died
out before he was up and over to his own mount in one swift dive;
and as he started in pursuit of the Blond Giant his arm dropped
toward the gun at his belt. Every feature grew cramped and bleak,
the tell-tale film of crimson spread around the white of his
eyes. "The dawg&mdash;the rotten-livered houn'! He ain't fitten
to know what he does know&mdash;he's too rotten to live.
Gillette's up there&mdash;he's traffickin' with the man. Sho'. He
can't play that game with me."</p>

<p>He quickened his pace, then stopped as he saw Lispenard
crossing a distant alley of the forest; then he went on again
with all the stealthy intentness of a cat.</p>

<p>As for Lispenard, he had no caution about him this day; he was
ridden by a solitary desire, and the farther he advanced the
greater it became. Earlier, when he first discovered Lorena, he
had been at some pains to conceal the nature of his expeditions,
to double back and watch for pursuit. But San Saba had never
followed, and in time Lispenard grew careless in this maze of
trickery. He suspected Gillette's presence in the cabin, and he
lay cached day after day among the bushes until he saw the man
step uncertainly out into the sunlight. At that point he had a
fair target. He could have killed Gillette from ambush, or he
could have set San Saba afresh on the trail, neither of which
acts was he above doing. Instead, he kept his own counsel and
waited.</p>

<p>Before he got within sight of the cabin he heard Gillette
calling back to the girl, and later he saw both Gillette and
Quagmire swing down toward Deadwood. This was the situation for
which he had long waited; directly they were out of sight he
slipped off his horse, crept around on the blind side of the
cabin, and circled until he stood by the door. She was singing to
herself, crossing and recrossing the room. He marked her step
until it came quite near the door, then he slid up to the
entrance, traversed it at a stride and came face to face with
her.</p>

<p>She drew back, she started to turn. His arms caught her like a
trap, and all the pent-up sullen rage broke across the few flimsy
barriers left of his decency. He struck her with his closed fist,
and when she cried out and the echo of that cry trembled through
the still, hot air he struck her again and shook her with all his
strength.</p>

<p>"Shut up&mdash;you spitfire! I won't be bilked any more. By
Godfrey, you'll pay your bill to me and you'll pay it in a neat
lump sum!"</p>

<p>Her gun lay on the bunk, only a yard removed; and as she saw
the taint in his bold eyes and the swollen flabbiness of his face
every fibre in her revolted, every ounce of strength went into a
great effort at freedom. He was a little off guard, and she
wrenched an arm free and struck him across the mouth; her nails
tore twin furrows in his slack lips, laid open the skin about his
eyes. He let go of her then, and she sprang back; the table was
between her and the bunk, and before she could circle around he
came raging over the interval. She tried to make the table serve
as a bulwark. His thick arms took it up and smashed it against
the room wall as if it were only a toy. After that, and for all
her courage, everything seemed to grow dim. She felt herself
throwing things at him, she felt her back near to breaking as he
caught her. His fist dropped on her shoulder with all the effect
of a sledge; and when she next knew anything clearly she was in
front of him, on his horse, going swiftly up the hillside and
deeper into the trees.</p>

<p>All her instincts summoned her to keep up the struggle. Yet
when she tried to pull away and drop to the ground she found
herself pitifully weak, and all she succeeded in doing was to
arouse his unbalanced anger so much more. His circling arm cut
into her waist.</p>

<p>"Now stop it&mdash;stop it! I'm done with using words on you,
my dear. Quite unmannerly of a gentleman to strike a lady. But
I'm no gentleman and you're no lady. And you've had this coming
to you for a long, long time. You laid open my scalp with that
sharp tongue of yours more than once. I suppose you think your
sex protects you. Well, it doesn't. Stop that moving about or
I'll squeeze you purple."</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you knew?" was his mocking retort. "You will
never see Deadwood again, you will never see your charming hero
again. My great regret is that I had to watch him day after day
and couldn't shoot."</p>

<p>"Put me down!"</p>

<p>"You had better save your breath. There is one great lesson in
my life, my dear girl, I wish to impress upon you. Never judge a
man by appearances. I may have looked simple..."</p>

<p>The horse carried them upward and on. Once Lispenard dragged
harshly at the reins and set the horse on its haunches. The man
was muttering to himself and staring around at the trees.
"Where's that rustling?" Then he went on, sinking his spurs deep
into the animal's flesh. They fell over a rise and started down a
pocket. The courage was out of the girl, she felt cold,
pulseless; somewhere, deep down, hope was dying and all her fine
dreams shrivelled and scattered. There was no good in this
man&mdash;not an honest impulse, not a single saving grace. He
represented the most debased point to which a human being could
fall, he was the most brutal and degenerate specimen upon the
earth&mdash;a man trained to be civilized, reared in the graces
and knowing right from wrong, yet deliberately throwing all this
overboard and reverting to the jungle. There was no element in
Lispenard to which she could appeal, she was utterly defenseless.
Even the animals had a code of a kind; this creature with the
wild, bulging eyes, racked by passion and swayed by sullen anger
and petty spites and raging thirsts, had no code.</p>

<p>They swept out of the depression and smashed through the
brush, Lispenard never ceasing his mutter of talk and his weaving
inspection of the forest around him. Something was on his mind,
and the farther they travelled the harder he gripped her and the
more he punished his horse, raking his spurs all along the
animal's flanks, sawing at the reins. As badly as she herself was
placed she felt sorry for the beast; the man was killing it with
his temper. And presently she began to feel ashamed of her own
lack of spirit.</p>

<p>"Let me down! You can't go on with this. You'll be caught
sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;you think so? Well, I'm not the tender Easterner any
more, girl. I've studied under good heads. D'you think your
blessed Tom Gillette will ever catch up? He can't do more than
sit in a saddle. By Godfrey, I wish he would follow! There's a
debt I'd like to pay. Oh, but I'll pay it! I'll leave him in
torment the rest of his life!"</p>

<p>"Let me down!"</p>

<p>"Stop that screeching, or I'll give you something to cry
about!"</p>

<p>"You'll never get away, you swine!"</p>

<p>"Don't believe all you read in the story books," he jeered.
"I've got a nice little retreat picked up here. And you'll wash
and mend and cook for me while they search till the very pit
freezes over. You'll see 'em within hand's reach, too, but I'll
have you whipped then! You won't have enough spirit to raise your
head!"</p>

<p>They swept into another small depression, ringed around by the
pines. The horse swerved, and Lispenard sat back in his saddle to
curb the animal, his grip on the girl relaxing. She had been
watching for such a moment; her whole body gathered into one last
effort, she wrenched the encircling arm free and flung herself
outward and down, landing asprawl on the uneven ground.
Lispenard's cry of rage broke like a bomb in the glade, the horse
came to a swirling halt, and the man sprang from the saddle.
Lorena rose and ran. If she only could reach the shelter of the
trees and just for a moment put him off the trail...She heard his
heavy body pounding in pursuit, she heard his laboured breathing
nearer and nearer; she knew she had no right to look around, but
the fear she had of him was stronger than her reason. So she
turned her head just as his great arm came swinging outward. It
struck her on the temple and she collapsed, crying like a child
with a broken heart.</p>

<p>Lispenard stood over her, watching her face. But for the
moment she was done, she had no tricks left in her. The brush
rattled behind him, and he whirled about, yanking the gun from
his belt and challenging.</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Lispenard's rolling eyes passed around
the circle; a patch of sun came through the aperture of the trees
and sparkled along his sweat-beaded face. In the hard light he
seemed more gross, more frenzied than before; the great muscles
of his neck stood out sharply, and his immense chest rose and
fell to his laboured breathing. Presently he became aware that he
made a fair target, and the thought sent him tramping around the
edge of the glade, knees springing at each step and his gun
veering from side to side. Down went his yellow head, like that
of an enraged and trapped bull. Near the girl he stopped.</p>

<p>"Get up!"</p>

<p>He saw her tremble; it seemed only to rouse the last vile
dregs of his temper. "Get up, you spitfire! Don't sham with me!
I've got you and I'll keep you! Next time you try that I'll break
bones! Get up!"</p>

<p>The brush stirred behind him; he swung on his heels, every
flabby muscle of his face cutting a seam across the white flesh.
Lorena rose to her knees and turned her head. Across, on the
opposite side from Lispenard, San Saba stood framed between two
small pines; the ex-foreman's little red eyes were affixed to
Lispenard's back and his thin features were set and drained of
emotion. Even as she looked, his arms dropped and rose, and there
was a gun levelled in his palm.</p>

<p>"Turn aroun', yella-belly."</p>

<p>Lispenard revolved, the breath blasting out of his mouth. "By
Godfrey!"</p>

<p>"Drop that gun."</p>

<p>Lispenard appeared rooted; his eyes rolled and flashed. "No by
a..."</p>

<p>"Drop it or yo' die this minute."</p>

<p>The gun fell. San Saba stood straighter, and there was an
imperceptible flickering of emotion across his gray lips. "Yo'
been deceivin' me right along, man," said he, droning out the
words. "Yo' knew Gillette was in that cabin. Yo' tricked me to
he'p yo' own plans."</p>

<p>"Well," snapped Lispenard, "he's still there. Go back and get
him if you want him. Don't interfere with me."</p>

<p>"Trash. Yo' jest trash. I don't traffic with women, and I got
no use fo' a man as does."</p>

<p>"Don't be pious! Get out of my affairs!"</p>

<p>"No, suh. I'm a dam' rascal, like I once told you. But I don't
sleep with snakes. Well, yo' had yo' minute of grace. I'm wipin'
yo' out now."</p>

<p>Lispenard saw death across the interval and his whole face
twisted into lines of agony. "Here&mdash;let me get my gun. You
tricked me out of it. Fair fight."</p>

<p>"I don't fight fair," said San Saba, each word falling sharp
and rhythmically across the space, "unless I've got to."</p>

<p>The girl averted her head from the ex-foreman. She felt the
movement of Lispenard's body; there was a single smashing echo,
and the Blond Giant was on the ground, threshing his life away.
She had never heard a cry wrung out of any creature half so
shrill or so despairing; San Saba's boots advanced, quite slowly,
each slap and squeal of leather cutting a deeper furrow into her
nerves. He passed behind her, he stopped. The fallen man's breath
came in tremendous gulps. There was one more shot, and then utter
silence descended upon the glade, and the girl sat on her knees,
hands over her face as if she was praying. Out of that silence,
as long as a century, came San Saba's brittle words.</p>

<p>"Yo' have nothin' to fear from me, ma'm. I don't traffic in
women."</p>

<p>She thought she heard a shuttering sound away down the slope.
San Saba spoke a little more quickly. "Ma'm, yo' got nothin' to
fear. Stand up. Did the dawg do an&mdash;?"</p>

<p>There was a break to the sentence. She looked up to see the
man facing north, slightly bent, and his little eyes running back
and forth over the trees. The drumming became plainer, more
insistent, brush broke and crackled. San Saba shook his head at
her. "Keep still. No sound from yo'." He retreated and presently
was in the thicket. Lorena got to her feet, meaning to run over
and meet the oncoming horsemen; before she could move Gillette
swept into the clearing, hatless, and a streak of crimson fresh
on his face. Lorena flung up her arms, crying, "Tom&mdash;look
out&mdash;watch the bushes!"</p>

<p>She saw him sway. A shot blasted the glade. Gillette was pat
against his saddle, gun speaking along the far side of his horse.
There was a rumbling yell, and Quagmire spurred on across the
opening. More shots ran into each other, and a swift exchange of
words rumbled and died out there beyond sight. The brush smashed,
Quagmire sounded again, farther off; at this Tom slipped from his
saddle and gathered the girl toward him, saying not a word.</p>

<p>Quagmire returned, wrath simmering on his morose face. "San
Saba. Pullin' consid'ble leather. Waitin' to take a bite at yo',
Tom. Looks like he got a stray skunk befo' he lit out, though.
Durnedest fella ever I met. One shot an' run. Shucks, I couldn't
ketch him with this hay burner."</p>

<p>"Let's turn back," said Gillette. He stepped around the girl,
shielding her from the sight of the dead Lispenard; he put her
into his own saddle and took the dead man's horse. The three of
them rode down the slope single file.</p>

<p>"One chore done, another to do," murmured Quagmire. "Allus a
little bit o' scandal left over. It ain't creation's pu'pose ever
to let mortal man get a square deal. All we do from cradle to
grave is play a rigged game. Ain't it foolish?"


<hr><h2><a name="ch17"></a>17. ALL TRAILS CROSS</h2>

<p class="first">THEY came back to the cabin. The horses and
wagon stood in the clearing, the preacher sat on a stump trimming
himself a switch; and when Lorena saw him her tired, troubled
face turned to Tom in a mute appeal. He helped her to the ground,
murmuring:</p>

<p>"I know it's been a mighty hard day. Can't blame you for not
wanting to be married after all this water's gone under the
bridge. If you'd rather postpone it until tomorrow..."</p>

<p>She shook her head slightly and motioned toward the cabin.
Once inside she closed the door and faced him. "It's not so much
that, Tom. I know I should be sorry for the man, but after all's
happened I can't bring myself to feel much sympathy. It had to
happen, he was doomed to die; all I regret is that San Saba was
so cruel about it&mdash;so cruel, Tom!" She stopped a moment, and
he saw her fighting for control. He was about to support her; she
shook her head again. "I'm strong&mdash;nothing can hurt me. It
isn't that, but..."</p>

<p>"You've changed your mind?" he asked, the words running
together.</p>

<p>"Tom, I can't ever change my mind as far as I'm concerned with
you! What's in me will always be there. But why do other people
live so securely while with us everything goes wrong? The very
moment I saw you, Tom, trouble started for you and everyone near
you. I know it. Treachery and bloodshed and bitter
feeling&mdash;and now you are about to lose all that you
own."</p>

<p>"You've had nothing to do with it," he interrupted almost
roughly. "What's to be is to be. All this is in the cards. A
man's got to fight to live. What you saw to-day is on your
mind&mdash;it'll die out."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. Sometimes I think it's a warning for me not to
marry you. What can I bring to you, Tom? The other girl, she's
more of your kind&mdash;she's beautiful and she's educated. She
can talk of the things you know, she's been a part of your life.
What am I? Oh, Tom, I don't know..."</p>

<p>"I won't hear any more of that," muttered Gillette. "There's
more in your little finger than in her whole body. I know who I
want, don't I? By George, I reckon I've got to marry you by force
before you let these queer notions get the best of you."</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear him. There was a set to her chin and a
remote light in her eyes. She had come to a decision. "I'll not
marry you here, Tom. I'm going back with you. I'm going to see
that girl. Call it queer if you want, but I can't disobey my
instincts. I'd&mdash;I'd feel almost unclean..."</p>

<p>"Look here, Lorena..."</p>

<p>"It's settled. Now let's go, Tom."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said; he saw that nothing on
earth would move that stubborn ruling. Lorena Wyatt was no half-
heart; every fibre in her was steel true; she owned a courage and
a will, and now she used them, no matter how it hurt her.
Gillette dropped his head, unable to meet her eyes. She was
whispering something to him that he didn't hear, her arm touched
him and slid away. Then he swung on his heel and went out.</p>

<p>"Let's go," he told Quagmire. And to the preacher he added a
short phrase. "Reckon we won't be needin' your help to-day."</p>

<p>Lorena's effects went into the wagon, she climbed to the seat
beside Tom. He turned the team and wound down-hill through the
trees. Quagmire followed a-saddle leading Gillette's horse. And
the caravan dropped through Deadwood's rutty street and on out
into the swelling land that stretched northeast.</p>

<p>It was a long and tedious trip, the blazing sun pouring out of
the cloudless sky by day and the sharp winds slicing across the
prairie by night. Ahead of them was uncertainty, behind was
nothing but the memory of disaster, of a dead man and of a man
who deserved to die yet still lived. What none of the three knew
was that this man followed them like a stalking beast all across
the leagues of sand; and at night he closed up the interval and
lay on the crest of a swell or in the shelter of an arroyo,
watching their camp fire with his round, unblinking eyes. He
might have come within revolver shot, he might have made his
attempt at Gillette's life in the darkness, but he never so much
as harboured the idea; for San Saba had tried to kill Tom
Gillette on four different occasions by stealth, each time
failing. He was a hard-headed renegade, yet there was in him a
trace of that mysticism known as the gambler's hunch. The hunch
told him he never would master Gillette by that method; therefore
he would try another&mdash;he would wait, and he would face
Gillette, and he would match guns openly. Thus he kept to the
shadows, and at day waited until the wagon had dropped out of
sight before taking up the pursuit.</p>

<p>Ordinarily San Saba was a cautious man; he loved to look upon
the world from a place of shelter, to be slightly withdrawn from
the light. He had infinite patience, and up to this point in his
life he had never let his hatred obscure the cold reason dwelling
in his little nutshell head. Sometimes the scales tipped against
him, and rather than even the score he had turned and ridden away
to other places. With him it was usually a matter of fresher and
farther pastures. The very fact that he disobeyed this life-long
habit now augured powerful and upsetting change. San Saba had
arrived at the point in his checkered career where personal
satisfaction outweighed every other consideration. He hated
Gillette as he had never hated another man; it was a matter of
pride, of instinct, and of a dozen other unfathomable reasons.
Whichever way the man turned he saw Gillette standing before him,
seeming to mock and threaten him out of those deeply set eyes.
Gillette was a challenge. He would never rest until he settled
the affair. So the poison spread through San Saba's thin,
malarial body and constricted his temper until the red signals
spread around his lids, like a cobra raising its hood.</p>

<p>The little party climbed at last the slope beyond which lay
the Circle G ranch houses. Quagmire spurred ahead. When Tom
Gillette drew the horses in and wrapped the reins around the
brake handle, the crew was mustered before him. The eviction
notice still clung to the house wall; nothing had been touched,
no other move had as yet been made. Quagmire announced it with a
tight satisfaction. Gillette studied the horizon a moment, and
Lorena saw the muscles snapping up along his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Then we'll push right on to Nelson and battle this through,"
he decided. His eyes wandered toward the closed house door; he
stared at Quagmire. "Is that all the news?"</p>

<p>Quagmire squinted up to the heavens. "Yeah," he mumbled.</p>

<p>Gillette got down and came around to give Lorena a hand.
"You're sure you've got to go on with this?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and of a sudden her attention rose above
him. The house door had opened. Christine Ballard stood there, a
splendid picture in the sunlight, as self-contained and enigmatic
as he had ever seen her. She was smiling at him, waiting for him
to come up; and the familiar cadence of her voice reached
him.</p>

<p>"Welcome home. Tom. We have kept the fort."</p>

<p>Lorena dropped to the ground, going directly toward the other
girl. Half across the interval she looked around, and it seemed
to Tom Gillette he saw a touch of fear in those sombre gray eyes.
She nodded and went on. There was a murmur between the women;
Christine Ballard threw back her head, then the two of them
passed inside and the door was closed. Gillette swept the circle
with an irritable glance. "Snake out a couple fresh horses.
Hustle it&mdash;hustle it. Quagmire, you're riding to Nelson with
me."</p>

<p>And five minutes later he and the puncher were heading away on
the last leg of their journey. Quagmire raised a skinny arm to
the sky. "Ask no favours o' this world an' yo' won't never be
disappointed."</p>

<p>"Quagmire, she won't get away from me again."</p>

<p>"Women has got ten times the cold nerve of a man," reflected
Quagmire. And he shook his head. "If that girl figgers to go
through with a thing, yo' better save yore breath."</p>

<p><br>Senator William Costaine had a nickname that sometimes was
spoken around the corridors and committee rooms of the Capitol.
It was bestowed humourously, yet as in most nicknames it
contained a measure of significance. They called him the "wrath
of God," and many a man who had felt the force of his outthrust
jaw, his rapierlike questioning, as well as the devastating
sarcasm of his speeches, went away from that ordeal with the firm
conviction that the term was nothing less than appropriate. When
the Senator got on the trail of corruption he seemed to generate
volcanic fumes, he had all the overwhelming energy of a steam
roller.</p>

<p>In this humour he struck Nelson a full week before Gillette
returned; and within one hour of his arrival his room at the
hotel became a chamber of inquisition. He summoned a notary and
installed the man beside him and then in turn he sent out a
series of brief invitations&mdash;to ranchers and surveyors, to
the United States Marshal and allied officials, to Grist and to
the land-office agent. The Senator asked questions, he listened
to statements, and he asked more questions while the heavy boots
tramped up the stairway and the room grew clouded with smoke. The
depositions thickened to a respectable pile on the notary's table
and into the Senator's frigid eyes there came a gleam that anyone
back in Washington instantly would have recognized. It was the
light of battle, the flickering of an ironic pleasure; the
Senator was establishing a case, and presently there would be men
scurrying for shelter while the halls of Congress heard his husky
lawyer's voice piling up evidence and laying the mark of Judas
across the names of certain gentlemen he long had suspected.
Costaine was no pettifogger, nor did he ever raise the cry of
"turn the rascals out" just to hear himself talk. When he had no
evidence he kept silent and went on with his interminable
digging. Therein lay his authority and his manifest power.</p>

<p>Presently the room was cleared. He lighted himself another
cigar and tilted back his chair, nodding at the secretary.</p>

<p>"Nicholas, we've got Invering scorched. He'll wear no more
purple, and he'll run for his hole like a scared rabbit. I detest
and I suspect a man who continually and publicly wraps the flag
around him and bares his breast to the arrows of iniquity. Oh,
yes, Ignacius is scorched. The gentleman's dream of royal robes
is sadly blasted. Nicholas, we leave for Washington by the next
train. Arrange it." And presently, after shuffling through his
depositions he raised his iron-gray head. "That fellow Grist
didn't come, did he? Nor the land agent. Well, we'll pay 'em a
visit. Come on."</p>

<p>Down to the land office he went. The agent knew very well who
Costaine was, but he affected ignorance, only asking "What can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>The Senator laid his card on the counter. "I want to see the
records of this office, sir. Want to see 'em all."</p>

<p>"Not open for inspection," said the agent, inclined to be
surly.</p>

<p>Costaine bent over the counter, frigidly polite. "Oh, yes,
they are. Don't tell me what the regulations are. And you had
better drop that public-be-condemned manner, sir. I want to see
every dot and comma in this office."</p>

<p>"You can't come out here and tell me what to do!" snapped the
agent. "I take my orders from the department! You senators think
you run the government, but you don't run the land office. My
books are all in order, and I'll open 'em to the proper
authorities."</p>

<p>"So," mused the Senator. "Either I see those books or your
head will be chopped off in the next forty-eight hours. And
moreover, you will find yourself answering certain distinct
charges. Nicholas, find me a chair in this rattletrap of an
office."</p>

<p>The land agent capitulated. The Senator put on his steel
spectacles and started down the pages in a kind of flat-footed
patience; all of his life he had done just exactly this sort of
thing, and there was no man in America more experienced in
smelling out discrepancies. Better than two hours later he left
the office, turned back to the hotel, and from thence went to the
station and got aboard the train. But Costaine was no hand for
delay, and a long telegram preceded him to Washington.</p>

<p>"It will be interesting to discover," he confided to the
everpresent Nicholas, "by what extraordinary circumlocution those
fine gentlemen got around the plain intent of the law."</p>

<p>In the course of the Senator's investigation he had failed to
interview one man. Christopher Grist was in town all during the
day; he had been told that Costaine wanted to see him, and later,
from his office, he saw the Senator pass along the street to the
land agent's. But Grist avoided a meeting: as quietly as possible
he left the back door of his office and as quietly disappeared,
not to appear again until night. But when he did return he found
the land-office man waiting for him uneasy and uncertain.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;did you meet the Senator?"</p>

<p>Grist smiled. "I made it a point not to, my dear fellow. I'm
doing no explaining. Let the bosses stand inspection."</p>

<p>"I know his reputation, the dam' muckraker," growled the
agent. "It's his kind that cause all the trouble in America.
Well, he looked at my records, but he never found anything.
They've got nothing to pin on me, Grist! I'll face 'em!"</p>

<p>"That's right," assented Grist cheerfully.</p>

<p>The agent pointed angrily at him. "It's your cursed outfit
that's got me in trouble! You've got to take some of the blame,
I'll not be the goat."</p>

<p>"Thought you said there was nothing to pin on you," replied
Grist.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't be a fool. That man means to manufacture
trouble."</p>

<p>Grist touched a match to his cigar. "Let me tell you
something, old fellow. The Senator doesn't need to manufacture
anything. If he looks he will find&mdash;and from the bird's-eye
view I had of the gentleman I'd judge he was one hell of a good
bloodhound."</p>

<p>"That's a fine way for you to talk," grumbled the agent.</p>

<p>"It's not my land, not my cattle. I'm only working for folks.
If you want to know the truth about it, I've acquired an
extraordinary detached point of view about the P.R.N. in the last
few hours. What that outfit can't stand is daylight. Public
attention will kill 'em quick as a shot. And I forecast much
attention in the next few weeks. Watch out for it. Those fellows
are the world's best evaders of responsibility. That's why I've
got a detached point of view&mdash;and stand quite ready to
detach myself from their employ."</p>

<p>"Say, you don't figure they'd be so low as to try to hook us
small fry, do you?" the agent demanded, more and more
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Don't you doubt it. A rich man's hide is no thicker than a
poor man's. What on earth's the matter with your face? Got yellow
jaundice?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm clear, anyhow," muttered the agent, ducking out of
the office.</p>

<p>"The poor fool," murmured Grist. He smoked alone in the
darkness, turning over all his own transactions, examining his
career with the P.R.N. for flaws. As far as he could reason the
thing out they could pin nothing on his name. He obeyed orders,
he didn't give them. If those orders happened to be ill-founded
in law, what fault was that of his? He wasn't a lawyer. Of
course, he had used his power criminally more than once&mdash;as
in the effort to rustle Gillette's cattle. But there was no proof
of this, and his own crew wouldn't ever testify against him.</p>

<p>"I happen to have all their instructions to me neatly filed
for reference. And yet those instructions, when you come right
down to it, are as innocent as a new-born cat. Ha&mdash;it would
appear I was in the hole, after all. They'd be just the gentlemen
to say I horribly violated their orders to be legal. Now who's
foolish?"</p>

<p>He stirred in the chair and threw away his cigar. "I'd be wise
if I drifted now. Still, it might blow over. Anyhow, the Senator
isn't in Washington yet and won't be for a few days. So, why not
wait? I'd hate to duck out of a good job and then find out
nothing happened. We'll hang on a week."</p>

<p>Grist, however, was a little short on his time calculation. He
overlooked the telegraph wires, and Senator Costaine kept those
wires busy all along the route to the capital city. The effect of
those messages was to throw a certain clique into high alarm, and
forty-eight hours after his departure from Nelson the
repercussion of that alarm returned to Nelson and struck both
Grist and the land-office agent almost at the same moment. Grist
received the following short query:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN VIOLATION OF
INSTRUCTIONS?</p>

<p><br>
Grist pondered over this a full day before sending back his
answer, which was almost equally terse though a great deal more
flippant.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">HAVE WASHED SOME DIRTY SHIRTS, AS PER
INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p><br>
The land agent came down to Grist's office in very much of a
hurry. He looked older, and there was a furtive expression on his
face. "I told you&mdash;I told you! Now the department is on my
heels. There's an inspector coming out here. My God, this is what
a man gets for trying to pay his debts! Look at me!"</p>

<p>"I see you distinctly. What are you worrying about? You're on
solid ground. No proof of a forgery or anything like that, is
there? Stand fast and get hold of yourself. This battle isn't
lost yet."</p>

<p>"All right for you to say," muttered the agent. "You don't
know what kind of a mess I'm in." He turned about the office two
or three times before going out. On the threshold he threw a last
word back. "I'm taking a little ride to clear my head."</p>

<p>Grist saw him go to the stable and presently come out with a
horse and rig. The tail of the rig was filled with luggage; and
as the man dipped beyond the street end and struck across the
tracks into the open prairie Grist nodded. "That's the last of
him. Well, he's wise. I should be doing it right this minute. But
we'll wait and see what the next mail brings forth."</p>

<p>He rode back to the P.R.N. home ranch and stayed two days, in
the course of which he let off no less than ten of his punchers,
among these being the man who had filed on the Gillette water
right. His instructions to them were pointed. "This country's
getting pretty hot. It's a rotten climate. Were I you I believe
I'd travel west until I found the exact spot where the sun went
into a hole." With that done he returned to Nelson and found a
pair of telegrams waiting for him. He read them in the order of
their date.</p>

<p>"In other words they're putting themselves on record as
disavowing me," mused Grist. "They've tucked tails, the fat
yellow scoundrels. Overboard goes the furniture to save a leaky
boat. It won't do. They'll lose the beef contract, and they'll
lose every inch of land they've had me steal. I'm through."</p>

<p>He saw the handwriting on the wall. Methodically he set about
bringing up his account, and during the ensuing four days he
brought together all the odds and ends of company business, even
leaving a list of instructions for his unknown successor. And
then, with all that behind him, he closed down the desk top,
locked the office door, and crossed to the hotel. He was
through.</p>

<p>"Just so. All it took to knock over an empire was one little
puff of air and a single beam of daylight. Grist, my boy, let
that be a lesson in high morality for you. There's always one
honest man among a hundred fools. Now we shall eat the feast of
Nero, salute this town, and depart. One more day and I'm apt to
find myself in the lock-up. They're desperate for a victim."</p>

<p>He gave the office key to the hotel man with instructions to
transfer it when his successor came; he started for the dining
room, hungry and moved to a kind of flippant amusement. Half in
his chair he heard the hotel man say:</p>

<p>"That's Tom Gillette ridin' in, ain't it? Sure. Somebody told
me he went to Deadwood. Well, he'll be on somebody's trail."</p>

<p>A startled expression skittered over Grist's face. He did not
touch the chair's bottom; pivoting he went out the back door and
on down the back alley.</p>

<p><br>Gillette's first visit, once in Nelson, was to the United
States Marshal. "Well, you invited me to come get a warrant,
Hannery. Here I am."</p>

<p>The marshal tilted back his chair. "I wasn't in any hurry
about that, Gillette. Why in thunder are you?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want it hanging over me," said Gillette
soberly. "That's some of friend Grist's work, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"That's right. So is the eviction proceedings, if you want the
opinion of a private citizen."</p>

<p>"All right, serve your warrant. If there's twelve men in
Dakota who'll convict me on that charge then they're a new brand
of settlers to me. I'll go that one better&mdash;if there's six
men, outside of the P.R.N. crew, who'll convict me I'll pay for
my own funeral."</p>

<p>"I know that as well as you do," drawled Hannery. "Don't you
figure I'm familiar with public opinion in this district? Hell,
it's so flat a case the U. S. Attorney won't clutter up his
docket with it. He told me so."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want it hanging over," said Gillette. "Let's
clear the matter up. Let's go through with it."</p>

<p>Hannery shook his head. He was a florid man, and he owned a
rough sense of humour that now and then snapped to his eyes. It
appeared now. "Reckon I've got to disappoint you, Gillette. Fact
is, I filed that warrant somewhere and I've lost it. All my
papers get throwed around so dog-gone carelessly. If you want to
be served you'll have to wait till I find it. Meanwhile you go
about your business. My opinion is it got into the waste basket
by mistake. Come to think of it, I'm almost sure somebody cleared
my desk the other day."</p>

<p>Gillette rolled a cigarette, frowning over the operation.
Presently he looked up. "Hannery, you're a white man."</p>

<p>"The country used to be nothing but white men," was the
marshal's gruff answer.</p>

<p>"Grist'll bring it up again, though."</p>

<p>"Like hell he will. Haven't you heard any of the news? Grist
resigned his job three days ago. He's still around town, but he's
got nothing to do with the P.R.N. any more. What are you worrying
about?"</p>

<p>"A fact?" murmured Gillette, plainly surprised. "What jarred
him loose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know for sure. But Senator Billy Costaine stormed
into town some ten days back and took enough depositions to fill
a wagon. Right after that the land-office fellow skipped. Next,
Grist filled in his ticket. You can guess for yourself."</p>

<p>He leaned forward, a stubby finger tapping the table.
"Speakin' privately, that Eastern bunch was ridin' awful high,
and they stood to make a million out of this land-grabbin' deal.
They'd of made it, too. Nobody around here could shout loud
enough to make Washington hear anything. Most of us didn't know
enough to register a kick, and some of us knew but weren't in any
position to make any very big noise. How Costaine came into the
wind I don't know. But he did, and when that fellow gets on the
trail something drops. I'm bettin' you solid silver against a
hackamore there won't be any P.R.N. Land Company in these parts
when the year rolls around."</p>

<p>"That's why I didn't see any cattle south of the river,
then?"</p>

<p>"Grist told me he was ordered to draw everything back from
that side and quit bothering with it."</p>

<p>Gillette got up and tilted his hat. He was smiling. "Any time
you want to evict me, Hannery, just go ahead. I'm going to move
anyhow. To-morrow morning I'll be squatting where Wyatt used to
be. I'd like to see anybody take that from me."</p>

<p>"I was going to drop that bug down your collar myself,"
replied Hannery. "P.R.N. can't hold it&mdash;they won't dare to
go through with the schedule. And nobody else's got wind of the
situation. You bet it's going to be a white man's country yet.
Say, you look kind of peaked. Deadwood trouble you some?"</p>

<p>"I went after a party and he saw me first," was Gillette's
sombre answer.</p>

<p>Hannery's eyes swept down Gillette's loose frame. "You don't
carry that gun low enough by two inches."</p>

<p>"I'm no killer, Hannery. I've had enough to last me. All I
want is to be let alone. Well, thanks."</p>

<p>He walked out and joined Quagmire who crouched in a patch of
shade. The sun went westering, and at the moment Nelson was
aflame under its slanting beams. The tide of life ran along the
street in a sluggish trickle; down at the station a train stood
ready to pull eastward, smoke pouring out of the engine's funnel
stack. A bell clanged resonantly and Quagmire stirred, rubbing
his knee joints with a slow, uneasy motion.</p>

<p>"Come on, Quagmire, let's get something to eat. It's a long
ride home."</p>

<p>"Ain't hungry," murmured the puncher. "I don't feel right. I
don't fer a fact. They's somethin' wrong. You go ahead."</p>

<p>Gillette went on and into the hotel dining room. Only a matter
of habit put him there&mdash;habit and the need for something to
occupy his mind. He was tired, supremely tired, and his muscles
served him none too well. The long trip from Deadwood had been a
pretty hard strain, even though he rode the wagon seat. It seemed
to him that he was growing old; here a month was gone since the
night San Saba and Hazel's gang had ambushed him, and still he
was weak. Where was his vitality? There was no snap to him, no
resiliency, and he observed with a detached and critical
disapproval that even for so simple an operation as reaching for
the salt shaker it took a distinct order from his brain and a
conscious pull of will to extend and withdraw his arm. He was
dull, dead on his feet.</p>

<p>"Wherever she goes," he told himself, "I'll follow. Clear to
the jump-off."</p>

<p>It seemed mighty queer to him he didn't feel elated at the
sudden change in his affairs. As far as his range and his water
right were concerned there wasn't even a struggle to be made.
Lorena was to be thanked for that. Lorena! Her name echoed like a
pleasant melody in his head. He remembered when he saw her
spurring over the swelling land, a pert and boyish figure mounted
on a horse she called Mister Jefferson Davis. And she had swept
around him like an Indian to reach out of her saddle for a
prairie blossom. He had never forgotten the picture she made with
that crimson flower stuck in her black hair and her white teeth
set into her lower lip.</p>

<p>Well, water had flowed under the bridge since. That sturdy
slip of a girl on the vague border of girlhood had risen to be a
woman.</p>

<p>"By Godfrey this man's world has bruised her! And after all
that does she think I'll let her go? It's got to be the other
way!"</p>

<p>Nothing mattered with a man. He was supposed to stand up and
be licked and stand up again. Else he wasn't a man. No crying for
the breaks of luck. But it did matter with a woman&mdash;and
Lorena, at the very worst of it, still had smiled at him out of
her dark eyes while she kept telling him nothing could hurt her.
He never observed that his fists were clenched about his plate,
nor that the food on it grew cold. Somebody was beside him,
muttering. He looked up to find Quagmire.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;well, Judas, what's happened to you, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Say, I haven't ever horned in on yore business now, have I?"
demanded Quagmire. "No, you bet not. Only yo' got a chore to do
yet, an' I figgered mebbe you'd ease yo'se'f an' lemme take care
of it while yo' et. That all right?"</p>

<p>"What chore?"</p>

<p>"Jus' a fragment of unfinished business," said Quagmire
evasively. "That's all right, ain't it? Yeh. See yo' later,
then."</p>

<p>"No, come back here. Come back here, you confounded fool! I'm
not delegating anything I don't know about. Spread it."</p>

<p>Quagmire swung around, his pale eyes squinting. There was a
hot personal anger in them&mdash;Quagmire was roused against his
own boss. "Listen, Gillette, if yo' don't know enough to come in
outen the rain I'll take my spurs and go!"</p>

<p>"You've got that privilege any day," snapped Gillette, and
thereupon cursed himself for the tag-end collection of nerves he
had become. "Oh, swallow it. What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Quagmire moved his arm sheepishly. "If yo' got to
know&mdash;San Saba's in town. He's down by the stable, standin'
in the middle o' the street."</p>

<p>"Then I reckon he wants to see me." Tom got up from the table,
laid down his half dollar, and walked through the lobby. At the
door he stopped and turned again to Quagmire. "Old-timer, let
that last remark wash down the creek."</p>

<p>"It goes twice," muttered Quagmire. "I'm a galoot for tryin'
to butt my mug in another gent's personal affairs."</p>

<p>"Well, here's the end of the train ride," said Tom. There was
something the matter with his ears, for he heard himself as from
a distance; and his arms were heavy.</p>

<p>"I know the gent's habits." Quagmire broke in. "In a pinch he
don't use that belt gun. It's another under his arm yo' got to
watch."</p>

<p>Gillette nodded, not hearing the words. The street was half
shade and half sunlight. Over in the shade he observed men
standing near to the walls and moving not at all. A spotted dog
padded across his vision leaving a trail of dust behind. "I wish
I knew her answer now," murmured Gillette and walked out into the
sunlight. San Saba's lank frame was in the shade, fifty yards
along. There were a great many men against the building walls;
Gillette saw the blur of their faces, and he heard some faint
voice calling his name. And then all this died out of his
attention; he swung and walked to meet the renegade ex-
foreman.</p>

<p>He thought at first the man meant to wait for him; but a
moment later San Saba stepped sidewise into the sun and came
forward. Gillette marked how the man's long legs buckled at each
step and how the dragging spurs fluffed the dust San Saba's arms
swung with his tread, in a short arc, and the palm of his gun
hand seemed to brush holster leather at each passing. He was
marked by hard travel, his clothes were an alkali gray, his
butternut shirt was open at the neck, and Gillette saw the two
front cords of his neck taut against the sunburned skin.</p>

<p>Nothing was said between them; that time had come when there
were no words to carry any meaning either would understand. They
were, the both of them, thrown back on instinct, back to the
stark and ancient promptings. So they closed the interval, and
for all the emotion they displayed they were as men coming up to
shake hands. San Saba's body swayed a little forward of his feet,
and his little nut-round head nodded. Gillette advanced erect,
watching bow the ex-foreman's eyes grew narrower at each pace.
Time dissolved into space and, save for the sound of his own
boots striking, he would never have known himself to be moving.
Somewhere a spectator coughed, the sunlight grew dim, the spotted
dog ran between them. And then all his range of vision was cut
off and he saw only San Saba. San Saba had stopped. His arm rose
slowly away from his belt; a bull whip snapped twice, sounding to
Gillette strangely like guns exploding. The spotted dog raced
back, barking, and men ran out into the street and made a circle
around a San Saba who had disappeared. Gillette stood alone,
wondering. His arm felt unusually heavy, and he looked down to
find a gun swinging from his fist; the taste of powder smoke was
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Yo' got him. Come away an' let Nelson bury its own
carrion."</p>

<p>Quagmire stood at his elbow, face seamed with great wrinkles.
Gillette drew a breath and bolstered his gun. He said something
to Quagmire, whereat the puncher stared queerly. The marshal came
along at an unhurried gait, still smoking; and the marshal threw
out a warning as he walked. "Better lower your belt two inches,
Gillette. It's too high."</p>

<p>Gillette headed for the hotel. The last idea in his head was
that he hadn't finished his meal and that he'd better go back and
drink the coffee even if he wasn't hungry. Directly at that point
the whole significance of the scene broke across his mind. "Then
it wasn't a bull whip after all, but the guns. The man's dead.
Another chore done. I can see the end of the trail."</p>

<p>He was at the hotel door, facing Lorena Wyatt. Where she came
from he didn't know. But she was there, supporting herself
against the wall, eyes aflood with strange mists.</p>

<p>"Settled?" he asked. The memory of the gun play was wiped out;
all else for the moment ceased to matter. He drove directly at
the thing he wanted to know. "Settled? I'll follow, no matter
where you go. It can't be any other way."</p>

<p>"She's gone, Tom. One of the men brought us to town in the
buckboard. I'm going back with you."</p>

<p>His head dropped. "Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never ask me any questions about it. There is the one thing
I'll hide from you. The rest of me is yours."</p>

<p>He took her by the arm, throwing a swift glance at Quagmire.
"Go get a preacher."</p>

<p>A half hour later they were travelling away from Nelson and
back to the ranch, while from a second-story window of the hotel
Christine Ballard watched them fade into the dusk of the prairie;
she was dry-eyed, her training wouldn't let her cry now. But when
the last vague outline of Gillette drooped into the swirling
shadows and was lost it was to her as if the light of the world
had been extinguished. She crouched down, her head resting on the
window ledge. And long after Nelson had sunk to rest she was
still in that same position.</p>

<p><br>Quagmire rode through the night with the silhouette of the
buckboard ahead of him. The stars were scattered in the sky,
shimmering like diamond dust; the wind bore up the cry of a
coyote on some distant ridge. The loneliness of the ages was in
that solitary chant, and Quagmire, hearing it, drooped a little
lower in the saddle, cigarette tip making a criss-cross pattern
in the velvet shadows. "Yestiday I was a kid an' my mammy sung
songs to me soundin' like that. To-morrow I'm dead. It's jes' a
day between sleeps. There's a couple which neither asked nothin'
from the universe an' accidental they busted through the crooked
game for a win&mdash;temporary. Well, somebody's got to win
temporary. A minute to smile and an hour to cry&mdash;then we
sleeps, an' them stars keep on shinin' like that an' some other
ki-ote howls out on the same old ridge. Man is mortal. Go along,
pony. Wish I had as little to think about as yo' did. Yeah, man
is mortal."</p>
