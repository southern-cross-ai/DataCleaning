<h2>EBOOK EDITOR'S NOTES</h2>

<p>This ebook is based on a transcript of <i>William Bradley's
Journal, December 1786 &mdash; May 1792, compiled 1802</i>,
prepared by the State Library of New South Wales</p>

<p>A Project Gutenberg Australia version of the transcript can be
found at <a href=
"http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#bradleyw">Bradley's
listing</a> at Project Gutenberg Australia. The present ebook
builds on that version to provide a more readable book, without
most abbreviations and without archaic spelling. In the journal
many nouns were capitalised, as was common usage at the time. Most are not
capitalised now, as it is <i>not</i> common usage to do so.
Further, minor changes in sentence structure have occasionally
been made to improve readability.</p>

<p>Sun and Moon: Throughout the journal, symbols are often used to
denote the sun and moon, where they are used in taking readings of
latitude and longitude. "Sun" is shown in the journal as a circle with a period at
the centre. "Moon" is shown as a crescent symbol. When used in this
way in the journal, the words are shown in square brackets in this
ebook.</p>

<p>As a matter of interest, Arthur Bowes Smyth, who also travelled to Australia
as part of the First Fleet, noted in his journal, on 23 December 1787, that
"the method of reckoning time at sea is the reverse of what they do on
shore. From 12 o'clock at noon of one day to 12 at noon the next is
a day, whereas on shore they reckon from midnight to midnight."
This accounts for the fact that, on many occasions, Bradley records the <i>pm</i> details of the day, before the <i>am</i> details.

<p>The many inconsistencies in the presentation of readings of
latitude and longitude have been altered to provide a standardised
format which can be used in Google maps. For example, <i>22º54'S,
43º19'W</i> finds Rio de Janeiro if pasted into the "Search Google Maps" box. Note, however, that seconds of degrees (") do not seem to be
supported by Google Maps. Nor are the words "latitude" and "longitude"
or abbreviations thereof accepted in the "Search Google Maps" box.
When used, no result is returned.</p>

<p>Bradley was inconsistent in his presentation of daily dates.
His text has been retained, however <i>date headers</i> have
been added in this ebook, to allows the reader to see at a glance
the date of each entry as indicated by Bradley.</p>

<p>I have set out to produce a readable version of the journal and
trust that you will enjoy it. If you want a verbatim transcript, or

<h2>Images from the Journal</h2>

<p>These watercolours are bound or hinged into William Bradley's
Journal, 'A Voyage to New South Wales, 1786-1792,' at the page
indicated above the image. They were probably painted some years
after the events depicted as the entire journal seems to be a fair
copy made ca. 1802.*</p>

<p>According to previous advertisements, tenders were received for
transports to carry convicts to Botany Bay on the coast of New
South Wales and taken up the 12th of September 1786 in five vessels
measuring about 300 tons more than advertised for.</p>

<p>The <i>Berwick</i> store ship about that time was taken into
dock at Deptford, it being intended that she should be fitted as a
man of war for this expedition.</p>

<p>The <i>Grantham</i> packet was purchased into the service to be
employed as a tender, but on examination was found very rotten and
totally unfit for the voyage, in consequence of which, the
<i>Supply</i> navy transport was ordered to Deptford and fitted in
lieu of the <i>Grantham</i>.</p>

<p>Three ships measuring 990 tons were also taken up as store ships
and stowed under the direction of Captain Tier, agent for
transports in the river.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 October 1786</p>

<p>The 25th of October. The <i>Berwick</i> store ship was
commissioned and named the <i>Sirius</i>. Captain Phillip, the
intended Governor of the</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 2]</p>

<p>new colony, was appointed to the command of her. The
<i>Supply</i> was also commissioned and the command of her given to
Lieutenant H. L. Ball.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 October 1786</p>

<p>The 28th. The <i>Sirius</i>, having a few hands, began rigging
etc., from which to the 8th of December we were employed getting
ready for sea, which was much retarded by bad weather and
unavoidable delays in being furnished with some part of the stores.
The provisions with which we were supplied were of the best
quality. Wheat, sugar, essence of malt, mustard seed and other
articles usually supplied in long voyages, we were also furnished
with, and an unlimited order for officers stores.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 December 1786</p>

<p>Tuesday, December 5. Captain Hunter came on board and, on the
same day, the officers had directions from Captain Phillip to
receive his orders for carrying on the duty.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 December 1786</p>

<p>The 9th we sailed down the river and moored the same afternoon
in Long Reach, just off Purfleet. We received our guns, powder etc.
here and were ready with a pilot on board, the 15th, to proceed at
the shortest notice.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 December 1786</p>

<p>The 15th. Two of the transports passed us bound to the port
where their proportion of convicts were to be embarked. The three
store ships also passed, bound to the Motherbank*, the place of
rendezvous.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Motherbank: A shallow sandbar off the
north-east coast of the Isle of Wight in England. It lies in the
Solent between Cowes and Ryde. (<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherbank">Wikipedia</a>)]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 December 1786</p>

<p>The 21st. Another of the transports passed. There now remained
only two at Gallions (<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady Penryhn</i>*)
both of which were to take in their proportion of convicts from the
hulk at Woolwich and from Newgate and the <i>Sirius</i> detained at
Long Reach to escort them.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bradley's spelling is <i>Lady
Penrhyne</i>.]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 3]</p>

<p>Some alterations were found necessary to be made to the
securities already fitted in those ships, from the representation
of the officer commanding the party of marines on board the
<i>Alexander</i>. It was also judged necessary to make some
alterations in the handcuffs.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 December 1786</p>

<p>On the 27th, these ships were again reported ready but were
detained, as no orders had been yet given to discharge any convicts
from the hulks to these transports.</p>

<p>The Board of longitude furnished the following instruments for
the use of the voyage and new colony:</p>

<ul>
<li>An astronomical quadrant of one foot radius.</li>

<li>A 3½ feet treble object glass achromatic telescope by Dolland,
with a wire micrometer for measuring difference of right ascension
and declination.</li>

<li>Also a micrometer with oblique wires and a quadrant fixed to it
with a moveable short telescope to take the distance of any object
(nearly) from bright fixed stars.</li>

<li>A night glass.</li>

<li>An astronomical clock.</li>

<li>A journeyman clock.</li>

<li>An alarm clock.</li>

<li>An old sextant by Ramsden</li>

<li>A portable barometer and two thermometers</li>
</ul>

<p>These instruments Captain Phillip gave a receipt for, promising
to return them to the board (the dangers of the sea and other
unavoidable accident excepted) at his return, or a receipt from
such officer as may supersede him in the command. Lieutenant Dawes
of the marines, a volunteer for the Botany Bay Detachment, having
been introduced to Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, was
acknowledged a proper person to make such observations on shore as
might be judged of use.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 4]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 December 1786</p>

<p>The 24th. The <i>Supply</i> anchored in Long Reach.</p>

<p>By order of the King in Council, the admiralty were to appoint a
second captain to the <i>Sirius</i>, with the rank of post captain
and pay of a sixth rate with four servants, with full power to
command her in absence of the principal captain, but nevertheless
subject to his control and orders. In consequence of this, Captain
John Hunter was appointed second captain of the <i>Sirius</i>,
bearing date 15th December.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jan87" id="jan87"></a>January
1787</p>

<p>In the beginning of January, a ship of 350 tons was taken up,
the first tonnage being found very insufficient.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 January 1787</p>

<p>January 4th. Orders were received at Woolwich for the convicts
to be embarked on board the <i>Alexander</i> but some of them,
being in a deplorable situation from disease, could not be
received. A part of the women convicts were put on board the
<i>Lady Penrhyn</i>. These ships were still detained, not having
their full proportion of convicts on board.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 January 1787</p>

<p>13th. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for the Nore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 January 1787</p>

<p>The 18th. We received orders to proceed to Portsmouth with the
<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> as soon as they joined us.
These orders were pleasing to us, and particularly so, as the
situation of the <i>Sirius</i> with respect to her being kept in
constant readiness for sea, while lying off Purfleet, was rendered
very precarious being subject, in light winds and calm thick
weather (which we had much of), to have vessels driving on board us
every tide.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 5]</p>

<p>We had several foul of us, one of which carried away the
spritsail yard, which was the only damage we received from them.
The <i>Supply</i> had her bowsprit carried away by a large ship
falling on board her and which was the cause of her being ordered
to the Nore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 January 1787</p>

<p>The 19th. It was discovered that some of the convicts on board
the <i>Alexander</i> had got their handcuffs off. What they could
promise themselves from such an attempt appears strange, as it
would have been impossible for any of them to have effected their
escape, with the guard and precautions used on board that ship, had
they all been loose in the place of their confinement. They were
handcuffed two together, or had chains on. Those that were
handcuffed were never separated, but obliged to move together upon
all occasions.</p>

<p>Between decks, in which these people were confined, was guarded
by a strong bulk head abaft ,with loop holes and filled with nails,
marine sentinels at the hatchway where a ladder was put down
occasionally and, when down, particularly attended by those
sentinels. A guard boat also was constantly attending those ships
after sunset while at Gallions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 January 1787</p>

<p>The 21st. An officer was sent from the <i>Sirius</i> to the
<i>Alexander</i>, (whose mast heads we could see over the land), to
order a signal by which we might be informed when the remainder of
the convicts were embarking and also a signal to let us know when
the <i>Alexander</i> was going to get under weigh. The intention of
these signals was that the <i>Sirius</i> might be unmoored, ready
to join them as they came down.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 6]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 January 1787</p>

<p>25th. Orders were received to proceed to Portsmouth with the
<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, without waiting for them
to complete their number of convicts. The wind setting in at east
prevented those ships from joining us immediately, as ordered. The
<i>Lady Penrhyn</i> joined us the 28th and went on to Gravesend,
having occasion to stop there.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 January 1787</p>

<p>The 29th. The <i>Alexander</i> passed us and proceeded to
Gravesend where they had likewise occasion to stop.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 January 1787</p>

<p>Tuesday, 30th. We sailed from Long Reach and passed the
<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>. They, not being ready,
were ordered to follow us to the Nore as soon as possible. In the
afternoon we moored at the Nore in twelve fathoms water. Nore light
NW by W, Minster Church SW. Here the <i>Supply</i> joined us from
the Little Nore.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="feb87" id="feb87"></a>February
1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 February 1787</p>

<p>February 1st. The transports joined us. The complement of women
convicts had been completed (104) while at Gravesend.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 February 1787</p>

<p>2nd. The weather was so very unsettled and thick that we could
not move until 11am when it, clearing away with a breeze at WSW,
sailed immediately, the <i>Supply</i> armed tender,
<i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> transports in Company. It
soon falling calm, we anchored between the east buoy of the Oaze
and west buoy of the Mouse, at the entrance of the Nubb Channel, in
9 fathoms water.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 February 1787</p>

<p>The 3rd at 7am weighed and made sail with the wind at SW and ran
through the Queen's Channel, as soon as the tide flowed
sufficiently.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 7]</p>

<p>It blowing very strong and it being impossible to get into the
Downes before night, we anchored in Margate Road.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 February 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 4th. At 5am weighed and made sail. At 11 anchored in the
Downes. The wind setting in at SW, moored the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 February 1787</p>

<p>The 5th. The wind at SE, made the signal and unmoored. The
<i>Lady Penrhyn</i> got under sail and, passing near us, asked
permission to go out and bring too off the foreland, which was
granted on account of her heavy sailing. At 11am we weighed with
the <i>Supply</i> and <i>Alexander</i> but the wind coming to the
southward and the flood tide made, we were obliged to anchor again
in the Downes. The <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> did not return on our coming
to an anchor, although near enough to see the signal plainly.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 February 1787</p>

<p>The 6th. The wind being fixed at SW and the weather having a bad
appearance, moored the ship and made every preparation to ride out
a gale of wind which came, as expected, and blew very strong all
the 7th.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 February 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 11th. It again blew a gale of wind at SSW. The best
bower* anchor came home; the ship did not bring up until both
anchors were ahead. We had a cable and half on the best bower at
the time, which gave us reason to suppose that our anchors were not
sufficient for the ship or she would not have started with such a
scope of cable when most of the merchant ships held fast.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bower anchors: each of two anchors carried
at a ship's bow, formerly distinguished as the <i>best bower</i>
(starboard) and <i>small bower</i> (port).]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 February 1787</p>

<p>Tuesday, 13th. The gale abated and the wind came to WNW. Hove up
the small bower and got everything ready to proceed, whenever the
wind should favour us.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 February 1787</p>

<p>The 15th. The wind backed to the SW and by noon blew a hard gale
of wind.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 8]</p>

<p>From that quarter we were again under the necessity of giving
the ship a large scope of cable and striking everything close down.
Several ships drove this day, and the <i>Houghton</i> East Indiaman
very near us, which obliged us to veer away 2 cables and let go the
small bower to check the ship from falling on board her on the
weather side. The <i>Houghton</i> took the first opportunity of the
tide, making strong to windward to heave both her anchors up and
give us a clear birth.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 February 1787</p>

<p>Saturday, 17th. Moderate weather at daylight. Unmoored and got
everything ready for sailing, the moment the wind should favour
us.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 February 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 18th. Wind at NW, moderate breeze. Weighed and made sail
but, the wind coming to WSW, anchored again.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 February 1787</p>

<p>19th. Moderate breeze at NW. At 4am weighed and stood out of the
Downes. H.M.* armed tender <i>Supply</i> and <i>Alexander</i>
transport in company. At 11, the tide being done and falling calm,
anchored off Dungeness. The lighthouse W½S 3 or 4 miles. By the
mean of 23 good observations taken in the Downes, I make the
latitude of the southern foreland 51º12'N.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* H.M. His/Her Majesty's.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 February 1787</p>

<p>20th. At 3pm the tides making to the weatherward, weighed with a
light breeze at NW, which increased and veered to the northward as
the evening came on. At 6, passed Dungeness and at daylight saw
Beachy Head, NE by N 6 miles. At noon, latitude by observation,
50º32½', Beachy Head NE, 4 leagues.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 February 1787</p>

<p>21st pm. Wind variable with thick weather. AM at 9 saw the Isle
of Wight. The weather cleared up with a moderate breeze at NE.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 February 1787</p>

<p>Thursday, 22nd. At 2pm anchored at the Motherbank and moored
immediately. Found the <i>Scarborough</i> and <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>
transports and the 3 store ships lying here.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 February 1787</p>

<p>Friday, 23rd. The <i>Prince of Wales</i> transport arrived.</p>

<p>While we lay in the Downes we found it necessary that some
alteration should be made in the hawse pieces* as the cables had
formerly worked on the spar deck with the windlass and now on the
gun deck with a messenger. The shipwrights came on board to make
those necessary alterations.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Hawse pieces: In a wooden ship, the timbers

<p class="date-jnl">24 February 1787</p>

<p>The 24th. A party of marines embarked on board, as did those
belonging to the <i>Supply</i>, and that part of the detachment for
the <i>Scarborough</i> transport.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="mar87" id="mar87"></a>March 1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 March 1787</p>

<p>Friday, March 2nd. 210 convicts arrived at Portsmouth in waggons
under a guard of Light Horse, but it blowing a gale of wind at SW
they could not be taken off to the transports. They were carried on
board the <i>Gorgon</i> lying in Blockhouse Hole, under charge of
the guard ships boats. Sunday morning it became moderate. They were
taken to the Motherbank in sailing lighters belonging to the dock
yard and put on board the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Scarborough</i>
transports.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 March 1787</p>

<p>The 8th. We received 3 anchors in lieu of the bowers and spare
anchor, which we had before found very insufficient to ride the
ship in a gale of wind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 March 1787</p>

<p>The 9th. camp equipage* for 660 tents were received and
distributed to the different ships.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Camp equipage: Equipment required to set up

<p class="date-jnl">15 March 1787</p>

<p>The 15th. the <i>Friendship</i> transport arrived from Plymouth
and the <i>Charlotte</i> the next day, both which had taken their
proportion of men and women convicts at Plymouth.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 10]</p>

<p>The greater part of the convicts on board the <i>Alexander</i>
having been embarked near 8 months and being rather sickly, it was
judged necessary that she should be smoked and whitewashed. For
this purpose two decked lighters were furnished from the dock yard
to receive such of the convicts as it was necessary to remove while
it was doing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 March 1787</p>

<p>The 23rd. The <i>Essex</i> hulk was ordered to be fitted to
receive those convicts, but the <i>Alexander</i>, being well
cleaned, whitewashed, smoked and sponged with oil of tar, and the
sick recovering fast, it was not judged necessary to use a hulk or
even to keep both lighters, one of which was returned and the other
kept for the their being whitewashed, which number was so trifling
that this lighter was also returned as soon as most of the
<i>Alexander's</i> sick had recovered.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 March 1787</p>

<p>The 24th. Our Complement of seamen was filled up with volunteers
from the guard ships.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="apr87" id="apr87"></a>April 1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 April 1787</p>

<p>April 7. Lord Hood hoisted his Flag on board the <i>Triumph</i>
in Portsmouth harbour. Saluted ditto with 13 guns. About this time
we were supplied with two cwt* of portable soup in addition to the
proportion allowed the ship (50 lb), which altogether was but a
small allowance for such a voyage, but small as it was, even that
was not allowed by the Sick and Hurt Board until an order for that
purpose was obtained from the Admiralty. Fresh beef was supplied
for the convicts and wine allowed for such of the sick as the
surgeon might judge necessary.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Cwt = Hundredweight. One English cwt. weighs
112 lbs. (pounds).]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 11]</p>

<p>An additional proportion of vinegar was allowed to all the ships
and a quantity of oil of tar.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may87" id="may87"></a>May 1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 May 1787</p>

<p>May 3rd. Two men convicts and 36 women, with 2 children, arrived
at Portsmouth and were immediately embarked.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 May 1787</p>

<p>May 7th. Captain Phillip arrived at Portsmouth. He brought with
him a timekeeper made by Mr. Kendal and a sextant, both furnished
by the Board of Longitude for the use of the voyage. The timekeeper
was sent by an officer to the Royal Academy at Portsmouth, and left
in charge of Mr. Bayley the head master.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 May 1787</p>

<p>The 10th. We were paid 2 months advance and the signal made to
prepare for sailing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 May 1787</p>

<p>The 11th. Waiting only for a wind to carry the ships to sea, an
officer was sent to bring on board the timekeeper, the rate of its
going determined by Mr. Bayley. The 3 days which he had it, it lost
1",38' per day.</p>

<p>The precautions necessary to prevent the timekeeper from being
let down were ordered by Captain Phillip who, with Captain Hunter
or Mr. Dawes, were always to be present at the winding it at noon.
And it was ordered to be the duty of the lieutenant who brought 12
o'clock to see it done and the officer who relieved him was not to
take charge of the deck until he was informed that it was done. The
sentinel at the cabin door was also ordered to plant himself inside
the cabin, on hearing the bell ring at noon, and not to go out to
be relieved until he was told, or saw, that the timekeeper was
wound up by one of the officers. The management of the timekeeper
for keeping the longitude by it was given to Lieutenant Dawes of
the Marines.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 12]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 May 1787</p>

<p>Saturday, 12th. His Majesty's ship <i>Hyaena</i>, Captain
DeCourcy, joined us at the Motherbank, being ordered under our
Command, and to accompany us a certain distance. Unmoored and
weighed with a breeze at SE, working to the eastward to get round
St. Helens before night, but the wind failing us toward the evening
and the eastern tide done, we were obliged to anchor at Spithead.
The Convoy anchored as they could between the Motherbank and
Spithead.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 May 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 13th. At 4am wind at SE, weighed and made sail to the
Westward within the Isle of Wight, in company His Majesty's ship
<i>Hyaena</i>, armed tender <i>Supply</i> with 6 transports, and 3
store ships under convoy. At 9 were through the Needles, St.
Catharines open, and bearing S½E. At Noon St. Albans Head N25ºW,
distant 6 miles.</p>

<p>The 14th. At noon, latitude observed 49º8½'N and longitude by
the timekeeper 3º42'W. Start point bore NE by N, 5 leagues. Spoke
to the convoy to enquire if they had left any one behind. Found
that the 3rd mate of the <i>Charlotte</i>, the Provost Martial and
5 of the crew of the <i>Fishburne</i> were left behind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 May 1787</p>

<p>The 15th. At noon, were off Plymouth Sound. In the evening saw a
frigate standing towards us, but being little wind she did not get
near enough to speak to us. Nothing material happened until the
21st on which day the <i>Hyaena</i> parted company for England.
During the time she was with us she performed every service that a
ship could do, to admiration, and had the heaviest sailing ship of
the convoy in tow a great part of the time.</p>

<p>This same day the irons were ordered to be taken off the
convicts, except any whose ill behaviour made it necessary by way
of punishment to have them kept on. This lenient step towards
making those unhappy wretches comfortable was very ill received on
board the <i>Scarborough</i>, two of the convicts belonging to her
being brought on board the <i>Sirius</i> the same evening for
mutinous behaviour. They were severely punished and sent on board
the <i>Prince of Wales</i> transport, heavily ironed. Since leaving
Spithead we had only a day or two unpleasant pleasure and thought
ourselves very fortunate in getting so soon and well clear of the
land. Latitude 47º50'N longitudee 12º14'W, when the <i>Hyaena</i>
parted Company.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 May 1787</p>

<p>Friday, 26th. Latitude 42º24'N longitude by [sun]

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 18]</p>

<p>Had the wind from the NE quarter which ran us the length of
Madeira.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 May 1787</p>

<p>Tuesday. 29th. The <i>Supply</i> ahead made the signal for
seeing land which was at first supposed to be Porto Sancto, but as
we came in with it, found it to be the Deserters and the weather so
thick that the island of Madeira could not be seen as we
passed.</p>

<p>The Deserters are generally spoken of as the third, after the
island of Madeira and Porto Sancto, and as a barren rock. There are
3 island Deserters, two of considerable height and 3 miles extent.
The other, a small one, lies nearer Madeira. There is a passage
between these islands, as also between them and Madeira, which is 6
or 7 leagues to the north and west of them. The Northmost Deserter
we observed in latitude 32º27'N, longitude by timekeeper 16º35' W,
variation 18ºW.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 May 1787</p>

<p>The 31st. Made the Salvages bearing SW by S. We found the
situation of this island very different from what is laid down in
the chart: By a good meridian observation we made the latitude of
this island 30º12'N and longitude by timekeeper 15º56'W. This
island has some high land on it and when it bore West a high round
hill was over the middle of the island. By calculation from angles
taken and a base by the ship's run, I make the length of this
island 1.8 mile in a N70ºW direction, true bearing. We saw 4 rocks
to the NW of it which can only be spoken of as rocks above water
though they are some height. I have seen them in passing to the
westward when the large island could not be seen through the haze.
We passed to the eastward at about 4 leagues.</p>

<p>The NE wind left us the day before we made the Salvages in
latitude 32º19'N, longitude 16º30'W and hauled round to the W and
SW, which winds continued to the 2nd of June when it again favoured
us and at 5am saw the island of Teneriffe bearing SW by S. The
weather being hazy, the peak did not show itself.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 June 1787</p>

<p>The 3rd. At 7pm anchored and moored in Santa Cruz road with the

<p>Franciscan Church with a very remarkable white steeple S73ºW.
The fort to the southward of the Town SW, peak WSW. Off shore about

used the precaution of buoying up the cables. In making Teneriffe
to the SW of you, and the weather hazy, you will not see the peak,
but fall in with Punta de Nago, a very high land making in a steep
bluff, off which are several high ragged rocks, which show
themselves as you come well in with the land.</p>

<p>We steered close in with this point and run from it WSW, compass
12 miles, as near as we could estimate. As we sailed along the land
we shut in Punta de Nago with Antekara Point and Antekara Point
with La Rocquet Point, before we got into the anchoring ground.
Antekara Point is just opening with La Rocquet when NE by N by
compass. La Rocquet Point, from our anchoring birth in the road,
makes in a ragged bluff, with a little sugar loaf topped rock just
open without it. I would recommend anchoring so far in as to shut
the other points in, for clear ground.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 20]</p>

<p>Before we anchored, the master of the port, accompanied by
several officers, came on board to make the necessary enquiries.
Next day Captain Phillip, with the Officers of the squadron and
garrison, waited on the Governor, who returned the visit two days
after, on board the <i>Sirius</i>. This island has a very ragged
appearance and at first sight might be supposed to be incapable of
producing anything. There are many spots well cultivated in the
island and very productive, besides the vineyards. The season was
very unfavourable for us to get supplies of fruit&mdash;grapes not
ripe, oranges, lemons etc. very scarce, as was every kind of fruit
except figs. We were tolerably supplied with fresh beef and
poultry, and wine, very good.</p>

<p>The road of Santa Cruz is on the SE side [of] the island, and is open
to the S and SE winds which makes it very dangerous to lay there in
the winter season, when those winds prevail. We had the breeze
fresh from the sea in the day, and off the land early in the
evening, while we lay there. There is a stone pier run out for the
purpose of shipping, or landing goods and is the only safe landing
place near the town. To the Southward of the pier there are some
windmills which show very conspicuous coming in from the sea.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 21]</p>

<p>The water for shipping is conveyed to the pier, were we filled
in the boat with a hose (<i>sic</i>). This water comes from the
same rivulet that supplies the town, to which it is brought a
considerable distance along the rocks, in spouts open at the top,
on an easy descent, just allowing the water a free passage. They
are led across several deep gullies and everywhere supported with
posts to prevent their being carried away by the great torrents
that rush down in the rainy season.</p>

<p>The latitude observed on board the <i>Sirius</i> was 28º30'N and
the longitude by timekeeper 16º16'W. The peak we estimated to be in
28º18'N, 16º31'W.</p>

<p>The country above the city of Santa Cruz rises more gradually
than any of this part of the coast, which is chiefly very high
ragged mountain. In the part that we anchored in, the peak showed
itself between two of the highest hills and was, by us, supposed to
be a part of one of them, until a very clear morning convinced us
of its being the peak. It bore WSW by compass. There are two small
batteries near the pier and some others scattered along the coast,
by which the road is secured.</p>

<p>They are making great progress in their silk and woollen
manufactories. Many poor are supported by subscription and employed
in these houses of industry. The silk is entirely the produce of
the islands. The wool is imported from Europe, which they mix with
that of the Canary Islands. They also make tape, coarse cloths from
flax imported from Holland, chiefly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 22]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 June 1787</p>

<p>7th of June. Being the Festival of Corpus Christi, the boats
belonging to the transports were ordered not to land, that this
religious ceremony might not be interrupted by the enormities which
English seamen are too apt to commit in foreign ports. This
festival is kept on the Thursday next after Trinity Sunday. The
religious observance of carrying the Host is, on this day, kept
with great pomp and solemnity in all Roman Catholic countries and
is announced early in the morning by ringing the bells of all the
convents, monasteries and churches in the town.</p>

<p>Several of the officers of our squadron went on shore to see the
procession, which assembled at 10 o'clock at a particular church
where, after having performed mass, the host, or consecrated wafer
(which, on certain festivals and other occasions, they offer up as
a host or sacrifice for the sins of mankind), enclosed in a glass
case, is taken down from a little recess over the altar and
delivered to the priest, who is to carry it through the whole of
the procession.</p>

<p>A canopy is held over it by four other priests and, the
congregation having arranged themselves in the order in which they
are to parade the town, the military guard, officers of state and
the dignitaries of the church, lead the procession in great
solemnity out of the church, at which instant the guns begin firing
from the forts, martial music playing, etc. Those people who did
not attend mass, appear at their windows and doors. Even the sick
are brought to the window and if any principal person, the
procession stops opposite to the house of the sick, holding up the
host, say a few prayers, and proceed.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 23]</p>

<p>When they have paraded the streets of the town, they return to
the church and, having placed the host from whence it was taken,
they all repair to their respective houses and pass the remainder
of the day cheerfully. It is required of every person passing
through the street at the time the host is going by, that they
kneel and uncover their head, the latter of which is always
expected from a foreigner.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 June 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 10th. Sailed from Santa Cruz and, after being becalmed
two days between Teneriffe and Gran Canaria, had the wind from NW
to NE. During these two days we had the peak clear, several times.
The peak is, by some, said to be a volcano and frequently to issue
stones etc.</p>

<p>An Officer who had resided in Santa Cruz a considerable time,
informed me that nothing but smoke had come from it for several
years and <i>that</i> at very distant intervals. The perpendicular
height is computed by Dr. Heberden at 15,396 feet. It is not safe
at all seasons to ascend the peak. The best time is in the months
of July and August, the snow at the foot being then mostly
dissolved. No one belonging to our squadron went to it. The oblique
height is reckoned at 15 miles.</p>

<p>The officer before mentioned also informed me that Oratavia,
situated on the west side of the island, was originally a great
place of trade and principal sea port but, from an earthquake in
1704, the port was filled up and the anchoring ground left was
scarcely such as would afford security for one ship.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 24]</p>

<p>The town of Oratavia now stands on the spot where the ships
formerly anchored.</p>

<p>The ships that go there are now obliged to keep in constant
readiness to clear the land if the wind should come on shore, there
not being any shelter. The island of Teneriffe is reckoned 50 miles
in length and 25 broad. As we sailed to the southward along the
island, the town of Candelaria opened to us. It is near the sea and
by strangers may be mistaken for Santa Cruz, if they fall in to the
southward in making the island. It is not so large, nor is there a
church in it, so conspicuous as that of St. Franciscan in Santa
Cruz.</p>

<p>It may also be known by the bearings of the peak, if you see it.
The peak over the southern part of Santa Cruz is WSW and over
Candelaria W by compass. The land about and to the southward of
Candelaria is not so ragged as it is all about and to the northward
of Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Branceforte, brigadier in the Spanish Service, is
the present governor, an Italian, and very much esteemed for his
great benevolence and many other excellent virtues.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 June 1787</p>

<p>June 15th. At noon crossed the Tropic of Cancer and had the sun
in the zenith at nearly the same instant. Thermometer then at 74.
The NE trade seemed to be fixed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 June 1787</p>

<p>17th. A large ship passed us to the northward, but not near
enough to distinguish what she was.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 25]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 June 1787</p>

<p>18th. In the evening, drawing near the Isle of Sal, shortened
sail and kept the <i>Supply</i> ahead. In AM, soon after daylight,
saw the island of Sal bearing SW by S and passed along the east
side of it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 June 1787</p>

<p>19th at 2pm Saw the island of Bona Vista, at 4. The southern
end of it bore due west 6 or 7 mile. We passed along the east side
of it within a mile and half of the reef. Brought to* in the
evening, not having run for the night to the Isle of May. In
falling in with these islands (the weather is generally hazy) Sal
may be known from Bona Vista by the high sugar loaf hill on the
northern end of it which, being situated toward that end of the
island, remains fixed as you run along the east side, whereas in
Bona Vista the highest land forms a similar sugar loaf and, being
towards the middle of the island, travels along the other land as
you pass it.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bring to: to cause a boat to come to a
standstill. Usually written as "brot too" in the journal.]</p>

<p>We saw the reef off this island break very furiously and sailed
along the east side of it within 1½ miles of the breakers. They
appear to run from the land, off the white sandhills, and when the
highest sugar loaf bears W½S you are nearly abreast the northern
part of them. They extend some miles along the coast, apparently at
the distance of 3 miles from the shore.</p>

<p>People who have fallen in with this reef differ as to the
situation of it. Some place it off the NE and others off the SE
part of the island. The bearing before mentioned, of the high sugar
loaf, W½S, appeared to us in a line with the northern part of the
breakers.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 26]</p>

<p>Several ships have narrowly escaped being wrecked upon this
reef, some from mistaking the island and others from supposing it
did not lay so far from the shore.</p>

<p>The northern end of Sal is in the latitude 16º50'N and the
southern end 16º40'N, longitude by timekeeper 23º02'W. Variation
observed 11º30'W. Southern end of Bona Vista, by good observation
on board the <i>Sirius</i>, 15º59'N and 23º02'W by the
timekeeper.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 June 1787</p>

<p>The 19th. At daylight saw the Isle of May, the S end NW by W 4
miles. At 4pm the southern end of Bona Vista bore N78ºW per compass
6 mile, from which we ran SW by S 37 mile and then brought to with
our head off shore. After making sail and running 2 mile W by S saw
the Isle of May as before mentioned.</p>

<p>In passing the Isle of May you may run close along the east side
of it and steer over west or W½S per compass for St. Iago, which
course carried us in with that island, about 2 leagues to windward
Port Praya Bay. The latitude of the southern end of May, reduced
back from the next noon, is 15º09'N and 23º07'W.</p>

<p>At 10am saw the island of St. Iago. In running along the coast
of it to Port Praya, there is the appearance of a bay, but it
cannot be mistaken for Port Praya when the direction of the coast
is attended to. The land from the east point of Praya Bay to the
northward lays nearly NNE and the whole land which opens to the
westward of this point W by S or W½S per compass.</p>

<p>About noon were standing in for Port Praya Bay when, on hauling
round the reef off the East point of the Bay, just within it and
had the fort open, were taken aback.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 27]</p>

<p>The convoy in a cluster round us, no true wind blowing, but
catspaws from every point of the compass and a heavy swell setting
in upon the shore, which circumstances altogether rendered our
getting in with the convoy very hazardous from the danger of
falling on board each other in such a swell as well as that of
being near the eastern reef.</p>

<p>It was therefore judged most safe to endeavor to get the convoy
from the land into the true wind, which was done in about 2 hours
and we again proceeded with a fresh breeze at east.</p>

<p>Standing in for the east point of Praya Bay, the W point will
show itself as will the W end of the island. As you draw near the
eastern reef, Quail Island will show itself, as will the fort,
which stands on a high rock and is on with Quail Island, when
bearing northern by compass, on which bearing a high round hill
will partly be over both. There are reefs which generally show off
both points of the bay. It is generally recommended to keep close
in with the land, until you open the reef of the W point of the bay
and then haul close round the eastern reef. Bring the flagstaff NW
or NW½N, the east point E by S and the outer point SW by W, from 10
to 7 fathoms water. It is not safe to lay in this bay during the
winter months. So early as August, Capt Wallis had very bad
weather. Observed the latitude of Port Praya, on board the
<i>Sirius</i>, 14º54', northern longitude by the Timekeeper
23º40'W.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 June 1787</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 28]</p>

<p>23rd in latitude 9º48'N, longitude 23º00'W. Lost the NE trade
and had frequent squalls, variable winds with heavy rain, thunder
and lightening.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 June 1787</p>

<p>By the 25th it seemed to have quite blown itself out. The wind
varying NE to SE, SW and frequently NW. Then variable winds
continued to the 28th when it fixed between the S and SW, then in
7º29'N, 21º41'W.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 June 1787</p>

<p>29th am. Saw a large ship to windward who bore down to us and
hoisted Portuguese colours. Found her to be a ship from Lisbon
bound to the coast of Brasil.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 June 1787</p>

<p>30th pm. After dark, a devil fish was hooked, as he lay on the
surface of the water. Before he could be hoisted in, 3 very large
sucking fish were soon on him, one of which was struck and got in
and was the largest I ever saw. It was 2ft. 9in. long. It being
dark when this monster was got in, he was kept on the quarter deck
all night, but was dead as soon as out of the water, from having
had several harpoons etc. stuck in him.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jul87" id="jul87"></a>July 1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 July 1787</p>

<p>In the morning, 2 sucking fish 7 inches long and quite white
were taken from within him, out at his mouth, perfectly alive. When
this fish was opened there was not anything found in his stomach or
intestines nor had he any teeth. He had 5 gills on each side,
evenly and oppositely placed, within which those white sucking fish
had fixed themselves. The belly of this fish was white, the back
dark brown and much resembling a large skate. He had two horns
projecting from the upper part of the head, just over his eyes.
Some of the people eat of this fish but it was not thought
good.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 29]</p>

<p>Dimensions Large Sucking Fish</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal.]</p>

<p>From the 29th June to the 1st of July had the winds chiefly from
the SW with frequent squalls, heavy rains etc., which obliged us to
keep on to the eastward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 July 1787</p>

<p>July 2nd, pm. The wind came to south, tacked and stood to the
westward. We found, by the timekeeper, a very strong easterly
current for some days past. The Portuguese ship which had sailed in
company until now, parted, not being able even to keep up with our
heavy sailing Convoy.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 July 1787</p>

<p>July 5th. The wind again coming to the SSW and SW obliged us to
stand to the eastward. From this prospect of our making a tedious
passage, the crews, marines and convicts on board the transports
were put to an allowance of 3 pints of water per day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 July 1787</p>

<p>The 6th, am. Saw a sloop standing to the westward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 July 1787</p>

<p>The 7th. The wind again coming to the southward, we stood to the
westward. We had been forced so far to the eastward as 18º22'W when
between the parallel of 9½º and 5½ºN, by variable winds, before we
got what might any way be called the SE trade, which this day came
on at south and S by E.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 30]</p>

<p>In the evening, spoke to the sloop, from London bound to
Falkland Islands, 12 weeks from England and 5 from the Isle of May.
They had been 3 weeks between the parallels of 9ºN and 5ºN with S
and SW winds.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 July 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 8th. Saw a large ship coming down before the wind. She
hoisted Portuguese Colours and passed to the eastward without
passing near enough to speak to her.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 July 1787</p>

<p>11th. An albacore was struck that weighed 80 lb. and several
smaller. We examined this and several other albacores and bonetta
and in both found the white appendage to the heart (which is
generally allowed to be the reason for the albacore having that
name) exactly the same, and not the heart as supposed by seamen in
general. It is closely connected to the heart, which is
considerably large and of a dull reddish colour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 July 1787</p>

<p>12th. The master of the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> transport brought on
board three of his people who had been guilty of mutiny in refusing
to steer the ship as directed by the master, by which means she was
very far to leeward out of her station. They were kept on board the
<i>Sirius</i> and three men sent in lieu to assist in working that
ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 July 1787</p>

<p>15th. At 5pm crossed the Equinoctial Line in longitude 26ºW,
variation of the Compass 5º50'W, being now much favoured by having
the SE trade well to the eastward and a prospect of making a
quicker passage than could be supposed when the allowance of water
was reduced. It was this day increased to 2 quarts per day.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 31]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 July 1787</p>

<p>27th. Observed the <i>Supply</i> and one of the transports heave
to suddenly and half an hour afterwards make sail. The
<i>Supply</i> informed us that the <i>Alexander</i> had lost a man
overboard.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 July 1787</p>

<p>28th pm. Blew strong from the ESE and continued to the 29th am,
when we again had the usual moderate weather and the wind from E to
NE. This day we changed the variation from west to east latitude at
the time the observation giving east variation was taken, lat.
18º30'S, long. E32ºW, variation 0º01'E.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="aug87" id="aug87"></a>August 1787</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 August 1787</p>

<p>August 2nd. Spoke to a Portuguese brig bound to Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 August 1787</p>

<p>3rd at 3pm. Saw Cape Frio, west per compass 12 leagues. The NE
winds, which had favoured since the 29th ultimo did not fail us
until we got under the land to the westward of Cape Frio, which we
did by midnight, when it became light and variable and, as usual in
these climates, alternately inclining from the land and sea. By the
preceding meridian observation, we make the Cape in 23º00'S and by
the timekeeper 41º44'W.</p>

<p>The Cape, as we take it, is the outer point of the island making
in a saddle and which lies to the southward a short distance off
the point on the mainland, which the Portuguese call the Cape. The
coast to the northward lies NNW and round Cape Frio it lays nearly
east and west more than 20 leagues to Rio Janeiro, the land bold
all the way, but the bottom is not clear in many parts near the
shore.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 32]</p>

<p>It is recommended to keep to the southward until you are past a
large bight formed by the Cape Island and the land to the NW, into
which there is often so strong a set as to make it dangerous. At
noon latitude observed 23º14'S, Cape Frio NE by E½E 12 leagues,
western extreme W¾N, about 5 leagues from the land abreast of us,
and saw the land about the harbour distinctly.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 August 1787</p>

<p>4th. In the evening light airs from the land. We lay to all the
night endeavouring, as the wind varied, to keep her head to the
westward. We had from 42 to 47 fathoms water, oaze with shells and
one cast 47 fathoms fine sand, very black. Our distance from the
shore as near as we could estimate was 4 leagues. At noon, latitude
observed 23º17'S, sugar loaf at the entrance of Rio Janeiro NW by
W½W per compass 8 or 9 leagues.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 August 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 5th. The false sugar loaf WNW½W 4 or 5 leagues, had 36
fathoms sand and shells. Brought to for the night about 5 miles
from the land. Sounded every hour, 34, 33, 34 fathoms sand and
shells. At daylight found that we had drifted considerably to the
eastward and scarce any inshore to the northward, from which the
soundings appear to run regular from the shore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 August 1787</p>

<p>Monday, 6th. At 9pm anchored with the convoy about 5 mile
without the entrance of Rio Janeiro, in 13 fathoms water. Found the
sounding regular, when anchored. The island Raze S by W½W. Sugar
loaf NW½N. The 2 Payas in one NE by E and Corkavada W½S by
compass.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 33]</p>

<p>The harbour is easily found when the land is sufficiently clear
to see the making of it. As you sail to the westward you will see a
sugar loaf hill sloping to the westward and trenching away to the
eastward. This piece of land lies a small distance to the eastward
of the entrance. The land to the westward is very remarkable and
that near the western extremity is a very high overhanging
mountain, called Corkavada, and is about 2 leagues to the westward
of the entrance. If the weather is clear you will see, lying
without it, Rodondo, an island round at top and may be seen a great
distance in clear weather. It is S by W 7 miles from the entrance
of Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>We passed Cape Frio at the distance of 6 miles and steered W by
S by Compass, ran 12 leagues and shortened sail. This course rather
carried us off the shore than in with it. When you have run this
distance, or before, you will see two islands (Maricas), off which
the ground is foul and very unsafe to anchor near. These islands
are the first you meet with on the coast between Cape Frio and Rio
Janeiro. Some of the land you pass has much the appearance of an
island, but is not. As you proceed to the westward and after seeing
Rodondo, you will see another island close to it (Raze) which
although not seen so soon as Rodondo, it lays to the eastward of
it. It is generally recommended to steer for those islands,
particularly if going in with Rio Janeiro after dark.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 34]</p>

<p>By preserving sight of one of them, you may anchor in a good
road within those islands in 13 fathoms clear sandy bottom,
bringing Raze south or S by W of you, and not more than 2 miles
from it. You will then be about 5 miles from the harbour and in a
situation that will enable you, in case of bad weather coming on,
to lead out to sea if the wind should be such as would not admit of
running for the harbour, which lies from Raze N½E 6 or 7 miles.</p>

<p>There are several islands lying without the harbour, between all
of which are passages, and between Raze and Rodondo a very good one
of 2 miles, steep too on both sides, and between Rodondo and a rock
just off it is a passage for small vessels.</p>

<p>There is also a passage between Paya and Maya Islands on the
east side the bay and usually left on the starboard hand. The Sugar
Loaf* is just on the opening between these islands when bearing NW
by W½W or WNW and, if under a necessity, a ship may with safety run
right through in for the Sugar Loaf; but unless pressed it would be
imprudent.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Now called Sugarloaf Mountain]</p>

<p>As you generally have sea and land breezes, the best pilotage is
to run well in with Rodondo and Raze and, having opened the
harbour, steer for it. You have good anchoring ground and regular
soundings within the island Raze.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 August 1787</p>

<p>Monday, 6. At daylight, an officer was sent into the harbour to
the Viceroy to inform him who we were and the occasion of our
calling at this Port. At 11 he returned. The Viceroy very readily
consented to our being supplied with every necessary for the use of
the convoy and convicts etc.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 35]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 August 1787</p>

<p>Tuesday, 7th at 1pm. The sea breeze set in. Weighed and stood
in for the harbour. The master of the port came on board. It being
little wind we did not get off the east point of the entrance, on
which stands Santa Cruz Fort, until past 5. We saluted that fort
with 13 guns which was immediately returned with an equal number.
At 7, came to in 17 fathoms with the <i>Supply</i> and convoy off
the city of St. Sebastians.</p>

<p>As you steer in for the harbour, the water shoals gradually to 7
and 6 fathoms, just without and nearly opposite the east point of
the entrance, when it deepens suddenly to 18 and 20 and keeps from
20, 18 to 16 as you sail up to St. Sebastians.</p>

<p>Ships generally go higher up and haul round the island of Cobras
which lies just off the NE end of the town. It is well fortified
and has stores houses on it for the use of heaving down and
refitting ships. If necessity should require it, a ship may pass
between the Sugar Loaf and the island that lays just without it
(Catumduba) as likewise to the westward of Square Island which lies
on the entrance and is a fortified rock. This channel is very
narrow, having a reef running from the west point of the island and
all foul ground. It is most advisable in all cases, when it can be
done, to use the direct passage from the island Raze into the
harbour, for safety, propriety and expedition.</p>

<p class="page-jnl"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[Page 36]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 August 1787</p>

<p>Wednesday, 8th. Captain Phillip, accompanied by the officers of
the squadron and garrison, paid respects to the Viceroy. They were
received with much kindness. The Viceroy, contrary to the usual
custom, ordered that all the English officers might be permitted to
go wherever they thought proper without being subject to those
restrictions complained of by Captain Cook in his first voyage and
others who have visited Rio Janeiro.</p>

<p>9th. Captain Phillip and Mr. Dawes went to look at a room which
had been granted for the purpose of making the necessary
observations for the timekeeper etc., but it not being thought
proper for the purpose, Captain Phillip obtained leave from the
Viceroy to make use of an island (Enradas) lying to the NE of the
town, which spot being approved, a tent was erected on the 11th and
on the 12th, the instruments landed and fixed under the direction
of Mr. Dawes.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 August 1787</p>

<p>The 13th. The Timekeeper was sent to the tent and all boats

<p class="date-jnl">21 August 1787</p>

<p>21st. Being the birthday of the Prince of Brazil, the Portuguese
flag was hoisted on board the <i>Sirius</i>. On this day it is the
custom for all the military to pay respects to the Viceroy and a
general salute from all the forts. Captain Phillip, with the
English Officers, paid the compliment of observing this custom and
by a Royal Salute from the <i>Sirius</i> when their forts
saluted.</p>

<p>The very kind behaviour of the Viceroy and the great attention
we received from the officers in general, was quite sufficient to
make every English officer in that port rejoice at having an
opportunity of showing respect to him and them. The guard boat
attended our squadron, apparently as matter of form. The
transports' boats were even permitted to land in any part of the
harbour or bay without being followed or in the smallest degree
restricted by them.</p>

<p>Water is well supplied and brought to the wharf fronting the
palace in pipes and led though spouts to the boat, from which you
fill with a hose. Fresh beef and every refreshment to be found in
the climate, we were here supplied with. The yams I think exceed
those of any other country I have ever seen. Oranges astonishingly
plenty and so very cheap, that the people in the guard boat would
frequently amuse themselves with throwing some hundreds to the
convicts in the different transports, from their boat.</p>

<p>The Health of the convicts, which was very little impaired
during this part of the voyage, was soon perfectly established by
being amply provided with fresh provisions, vegetables and very
frequently fruit was given them. Fourteen only died since leaving
England, the greater part of which was embarked in the river, and
such objects as could not have been supposed would have lived, had
they remained in England.</p>

<p>We have proofs already of the great neglect in fitting the ship.
Decks and upper works so leaky as to make it necessary to employ
caulkers on board. The skirting boards over the copper were so
badly secured as to have been washed off on both sides. While the
ship was on the heel to fix other skirting boards, we took the
opportunity of driving 2 bolts and 2 spike nails, of the white
composition, 12 inches below the wale and laid them over with
copper, to try if the copper would make any impression on this
composition.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 August 1787</p>

<p>31st. Mr. Morton, master of the <i>Sirius</i>, was invalided,
having received a hurt on the passage from Teneriffe which rendered
him for a time incapable of duty. This was a real loss to the ship,
he being an attentive, active and experienced man and well
qualified for the station. Mr. Seally and Mr. Rotton, two of the
master's mates, were also invalided. Their Health being in so bad a
state as to make it necessary, and there being an English ship
bound to London, they had a good opportunity of returning to
England. Mr. Kelty a master in the navy and serving as mate on
board one of the store ships was appointed master of the
<i>Sirius</i>.</p>

on board. The rate of the timekeeper was determined by 12 days
observations, losing 2"28' per day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 September 1787</p>

<p>4th. Captain Phillip, with the officers, took leave of the
Viceroy and on the 4th at daylight weighed and made sail with a
light breeze from the northward. At 7 and before we were the length
of Santa Cruz, that fort saluted us with 21 guns which last and
great mark of respect was immediately returned with the same number
from the <i>Sirius</i>. This was no doubt a return to the
compliment which we paid them on the Prince of Brazil's birthday.
When we were without the harbour the master of the port left us.
Plants of almost every kind the country produced were procured for
Captain Phillip, amongst which were the cochineal, coffee jalup,
citron, tobacco, cocoa, oranges of different sorts, limes, sweet
lemons, bananas, guavas, and seeds of those that were not so easily
removed in trees or plants.</p>

<p>Soon after we left the harbour we saw two sail, tacked and stood
toward them. The <i>Supply</i> spoke the nearest, a Portuguese ship
from Oporto bound to Rio Janeiro, sailed in June, had no other news
than that of the Viceroy being superseded in the Government of the
Brazil and that the arrival of the new Viceroy might be daily
expected.</p>

changed to SW in a very hard squall with heavy rain.</p>

<p>Thunder and lightening at 2am the 8th from which time until the

several hours and suddenly shifted to the SW after we had got
further to the southward. From the 23rd we had the wind alternately
NW and SW, with short intervals of light breezes from the SE, if we
got anything to the northward, which we lost again by keeping more
to the southward. A convincing proof I think that keeping to the
southward is the best chance of making a passage to the
eastward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 October 1787</p>

<p>6th am. The <i>Alexander</i>, making the signal to speak us,
brought to her boat. The master of her and one of the marine
officers came on board. We found that some part of the crew of that
ship had leagued themselves with the convicts to furnish them with
materials to endeavor to effect an escape at the Cape of Good Hope
and that one of them had already furnished them with an iron crow
for the purpose. However impossible it might be for them to execute
any plan of that nature, it was judged proper by Captain Phillip
that the ringleader and 3 others of the Crew should be removed on
board the <i>Sirius</i>, which was immediately done and 4 seamen
sent in lieu to the <i>Alexander</i> to assist in working her. The
convict who endeavoured to escape at Teneriffe was the projector of
the plan. He was then very heavily ironed and now stapled down to
the deck. One of the convicts, whose life was in danger on board
the <i>Alexander</i>, having given information of their plan, was
removed to the <i>Scarborough</i>.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 October 1787</p>

<p>Saturday, 13th, pm. The <i>Supply</i> was ordered ahead during
the night, it being then intended to run in for the land all night,
but the wind increasing and coming dead upon the shore, it was
thought best to bring to until daylight, when we again made sail
and at sunrise saw the Cape of Good Hope, SE by E 10 leagues. The
wind favouring us, we anchored and moored in Table Bay with the
<i>Supply</i> and convoy the same evening.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 42]</p>

<p>An officer was sent to the Governor, who assured us that we
should be supplied with everything wanting as far as it could be
done, but that the opinion of the council must be had before he
could answer the whole of our demand. The Governor assured the
officer that our salute should be returned gun for gun by the fort.
This was required in consequence of its having been customary here
for the Governor to order an Indiaman in the bay to take up
salutes. At sunrise, saluted the fort with 13 guns which was
answered by the same number from the Fort.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 October 1787</p>

<p>16th. Captain Phillip, accompanied by the officers, paid
respects to the Governor, who shortly after returned the compliment
at the house where Captain Phillip lived, and invited all the
English officers to dine with him the next day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 October 1787</p>

<p>17th. Eight of the main deck guns were struck down in the hold
and the deck cleared for the reception of cattle, for which purpose
stalls, etc. were built fore and aft the deck, just leaving room to
work the cables.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 43]</p>

<p>In consequence of Captain Phillip having written to the Governor
to say that if he had not an immediate answer concerning the
supplies for us, that he must take such steps as would enable us to
proceed without them, an order was given the 23rd to supply all our
demands. All the staves, hoops etc. were now collected from the
different ships in addition to those of the <i>Sirius</i>, that as
much water, flour, spirits and every article for the people and
cattle might be taken as could possibly be stowed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 October 1787</p>

<p>25th. A Danish Indiaman arrived from China. She left 2 French
king's ships at Macao that had been on discoveries out round Cape
Horn among the islands, and had then returned from the northward as
far as they could penetrate.</p>

England. Sailed in August, brought an account of our having a fleet
of observation ready, under the command of Commodore Leveson Gower,

occasioned by dissentions in Holland.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 November 1787</p>

<p>The 6th. This Packet sailed for Bengal.</p>

<p>Saturday, 10th. The cattle and everything being on board,
unmoored and dropped farther out into the Bay, as did most of the
convoy.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 November 1787</p>

<p>13th. At 2pm weighed and made sail, <i>Supply</i> and convoy in
company with a fresh gale from the southward. At 6, spoke to the
<i>Kent of London</i>, 4 months from England; had been whaling in
St. Helena Bay.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 44]</p>

<p>As we ran out to the northward of Roban Island, we passed a
shoal part of it in 7 fathoms, the <i>Borrowdale</i> at the same
time ½ a Cable's length within us. While we lay in Table Bay, fresh
provisions, loaves and vegetables were supplied every day to the
seamen, marines and convicts.</p>

<p>The quantity of cattle etc. taken on board the <i>Sirius</i> was
that of the Governor, there only being a bull, a bull calf, 3 cows
and 2 rams on board her of the public stock, the other part of
which was on board the <i>Fishburne</i>, <i>Borrowdale</i> and
<i>Friendship</i> and was only 40 sheep, 1 Ram, 26 sows, 2 boars
and 4 goats. The <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> had on board 1 stallion, 3
mares and their colts and were all again with foal. The <i>Golden
Grove</i> was appropriated to the use of other individuals.</p>

<p>The following is an account of a Malay who, just before our
arrival, had thrown the whole of Cape Town into the utmost
confusion by running amuck.</p>

<p>This horrible desperado was a native of Batavia and a person of
some consequence among his countrymen, but was banished to the Cape
of Good Hope for some crime which he had committed, and because the
Governor would not permit him to return to Batavia he became
exasperated with revenge and in order to enable himself to put it
into execution, he worked himself up into a frenzy by smoking
opium, then armed himself with a variety of weapons, rushed forth
in the dusk of the evening and killed or wounded every man who was
unfortunate enough to fall in his way.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 45]</p>

<p>He stabbed the sentinel at the gate of the company's gardens
and, taking his post, waited in expectation of seeing the Governor
come out, who narrowly escaped the fate intended for him by its
falling on another person who accidentally came that way. On being
pursued, he fled with incredible swiftness to the Table Mountain
where he remained two days, still raging from the effects of opium
and defeated every person who was sent to take him alive. For two
days none dare stir from within doors, neither master nor slave,
for the Governor had given an order, as the most likely manner of
destroying him should he appear in the town, that whatever Malay
was seen was to be killed by the soldiers.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day he was taken alive on the Table
Mountain, doing much injury in resisting those who took him. He was
taken immediately to the place of execution, where he suffered a
lingering and horrid death. He was broken alive on the wheel, his
head and limbs were severed from his body and distributed in
different parts of the country.</p>

<p>He killed 14 inhabitants and double that number badly wounded.
It was remarked that his madness fell only on men. Women passed him
unhurt and it was as extraordinary as unfortunate that, amongst
those which his rage destroyed, were some of the most deserving and
promising young men in the town. This madness is called at Batavia
running amuck, and has happened there several times, but was the
first instance ever known at the Cape.</p>

<p>The Government of the Cape is vested in a Governor and Council
together with a Court of Justice. The members of the Council are
the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Commanding Officer of the Troops
and four of the Council. With these, all regulations for the
management of the colony originate and from them all orders and
decrees issue.</p>

<p>The Council of Justice is composed of the Fiscal and 12 Members.
The Fiscal, who is the first officer of justice, is independent. He
hears all causes and prescribes all punishments. He has people
under his directions who constantly patrol the streets armed, for
the apprehending of all disorderly persons. Every 14 days offences
are tried. The punishments inflicted here are breaking upon the
cross, upon the wheel, impalements, flogging to that degree that
death is frequently the effect of its severity. Over the door of a
small wooden house, wherein are kept the instruments of execution,
is the following inscription, in Latin:</p>

<p><i>"Happy is the man whom other men's misfortunes make
wary."</i>
</p>

<p>In this town are two churches, one for the Calvinists the other
for the followers of Martin Luther. In the former is a neat and
handsome organ. The women sit in chairs in the body of the church,
the men in pews round the sides. Marriage ceremonies are performed
on Sunday only and the parties dressed in black.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 November 1787</p>

<p>13th at 7pm. Took our departure from the Lions Rump, bearing
S39ºE, 6 leagues. The wind continuing at south and S by E obliged
us to stand on to the westward. The rate of the timekeeper by
observations during our stay in Table Bay was determined at losing
3",17' per day.</p>

<p>It is generally recommended to ships sailing from Table Bay to
go out to the northward of Robben Island, as there is frequently a
strong set down upon the rocks which lie off the SE side of it and,
being very liable to get becalmed under the high land on the south
side of Table Bay, it is thought dangerous to attempt that passage
unless the wind is well to the northward of east.</p>

<p>Going into Table Bay, it is best to keep well to the southward
to prevent being driven down on those rocks. You may haul close
round Green Point in 7, 6 or 5 fathoms water. After you pass Green
Point, if the wind should be from SE, you must be cautious not to
stand very far over on the NE side of the Bay, there being a great
deal of foul ground and shoal water on that shore. There is much
foul ground in the Bay, which may easily be avoided, unless a great
number of ships are in the Bay.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 48]</p>

<p>You must pass the outermost fort before you have clear ground
and, when the Sugar Loaf* is half way between that and the New
Fort, you may anchor in any depth under 12 fathoms clear ground.
The berth I would choose for a large ship, is the Sugar Loaf,
directly over the New Fort in 8 or 9 fathoms water. There is good
anchorage under Robben Island, should you be going in the northern
passage and be baulked by a shift of wind etc.</p>

<p>Thursday, 15. The wind coming to the westward of south at 9 am.
Tacked and stood to the eastward but in a few hours, it backing
again to S by E and SSE, obliged us again to stand to the westward.
Went to an allowance of 2 quarts of water per day each man.</p>

<p>This day, Captain Phillip made known his intentions of
proceeding to Botany Bay in the <i>Supply</i> when we were to the
eastward of the Cape of Good Hope and that one of the lieutenants
of the <i>Sirius</i> should go with him. This was proposed to me
and immediately accepted, but Captain Hunter objecting to the first
lieutenant being taken out of the ship, Captain Phillip ordered the
second lieutenant to be ready to accompany him.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 November 1787</p>

<p>Monday, 19th. Being calm all day, the luggage of Captain Phillip
etc. was put on board the <i>Supply</i> as were eleven artificers
belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, that everything might be ready when
the Governor should leave the <i>Sirius</i>. We received 9 Men from
the <i>Supply</i>.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 49]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 November 1787</p>

<p>20th. Officers and ships' companies put to an allowance of three
pints of water per day. AM at 8, after being calm, a breeze sprung
up at NNE which at last enabled us to steer to the eastward, after
having been carried into the longitude of 10½ºE by S and SE winds,
without having it once in our power to stand to the eastward more
than 2 hours. A great number of whales, several close alongside the
ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 November 1787</p>

<p>Sunday, 25th, am. Made those ships signals that were to proceed
ahead. At 11, Captain Phillip, Lieutenant King, and Lieutenant
Dawes, of the marines, belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, went on
board the <i>Supply</i>, to which ship the timekeeper was removed
from the <i>Sirius</i>. Major Ross, with the adjutant, went on
board the <i>Scarborough</i> transport which ship, with the
<i>Friendship</i>, was to proceed under the command of Lieutenant
Shortland, Agent of Transports, in the <i>Alexander</i>.</p>

<p>At noon they all parted company leaving the <i>Sirius</i> to
follow with the heavy sailing ships (3 Transports and 3 Store
ships). Latitude 38º47'S, Longitude 25º53'E. Timekeeper
22º36'E.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 November 1787</p>

<p>Next day at noon the <i>Supply</i> was in sight from the
masthead bearing SE by E and the Agent's Division, SE 6 mile.
Finding that we had been carried considerably to the northward, we
altered the course to the southward and in the afternoon the

<p>Between the Cape of Good Hope and these islands we kept the
parallels of 39, 40 and 41 as we approached, from an idea of
preserving clear weather by not running near either of those
islands. In this we were very successful, not having any fogs and
very little thick weather and continued fair wind, shifting
frequently from SSW to W, NW and N and sometimes blowing strong for
a few hours. In general, a steady fresh gale.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 December 1787</p>

<p>Wednesday, 19th. The wine being out, our allowance was ordered a
quart of grog and a quart of water per day.</p>

<p>Sunday, 23rd. Saw a sea otter. He followed the ship a
considerable time. The haze round the horizon this afternoon had
much the appearance of land being near; a.m. a great number of
whales were seen about the ship.</p>

<p>31st. Expecting to have strong winds as we approached the land.
Bent a new foresail, fore and main top sails, which was not done a
day too soon. The new year came in with a hard gale at WNW, which
lasted only a few hours. In the space of half an hour, while the

seeing the land, at 4pm made signal for the convoy to come our

135º30'E, the longitude at noon, was shown to them.</p>

<p>This night a luminous appearance or substance was seen, and very
different from what I ever heard of being noticed by any one. They
resemble lights floating on the surface of the water and disappear
when turned, as the sea washed over them. They keep the same
appearance when close alongside, as at a distance. Several of them
passed close to us as the ship ran through them, and were seen on
the surface more than a mile ahead. We endeavoured, without
success, to get some of them. They immediately got the name of
Purser's Lanthorns*.</p>

<p>Sunday, 6. At 11pm the Aurora Australis was very bright, with

<p class="date-jnl">8 January 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 8th. At half past 1pm saw Van Diemen's Land. We were
only 8 weeks from the Cape of Good Hope and since the 23rd of
November, on which day we regained the meridian of that cape after
having been forced 9º to the windward, we had scarce an hour foul
wind; but even this good fortune was not enough to preserve the
cattle on board the <i>Sirius</i>, which were so badly provided for
as to be nearly starved. Three of the cows calved on the passage,
the whole of which died. The cows having scarce sufficient to keep
themselves alive, could not support the young. One of the cows, big
with calf, also died before we made the land.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 52]</p>

<p>At 2pm saw the Mewstone, N36ºE by compass, 4 or 5 leagues. We
were in latitude 44º04'S and stood in NE. At 4 passed the Mewstone
about 6 mile to the southward of it. At 5 saw the Eddystone to the
eastward of Swilly. The whole space between those rocks appeared
from the mast head to be full of broken water and some tops of
rocks showing themselves above the surface. We stood on for the
South Cape and passed it at 2 or 3 mile distance. We now steered
ENE and passed to the northward of Swilly at 9 or 10 miles
distance. We made the Mewstone within 5 miles, as laid down by
Captain Cook. By the mean result of all the observations taken on
board the <i>Sirius</i>, by Captain Hunter and myself, we reduce
the point of this land, as follows:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="1901251h-images/_Journal-p52a.jpg" alt=

<pre>

Mewstone      43°48'S, 146°25'E } Variation of the compass, 5°30'E.
South Cape    43°42'S, 146°53'E }

Eddystone     43°53'S, 147°09'E } the surface: between the two high rocks.

</pre>

<p>The point of the South West Cape we were at a loss to determine,
but concluded it must be that which makes like the Ramhead of
Plymouth and particularly so from the situation of the
Mewstone.</p>

<p>Between the South West and South Capes we saw many islands, high
rocks and the appearance of harbours, from the double landmarks
behind the coast and the islands lying off it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 53]</p>

<p>One, particularly when the Mewstone bore N14ºE by compass,
seemed to be formed by low land to the westward making in a bluff,
and has the appearance of an island with a very remarkable rock
just open of it, bearing northern.</p>

<p>As we passed along, the same appearance of a harbour continued,
although the bearings of the Mewstone and rock, before mentioned,
had been altered some points. As we got to the eastward of it, the
low bluff island appeared to be very near, or a part of the west
side of the harbour which it formed and two small islands were seen
lying off what might be termed the entrance of the bay which, from
the double lands, seemed to branch off in two arms, one to the NE
and the other NW.</p>

<p>We much lamented it not being in our power to determine this, or
ascertain the situation of the points of land with each other by
keeping close in shore, which one could have done, as we had the
wind, but having a convoy of heavy sailing ships with us it would
have been dangerous.</p>

<p>This appearance of a harbour, which we so particularly noticed,
lies to the westward of the peaked hill and appears to be formed on
the east side by the land, under a remarkable ragged high hill to
the westward of the peak. When that hill bears from NNE to N and
when it bears NW the whole appearance of the bay is shut in by a
point projecting from the land to the westward.</p>

<p>The land in general is moderately high, the coast rocky and
apparently steep too. The country inland from the South West Cape
appears barren.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 54]</p>

<p>We did not see a tree between it and the land about the South
Cape, the top part of which, and all the land to the eastward, is
covered with trees thick together, some growing a considerable
height before they branch.</p>

<p>The coast about the South Cape is a dark rock and, towards the
pitch of it, has a large notch which shows when you are to the
westward of it. There appears, just to the eastward of this point,
another projecting point covered with trees, but the land between
falling rather to the northward, I set down the first as the South
Cape of Van Diemens Land, a little to the westward of which is a
very remarkable white patch in the rocks near the sea.</p>

<p>The peaked hill is also a good mark for knowing the South Cape,
but I do not know a better, than that there are not any high trees
on the hills to the westward of it, that we could see.</p>

<p>The wind continued westerly all day, very fresh, and fell little
wind in the evening at 10. It was variable mostly between the
northern and east. We had luckily got to the eastward of Swilly
when the westerly wind left us and, being well in with the main
land, were enabled to carry the convoy clear to the eastward of all
danger from the rocks of Swilly and the Eddystone, both of which we
saw the next morning at daylight, both in one bearing WSW 4 or 5
leagues.</p>

<p>As we passed along the shore after dark fires were seen to the
eastward of, and about, the South Cape, and between the South and
South West Capes. We saw snow on the high peaked hill as we
passed.</p>

violent and came on with remarkable loud thunder and strong
lightening with very heavy rain. It lasted half an hour. The

of the [sun] and [moon], the mean of which gave 152º48'E, and of
those taken by Captain Hunter, 152º44'E, which was 1½º to the
eastward of account since leaving Van Diemen's Land. We suppose
this was occasioned by a strong set from between the Schouten

<p class="date-jnl">19 January 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 19th. Fresh breezes from the SE at 7pm. Brought to,
not having made the land. AM moderate and clear. At daylight saw
the land bearing W by N. At 10 were abreast of some remarkable
white sand hills, having much the appearance of white cliffs. At
noon were in 34º30'S. Saw red point (so named by Captain Cook) with
a small island on with it W½N, 4 leagues.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 57]</p>

<p>The round hill mentioned by Captain Cook, as like the crown of a
hat, bore W by N, the northern extreme of land N 10 leaguess.</p>

<p>A very remarkable clump of trees, like those on Portsdown, were
seen at noon N by W. Red point may very readily be known by Captain
Cook's remarks, viz. the round hill a little to the northward of
it; but it is necessary to observe that there are two islands near
it and that the land to the northward of the red land forming the
point, is very white.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 January 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 20th. At 2pm saw the white cliffs mentioned by Captain
Cook to be 10 miles to the southward of Botany Bay. I do not
altogether think it a certain mark for knowing when you are near
Botany Bay, there being many white sand hills that show like
cliffs, coming up the coast. The land from these white cliffs, to
the northward, is tolerably even.</p>

<p>At 4, saw the entrance of Botany Bay appearing in the middle of
land, that showed like an island lying a small distance from the
shore. We saw the neck of land by which it is joined to the other
land when 8 or 9 miles to the southward of the entrance of Botany
Bay. It has a sandy beach, the shore covered with wood. In the
sandy beach is the appearance of a gully or opening.</p>

<p>The land about the entrance of Botany Bay appears in hummocks
and rocky and, with a glass, Point Solander, the south point of the
bay, may be seen like a perpendicular notch cut in the rocks, near
the middle of the land, like an island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 58]</p>

<p>Those cliffs, 10 miles to the southward of Botany Bay, make in 5
cliffs as you come near abreast of them, and the Portsdown clump of
trees is on the northernmost of them, when bearing west, soon after
which that clump loses its remarkable appearance.</p>

<p>At sunset, the entrance of Botany Bay bore N.19ºW, 7 or 8 mile.
Shortened sail and made the signal for the convoy to pass in
succession, within hail. They were ordered to be very attentive
during the night and to keep their stations strictly, when we made
sail in the morning.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 January 1788</p>

<p>21st am. At daylight made sail for the bay with a moderate
breeze at SE and when within about 2 miles of the south head saw
the <i>Supply</i> in the bay and soon after the 3 transports that
had been dispatched under the command of the agent.</p>

<p>The master of the <i>Supply</i> came on board as we approached
the entrance. He informed us that they had only been arrived two
days, and the agent one day before us and the heavy ships. At 8,
anchored with the convoy in Botany Bay and moored immediately.</p>

<pre>
Point Solander SSE} in 8 fathoms water.

<p>We found that the Governor had, without much difficulty, met
some of the natives on the northern side of the Bay and, after
convincing them of his good intentions, they received some trifling
presents from him which they handed to each other without much
concern.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 59]</p>

<p>They were quite naked and had much the appearance of being well
disposed toward us. We saw eight of them setting on the rocks as we
came into the bay. They called to us. Some of them walked along the
shore and others kept setting on the rocks. The boats met with
natives in every part of the bay but no women had yet been
seen.</p>

<p>Captain Hunter went on board the <i>Supply</i> to the Governor
and with him visited the south shore, taking a guard of marines
with them. Near the place the Governor landed at, we saw several of
the natives, in small parties of two, three and five together,
frequently advancing and again retreating. The Governor advanced by
himself and laid down some presents for them, then retired. One of
the natives immediately advanced, picked it up and handed it to the
others, apparently pleased. By noon we saw that our people and the
natives were mixed together. The boat crews amused themselves with
dressing the natives with paper and other whimsical things to
entertain them, with which they were pleased for the moment.</p>

<p>Monday, 21st, pm. An officer and party of men were sent from the
<i>Sirius</i> to clear away to a run of water on the south side of
the bay. The natives were well pleased with our people until they
began clearing the ground at which they were displeased and wanted
them to be gone. At sunset, when the boats left the shore, several
of the natives came down to the water side and then went to their
huts.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 60]</p>

<p>Mr. King returned, having been up an inlet on the south side, 5
miles. He found the country something better than what it was round
the bay but not any water. Mr. King, seeing some natives on a point
of land, backed the boat to them to endeavour to have some
intercourse with them. One of the natives threw a spear at which
all the rest seemed much displeased, after which they came close to
the boat and were quite friendly.</p>

<p>They expressed a wish to know whether the people in our boat
were men or women and made themselves understood by bringing some
of their women down, pointing to themselves, our people and the
women alternately. As the men were entirely naked, they were
immediately satisfied in this particular by one person in the boat,
which served to convince them all were the same.</p>

<p>The natives that appeared on the northern side the bay expressed
the same wish of knowing whether our people were men or women.
After being satisfied on that head, one of them ran in amongst the
bushes, made himself a belt of grass and came dancing out with it
round his waist with leaves hung over it. They were much inclined
to steal any kind of cloth or covering and did steal some bags
which were sent on shore for hay.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 61]</p>

<p>AM, at daylight. The Governor, Captain Hunter, the master of the
<i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> went in the long boat and 2
cutters, to look into Port Jackson, not finding any situation at
Botany Bay fit for settling and particularly, from ships in the bay
being so much exposed to the sea in bad weather, as to render their
situation very dangerous.</p>

<p>Mr. King and Mr. Dawes were again sent up the inlet to determine
as near as they could the extent of it. Major Ross attended the
operations on shore and, as our settling here was not yet
determined on, it was not judged proper to land any of the
convicts, but the necessary works were carried on by the marines
and seamen.</p>

<p>Two of the seamen on the northern shore, straggling into the
woods without arms or anything to protect themselves, sailor like,
met with some natives, men, women and children who were very
friendly, met them without fear and eagerly accepted of a jacket
which one of the sailors gave them. They were all entirely
naked.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 January 1788</p>

<p>22nd. Clearing the ground on the south side the bay it appeared
worse the lower we went down and, in digging a sawpit, the whole
depth of it was little else but sand, and swamps all round. Some
dogs were seen with the natives that came amongst us.</p>

<p>When the seine was hauled this evening, several of the natives
were by, and when they saw the quantity of fish brought on shore at
once were much astonished, which they expressed by a loud and long
shout. They took some of the fish, which the officer permitted, and
ran away directly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 62]</p>

<p>Some of the officers going to that part of the wood to which
they retreated, occasioned them to stop and make signs that they
did not like to be followed, on which they were left to themselves
to walk off with their fish. We met with more success with the
seine than before, in a cove round the point, just within Bare
Island. In this cove we found better water and easier to be got at,
than any place we had yet tried.</p>

<p>Mr. King and Mr. Dawes returned, after having been, by their
account, about 12 miles up the Western inlet, without being able to
determine how much further it ran.</p>

<p>AM. None of the natives appeared on the south side, but a great
number on the northern shore. They struck the fish, as the seine
was hauled ashore, with their spears, and ran off with them,
sensible that what they had done was wrong.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 January 1788</p>

<p>23rd, pm. A black man was landed among the working party with
whom the natives were much pleased and they seemed astonished that
he did not understand them. They wished him to stay with them and
followed the boat that he was in, as far as they could. As the boat
left the shore they retired, apparently as well satisfied as if the
man of their own complexion had remained with them.</p>

<p>A great number of rats were seen and a flying squirrel. The
natives we met with here were of the middle size. Men wore their
beards long, their hair much clotted with dirt. They appear a
straight, well limbed people and very active.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 63]</p>

<p>The weapons they had with them were either a spear, a lance for
striking fish, or a club. Most of those we had seen have lost one
of their fore teeth, apparently drawn or punched out, and although
few were seen with the bone or stick across the nose, as mentioned
by Captain Cook, they had, most of them, the hole through the nose.
They all expressed great curiosity as to our sex. Having our beards
shaved and being clothed, they could not tell what to take us
for.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 January 1788</p>

<p>24th, pm. The Governor, with the boats, returned from the
northward, having discovered Port Jackson to be an exceeding fine
harbour with many coves all forming inner harbours, the soil far
preferable to that at Botany Bay and in some parts a good soil, and
well supplied with water. These discoveries at once determined the
Governor to remove the ships as soon as possible and proceed
himself in the <i>Supply</i> immediately, for which purpose a
proportion of convicts and guard of marines were ordered to go with
the <i>Supply</i>.</p>

<p>AM. At daylight, two strange sail appeared in the offing, which
prevented the Governor proceeding in the <i>Supply</i>, he wishing
to first know what they were. The wind blowing strong off the land,
they lost ground every tack and were too far out for a boat to
venture to them. We perceived their colours to be French, at their
nearest approach.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 64]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 January 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 25th. The transports were reported ready to proceed with
the <i>Sirius</i>. The French ships were out of sight at 6 o'clock.
We received the timekeeper from the <i>Supply</i> where it had
unfortunately been let down on the passage to this place.</p>

<p>AM. The <i>Supply</i> got under sail with two long boats. At 6
the signal was made for the convoy to get under weigh, which most
of them did. The flood tide ran so strong that they fell to leeward
on which the signal was made to anchor. The <i>Supply</i>, after
having made several tacks in the entrance of the bay, finding the
tide too strong, bore away and came in again. At 9 she weighed, at
10 made the signal and weighed with the convoy but, coming on very
thick and the <i>Golden Grove</i> having parted her cable, at noon
made the signal and anchored again, the <i>Supply</i> clear,
without the heads.</p>

<p class="caption">'Entrance of Port Jackson, 27 Janury 1788'</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 January 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 27th. At 1pm were clear of the bay and steered for Port
Jackson. At 3, seeing that all the convoy were out, made sail and
at 4 were within the heads of Port Jackson, up which harbour we ran
about 5 miles and anchored at the entrance of the cove in which the
<i>Supply</i> was lying, and where the marines and convicts that
came in here were encamped. The convoy all anchored in and off the
cove before dark.</p>

<p>The entrance of Port Jackson is about 10 miles to the northward
of Botany Bay and is some distance within the northern extreme of
land in sight when without the bay. The best mark to know when you
draw near it, coming from the southward, is some remarkable
sandhills over a sandy bay, 2 or 3 miles to the southward of the
South Head. The shore from this bay to the South Head is high rocky
cliffs.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 January 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 28th. All the carpenters and artificers belonging to the
<i>Sirius</i>, and convicts, were employed clearing away the ground
round the encampment. AM, went with Captain Hunter, the master, and
one of the midshipmen, about surveying the harbour.</p>

<p>On a point of land in the lower part of the harbour, between
Middle Head and Bradley Point, we saw several of the natives on the
upper part of the rocks, who made a great noise and waved to us to
come on shore. There being a great surf we could not land at the
point we wished which, they observing, pointed to the best place to
land and came down unarmed to meet us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 66]</p>

<p>We, of course, landed unarmed, taking care that arms were ready
for us at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Having some angles to measure from this point, two of the
officers went to the outer point of the rocks for that purpose. The
others remained with the natives, who were all much disposed to
good humour and pleased with us.</p>

<p>On our landing, we observed some women at the place the men came
down from. They would not come near us, but peeped from behind the
rocks and trees. When the boats put off, the men began dancing and
laughing and when we were far enough off, to bring the place the
women were at in sight, they held their arms extended over their
heads, got on their legs and danced until we were some distance,
then followed us upon the rocks as far as the boats went along that
shore.</p>

<p>In course of the forenoon we went to a cove within the inner
South Head (Camp Cove), where we were cordially received by 3 men,
who left their women sitting in a canoe at the other end of the
beach. We made a fire on shore and dined in the boats. While our
people were cooking the dinner, the natives were amongst them
playing, looking at the boat, manner of cooking etc. and were
without any weapons the whole time. They laid their spears down on
the sand between the women and the place they met us at. When we
left them and rowing towards the point where the women were, they*
got out of the canoes and ran into the woods. The men followed us
along the shore*.</p>

<p class="footnote">["they" = the women? Bradley refers to "a
canoe" ealier in the paragraph. Ed.]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 67]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 January 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 29th. Landed on a point forming the NW or middle
branch, to which we were followed by several of the natives, along
the rocks, having only their sticks which they use in throwing the
lance, with them. A man followed at some distance with a bundle of
lances. They pointed with their sticks to the best landing place
and met us in the most cheerful manner, shouting and dancing. The
women kept at a distance near the man with the spears. This mark of
attention to the women in showing us that, although they met us
unarmed, they had arms ready to protect them, increased my
favourable opinion of them very much. Some of these people, having
pieces of tape and other things tied about them, we conclude them
to be some of those people whom the Governor had met here before.
These people mixed with ours and all hands danced together.</p>

<p>From here we went to Grotto Point, moored the boats for the
night and made a tent fore and aft the longboat, in which we all
slept.</p>

<p>AM. Went over to Shell Cove and left this branch, taking it as
reported by those who examined it when the boats first came into
this harbour. As we left this branch we met several canoes with one
man in each of them. They had so much confidence in us as to come
close alongside our boats. After fixing the place of the rock and
extent of the shoal water round it, we went into the north arm.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 68]</p>

<p>As we were going in to the first cove on the east side, called
Spring Cove, we were joined by 3 canoes with one man in each. They
hauled their canoes up and met us on the beach, leaving their
spears in the canoes. We were soon joined by a dozen of them and
found three amongst them with trinkets etc. hanging about them,
that had been given to them a week before by the Governor on his
first visit to this place.</p>

<p>Our people and these mixed together and were quite sociable,
dancing and otherwise amusing them. One of our people combed their
hair, with which they were much pleased. Several women appeared at
a distance, but we could not prevail on the men to bring them near
us.</p>

<p>We had here an opportunity of examining their canoes and
weapons. The canoe is made of the bark taken off a large tree of
the length they want to make the canoe, which is gathered up at
each end and secured by a lashing of strong vine which runs amongst
the underbrush. One was secured by small line. They fix spreaders
in the inside. The paddles are about 2 feet long in shape like a
pudding stirrer. These they use, one in each hand, and go along
very fast, setting with their legs under them and their bodies
erect and, although they do not use outriggers, I have seen them
paddle through a large surf without oversetting or taking in more
water than if rowing in smooth water. From their construction they
are apt to leak when any weight is in them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 69]</p>

<p>The man nearest that part of the canoe where the water lies,
heaves it out behind him with a piece of wood in the hollow of his
hand, still keeping his body erect as when rowing. They are by far
the worst canoes I ever saw or heard of. I have seen some so small
as 8 feet long and others twice that length. In these canoes they
will stand up to strike fish at which they seem expert.</p>

<p>The lances which they had here with them were one sort about 12
feet in length with 4 barbed prongs made of bone and fastened on to
the prong by a stiff gum. These 4 prongs are secured to the stick
and spread equally, about a foot in length. A smaller one, of the
same kind, and one with a single stick barbed at and above the
point.</p>

<p>The long spears are indented at the end, for to receive a peg
which is fixed on a stick, 2 or 3 feet long and which they apply to
throw the lance any considerable distance. The other end of this
stick has a sharp, hard shell fixed on it which serves for opening
shell fish, getting them off the rocks and various other
purposes.</p>

<p>The Governor's plan with respect to the natives, was, if
possible, to cultivate an acquaintance with them without their
having an idea of our great superiority over them, that their
confidence and friendship might be more firmly fixed. We could not
persuade any of them to go away in the boat with us.</p>

<p class="caption">'First interview with the native women at Port
Jackson New South Wales'</p>

<p>Having occasion to measure another base line, we landed at the
upper part of the northern arm for that purpose. While we were
about it, 2 of the natives came down, seemed pleased to meet us and
were much astonished at what we were doing. These people passed on
to the place where our fire was and mixed with our people. They
were neither of them armed.</p>

<p>Soon after, and as we were going along the beach, a man and a
very old woman met us. They stopped with us a short time and then
walked on to the place our people were at. This was the first woman
that came among us. She appeared feeble with old age, very dark and
ugly. We could, not from her, judge what the younger ones might be,
but we had now some hopes that, by the old woman coming to us, the
others who we saw on the beach close by the woods would allow us an
interview.</p>

<p>As we approached them they ran away and as soon as we retired
they showed themselves again and had a party of very stout armed
men near them. We used many entreaties without effect. The ladies
still kept their distance.</p>

<p>When we had done what we had to do, we returned to the boat,
leaving two of the officers on shore with the people who were
cooking, that nothing improper might be done by them as we had now
many of the natives assembled about us and armed and several more
coming along the beach. Two muskets were handed to our people on
shore and the other arms kept ready in the long boat. These people
all came among us and laid their lances down on the beach.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 71]</p>

<p>The old woman made herself very comfortable and was with us from
our first meeting with her. She and her companions expressed a wish
to know whether we were men or women. These people wanted every
thing from us that they saw us make use of or that we had about us.
We did not give them anything, in hopes of bringing the women among
us by keeping what articles we had to give them and signified to
the men that we would give all to the women if they would come from
the woods where they were sitting looking at us.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 January 1788</p>

<p>30th, pm. This scheme at last succeeded, for as we left the
beach to dine in the boats, which lay close to, the women came,
having a party of armed men with them who had each a green bough in
his hand which they waved as they advanced. They came near us and
sat down amongst our other visitors. The party of armed men stood
by them and never laid down their spears.</p>

<p>We made signs to them, that if they would stay, we would bring
them ashore some things, which we showed to them. We took every
precaution to prevent improprieties being committed by ordering the
people out of the small boat and Captain Hunter, with the 3
officers, went in her from the longboat to go on shore, leaving the
muskets in the longboat loaded, in case their might be occasion to
use them. As we approached the shore the women retired, on which we
immediately put back to the longboat, making the same signs as we
had done before.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 72]</p>

<p>An old man then called to the women and the greatest part of
them returned and came to the old man who walked close down to the
waterside as we approached. The armed men with the boughs posted
themselves together just by, and every one of the men now took up
their spears and kept them poised ready for throwing, standing
close to the edge of the beach and rocks when the boat landed. The
old man came to the side of her and wanted the things which we had
held out to the women, to take to them, which we refused and
signified to them that we must give the things to the women
ourselves.</p>

<p>The old man, finding us determined, spoke to the women and one
of them came in to the water to the side of the boat. We ornamented
this naked beauty with strings of beads and buttons, round her
neck, arms and wrists. She appeared rather frightened, although she
affected a laugh and seemed pleased with her presents. When she
retired, several of the other women came to the side of the boat,
attended by the old man. We ornamented these the same as the
first.</p>

<p>Some came without fear, others trembling and laughing,
hesitating before they would come, and some just near enough to
reach the things. Two of them could not be persuaded to come within
2 or 3 yards of the boat. To those we threw some things and gave
the old man some for them. The whole of this time the men who kept
their lances ready were silent and attentive to what was doing. Two
men were placed on a separate rock, we supposed to keep a look out
upon the long boat.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 73]</p>

<p>After having disposed of our trifling presents we went off to
the long boat. As soon as we put off, the men held their spears
carelessly and began shouting, laughing and dancing. We counted 72,
besides women and children. This was more than twice the number
ever yet seen together before, either in this harbour or Botany
Bay.</p>

<p>The men we met with here were, in general, stout and well
limbed. The women, excepting the very old woman, were young and in
general shorter than the men, very straight limbed and well
featured, their voice a pleasing softness. They were all entirely
naked, old and young.</p>

<p>The men had their beards long and very bushy. Their hair hangs
about their heads, clotted with dirt and vermin. Some of them had
the teeth of some animal, and pieces of bone, stuck in their hair
with gum. They are so dirty that it is hard to tell the real colour
of their hides, which I think is nearly black. Their noses are
somewhat flat and all those that we noticed had a hole bored,
through which they sometimes put a stick or small bone, but of all
this party only one wore it.</p>

<p>Most of these men had lost one of the fore teeth and their skins
are much scarred &mdash; not like those commonly seen from wounds.
This, as well as the loss of a particular tooth, is a custom
observed amongst them, that we cannot yet learn the reason for.
They walk very upright and very much with their hands behind them.
Most of the spears this party had were a single hard sharp pointed
stick secured, as the others, with gum, to a long and light stick
12 or 16 feet in length, and a single barbed spear. The former they
threw at a mark, tolerable exact, 60 yards.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 74]</p>

<p>They use a throwing stick which is about 3 feet long with a kind
of peg secured on one end, which they apply to the end of the
spear. Keeping hold of the other end of the throwing stick, they
steady the spear and direct it with the forefinger and thumb. This
stick being applied, increases its velocity very much. Several of
these men were marked with streaks of red and white, particularly
the armed party that came from the woods with the women.</p>

<p>We saw two huts, a little from one part of the beach, but their
residence we find chiefly under the shelving rocks. The afternoon
being far gone, we left these people earlier than we should have
otherwise done, that we might sound about the lower part of the
harbour as we returned to the ships.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="feb88" id="feb88"></a>February
1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 February 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 2nd February. We did not meet with any natives again
until this day. At daylight saw several canoes in the cove we were
surveying. They all fled, some out of the cove and others up to a
cove (Lane Cove). We could not by any means get these people near
us. Having occasion to go to the bottom of the inner cove where
several of them had gone with their canoes, they thought we were
following them and pushed up a creek to avoid us.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 February 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 3pm. In a cove to the NW, 3 miles above the ship, we
saw several natives, some sitting round a fire. Others were just
landing with their canoes.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 75]</p>

<p>The moment they perceived us, they ran off in great confusion
and hurry, not taking time to make the canoes fast or haul them
ashore. These people had a dog with them. We found muscles on the
fire, others in their canoes and some dropped between both. Their
fright was so great that they went off without taking their fishing
lines, spears or anything with them. These we suppose to be of the
number who fled up the harbour when we arrived. We left strings of
beads, cards, pieces of cloth etc. about their fire and in the
canoes and were very particular not to move any one of their
things.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 February 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 4th, am. As we proceeded up the harbour, the natives all
fled in their canoes as far and as fast as they could. About 4 mile
higher than where the ship lay, the country was open and improved.
The farther we went up, and in most places, not any underwood,
grass very long.</p>

<p>4th, pm. Followed many openings to the NW and passed a narrow
channel into a wide space which would not be in our power to survey
before night. There was assembled up here an astonishing number of
the natives, all armed.</p>

<p>Flats on which the boats might ground in this channel, and put
us much in their power. Not having any people but the boats crews
with us, and being 8 miles from the ship, Captain Hunter thought
that taking the necessary precautions would employ too many of our
people for us to go on with the plan we were prosecuting. We
therefore returned and moored the boats for the night at Dawes
Island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 76]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 February 1788</p>

<p>5th, am. Went into the SW branch. Found it terminates in snug
coves, surrounded with mangroves, rather shoal water.</p>

<p>5th, pm. Returned to the ship. At daylight, having a guard of
marines, proceeded to the upper part of the harbour again, passed
several natives in the coves as we went up and some on shore near
the place where we left the beads and other things, who followed
along the rocks calling to us. We landed to cook our breakfast on
the opposite shore to them (Breakfast Point).</p>

<p>We made signs to them to come over and waved green boughs, soon
after which 7 of them came over in two canoes and landed near our
boats. They left their spears in the canoes and came to us. We tied
beads etc. about them and left them our fire to dress their
muscles, which they went about as soon as our boats put off.</p>

<p>At noon, we were far enough to see the termination of the
harbour as far as navigable for ships, being all flats above us
with narrow passages that we supposed might run a considerable
distance but very shoal. As we returned to the ship we saw natives
in almost every part of the harbour, in small parties. In one of
the coves we found a piece of a cake which appeared to be made of
the wild fig. We saw them chiefly in small parties and, to
appearance, have not any fixed habitation, moving about the harbour
as they find will afford them the best means of subsistence in the
north arm.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 77]</p>

<p>I suppose them to be a people inhabiting that part of the
harbour. This I judge from the number of women and children that
were with them and the appearance of their being governed by a
chief, from the attention they paid to the old man at our interview
with the women. The party of armed men being selected and painted
on the foreheads and breast, and their being with the women when
they first appeared, shows that they were for their protection and
favours my opinion. We did not see anything of the kind in any
other part of the harbour or notice that one man held himself
superior to any other.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 February 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 6th. The survey of the harbour was finished in as
accurate a manner as the time would admit of, yet in a place so
very extensive it is possible for rocks to be hidden and holes of
deep water near the bluff lands to be, without our being able to
get exactly on them.</p>

<p>The entrance of the harbour is about 10 miles to the northward
of Botany Bay. The best mark to know when you draw near it coming
from the southward, is some remarkable sand hills over a sandy bay.
These sand hills are near 3 mile to the southward of the entrance
and from the point of this sandy bay, the shore is all rocky cliffs
to the inner south head. As you approach the entrance from the
southward, the heads have an unfavourable appearance.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 78]</p>

<p>As you sail into the opening between the outer heads, which is
near 2 miles across, steep too on both sides, you will see on the
south shore a point off which is a small reef made by the fallen
rocks, and breaks as far out as any danger can be (and a steep
rocky head to the WNW called Middle Cape as it separates the
branches.)</p>

<p>As you pass this point, or inner South Head, the harbour opens
to the SW in which reach of the harbour, and more than a third over
from a sandy cove on the south shore, formed by a remarkable green
point, is a rock which dries at half ebb and a flat round it of
considerable extent.</p>

<p>There is a bar of clear flat sand all the way from this rock to
the inner south Head, with 3½ fathoms at low water. It is not very
broad and when past it you have deep water between the rock and the
south shore, the marks for which channel are the inner northern and
south heads on. The marks for the Rock are the outer point of the
northern head just on with the inner south head and the green
point, on with a remarkable gully seen over the land to be close to
the outer south head.</p>

<p>In passing to the westward of the rock you will go over a flat
which extends from the shoal of the rock over to the next point
above the middle cape. There is 4 and 4½ fathoms on it and shoals
gradually to 3 towards the shoal which is a little distance. Above
the rock you may cross in 3 fathoms. As soon as past the point
above middle cape you have deep water and may anchor or work from
shore to shore. There is no danger afterward that we could
discover.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 79]</p>

<p>As you sail through this reach of the harbour, which lays SW by
S by compass, you will see two islands which, before you get the
length of the harbour, will open W or W¼S of you round a projecting
point, and a white rocky small island show itself right in the
stream of the harbour. You may pass on either side of it and about
half a mile higher up is the cove where the settlement is fixed,
off both points of which is a small ledge which dries at low water,
the greater part of it. The shore round both sides of the cove is
steep too.</p>

<p>With a leading wind I would recommend steering in for the land
of the middle cape which lays nearly WNW by compass from the inner
south head, and keep that shore on board until above the rock. The
northern arm has good clear ground and depth of water. The harbour
is navigable for ships 12 miles east and west and the branches
extend 6 miles north and south. It is one continuation of harbour
within harbour, formed by snug coves with good depth of water and
fresh water in many of them. Those coves above where the ships lay
were surrounded by mangroves and had mud flats at the bottom. Those
below had sandy beaches, most of them.</p>

<p>The entrance is in latitude 33º50'S longitude 151º26'E. The flag
staff at the settlement 33º51'S and 151º20'E. Variation of the
compass 10º30'E. Tide flows full and changes ¼ past 8 and rises
from 5 to 8 feet, much influenced by the winds.</p>

<p>We found fish aplenty although the harbour is full of sharks.
There is a great quantity of shell fish in the coves that have mud
flats at the bottom.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 80]</p>

<p>Oysters were very large. We found wild spinage, samphire and
other leaves of bushes which we used as vegetables. An island near
a mile below the settlement was granted for the use of the
<i>Sirius</i> to make a garden of.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 February 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 7th, pm. The lightening which had been frequent, and
very severe since our arrival, was particularly so this evening. A
tree was struck and shivered near the encampment. Six Sheep, one
lamb and one hog that were near the tree were killed by the same
lightening and others much scorched. The sentinel on post near the
tree was knocked down and lost his sight. The thunder squalls for
the last three nights were excessively severe.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 February 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 8th, am. Being the morning appointed for reading the
Governor's commission etc., all the officers attended. At the hour
appointed, the convicts were collected and the marines formed under
arms. The commission was then read by the judge advocate, and the
other public authorities, by which the settlement was to be
governed.</p>

<p>Besides the civil law, according to the method used in England,
another court for the trial of capital crimes was established by
Act of Parliament. This court is called a Court of Criminal
Judicature, to be composed of the Judge Advocate and 6 officers of
His Majesty's Forces by sea and land, the majority of whose
opinions to be the sentence, if not touching life or limb, in which
case 5 of the 7 must concur in opinion, before sentence can be
given.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 81]</p>

<p>The Governor has the right of approving all sentences and
mitigating punishments and of granting pardon.</p>

<p>8th, am. Two natives came to the camp. The Governor gave a
hatchet and several other things, but could not persuade them to
stay. A kangaroo was killed which was the first we had brought
in.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 February 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 9th, pm. The captain of the <i>Astrolabe</i> came
round from Botany Bay to pay respects to Governor Phillip and to
leave the French commodore's dispatches for Europe, to go by our
transports. We found that they had been obliged to fire on the
natives at Botany Bay, to keep them quiet. We also learnt from them
that they had lately suffered much loss at the Navigator's Islands,
from some offence having been given to the natives.</p>

<p>They took the opportunity of their longboat being aground to
close on them with clubs while others threw stones and forced them
from the shore to two small boats, which they luckily had with
them, or all must have fallen. They fired and killed many of the
natives but were obliged to retreat with the loss of the captain of
the <i>Astrolabe</i>, 7 other officers and 4 of their people, and
many others badly wounded. They broke the boat to pieces in their
savage frenzy.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 February 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 11th. A Criminal Court of Judicature was held on three
convicts, whose sentence was immediately put in execution after
being read to them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 82]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 February 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 12th. A boat belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, being up
the harbour, found 4 convict women straggling about the rocks, one
of whom made her escape into the woods and no doubt perished.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 February 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 13th. Several kangaroo were seen and a bird
resembling the ostrich.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 February 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 14th. Twenty of the natives came to the Governor's
farm. On seeing the sheep they exclaimed, "kangaroo." They would
not come nearer the camp. In the morning the <i>Supply</i> sailed
for Norfok Island, with Lieutenant King, a master's mate, surgeon's
mate and 4 artificers belonging to the <i>Sirius</i> and 9 men and
6 women convicts.</p>

<p>Mr. King had some sheep, hogs, poultry, seed and plants, with
tools and implements for clearing and cultivating the ground.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 February 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 15th. The Governor went with three boats, marined and
armed, up the harbour, taking the first lieutenant and master with
him. We were some distance up the harbour before any of the natives
were seen. The first party of them were 8, sitting under a hollow
rock round a fire. One of the men stood up and spoke to us. The
rest did not appear to be the least disturbed as they neither moved
nor spoke. We stopped at a neck of land to breakfast and we were
soon met there by a native, armed.</p>

<p>He laid down his spear as soon as he joined us, and had more
curiosity than any we had before met with. He examined everything
very attentively and went into all our boats from one to the
other.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 83]</p>

<p>In the long boat he sat down and, with the help of one of the
people, he contrived to manage an oar, though very awkwardly. The
Governor gave this man a hatchet and a looking glass which, when he
looked into, he looked immediately behind the glass to see if any
person was there, and then pointed to the glass and the shadows
which he saw in the water, signifying they were similar.</p>

<p>Another man joined us soon after and a third was laying off in a
canoe. Wanting to see him get out of the canoe, we enticed him on
shore. He had a stone, slung by way of an anchor, which he let go
just as the canoe took the ground. He stepped one leg out of the
canoe, keeping the weight of his body in its centre, until he had
foot hold of the shore to remove it to that leg. In this manner he
landed without any risk of oversetting the canoe. We next proceeded
up to the beginning of the flats, where we landed and went 2 or 3
miles into the country, found the trees a considerable distance
apart and the soil, in general, good; grass very long and no
underwood.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 February 1788</p>

<p>16th. At 1pm returned to the boats and, after dinner, went in
the smallest boat over the flats, past a mangrove island and
followed a creek some distance to the westward, when it branched
away to the NW and SW which last we followed 4 miles as near as we
could judge.</p>

<p>The lake, or drain, is very shoal, and where we stopped was
entirely filled up with fallen trees from both sides. The water
falling fast, we had barely time to get down boats which, when we
first returned to the ship, a marine was missing in the woods.</p>

<p>AM. In a cove where our people were hauling the seine, the
natives, men and women, joined them and assisted, for which they
had some fish given them and were very thankful.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 February 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 17th, am. The marine that lost himself came in. He met
with several of the natives, who were all very friendly. They
wanted his musket, but did not offer to take it by force when he
refused to let them have it. He saw a great number of kangaroo, one
of which he killed and brought to the camp with him.</p>

<p>Three people belonging to the French ships came over from Botany
Bay. They met with but few of the natives. We found that the
natives at Botany Bay had been endeavouring to steal several things
from them, which obliged them to fire on them once or twice.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 February 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 18th. Several of the natives appeared on the points of
land near where the ship lay. The fishing boat coming past them put
ashore and gave them some fish which they eagerly accepted.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 February 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 19th. Governor Phillip removed from the ship and took
up his residence on shore.</p>

<p>AM. Several of the natives came down the harbour and kept in a
bay near the ship. Seven of them in 4 canoes passed through the
cove between the <i>Sirius</i> and transports and went close past
one of our boats with great confidence.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 85]</p>

<p>One of them landed on the east point of Sydney Cove to meet some
of our people who were there. From this they went to our Garden
Island and found means to steal two iron shovels and a pick axe.
The pick axe, the gardeners obliged them to bring back and lay it,
themselves, in the very spot they had taken it from. The shovels
they escaped with, but not without their skin being well peppered
with small shot.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 February 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 20th. Several canoes passed the ship, in which were
women and children. They stayed all night on a point close to the
ship and then went down the harbour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 February 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 21st. Having had a great deal of dry, hot weather it
was observed that several of the streams of fresh water had stopped
and others run very slow. Some of the officers of the
<i>Boussole</i> came from Botany Bay to visit the Governor. They
inform us that the natives are exceedingly troublesome there and
that wherever they meet an unarmed man they attack him.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 February 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 23. A general muster of the convicts discovered that 9
men and 1 woman were still missing. The woman is the same that ran
into the woods the 12th when our boat took her 3 companions
straggling. This afternoon the left arm and hand of a white man or
woman floated past the ship; had the appearance of having been a
considerable time in the water.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 86]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 February 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 25th. Our fishing boat met with a great number of canoes
in the cove where they went to haul the seine, in several of which
were women fishing, who felt no kind of interruption from our boat
being amongst them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 February 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 26th. Captain Hunter went to Botany Bay in the longboat
to visit the French officers.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 February 1788</p>

<p>27th. Three convicts were condemned to death by a criminal court
for stealing provisions from the store. The allowance to the
convicts had been this day increased and they were receiving such
addition at the time the theft was committed. One of them was
executed the same afternoon and the others reprieved twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 February 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 28th. The weather was such that our boat could not get
out of Botany Bay. Captain Hunter walked over with some of the
French Officers. At 6 in the evening the criminals who had been
reprieved were taken to the place of execution. They were pardoned
on condition of being banished from the settlement.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 February 1788</p>

<p>29th. The same criminal court met again to try the rest of the
criminals. One was admitted king's evidence, 2 condemned to death
and 1 acquitted for stealing wine from the contractor. Another was
sentenced to death for stealing provisions from one of the other
convicts.</p>

<p>At 4 their sentences were read to them and they were taken to
the place of execution where, instead of meeting the fate they
deserved, they received an extraordinary mark of the Governor's
lenity. He pardoned them on condition of their being banished from

<p class="date-jnl">1 March 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 1 March. The long boat returned from Botany Bay. The
French ships had launched their boats, which they had built in lieu
of those destroyed at Navigators Isles, and proposed sailing in a
few days.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 March 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 2nd. At daylight the Governor, with his cutter,
accompanied by the first lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i> in her
long boat and the master in one of the transport's long boat, with
a party of marines in addition to the boats' crews, left for the
purpose of examining Broken Bay, victualled for seven days.</p>

<p>The long boat in which the master was, proved so very heavy and
unhandy, that we waited in Spring Cove until she came up with us
and cleared her. The Governor took the master into his boat and
sent back that longboat. We were met in this cove by several of the
natives. A woman who was fishing in a canoe, landed with very
little persuasion. She was excessively ugly and very big with
child. There being many women fishing in their canoes about the
cove, the Governor did not give anything to the men.</p>

<p>None of the other women came ashore, but all came alongside our
boats with their canoes. The men kept on the beach. The generality
of this party of women were old, ugly and ill-shaped. The Governor
here exchanged a straw hat for a spear which, when he was taking it
to our boat, another of them took hold of it, on which the man who
had the hat ran to him and explained that it had been exchanged. He
let it go and seem pleased.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 88]</p>

<p>At 8. Went out of Port Jackson. When off the harbour, the heads
of Broken Bay are within the northern extreme of land. The south
head is fifteen miles to the northward of the North Head of Port
Jackson, round which head the coast forms a deep bight and has a
cove, or bend, where a boat may shelter.</p>

<p>From this the beach [the land] runs about three miles to the
northward to a reef of rocks, which break some distance out, and
round which is a bight with a long sandy beach, on which close
round this reef of rocks a boat may land, if caught upon the shore
and not able to reach either of the harbours.</p>

<p>All round this bight the natives appeared on the high land, from
this there did not appear to be any shelter for boats in any of the
sandy bays. As we passed the sandy bay next to the south head of
Broken Bay, we were met by three canoes, having 1 man and 5 women
in them. They came alongside of our boats quite familiarly. The
Governor pushed over to the northern shore in the cutter.</p>

<p>The tide set so strong to the southward, that it was with
difficulty the long boat could get round the south head. As the
evening closed, we lost sight of the cutter and as we approached
the northern shore of Broken Bay we made signals, by flashing of
powder, and saw lights immediately after, on the northern shore, to
which we rowed and found to be the natives lights.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 89]</p>

<p>We then hauled off and fired a musket, which was immediately
answered, and we soon saw the cutter and at 9 at night moored the
boats in a cove on the northern side of the bay, off which the surf
broke violently.</p>

<p>When the cutter first landed, they were met by a great number of
the natives, men, women and children. The men were all armed with
spears, clubs, stone hatchets and wooden swords. They were all very
friendly and, when the long boat landed, were without arms. We
passed the night in this cove on board the boats, everybody.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 March 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 3rd. At daylight we went into the northern branch of the
harbour, which has a shoal and narrow entrance, just within which
we stopped. Found the natives familiar. They had several huts here
which were merely small sticks placed against each other and
covered over with bark. In these huts were several women, old and
young. They were much terrified at first, but soon were composed
and familiar on having presents made them. They had several
crayfish about these huts.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up this branch, after passing a very shoal flat
and two or three coves, we found the set out so strong that we
could not pull ahead through between two projecting points, on
which we landed in a cove adjacent. Here we were met by several
natives, men and women, who all came freely about us.</p>

<p>All the women we met with in this bay, 2 only excepted, had lost
two joints of the little finger on the left hand, which custom,
like others, we are at a loss to account for. It was supposed by
some to be the pledge on the marriage ceremony, or on their having
children.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 90]</p>

<p>I cannot agree in that opinion as one of the exceptions was an
old woman who had had children and the other a young woman who had
not.</p>

<p class="caption">'View in Broken Bay New South Wales, March

<p>The others, who had all been subject to this custom, were of
both descriptions, old and young. This was not observed at Port
Jackson as a custom among them but noticed in some and supposed to
have been done by accident. We found most of the women had the hole
bored through the nose, the same as the men. When the tide had
slackened, we pushed up and found several small inlets between
mangroves, on one of which islands we stopped and pitched the
tents. Had very hard rain all the morning</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 March 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 4th, pm. While the tents and clothes were drying, some
of the natives landed and were easily kept at a proper distance
from the clothes. A crab was caught and proved very good.</p>

<p>am At daylight proceeded up and found it to be an extensive and
very shoal piece of water, too much so for the boats to go over the
flats without the risk of being left dry on the ebb tide. We found
natives all the way up. Not being able to determine the extent of
this piece of water, we returned to the cove in which we first
stopped, where we found a straw hat and some strings of beads,
which favours the opinion of their not having any fixed residence,
as nothing of that kind had been given them here and several were
both at Port Jackson and at Botany Bay. After staying a short time
here we went over to the south side of the bay into the SW arm, off
which is an island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 91]</p>

<p>We moored the boats about three miles up this branch. We had
heavy rain, thunder and lightening all night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 March 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 5th, am. Followed the SW arm up to the head and found
several coves and good depth of water all the way up, which I
suppose to be about seven miles. We left two openings to the
southward, without looking into them, and left this arm without
examining a large opening to the NW, out of it about a mile and
half above the island.</p>

<p>We went into the south arm and were caught suddenly by a thunder
squall and had much difficulty in getting in.</p>

<p>In a cove just within the entrance we were met by an old man and
boy. He had a stone in his hand, which he laid down as he came
towards us. He showed us the best landing place, brought us a stick
of fire and some water, signifying to us that the rain was very
cold. We gave them fish and the Governor exchanged some things for
spears. This man was but little scarred about the body.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 March 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 6pm. Continuing to rain we secured everything for the
night. The old man was with us until the evening.</p>

<p>am Went up this arm and saw several of the natives in every
cove. The old man and boy followed us round to one of the coves and
showed us water. We stopped in a cove on the east side about three
miles up. Several women in canoes were fishing, two of them came
ashore, the one an old and ugly, the other a young woman, tall, and
was the handsomest woman I have seen amongst them.</p>

<p>She was very big with child. Her fingers were complete, as were
those of the Old Woman.</p>

<p class="caption">'North arm of Broken Bay, New South Wales, from
an island at the entrance, September, 1789'</p>

<p>One of the women made a fishing hook while we were by her, from
the inside of what is commonly called the pearl oyster shell, by
rubbing it down on the rocks until thin enough and then cutting it
circular with another. She shaped the hook with a sharp point,
rather bent in, and not bearded or barbed.</p>

<p>In this cove we met with a kernel, which they prepare and give
their children. I have seen them eat it themselves. They are a kind
of nut growing in bunches somewhat like a pine top, and are
poisonous without being properly prepared, the method of doing
which we did not learn from them. Hard rain the greatest part of
these 24 hours.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 March 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 7. We were at the upper part of the south arm and found
in every part of it very good depth of water, except a flat at the
entrance from the east point two thirds of the way over, between
which and the western shore is a channel with three fathoms at low
water, and that depth close to the rocks. The land on the east side
of this arm is, in general, good and clear. On the west side all
rocks, and thick woods.</p>

<p>AM. Left the southern arm and went again into the SW arm to look
into that opening to the NW. Found but few of the natives in it. We
landed on an island about two miles up this branch, on which we
secured everything for the night. Got a great quantity of mullet in
the seine, from which we called it Mullet Island.</p>

<p>There is long flat to the SE and a reef of rocks, round which is
the bay for hauling the seine. We found some huts on the island,
but only three natives came to us this evening.</p>

<p class="page-jnl"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[Page 93]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 March 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 8, am. Several of the natives came to us, painted very
whimsically with pipe clay and red ochre, both of which is plenty
on the island. The pipe clay is just under the sand on the beach,
round the rocks.</p>

<p>We followed this branch up to the NW some distance, found
openings to the northward and NW and on the west side of this
opening to the NW there appeared to be an island with passages
round it on both sides; but we only examined that opening to the NW
above Mullet Island, which was found to be very shoal, that to the
northward not having more than six feet water across the entrance,
just within the points forming it, prevented our looking farther
into it. About noon, having finished our superficial examination,
which was much hindered by constant heavy rains, we returned to a
cove at the outer part of the south arm. to be ready to go out of
the Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 March 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 9th, pm. The old man and boy came to us as before, with
several more of the natives. They had many things given to them but
that did not keep them from stealing. After dark the old man took
an iron spade and was going off with it. He was seen from the
longboat, pursued and brought back with it by one of the people on
shore. The Governor chastised him for it, which so enraged him that
he run off and very soon returned with his party, all with their
spears ready to throw, when a musket was fired which made them stop
and a second musket drove them away for the night.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 94]</p>

<p>AM. At daylight, the old man and his companions came to us just
the same, as if nothing had happened, and without arms. About 6
o'clock we left Broken Bay and got into Spring Cove in Port Jackson
at 11.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 March 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 10th, pm. Landed in a cove above Spring Cove and in Camp
Cove, in which last we saw several of the natives who ran away, all
but two. Those stayed on the beach and one of them showed us the
marks on his body where he had been beat and also cut on the
shoulder by the people who landed here from two boats. He made
signs to us that the barbed spear had been jabbed several times
into his shoulder. About 6 (pm) returned to the ship.</p>

<p>An emu had been shot while we were away and proved very good
eating. Some of the convicts, straggling into the woods, met with
several of the natives. A quarrel ensued. Who were the aggressors
is hard to say, but the convicts were, some of them, wounded and
one since dead. One of the seamen belonging to the <i>Lady
Penrhyn</i> transport, who had been missing some days, was found in
the woods by a man employed shooting for the Governor. He had been
stripped of all his clothes, not able to stand and scarce
sensible.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 95]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 March 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 11th. Were informed by the man encamped to get greens
for the sick, that the French ships were sailed from Botany
Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 March 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 13th. The Governor met the officers on the subject of
grants of land. They were informed that it was not in his authority
to do it. Pieces of ground, for gardens and for feeding their
stock, he allowed for present use, but not as grants of land.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 March 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 16th. Some of the natives came to a place where a party
of the convicts had been left to cut rushes and, finding them
unarmed, wanted to steal their tools. Being opposed they threw
their spears at the convicts, which they very wisely picked up and
broke to pieces. When they had thrown all their spears and saw them
all broken to pieces, they threw a few stones and ran away. One of
the convicts was wounded.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 March 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 17th. A man employed shooting for the Governor had been
5 days absent. He reported, on his return, that he had been taken a
considerable distance into the country by the natives, that he had
killed a kangaroo which they took from him, broiled it and ate it
all together.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 March 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 19th. The <i>Supply</i> arrived from Norfolk Island
having left Mr. King with the people and stores there and the jolly
boat belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>. On their passage to Norfolk
Island they discovered an island in latitude 31º36'S and longitude
159º00'E. Lieutenant Ball named it Lord Howe Island*. They arrived
off Norfolk Island and landed on the NE side of it.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Spelled "Lord Howes Island" in the
journal.]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 96]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">March 1788 [Previous day stated to be 19th
March. A few paragraphs hence is the 20th March. These interim
dates seem to refer to incidents on norfolk Island.]</p>

<p>The 2nd inst. A surge of the sea washed one of their people from
a rock where he was standing and was drowned. It was supposed he
had been drawn under a shelving rock as they could not see anything
of the body. They could not find any place on this side of the
island where the provisions and stores could be landed.</p>

<p>On the 6th they were landed on the south side of the island
where there is a small gully through a reef, which dries at half
tide, that will just admit a boat and is very dangerous when any
swell is on the shore. They had much bad weather during the passage
and the prevailing wind SE. They found part of the bones of a very
large whale above high water mark.</p>

<p>Pigeons and other birds they found plenty, upon the island. The
<i>Supply</i> called at Lord Howe Island on her return and got
several turtle. The soil on the island appeared good and there were
found a great quantity of ground birds which were very good and
easily taken.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 March 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 20th. Captain Meridith, up the harbour, met several of
the natives on the land opposite to Dawes Island. They were very
familiar and had many things from him, but after he left them,
dropping his boat along the shore, a spear was thrown that passed
near him. He levelled his musket at which they, perceiving, got
behind the trees. He fired a ball among them, on which they shouted
but did not all run away.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 97]</p>

<p>A convict, who had been out to gather greens with another
convict, returned having met with a party of the natives, who beat
him severely with their throwing sticks and then let him go. The
other escaped through a thick brush which the natives don't like to
get into.</p>

<p>An eagle was shot measuring seven feet from wing to wing, the
feathers black and white. A very beautiful bird was shot by one of
the officers, that seemed to partake of two species; the head and
upper part of the body the parrot, the lower part and feet that of
the pigeon.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 March 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 23. An Officer was sent to Botany Bay for the purpose of
seeing if any ship was there and how the natives were disposed. He
did not see any vessel there. He met a great number of natives, who
were all friendly.</p>

<p>A shark was caught this day, thirteen feet long and six and a
half round. After his jaws were taken out they passed over the
largest man in the ship without touching. The liver gave us
twenty-six gallons of oil. He had four hooks cut from within him,
besides that which caught him.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 March 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 24th. Lieutenant Dawes, of the marines, a corporal and 8
privates, were lent from the <i>Sirius</i> to do duty on shore, the
battalion being weakened by sickness.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 March 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 25th. The people employed making bricks were met by
some of the natives, who threw stones at them and ran away. This
day the <i>Scarborough</i>, <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> and
<i>Charlotte</i> transports were discharged. Being clear, these
ships, by contract, are allowed two months pay from their being
cleared, on account of their having a voyage to China to perform,
as also an additional sum on the ton to the other transports, on
account of their being discharged and not kept in pay until their
return to England.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 98]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 March 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 27th. Several canoes passed down the harbour, one of
which stopped to fish between the ship and the shore, with two
women in her. They remained until near sunset, but would not come
to the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 March 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 29th. Several men, women and children were fishing
abreast the ship, where they kept all day and landed on a point of
land near us in the evening.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 March 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 30. Natives as yesterday. On our boat going towards
them, they paddled to the shore and ran into the woods and came out
again as soon as our boat left them. We did not interrupt them
again. They stayed to the 2nd April and then went two coves higher
up. This party consisted of seventeen canoes with thirty people in
them. Some of our officers were on shore, on a point which they
passed near. One canoe landed and had some baize given them. The
other canoes all lay off.</p>

<p>The surgeon wounded and brought down a crow in their sight and
endeavoured to get the canoes to land, by waving the wounded bird
to them. Finding that they would not land, the surgeon threw the
bird toward them which, having recovered itself, flew away and
joined some others that were in a tree close by. This uncommon
circumstance, which could not appear to them short of our having
power to give and take life, astonished them so much that they
remained quite silent some time and then all joined in a loud
exclamation of wonder.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 April 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 3rd. Another party came up the harbour and occupied
the caves etc. which the former had left. [Our] boat went to them
with pieces of cloth etc. The women all ran into the woods, the men
remained and met our boat. They had several things given them among
which was a shirt. One of them put it on. This new skin he seemed
much pleased with, but appeared to be deprived of the use of his
limbs while within it. They could not be prevailed on to come to
the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 April 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 4th. Natives as yesterday and the former party fishing
higher up in sight of the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 April 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 6th. Some of the officers went to Botany Bay. There was
no ship there. They found that the inscription which had been
painted on a board and fixed on a tree, near the place the French
Abbé who died was buried, while those ships were at Botany Bay, was
torn down by the natives. The inscription was not so much defaced
but that it was copied by one of the gentlemen and the same ordered
by Governor Phillip to be engraved on a piece of copper and nailed
in the place the other had been taken from.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 100]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 April 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 10th. The Governor and party being in that part of the
harbour round middle cape, found an entrance round a long sandy
point into a very extensive piece of water, which branched away in
three directions and good depth of water, after having passed over
the flat at the entrance.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 April 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 13th. The Governor went down the harbour to visit the
coves in the lower part of it. He crossed the neck from the
northern cove and found, at the end of the beach at the back of it,
a piece of stagnate brackish water.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 April 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 14th. Captain Hunter traced the northernmost branches of
the Middle Harbour, to endeavour to know if they had any
communication with that piece of water found yesterday. The
northernmost branch was found to end in a flat, dry at low water,
and about two miles above it a large run of fresh water. This day
two natives landed on the point of the cove where the observatory
is fixed, but could not be persuaded to go into camp.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 April 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 15th. The Governor and party were landed in the
northern cove, for the purpose of going some distance into the
country and to examine that piece of stagnate water
beforementioned.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 April 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 16th. A boat went to the northern cove to bring this
party back should they return. While the boat was laying there we
walked across the neck, where some canoes were just landing, which
they did with ease although a very great surf was running. They met
us and walked over with us to the place where our boat was laying.
They stayed with us half an hour. Several women appeared at a
distance but would not come to us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 101]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 April 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 17th. Lieutenant Ball, with some of the Governor's
party, crossed the branches of Middle Harbour and returned to the
northern shore opposite to Sydney Cove. They left the Governor at
the northernmost branch leading to a large run of water, up which
they meant to go the next day. Mr. Ball found all the country he
crossed to be a jumble of rocks and thick woods, except one small
spot about a mile to the NW of the place he came to.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 April 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 18th. Went up the northern branch of the Middle harbour
to meet the party, which we did just below the flats. The Governor
had traced the run of water some miles and found the country, in
general, rocks and woods. The piece of water near the sea they
found to be a stagnate pool into which the sea breaks over the
shore in bad weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 April 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 19th. Some canoes landed on Garden Island, had some
things given to them and went away immediately.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 April 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 20th. Some officers went to Botany Bay and a boat was
sent without the heads of the harbour, from a report having been
made to the Governor that distant guns had been heard. The officers
and boat returned in the evening. Nothing at Botany Bay, or to be
seen in the offing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 April 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 21st. Captain Hunter, with the officers who had before
assisted him, went with two boats to survey the branches of the
middle harbour.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 102]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 April 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 22nd. On a point where we landed, found the earth
thrown up in the manner of a grave, which we turned up and found
the ashes of some deceased person and, by the burnt wood laying
near it, we suppose it to have been consumed on that spot. The
ashes appeared to be heaped together on the surface of the ground
and covered with earth. Some pieces of bones were found not quite
consumed, but too much so to know what part of the body they
belonged to. From a greater quantity of the ashes at one end than
at the other, I suppose the body to have been laid at length before
the fire is applied to the pile, and conclude that they dispose of
the dead in the same manner. Saw very few of the natives.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 April 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 23rd. Examined all the northernmost branch and moored
the boats below the flats leading up to the large run of water.
Passed several of the natives on, and fishing off, the Middle
Cape.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 April 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 24th. As the tide flowed we went over the flats in the
small boat and found many winding reaches with holes of two and
three fathoms water in some of them. As we went up we saw one old
man setting upon the rocks by his canoe. At about half flood we got
nearly up to the fresh water in the boat. When we returned we found
the old man with our people. They entertained him with dancing,
combing his hair and beard and showed him how to smoke a pipe. Two
or three whiffs perfectly satisfied that part of his curiosity and
set him coughing.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 103]</p>

<p>We gave him roasted oysters which he ate as fast as he could get
them and, on giving him a bunch of them roasted, he opened them
with his thumb as easy as we could with a knife. He got into the
long boat and examined every part of her attentively. All the
natives in this part of the harbour, except the old man, were very
shy and would not come near us. We did not find any huts; they were
in caves formed by shelving rocks. At the outer part they make a
fire which serves both for roasting their fish and giving them heat
during the night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 April 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 25th. A boat was sent to the upper part of the harbour
to attend the Governor who, with a party of officers and marines,
had been landed there on the 22nd to make an excursion to the
westward. Some officers, who had been at Botany Bay, returned. In
going there they crossed from the upper part of the SW arm to the
NW branch of Botany Bay, which they found but a very short distance
across a swamp.</p>

<p>They met several of the natives, all very friendly. One party
which they met at the close of the evening showed them a hut,
making signs for them to sleep there. They also brought them fire
and water and came to visit them in the morning. This night five
sheep were killed by some animal.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 April 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 27th. Officers visited Botany Bay; no ship there. They
met the natives in great numbers along the shore of the upper part
of the bay, where they slept near a large party of them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 104]</p>

<p>The natives were very friendly, gave the officers fish and
remained the night near them and parted in the morning, very
friendly. There were many women and children amongst them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 April 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 28th. The marines, who were with the Governor, returned.
A small boat was detained up the harbour, to examine a lake which
runs to the westward above the flats. The Governor had been several
miles into the country, all of which was found to be a clear open
country and good soil. They found a channel up the lake to a large
run of water, where there was a kind of slate found in great
quantities.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 April 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 29th. The carpenter was employed fixing new skirting
boards under the whales* and while the ship was on the heel for
that purpose, the white composition bolts and nails which had been
driven for experiment at Rio Janeiro were examined and found to be
very much decayed, being eaten into by [indecipherable word]
copper. Some of the iron bolts in the butts were also examined and
found but little touched.</p>

<p class="footnote">[The gunwale is the top edge of the hull of a
ship or boat. Originally the structure was the "gun wale" on a
sailing warship, a horizontal reinforcing band added at and above
the level of a gun deck to offset the stresses created by firing
artillery. <a href=

<p class="date-jnl">30 April 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 30th. At one haul of the seine we caught fish enough
to serve the ships company, hospital, battalion and great part of
the convicts.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may88" id="may88"></a>May 1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 May 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 2nd May, am. A convict was executed for robbing a tent
and some other convicts who had been guilty of theft, were flogged
at the tree while the other was hanging over their heads, to
endeavor, if possible, to strike these abandoned wretches with
terror.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 105]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 May 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 4th. Some of the officers, sailing in one of the boats,
met with several of the natives, who they mixed with and were very
sociable. The natives gave them fish and they shaved the natives in
return, which they appeared much pleased with. Several women,
peeping behind the trees, came forward at times and were ordered
back by the men.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 May 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 5th. A party of seamen from the <i>Sirius</i> were
employed hutting the women convicts. The <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>
transport sailed for China.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 May 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 6th. The <i>Scarborough</i> transport sailed for China
and the <i>Supply</i> for Lord Howe Island.</p>

<p>Thursday, 8th. The <i>Charlotte</i> transport sailed for
China.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 May 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 9th. An officer went up the harbour with proper people
to examine the slate up the creek above the flats. It was found to
be a kind of rock and slate together and not fit to work into slate
for covering a house or other use.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 May 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 10th. Many natives, men and women, about our fishing
boat. A shark followed this boat on her coming up the harbour. He
got hold of the blade of one of the oars and when shook from that
he went to the rudder and did not quit it until he was struck with
the tiller. The fish caught for several days past has been very
trifling, which we suppose to be occasioned by the cold
weather.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 106]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 May 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 11th. Officers at Botany Bay [found] no ship there. They
painted, on some conspicuous rocks near the entrance, that the
settlement was made at Port Jackson. They met with a great number
of the natives [who were] very friendly. During the night the
natives kept a continual noise and appeared to keep a good look
out.</p>

<p>Three emus were seen between Port Jackson and Botany Bay but not
within shot. A boat down the harbour met with several of the
natives who appeared to be very hungry. They had not any fish with
them and ate the salt meat which our people gave them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 May 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 12th. A party went up the harbour to the lake or creek
running to the NW above the flats. We went about 3 miles up, to a
very fine run of water. The country on both sides [was] pleasant
and the ground apparently fit for opening, with far less trouble
than any in the other parts of the harbour, and the soil good. A
little above the part where the fresh water meets the tide is the
place supposed would produce slate, but had been found on
examination not fit for working. We tried it as coal, without
success. Found a great number of cranes and other birds about and
above the flats, all very shy.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 May 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 15th. Some of the officers [went] shooting up the
Middle Harbour. On their return [they] landed in a cove where they
saw some natives, to whom they gave the birds they had.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 107]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 May 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 18. A party visited some of the coves down the harbour,
where some of the natives were seen. They were all friendly. They
seemed to be very badly off for food, not having any fish. At
another cove where we landed, an old woman with a child remained
with the men who met us. They had two fires under a very large
hollow rock. We did not find any fish with these people. They were,
most of them, chewing a root much like fern. We passed close to two
men on a rock, who were so intent upon fishing that they did not
notice us, nor did they strike a fish the whole of the time that we
were near them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 May 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 19th. Several natives were seen on a point of land just
above the ship. About noon four canoes with men and women in them
passed up the harbour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 May 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 22. A black swan was killed which measured six feet
three inches from wing to wing, all black except just the tip of
the wings, which were white. Two of the convalescent convicts were
sent out to get greens for the hospital. They were met by a party
of the natives about a mile from the camp. The natives attacked
them, first by throwing stones, which they were returning, when
they used their spears. One of the convicts escaped with a barbed
spear broke in him, entering at the small of the back, and was
obliged to be cut out. He reported that the other convict was
killed and that the natives had stripped him and taken the body
away with them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 108]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 May 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 23rd. Some canoes landed at Major Ross Garden up the
harbour. They stole a jacket and several other things which were
afterwards found in one of the canoes by some of the convicts who
followed them along the shore to the next cove, where they landed,
and we have reason to suppose that one of the natives was murdered
by them, but the proof could not be got. They were dismissed
without coming before a criminal court. Lieutenant Dawes was this
day discharged from the <i>Sirius</i> to the Battalion.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 May 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 24th. Went to the South Head, observed the latitude
33º50'43"S, and Captain Hunter 33º51'07"S. Saw several women
fishing in canoes without the head. They noticed us immediately and
made a great noise. We threw them a handkerchief over the precipice
which we saw them take up and throw by in one end of the canoe. Two
canoes came alongside the <i>Sirius</i> with little persuasion, but
the natives would not come on board. They had fish, bread, beef and
pork given to them, all of which they ate with an eagerness that
convinced us they must have been very hungry. They remained
alongside our boat some time and were shaved, which seemed to
please them much. They afterwards landed abreast of the ship and
stayed there all day.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 109]</p>

<p>A calf at the Governor's farm was found wounded by a spear.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 May 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 25th. A hat, shirt and piece of a jacket were found in
the woods and known to have belonged to the convict who was
reported by his wounded companion to have been stripped and killed.
The hat and jacket had marks of spears having passed through
them.</p>

<p>The <i>Supply</i> returned from Lord Howe Island. They were very
unfortunate in not getting any turtle and losing one of her anchors
there. The <i>Scarborough</i>, <i>Charlotte</i> and <i>Lady
Penrhyn</i> transports were all at Lord Howe Island while the
<i>Supply</i> was there. The <i>Scarborough</i> and
<i>Charlotte</i> sailed from thence together and the <i>Lady
Penrhyn</i> by herself.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 May 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 27th. A kangaroo was killed which weighed 140 lbs., the
largest yet met with. His length from head to tail 7ft. 3in.; of
the tail 3ft 4in.; circumference of the tail at the rump 17 in.;
fore legs 1 ft.; hind legs 2ft. 7in.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 May 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 28th. Went to the North Head to observe the latitude
but it blew too hard to make an accurate observation. We landed in
Spring Cove and found it an easy walk to the North Head. The land
about the North Head is sandy ground between the top of the rocks,
covered with a variety of brush wood and shrubs, some of which have
very pretty blossoms.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 110]</p>

<p>On our return to Spring Cove, we observed a cave in which there
was a man and a little girl. They were so intent upon the motions
of our people on the beach, that they did not see us until we were
close upon them. The man was not the least alarmed but the child
was exceedingly terrified and clung round the old man, endeavouring
to hide herself from us. The girl's fingers were complete. We gave
the man several birds which were shot. He just plucked a few of the
feathers, broiled and ate the birds, bones, guts and all, except a
part of the head and the feet.</p>

<p>A kangaroo was killed, that was found to have a spear broken in
him, a proof that the natives seek other food besides fish.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 May 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 30th. Observed the latitude at the south Head 33º50'42"S
and Captain Hunter 33º51'09"S. Saw several of the natives on the
high land. They were gathering a kind of fruit which they soaked in
water and sucked.</p>

<p>On our return to the cove where we landed we found a native in a
tree gathering a fruit of the size of a small pine and of a
beautiful pale yellow. He got it by fixing a four-pronged spear
over the stalk and twisting them off. It had a sweet taste. We
found two children, a boy and a girl, near the tree in which the
man was. The children did not appear frightened when we took hold
of them. The girl's fingers were complete, as were the boy's
teeth.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 111]</p>

<p>When the man had got a good quantity of this spongy fruit he,
with the children, walked along the beach and sat down by the side
of a pool of fresh water, to which place we followed him.</p>

<p>They ate, or rather sucked, the whole of what they had gathered,
frequently dipping them in the water. They then returned to the
place where we first met with them. They eagerly accepted of a gull
which we gave them.</p>

<p>On our return to the <i>Sirius</i>, we found that some of the
natives had been alongside and examined the outside of the ship
with great attention, particularly the figure*. They appeared to be
the same that visited the ship some days before, as they had been
shaved. They landed at the observatory point, stopped a short time
and went up the harbour.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Figure = Figurehead(?)]</p>

<p>Captain Campbell, going to the SW arm with boats to bring down
rushes for thatching his house, on landing at the place where two
convicts had been left with a tent for the purpose of cutting those
rushes, found the tent but not the men. Finding some blood near the
tent, he followed it to the mangrove bushes, where they found both
men dead and lying at some distance from each other. One of them
had three spears in him and one side of his head beat in. The other
man had no apparent wound but a blow on the forehead.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 May 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 31st. The Governor, with a party, went to the place
where the two men had been killed by the natives. The boat
returned, leaving them in a natives path which they meant to follow
until they met with the natives.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 112]</p>

<p>The officer who was in the boat called at the Lieutenant
Governor's farm as he returned and was there informed that a
convict had killed one of the natives some days before, by cutting
him across the belly with his knife.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that, this native having been murdered,
occasioned their seeking revenge and proved fatal to those who were
not concerned. They have attacked our people when they have met
them unarmed, but that did not happen until they had been very ill
treated by us in the lower part of the harbour and fired upon at
Botany Bay by the French.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jun88" id="jun88"></a>June 1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 June 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 1st June. The Governor and party returned by land to
Sydney Cove. He had followed the path to the NW arm of Botany Bay,
met with a party of armed natives of two hundred and ten. The
Governor and one of their principal people met unarmed. One of the
natives advanced to show a wound which he had received in the
shoulder, apparently with an axe. They were all friendly. The women
showed every disposition to be very familiar. A quantity of dried
fish was found among these people and bones which, from the size,
were supposed to belong to the kangaroo. Orders were this day
given, that no party under six armed men were to go into the woods,
on account of the natives being so numerous.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 June 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 4th. Being the first birthday of the King* to be
celebrated in this new colony, the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i>
saluted the rising and setting sun and, at the usual hour, 1pm,
with twenty-one guns each.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* George III (4 June 1738-29 January 1820).
<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom">Wikipedia</a>]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 113]</p>

<p>When the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> had finished at 1
o'clock, the transports, all except the <i>Alexander</i>, which
ship wore the agent's pendant, saluted one after the other with
five guns each.</p>

<p>At the Governor's house, after dinner, the county in which Port
Jackson is situated was named Cumberland, boundaries of which is
Broken Bay to the northward and Botany Bay to the southward as far
in land as a range of mountains seen from Port Jackson to the
westward.</p>

<p>The extent of the territory of New South Wales is from Cape
York, or northern point of the Coast, to the South Cape of Van
Diemen's Land and as far west as 135 degrees of east longitude from
Greenwich.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 June 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 11th. Went to the North Head to observe the latitude,
had a very good observation 33º49'23"S, Captain Hunter
33º49'6"S.</p>

<p>On the pitch of the North Head we saw a man immediately under
the overhanging cliff. On our calling to him, he answered and made
signs where the road was to come down. The rocks under the cliff
appear to be a large flat, with deep water close to the edge of
it.</p>

<p>On our return we were joined by two men and two boys, of about
fourteen years old. They laid down their spears and made signs for
us not to fire our muskets. They had a quantity of shell fish in a
net which had been taken out of the shell. These they offered to
us, eating one themselves at the same time. We tasted and returned
them. They walked to the cove with us and then went along on the
rocks up the north arm.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 114]</p>

<p>Several parties were sent in quest of the bull and cow which
belonged to the settlement, they having been missing some days. One
of the convicts having absented himself about the same time, it was
supposed he had driven them away. These parties were continued for
several days without success, in all directions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 June 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 14th. The Governor made known his intention of sending
the <i>Prince of Wales</i> transport to England. This ship had been
fitting for sea several days and was said to be going to Norfolk
Island until the question was asked by Captain Tench.</p>

<p>A convict was poisoned by eating some fruit which he got in the
woods.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 June 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 20th. Seven canoes passed through the cove within the
<i>Sirius</i>; 20 men, 12 women and 1 child. The child was carried
upon one of the men's shoulders as he passed. In a cove down the
harbour an old man was found nearly dead, with some young men and
women with him. He was lying on his back [and] appeared worn out
with age. They had a fire on each side of him to keep him warm.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 June 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 21st. A kind of fruit had been discovered here, a pure
acid, and [was] found very good in scorbutic cases. As we had
several people down with the scurvy, a party was employed to get
those berries.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 115]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 June 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 22nd. A shock was felt about 4 in the afternoon, which
much astonished all who noticed it. The weather [was] calm and very
clear and of moderate heat, thermometer at 58, the water perfectly
smooth. This shock was distinctly felt on board the ships in the
cove and by several people on shore, who supposed it to be the
shock of an earthquake. It was not noticed on board the
<i>Sirius</i>, which ship lay just off the cove, in the stream.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 June 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 23rd. The convict who had been supposed to have driven
the cows away was brought in and tried the next day for a robbery
he had committed before he absented himself, and was sentenced to
death, as was another convict for robbing one of the officer's
tents.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 June 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 25th. Several canoes came down the harbour and passed
within the ship. Some of the men came alongside. We gave them some
fish and several other things. They were much pleased and gave us
some oysters in return. These people seemed to suffer much from the
cold.</p>

<p>About half an hour before noon, those two men under sentence of
death were executed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 June 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 27th. A flying fox was killed that measured three feet
from wing to wing. This was the first met with.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jul88" id="jul88"></a>July 1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 July 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday July 1st. It having blown a gale of wind dead upon the
shore for 48 Hours, we went down the harbour to get on the high
land of one of the heads to look round that part of the harbour
which is exposed to the sea, for any broken water or foul ground
that may show itself in so great a sea.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 116]</p>

<p>We found the swell too great to attempt landing near the Middle
Head as we intended. We went to a cove near the land of the South
Head and walked over to the sea face near the South Head, where we
had a good view of the sea and of all that part of the harbour open
to it. Could not see the least appearance of any foul ground except
the rock marked in the chart and which was seen when the boats
first visited this harbour, and that shoal did not appear of
greater extent than we had before determined it. If the flat round
this rock was not a perfect smooth bottom, I am confident that with
the sea that was running it would break.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 July 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 7th. A considerable party of the natives were met with
about 2 miles from the Camp.</p>

<p>Tuesday, 8th. Went down to one of the lower coves and walked
over to the sand hills which are given as a mark for a ship coming
from the southward to know when they are near to Port Jackson. We
found a good path over the neck of land, and [it is] not half an
hour's walk.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 July 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 10th. The Governor's fishing boat met a great number
of the natives in the lower part of the harbour, as they were
hauling the seine. The people gave fish to all the natives, but
they were not satisfied with that. They closed upon the people
employed in the boat and took what they pleased, their musket
happening to be left in the boat.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 117]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 July 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 11th. One of the people killed a male and female
kangaroo and took a young one alive, which was sent on board the
<i>Alexander</i> transport to go to England.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 July 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 14. The <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Prince of Wales</i>,
<i>Borrowdale</i> and <i>Friendship</i> transports sailed for
England under the direction and command of Lieutenant Shortland,
agent for transports. These ships were all in a distressed state
when they sailed, both as to sickness, want of provisions and
furniture. We made a party to the South Head to see them off the
land.</p>

<p>They had a fresh gale from the SW and were soon out of sight,
steering to the northward. On our return we went into Camp Cove
where we found a man and two children who appeared to be starving.
We gave them salt beef which [they] eagerly took and ate
immediately. Whilst the boats remained in the cove, the man went
into the woods and brought in a root which he roasted [and] beat it
with a stone which he frequently wet with his mouth. When it was
properly prepared he gave it to the children to eat.</p>

<p>The man had many sores about him and was really a miserable
object. The boy and girl appeared to be about 5 or 6 years of age.
The boy's teeth were complete as were the girl's fingers. We saw
several women fishing near the cove, but they would not land. We
had two seines with us, both of which were hauled several times
without one fish being taken. Some birds were shot, all of which
were given to the old man and his children.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 118]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 July 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 17. Boards of direction were sent to Botany Bay to be
fixed on Bare Island, which is near the entrance, so that any ship
that may arrive there would be informed that we were at Port
Jackson. This party met with but few of the natives. One of our
boats down the harbour had several stones thrown at her on landing.
A musket fired at them set them off. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for
Norfolk Island with provisions and stores.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 July 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 18. Several of the women convicts met with a party of
the natives in a cove where they were employed. The natives did not
appear to notice the difference of dress but soon found which sex
they were of.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 July 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 27th. Convicts gathering greens for the use of the sick
were attacked by the natives. One of them got clear and ran into
camp leaving his companion to do the best he could for himself. He
was soon found by a marine who happened to be near, but not before
he was wounded by a spear which passed through one side of his face
to his neck.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 July 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 28. A sailor straggling into the woods met several of
the natives who threw stones at him and followed him when he
attempted to run away. He, with great presence of mind, stopped and
presented a stick at them in manner of a musket, at which they
stopped, and by that means he got away clear of them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 August 1788</p>

<p>August 7. The Lieutenant-Governor's house, which was a building
of stone and several feet above the ground, gave way with the heavy
rains and fell to the ground.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 August 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 10th. <strike>Two kangaroo were killed at one shot. They
were in the act of propagating the species which, from the
construction of their generative parts, they perform with their
rumps to each other.</strike>*</p>

<p class="footnote">[In the journal, the paragraph above was struck
through, with a single slanting line.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 August 1788</p>

<p>Friday, 15th. Fourteen canoes passed, going down the harbour.
Twelve of them had a man in each, the other two empty and towed by
them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 August 1788</p>

<p>Saturday, 16th. Several canoes went up the harbour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 August 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 17th. The Governor and Captain Hunter went down the
harbour with two boats and the first lieutenant and master up the
harbour with two boats, to examine all the coves and collect as
near as possible the number of canoes and natives then about the
harbour. These were met with 67 canoes, 94 men, 34 women and 9
children.</p>

<p>All those that we met with in the upper part of the harbour were
very friendly and one party of them which we met with took the
shellfish off their fire and brought us to eat. Those met with in
the northern arm of the harbour were not so friendly, for while
speaking with the boat in which Captain Hunter was, a spear was
thrown which passed about six feet right over the midships of the
boat. They immediately ran away and were followed by the charge in
one of the muskets which, luckily for them, happened to be only
loaded with small shot.</p>

<p class="page-jnl"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[Page
120]</p>

<p>Some time after this, when the two boats had joined and were
passing the same place, several women came down and used every
endeavor to entice the boats to land. As we were coming down the
harbour the master shot a fish of 1½ lb weight, in a branch of a
high tree, which we got and ate. This fish was in the claws of a
large hawk which, when fired at, dropped the fish and flew
away.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 August 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 18. A canoe with three men in her followed our fishing
boat up the harbour and came alongside the ship, but could not be
persuaded to come on board.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 August 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 19. The Governor, with a party, landed at the bay
nearest the sand hills, to walk along the shore to Botany Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 August 1788</p>

<p>Wednesday, 20th. They returned, met many natives and, on a part
of the coast near Botany Bay, was the remains of a whale which had
been thrown ashore, apparently a considerable time since. On this,
the natives were then feasting.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 August 1788</p>

<p>Thursday, 21st. Several natives passed through Sydney Cove and
landed with two canoes on the west point. Whilst these people
engaged the attention of the officer on one side, the rest went
round and, seeing a goat on the other side, killed it with a spear
and made off with it in a canoe towed by one of the others. They
were pursued, but not until it was too late, either to recover the
goat or discover the thief.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 August 1788</p>

<p>Friday. 22. The Governor landed in the northern arm to go to the
northward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 121]</p>

<p>Met a great number of natives there with fifty canoes.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 August 1788</p>

<p>Sunday, 24. Two boats were sent down to attend the Governor in
case of his return. They found a great number of the natives in the
cove, where they lay with the boats. They observed several small
parties join those who were first seen. The women came to the
waterside and used every means to entice our boats to land. When
the boats had been there about an hour, the men formed into two
parties and fought some time with spears and using oval shields.
Some fought with clubs and sticks. When they began, the women and
children screamed and ran about seemingly much frightened and some
of them came close down upon the beach off which the boats lay.
Some spears were thrown at our boats and fell so near them as to be
picked up.</p>

<p>One of the officers was of opinion that this was a sham fight,
from their holding frequent parlies and only one seen to fall. At
sunset when the boats left the cove, they set up a loud and
apparently contemptuous shout and came close to the water side,
except a party of very tall stout men, who remained among the long
grass and had the appearance of being chosen either as a guard for
the women or a reserved party. In this branch of the harbour we
have experienced that they have hostile intentions when they
suppose our people in their power. There were about two hundred of
them collected together during the time the boats stayed in the
cove, and all armed with spears and clubs.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 122]</p>

<p>This day a convict was examined who said he had discovered a
mine, which had some gold in it, but for some time would not tell
where it was, unless he was promised pardon and a sum of money.
Finding that he could not obtain it, he said he would show any
officer the Lieutenant-Governor might send with him, where it
lay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 August 1788</p>

<p>Monday, 25th. Captain Campbell went with the convict to the spot
where he expected to find the mine. The man led him away to the
land about the South Head and found means to escape through the
bushes. He returned to the camp by noon telling the Lieutenant
Governor that Captain Campbell was at the mine and wished a guard
to be sent to him. It was 4 o'clock before Captain Campbell got
into camp, at which time the convict could not be found.</p>

<p>In the evening the Governor returned, soon after which this
convict, the gold finder, surrendered himself, saying it was his
intention to divert the time until the return of the Governor and
that to him he would declare everything. In the mean time he was
punished with fifty lashes for his conduct respecting Captain
Campbell and then sent with another officer, who had orders given
him in the man's presence to put him to death if he offered to
escape or play any more tricks.</p>

<p>Soon after the boat left Sydney Cove he declared to the officer
that the ore produced was the work of his own hands from brass,
copper and a guinea mixed with it in a composition which he had
prepared for that purpose and that he had hopes of selling a
considerable quantity of it to the transports when they might be
just on sailing, and that he had not made any discovery, but was
persuaded by the woman who lived with him to do it.</p>

<p class="caption">'View in Port Jackson from the South Head
leading up to Sydney; Supply sailing in.'</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 August 1788</p>

<p>Tuesday, 26th. The <i>Supply</i> arrived from Norfolk Island.
Whilst she was at that island (August 6) a boat which had been
ordered to lay just within the point of the reef in case of an
accident happening to the <i>Supply's</i> boat then coming in, was
carried out by the strength of the outset so far as to oblige them
to pull across the swell to regain the landing place, in effecting
which the surf rose suddenly on her, the consequence of which was
[that] the boat [was] lost.</p>

<p>Mr. James Cunningham, mate of the <i>Sirius</i>, one seaman
belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, one to the <i>Supply</i> and one
convict were drowned. The other man who was in the boat, a convict,
saved himself by swimming through one of the channels through the
reef.</p>

<p>The accounts of the produce of the island are very favourable
and flattering to the settlement. The pines are said to be fit for
all purposes and of sufficient size to mast a first rate(?) with
the stick. There are several other kinds of wood besides the pine,
with which the island abounds.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 124]</p>

<p>Mr. King, the Commandant, is so sanguine as to expect that in
the course of three years the island would support itself. Landing
is very difficult and frequently dangerous, sometimes altogether
impracticable for days and weeks together. The boat in which Mr.
Cunningham was lost was before overset on the same reef and one
marine belonging to the <i>Sirius</i> drowned.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="sep88" id="sep88"></a>September
1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 September 1788</p>

<p>September 1. A convict at Major Ross's farm was wounded by a
spear being thrown at him from behind a tree by a native, who ran
away immediately.</p>

<p>It had been determined that the <i>Sirius</i> should visit some
of the islands near the settlement. Every preparation was made for
the voyage, but early in this month her destination was altered, it
appearing that a considerable quantity of the vegetable part of the
provisions in the settlement was damaged and that the produce of
grain was likely to be very small, great part of the seed not
producing anything.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, it was thought necessary that the
<i>Sirius</i> should land some of her guns, heavy stores and
provisions, reserving a sufficient proportion for a passage to the
Cape of Good Hope at which place it was intended she should take in
as much as could be stowed of such articles as were most wanted in
the settlement, where they would be distressed for some articles if
a supply did not arrive in the course of the ensuing season.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 125]</p>

<p>The latter end of September, 1 midshipman, 2 seamen, 1 corporal
and 5 private marines belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, 20 men and 12
women convicts were put on board the <i>Golden Grove</i> transport
to proceed under the direction of the master of the <i>Supply</i>
to Norfolk Island, to be left there, in addition to those people
already on that island, with Mr. King taking twelve months
provisions of all species, for the whole number of people.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="oct88" id="oct88"></a>October
1788</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 October 1788</p>

<p>October 1st. The <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Golden Grove</i> dropped
down the harbour, and in the night the <i>Golden Grove</i> sailed
for Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>Having passed part of a summer and one winter in New South
Wales, I shall give a collected account of the natives etc. before
we quit Port Jackson, from occurrences which have, in the course of
that time, come within my certain knowledge. In the course of the
last month, the natives appear to be very numerous and the fish to
come in great quantities into the harbour, from which circumstance
I still support the opinion of their not having any fixed residence
and that the fish, as well as considerable part of the natives,
incline to the northward during the winter.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 126]</p>

<p>What has been experienced lately in several instances of meeting
with the natives, has occasioned me to alter those very favourable
opinions I had formed of them, and however much I wished to
encourage the idea of their being friendly disposed, I must
acknowledge, now convinced, that they are only so when they suppose
we have them in our power or are well prepared by being armed.</p>

<p>Latterly they have attacked almost every person who has met with
them that has not had a musket and have sometimes endeavoured to
surprise some who had. We have also experienced that they have
great cunning, which was twice particularly shown in stealing a
goat each time. This they effected by a part of them engaging the
attention of those who they supposed might interrupt them, whilst
others speared the animal and put it into a canoe and paddled away
directly and by the time the animal could be missed they had been
gone too long to follow them with any chance of success.</p>

<p>The musket now seems to be the only thing to keep them in awe,
which when they notice we have, and they are disposed to come among
us, they are familiar and friendly. That some of them have been
killed by musket balls, both at Port Jackson by our people and at
Botany Bay by the French I have not the least doubt.</p>

<p>The instruments and weapons that I have seen are spears, some
with four prongs three, two and single, for fishing, the points of
all which are barbed with shell or bone secured to its respective
prong with stiff gum.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 127]</p>

<p>The single one is generally barbed at the point and at several
parts above it in the same manner. They are seldom without a spear,
which they use as an offensive weapon.</p>

<p>The sharp pointed end is made of very hard wood, two or three
feet in length and tapered to a point. I never saw any of those
barbed. This is secured, as are the prongs of the fishing spear, to
a long and light stick which they find about the low gum trees and
which they make to the length they want by lashings and gum at the
different parts where they join it, generally from eighteen to
twelve feet in length. I have seen them add a joint to the fishing
spear by letting one part into the other and use it
immediately.</p>

<p>I think the spear may be easily avoided if you see the man who
is going to throw it. In two or three instances when they have
attacked our people, their spears were taken up and broken as fast
as thrown. Those convicts who were killed were either surprised, or
held a contest with them until surrounded. They no doubt endeavour
to be assured that those whom they mean to treat unfriendly are not
provided with fire arms before they make an attempt and those boats
at which they have thrown stones and spears appeared to them
unprepared, but twice they experienced that the people in the boats
were perfectly ready although the muskets where not shown until it
was necessary to fire on them.</p>

<p>For short distances, and commonly in striking fish, they throw
the spear by hand, but other times they use a stick about three
feet long, with a peg at one end, which is applied to the end of
the spear. Then balanced, they just steady the spear with a finger
and thumb and apply the force of the arm to the stick on which they
spear is poised.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 128]</p>

<p>They throw it from sixty to ninety yards. I have seen them throw
it very true at sixty yards. On the other end of the throwing stick
is fixed a shell which they use in getting shellfish from the rocks
and various other purposes as we would a knife or chisel.</p>

<p>They use targets made from the bark of the gum tree and have
some [targets] of the outside part of the tree itself, when the
tree has been burned inside, which is here a very common practice
for getting the opossum etc. out of them, or some purpose we are
yet unacquainted with. I have seen their shields or targets with
the points of spears broken in them and some holes which had the
appearance of the spear or pointed part of it having passed
through.</p>

<p>It was noticed by the officers who were in our boats in the
northern arm of the harbour and present at a real or sham fight
among the natives, that they use the target for security against
the spear. The other instruments of war which I have seen are the
club, wooden sword and scimitar.</p>

<p>The club is three or four feet long, of very hard and heavy wood
of different shapes. Some are pointed so that they may be used to
make a charge with, as well as to give a very violent blow.</p>

<p>The sword is somewhat of the shape of the common hanger, with
the handle, or hilt, carved so as to give them a good hold of
it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 129]</p>

<p>It is made of very hard wood, smooth and sharp at both edges,
coming to a tolerable sharp point. They are from 2 to 3 feet long
and as many inches, or more, broad.</p>

<p>The scimitar is of the same hard wood, of a curve, with two
handles to it and appears to be used to repel the blow of the club
or sword and, from its construction, will as well as fend off a
blow, occasionally give a very heavy one.</p>

<p>The implements or tools which we found among them are very
miserable tools indeed, and they do not appear to have one which is
not absolutely necessary for furnishing the means of subsistence to
themselves, which appears to be their only care.</p>

<p>The stone hatchet is made of a hard stone, much like flint,
sharpened at the edge, secured to a stick about 2 feet long by
fixing it with gum and lashing, and is a miserable blunt tool.</p>

<p>The adze is made of the same stone and secured to a stick in a
similar manner as the hatchet, but of shape somewhat like our
carpenter's adze, but one hundred strokes with it would not do the
same execution as one with ours.</p>

<p>They use a wedge of the same kind of stone, with a junk of wood
for a mallet or maul. These tools appear all to be used in
providing the canoe and shields from the trees which, with such
wretched implements, is a work of great labour. They cut the bark
round to the length they want and enter the wedges, leaving it in
that state some time, before they take it off altogether.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 130]</p>

<p>Many of them have been met with and several times seen at work
on the canoe and shield. Some have been considerably above the
reach of any man. They notch the trees to enable them to get up for
this and other purposes.</p>

<p>The canoes we met with are by far the worst I ever heard of,
being nothing more than a piece of bark gathered up and lashed at
both ends, with spreaders of small sticks inside by way of thwarts.
I have seen them from 10 to upwards of 20 feet in length and
observe that, when employed fishing, have seldom more than two
people in them. When moving their station I have seen 4, and once
6, in a canoe. We never met with any that had outriggers or any
kind of sail. We have met with them without the harbour between
Port Jackson and Broken Bay when there has been a great swell on
the shore.</p>

<p>They row with paddles in shape like a pudding stirrer about two
or three feet long, which they use, one in each hand, and take the
stroke alternately. As one hand comes aft, the other is applied
forward. I have noticed them, when in a great hurry, apply both at
the same time, which occasions them to stoop forward. At other
times they sit perfectly upright and are very expert in preserving
the equilibrium so necessary to prevent over-setting.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 131]</p>

<p>The men sit upon their heels with their legs under them and
their feet stuck out behind them. The women sit with their knees up
to their chin and their feet crossed before them. They all sit in
the bottom of the canoe with their face forward and they have
generally fern and some sea weed under them and under the fire,
which they are scarce ever without, in the middle of the canoe.</p>

<p>When men and women are in the same canoe I have always observed
that the woman sat forward and the man abaft. The women sitting
forward have their backs to the fire which occasions many of them
to be marked, which appeared to us at first like that of their
having been severely scourged.</p>

<p>Having fire in the canoe I take to be for the purpose of getting
fire when they land and for warmth, more than that of dressing food
in the canoe. I have seen them broil fish in the canoe once or
twice when alongside the <i>Sirius</i>, but in general they put all
that was given to them among what they had before got themselves.
We never yet got an opportunity of seeing the method they use to
produce fire and from their always carrying it about with them
suppose it to be a difficult process or a work of labour and
time.</p>

<p>The young children in the canoes are sometimes laid across the
mother's lap, setting between her knees and sometimes on the men's
shoulders, holding fast by his head, neither of which prevents
either man or woman from using both paddles.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 132]</p>

<p>From the wretched construction of these canoes, they take in a
great deal of water, which they throw out with a flat stone or
slate. Taking it in the hollow of the hand, they throw the water
out behind them without getting up in the canoe. This, for the
time, prevents the person who is baling from using both
paddles.</p>

<p>This method of freeing the canoe is very hurtful to them. As
they apply the edge of the stone, every time, to touch the bottom
of the canoe, that part wears away and, when into a hole, they
patch up with gum and sometimes use the leaves of the cabbage trees
with it, but from these holes enlarging they are frequently obliged
to lay the canoe by before the other parts are decayed.</p>

<p>They get in and out with great ease, though it is not without
great difficulty and attention that any one of us can, without
over-setting. When they land at the rocks, they lay the canoe
alongside of them, keeping fast by a piece of line. When at a
beach, or mud flat, they haul the canoe ashore after them or heave
a stone overboard with a fishing line fast to it, as soon as they
take the ground, to prevent their driving off. They frequently haul
their canoes up upon the rocks at those places, where the shelving
rocks afford themselves shelter.</p>

<p>In the summer the sea seems to furnish the natives good
subsistence, fish being then in great plenty in and about the
harbours, among which are the jew fish, snapper, mullet, mackerel,
whiting, dory, rock cod, leather jackets and various others, some
of a species which had never been seen by any of us. There are
great numbers of the sting ray and shark, both of which I have seen
the natives throw away when given to them and often refuse them
when offered.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 133]</p>

<p>We met with several fish that seemed to partake of the shark,
the upper part being that of the skate or other flat fish, with the
back fins and tail of the shark. This kind of mixed breed is also
found among the beasts and birds. The quadrupeds, the dog excepted,
partake of the kangaroo and opossum, many having the false belly
and hind legs and feet similar to those of the kangaroo. The birds
frequently partake of the parrot.</p>

<p>The natives strike fish with their barbed spears, from the
rocks, and sometimes from the canoe in which they stand up. In
general, we observe the canoe occupied by the women, who fish with
hook and line, which I never noticed any of the men to use, or that
the women use the spear. The line appears to be made from the
inside bark of the cabbage tree. It is made of two strands, well
twisted and strong. Their hooks seem to be made both from the claws
of birds and the inside of a shell resembling the pearl oyster
shell. From the latter I have seen a hook made. They rub it down on
the rocks until fit for their purpose and then shape the hook in a
curve with a sharp shell or stone.</p>

<p>We found vast quantities of oysters and other shell fish in the
harbour and oysters of an amazing size in the uppermost coves. At
Broken Bay we saw several very fine cray fish and one tolerable
size crab, but did not ever meet with either at Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 134]</p>

<p>For a considerable time after our arrival it was supposed that
the food of the natives was entirely fish, but the winter convinced
us that if they had not some other resource, great numbers of them
must perish. As it is, they are very hard put to it when the fish
is scarce. We have been several days together, without getting half
a bucket of fish with the seine, and having met some of the natives
in a most deplorable situation for want of food in the winter
months. At those times they will eat anything and have been seen to
take up the carcase of a sheep that had been thrown overboard as
eagerly as if the animal had been just killed. I have several times
met with small parties of them seeking roots and spongy substances
which grow on some of the trees and yield a small seed and sweet
juice which the birds feed on. The fern and some other roots they
prepare by moistening and beating between two stones, a
considerable time before they use it.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but they lay wait for the kangaroo and birds.
Many of the trees are notched, that has not had a canoe taken from
them, from which I suppose they get into these trees to seek or
wait for anything that may come in their way. About the open ground
where the kangaroos frequent, we have met with a kind of hunting
wigwam, consisting of two sides made of bark over some small
sticks, just meeting each other and open at both ends. In the sides
they have a hole or two to look out. The dogs hunt the kangaroo, we
have proof of, by one being shot close at the heels of a
kangaroo.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 135]</p>

<p>In an excursion made to Botany Bay, near the sea coast, many of
the natives were found feasting on the remains of a whale that had
been thrown on shore by the sea. They have no idea of dressing fish
any other than by laying it on the fire. One of them, very eager to
steal a fish which he saw in a pot at our fire in one of the coves,
put his hand in to snatch it out but the water being just boiling,
he let the fish go and appeared to be much surprised.</p>

<p>We found a kind of wild fig and notice that the natives use it.
They also use a nut which grows in clusters to the size and shape
of the top of the pine. One of the convicts was poisoned by eating
them. In what manner the natives prepare them I do not know, but I
tasted some at Broken Bay and thought them good.</p>

<p>We never met with the smallest appearance of any kind of
cultivated ground. We found wild spinach, samphire and parsley and
small quantity of sorrel and wild celery, all of which, with the
leaves of several kinds of bushes, were used by us for want of
better vegetables, which were not yet supplied from the garden, as
will appear from our whole stock of vegetables on board the
<i>Sirius</i> for her intended voyage was a dozen heartless
cabbages and as many young broccoli plants, and those the produce
of the Governor's Garden.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 136]</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival a berry in appearance like an unripe
currant was found in many parts of the harbour. A very strong, pure
acid and of infinite use in removing the scurvy from those on board
who had been attacked by that disease. We also found a plant which
grew about the rocks and amongst the underwood entwined, the leaves
of which, boiled, made a pleasant drink and was used as tea by our
ship's company. It has much the taste of liquorice and serves both
for tea and sugar and is recommended as a very wholesome drink and
a good thing to take to sea.</p>

<p>The quadrupeds we met with here, were the dog, of the common
size much resembling the jackal. The kangaroo, which is an animal
we have reason to suppose is not known in any other country, are of
a dun and reddish fox colour. The fur on the young ones is
tolerable good. The body of this animal seems to be of a peculiar
structure, narrow shoulders, the fore legs small and short, having
5 toes on each foot or paw, regularly placed, the middle the
longest. This animal is very large and strong about the loins, the
hind legs long and of great strength. They seldom use the fore feet
in moving, but bound along with great swiftness upon the hind legs,
in doing which the tail, which is large and powerful, affords them
much assistance. They have but 3 toes on the hind feet, one large
long one with a very strong nail on it, this is between the 2
others, which are smaller than those of the fore feet and 1 of
those has a double nail, which I never heard of being met with in
any other animal, and in this is general in the vast number shot.
There never was one exception.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 137]</p>

<p>[<strike>They also differ from other animals in having the
testes situated before the penis, which comes out through the
external orifice of the anus. The female has but one external
orifice within which is seated the parts necessary for propagation.
It is not ascertained whether they bring forth the young in the
false belly, or whether in the same manner as other animals, and
afterwards put it into the false belly to nourish it.</strike>]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the journal, the text in brackets was
struck through with a single wavy line.]</p>

<p>The teats are situated in the false belly and the young one has
been found fixed on the teat when just formed and not half the
length of a man's finger. The young ones of considerable size have
been found and killed in the false Belly.</p>

<p>The kangaroo have been killed from the smallest size to that of
160 pounds weight, the dimensions of which were from the head to
the tail 7 feet 3 inches; of the tail 3 feet 4 inches; fore legs 1
foot 3 inches; hinder legs 2 feet 9 inches; the tail at the root 18
inches in circumference. The head is much the shape of the horse's
head, small and rather longer, ears which turn right round and hear
the least noise. Windy weather is reckoned best for shooting them,
the woods being then in motion and making a noise, [which] prevents
them hearing the approach of any person. We think the meat very
good, having been so long without other fresh provision, but in any
other situation I cannot think it would be esteemed as such.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 138]</p>

<p>We found great numbers of the opossum, squirrels, rats of
various kinds, many of which partake of the kangaroo, the hind legs
and tail being similar, and the females of the opossum having the
false belly. The flying fox, or large bat, is common here as are
flying squirrels. The birds we met with here are gulls of many
kinds, black swans, eagles, hawks, crows, cranes, curlew, heron,
bustards, quails, cockatoos, parrot, and parakeets of beautiful
plumage. We found but few pigeons and met with a great variety of
small birds, extremely beautiful, and some of the birds most
unaccountably partaking of the parrot in some degree.</p>

<p>The ostrich and emu have been seen and one emu killed, which was
allowed to be very fine eating and the best bird in the country on
account of its size.</p>

<p>Many kinds of snakes were met with and lizards, iguanas,
terrapins and centipedes of an incredible length. One which was
justly called a millipede measured two feet six inches in length
and was taken on Garden Island. The ants and mosquitos we found
very troublesome. Of the former we saw a great variety. The sting
of the large white ant is very painful.</p>

<p>The natives that we met with during our stay at Port Jackson and
visiting Broken and Botany Bays, were in general of the middle
stature, very active, but do not appear to be that strong, robust
people which savages are usually found to be. There is a great
sameness in their features, noses rather flat, voice of the men
harsh.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 139]</p>

<p>The women have remarkable soft voices and the younger women much
expression in their countenances. They are very dark and keep their
skins so dirty that it is hard to tell the true colour of them.
Their hair is clotted with dirt and full of vermin, and as they
never wash themselves unless by chance or accident, the beauty
which many of them, from regularity of features and pleasing
countenances, would be allowed to have, is destroyed.</p>

<p>The men wear their beards long. Their hair, which is full of
dirt and vermin, they wear loose, or rather, clotted with both, and
sometimes ornamented with the teeth, claws etc. of animals stuck in
their hair with gum. Several of them have been shaved by our people
and one party, after having gone through this operation, came
alongside the ship again in a few days making signs that they
wished to have it repeated.</p>

<p>We never could prevail on any of them to come on board, although
they would frequently run all over our boats. Of the whole number I
ever saw or met with, there were only two who were not entirely
naked and those seemed to be lame, the one an old woman, the other
a young boy. Some of the women I have seen with a string tied loose
about their necks. The men have many large scars about their bodies
which they signified to us was done by a sharp shell, but on what
account we could not discover.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 140]</p>

<p>The men having lost one of their front teeth is, except in a few
instances, a general custom, as is that of the women losing two
joints of the little finger on the left hand.</p>

<p>All these customs we are yet at a loss to account for, but that
they are not a badge of disgrace or infamy is evident from being so
general and that they are fond of showing them to us when we notice
it. One of them in a party I fell in with, up the harbour, took a
deal of pains to show us the difference between the ornamental
scars and those from the wounds of the spear. He had three of them
in his body.</p>

<p>The inside part of the nose between the two nostrils, being
bored, appears to be common, but not general in both sexes. They
thrust a bone or stick through it at times, but are very seldom
found wearing it there. Several have been met with very
whimsically, painted with red ochre and pipe clay, both which we
find plenty of. They are great thieves, which is common among
savages.</p>

<p>In many places we found straggling huts, but I never saw more
than 8 or 10 together. These are, if possible, more wretched than
their canoes. They are made with small boughs, or rather sticks,
covered in a miserable manner with bark and leaves of the cabbage
tree. Their height will not admit of entering without stooping or
crawling in. They appear to live chiefly in the caves and hollows
of the rocks, which nature has supplied them with, the rocks about
the shore being mostly shelving and overhanging, so as to afford a
tolerable retreat to these miserable creatures.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 141]</p>

<p>And frequently after passing a whole day in search of food
without being able to procure as much as would make half a
reasonable meal, they make a fire at the outer part of these dismal
holes which throws a heat in, but so hard pressed are these poor
devils in the winter, that from the hours we have seen them fishing
with a light in the canoe, they are frequently without two hours
rest to themselves.</p>

<p>Hunger is so pressing a call that they cannot quit their
endeavours to satisfy it for any other enjoyment. In heavy rains I
have seen the women hold a piece of bark over their heads so as to
throw the rain clear of them, but I never notice the men make any
difference, only that they are not so active in the rain and appear
to be cramped.</p>

<p>To speak of the virtue of the ladies of this country, I believe
no one in the colony can boast of having received favours. Whether
they are bound by any tie, or their connections made by promiscuous
intercourse is hard for us to determine, it has been generally
observed that the men are very jealous of the women being among us
when we happen to fall in where they are, and that the women are
kept at a distance when we do not come unaware upon them, and a
guard with several lances, always ready for their protection, has
been usually found.</p>

<p>They are very impatient to revenge an affront, and very soon
forget injuries, or any offence that has been given to them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 142]</p>

<p>There has been two hundred of them met with together about
Botany Bay but, except that and the northern arm of Port Jackson,
they are seldom seen more than twenty or thirty and, frequently,
two and three together. That large body of them met with at Botany
Bay had a quantity of dried fish with them, which was the only time
that anything of the kind had been seen.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by a convict who absented himself and
remained some days in the woods, that the natives were cannibals,
and that he had seen a party of them eat the flesh of one who they
had killed. The authority is not good, yet I think that the
circumstance of their taking one of the convicts into the woods
with them, after having killed and stripped him, favours the man's
report; and that but a short time before he was executed for the
robbery that induced him to absent himself, he affirmed the truth
of his report. This expedient of flying to the woods for shelter
has been tried by several of them and they have found that they
have been obliged to return and be hanged or suffer the most
shocking death; that of being starved.</p>

<p>We have every reason to suppose that they burn the dead, from
the number of graves we have opened and seen. In those which were
opened, we found the ashes, with many pieces of bone not quite
consumed. The ashes appear to be thrown together and covered with
earth until raised, much as those commonly met with.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 143]</p>

<p>It was the appearance that led us first to open one which we met
with newly made. They do not appear to observe any kind of
religion.</p>

<p>The land on that part of the coast which we fell in with is
moderately high and the sea face rocky, with many sandy beaches
between the projecting points. Some parts appeared barren, others
pleasant downes, particularly that about the white cliffs to the
southward of Botany Bay, which we called Portsdown, from a
remarkable clump of trees on it.</p>

<p>The land over the sandy bays is, in general, woody, as is a very
considerable part of the higher lands. A great distance inland from
the coast about Port Jackson are a chain of very high mountains,
towards which many excursions have been planned but none yet
executed.</p>

<p>Towards the upper part of Port Jackson the country opens and is
covered with long grass growing under the trees. There are some
spots of clear ground round Port Jackson but none of considerable
extent until near the head of it, from which, along by the flats
and creeks, it improves and near the fresh water at the top of the
creek it is a fine open country and good soil.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 144]</p>

<p>To this part, which is called Rose Hill and is about twelve
miles above Sydney Cove, it is intended early in the present month
to detach a captain and company of marines, with a proportion of
convicts, for the purpose of clearing and cultivating that part of
the country, which will no doubt be of great use to the
Settlement.</p>

<p>The wood for building is not very good. The gum tree grows very
large, but the grain is so short that it is neither strong nor
durable. There is a kind of pine and a bastard kind of mahogany,
all of which are used. The latter makes tolerable good
furniture.</p>

<p>The stock brought to Port Jackson has turned to little account,
the sheep nearly all dead, the bull and cows missing, either killed
by the natives or run wild in the woods. Hogs, which appear to
thrive the best, will be lost for want of food, before grain can be
raised for their support. The cabbage tree affords good food while
it lasts, but there is great difficulty in getting it. All kinds of
poultry thrive very well and goats particularly well. The great
want is grain to support the stock.</p>

<p>To speak of the seasons and weather, from our partial trial of
both I have observed that the weather is generally unsettled at new
and full moon, at which times, on our first arrival, we had
tremendous thunder squalls. The wind frequently changes suddenly to
the southward in a strong gust and generally blows hard afterwards.
We have remarked also that lightning to the southward is an
indication of such strong winds coming, but I have frequently known
them to come on in a sudden gust, without a moment's warning or any
apparent alteration in the heavens. In moderate fair weather, the
land and sea breezes are regular and fresh.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 145]</p>

<p>We found very great and sudden changes in the degree of heat. A
shift of wind would rise or lower the thermometer 14º in less than
ten minutes on board the <i>Sirius</i> and, on shore, considerably
more. We observe a change in the face of the country as the winter
approaches, although the trees are not stripped of their leaves,
there being a constant succession, which we also found in the
vegetable production of the woods. But during the winter, neither
the grass or the trees have the fine green appearance as on our
first arrival. We found a very great variety of shrubs which had
beautiful bloom but scarce any smell in them.</p>

<p>The progress made in the new settlement, or what the colony may
promise from its present state, I cannot pretend to judge of,
further than that I think the quantity of ground cleared is very
inconsiderable.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 October 1788</p>

<p>2nd. Sailed for the Cape of Good Hope. We left the <i>Supply</i>
at Port Jackson, with the <i>Fishburne</i> and <i>Golden Grove</i>
transports, both of which it was supposed would be cleared and sail
for England in November. We had a fresh gale southerly, which soon
gave us a good offing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 October 1788</p>

<p>3rd. At noon, we were thirty-seven leagues to the eastward of
Port Jackson, a strong gale southerly, which continued to the 6th.
When in 35º22'S, 156º51'E it hauled round to the east and NE.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 October 1788</p>

<p>8th. Blew a Strong gale at NE and at noon came to the
northward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 146]</p>

<p>It was this day determined to pursue the route to the eastward
round Cape Horn, as the most certain passage from what had been
experienced by others in high southern latitude getting to the
westward, and particularly as the ship had sprung a leak the day we
sailed from Port Jackson and was thought the more unfit to beat
against the westerly winds.</p>

<p>From the 8th to the 11th, wind and weather very changeable, then
a strong western gale promised a good run to the eastward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 October 1788</p>

<p>13th. We passed the South Cape of New Zeeland at forty leagues
distance.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 October 1788</p>

<p>16th. In latitude 51ºS, 176ºE, we again met with SE and E winds,
with fine settled weather. These winds continued to the 22nd,
veering from SE to E and NE, by which we were enabled to make some
small progress to the eastward, although in six days it was only as
many degrees of longitude.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 October 1788</p>

<p>23rd. A Fresh gale sprung up from the westward and continued to
the 30th in 53º38'S, 203º45'E, weather mostly fair.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 October 1788</p>

<p>30th. It fell calm. We had a great quantity of birds about the
ship. In the evening a breeze sprung up which was very variable and
the weather unsettled.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 October 1788</p>

<p>31st. Saw several divers, small gulls and two sea otters.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 November 1788</p>

<p>November 2nd. In 55º18'S, 214ºE saw several whales, small gulls
and pintado birds*. This day the wind fixed to the northward and
continued to the 6th, hazy and rain, with some intervals of fair
weather.</p>

<p>In 227º30'E, the wind again came to the eastward with a clear
serene sky. Several pintado birds and gulls were constantly about
the ship. Three pintado birds were caught with hook and line, over
the stern. As soon as they were taken they threw up a quantity of
an oily substance. We frequently observed them to feed on some
floating matter, which appeared to us to be what might come from
the fish, and float about upon the surface.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 December 1788</p>

<p>9th. The wind again favoured us and blew strong, with hail and
snow.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 December 1788</p>

<p>18th. We were under a necessity of putting a stop to the serving
of essence of malt, having been supplied with so small a quantity,
part of which was kept at Port Jackson, and the quantity remaining
was now not sufficient for those who were attacked with the
scurvy.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 December 1788</p>

<p>20th. Several porpoises, striped black and white, were about the
ship and a great quantity of gulls and many pintado birds.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 December 1788</p>

<p>22nd. At noon, in 57º17'S, 280º10'E, saw an island of ice. In
the course of the day passed several more. Many whales and a
variety of gulls about the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 December 1788</p>

<p>24th. Had very hazy weather, with hail and snow. Passed between
several islands of ice. Gulls and pintado birds and a sea otter
about the ship.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 December 1788</p>

<p>25th. Passed several very large and high islands of ice; had
frequent squalls of hail and snow.</p>

<p>AM. Soon after daylight, several flocks of ducks and one of
geese flew over the ship to the northward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 148]</p>

<p>At noon we were, by observations of the sun and moon, taken at 8
am exactly in the longitude of Cape Horn and, by the meridian
observation, 10 leagues south of it. We hauled in NE by N.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 December 1788</p>

<p>The 26th at 6pm. Made the land on the south coast of Terra del
Fuego, or the islands off it, from N by W to WNW then in 56º08'S. I
take the western extreme of land to be that about Cape Horn. On
making this land the dead reckoning was between 3º and 4º to the
eastward. We took a fresh departure from the latitude and longitude
observed.</p>

<p>The timekeeper was near a degree to the eastward of the
observations and had been so the three last sets. It appeared to be
full as much on making the land, but not having an opportunity of
determining exactly which point of land was Cape Horn it was
continued by the same rate allowed, on leaving Port Jackson.</p>

<p>We have some reason to suppose that the cold weather to the
southward might affect the timekeeper as, during the winter months
at Port Jackson, the rate of losing increased to 7" per day and
before we sailed had regularly come back to 4".77, at which it was
fixed. We have always kept the result of the lunar observations
carried on, by the daily difference of longitude or, as often as
the weather would permit, given by the timekeeper between the times
of those observations. We observed the variation of the compass off
Cape Horn 25º00'E. As we approached Cape Horn we kept the parallel
of 56º30'S to see if the island called Diego Ramirez was, or was
not, there to be found. There is not any island so situated. It was
clear enough for us to see land seven or eight leagues, the whole
day.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 149]</p>

<p>We conclude that in the old charts it is misplaced and that it
is Barnevells Isle which is near the shore in Captain Cooks chart.
In the volume of Dr. Hawkesworth, which relates to that part of
Captain Cooks first voyage, is a chart which calls an island Diego
Ramirez, laying S, or S by W, from Cape Horn in 56º30'S.</p>

<p>After passing Cape Horn the wind, which had been blowing strong
for several days from the SW and NW, changed and became variable W,
fine moderate weather.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="dec88" id="dec88"></a>December
1788</p>

<p>From this to the 1st of December had mostly northern and
easterly winds, with very unsettled weather, frequently squally
with very thick fog and rain, sometimes light breezes and suddenly
blowing strong. Many ice islands, gannets, gulls and one ice bird
about the ship. Passed a great quantity of sea weed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 December 1788</p>

<p>9th. The wind came to the westward and blew strong, with fair

sailed December 14 1788, off Cape Horn.'</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 December 1788</p>

<p>13th. We passed a very high one [ice island] which, by the ships
run as a base and the angles measured, was found to be three miles
in length. This day one of the seamen died of scurvy, which was now
getting ahead very fast. The sick list increased to thirty and the
whole ship's company appears to be tainted with that disease. It is
not to be wondered at, when it is considered that they had been now
more than a year without any supply of fresh provisions or
vegetables.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 December 1788</p>

<p>14th. The wind settled in the SW quarter, in 49º49'S and the sun
very near the southern tropic. Water froze at the scuttle butt on
the quarterdeck.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 December 1788</p>

<p>15th. In 48º30'S had many squalls of hail and snow. Ice islands
all around the compass, some of which had large patches of black on
them, as if they had been accumulated along the shore and froze
snow and earth together.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 December 1788</p>

<p>16th. Among the ice islands we passed this day, many had black
patches as before mentioned and one of them a large remarkable
projecting part of a beautiful dark blue. Ice islands still
surround us and some whales were seen.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 December 1788</p>

<p>17th. It blew strong from the NW, several ice islands
continually in sight and a great number of whales, gulls and
pintado birds.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 December 1788</p>

<p>18th. The wind frequently shifted in squalls from NSW to NW to
NSE.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 151]</p>

<p>The weather very unsettled. At noon, the wind fixed at WSW and
blew a hard gale of wind, which continued to the 19th in the
evening, when it became moderate and the wind, veering to the SW,
cleared up the weather. This evening the variation of the compass
was observed 00º04'E. Position 45º34'S, 340º32'E. We passed a great
quantity of seaweed and many ice islands.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 December 1788</p>

<p>21st. One ice island only was seen which was the last we met
with. When we passed it, our position was 44º16'S, 343º32'E.</p>

<p>This, the longest day in the southern hemisphere, was
excessively cold. We first met with ice islands November 23rd, in
37º17'S, 280º10'E*, so that we were twenty-eight days floating with
these lumps of misery in sight and run 836 leagues through between
them, which was frequently rendered very dangerous from the thick
fogs which we had much of, after passing Cape Horn.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the journal, Bradley always refers to
measurements of longitude as "degrees east." By convention, the
prime meridian, which passes through the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of 0 degrees
longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle
east or west from the prime meridian, ranging from 0 degrees at the
prime meridian to +180 degrees eastward and -180 degrees westward.
In the next paragraph we see that, because Bradley referred to
measurements as 0 to 360 degrees east, when he arrived at the
Meridian of Greenwich he needed to "drop 360 degrees of longitude
and begin East longitude again." <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">Wikipedia</a>.]</p>

<p>We have been twelve hours sometimes without being able to see
one mile round the ship. No particular occurrence happened until
the ever memorable 25th, on which day at noon we arrived at the
Meridian of Greenwich, having, since last passing it sailed east
round the South Pole. We therefore drop 360º of longitude and begin
east longitude again, repeating Thursday, 25th December, to make
our time correspond with that at Greenwich. In this voyage we have
had two Christmas days and it being leap year, 367 days in the
year. What few, if any, navigators can boast of.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 December 1788</p>

<p>29th, 11pm. A large meteor with an apparent ball of fire of a
conic shape was seen to the NW. It rose five degrees above the
horizon and continued to a minute in sight, falling or setting 4
points to the northward of its bearing first noticed. The whole
space in that quarter, of a deep reddish yellow, for two minutes
before the glare disappeared.</p>

<p>As we drew near the Cape of Good Hope we found a very strong NW

leagues.</p>

<p>At Noon, ditto. S by E 8 leagues, wind variable.</p>

<p>By [sun] and [moon ] the preceding day brought on by timekeeper,
SSE 7 leagues. The timekeeper, on making the land, appeared to be
1½ degree too far to the eastward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 January 1789</p>

<p>Friday, 2nd, 4pm. Finding we could not weather Robben Island,
we bore away and at 5 Anchored on the NE side of it in 9 fathoms.
Flag at the fort W, northern end of the island NW. Southern end, SW
by W off shore ¾ of a mile. An officer was sent on shore to the
island but the commandant not speaking English, and would not allow
the slaves who could to come up, very little information could be
got.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 153]</p>

<p>He ordered bread, many sorts of fruit and vegetables to be put
into our boat for the use of the sick and very politely requested,
if we had not an immediate opportunity of getting up to Table Bay,
that we could accept, as a testimony of his good wishes, all that
his garden could afford. The fruit and vegetables which he sent to
out boat afforded a very seasonable relief to those poor wretches
who were in the last stage of the scurvy and, with the knowledge
that we were now within reach of the means of reliefs, saved
several of their lives.</p>

<p>We had forty men not able to move and ten who kept watch that
were deprived of the use of one arm or leg with the scurvy. The
whole ship's company were weak and affected by the disorder in some
degree. We lost three men, the passage of two of them just as we
came in with the land.</p>

<p>At daylight next morning, weighed and made sail up to Table Bay,
where we moored at 10 o'clock. We found a Dutch frigate and several
merchant ships of different nations but not one English among the
whole. An officer from the Dutch frigate came on board to pay
respects for his captain to the English man of war. This compliment
and the great hospitality we received from the commandant of Robben
Island was very different to what we experienced on our passage out
last year, which alteration we were at a loss to account for until
the return of the officer who had been sent to wait on the
Governor, when we heard of the changes in Europe and the new
alliances that had been made.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 154]</p>

<p>We had not the least account of any of our transports which
sailed from Port Jackson for England near three months before we
did.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 January 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 4th. The sick were landed, a house without the town
toward the Lions Rump being hired for that purpose.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 January 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 5th. A Dutch ship arrived from Rio de Janiero. They
informed us that two of our transports, the <i>Prince of Wales</i>
and <i>Borrowdale</i> were there when she sailed. The <i>Prince of
Wales</i> had lost her bowsprit. The master and great part of the
people were dead and the rest in such a state that when the harbour
master went on board her, he was obliged to take his boat's crew to
get her into an anchor. The <i>Borrowdale</i> did not arrive there
for some time after the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, nor had she
suffered so much.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 January 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 7. In a strong SE gale our best bower cable parted.
We brought up immediately with the sheet.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 January 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 11th. Having stanched [the flow of] all the salt water
and got all the lumber and weight out of the ship, that was to be
landed, heeled ship to examine the leaks. Found a large bolt hole,
the bolt having been eaten entirely through. We found two other
spike nail holes through the skirting boards. We plugged and
secured them all and we found the ship did not make much water
afterwards.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 January 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 19th. A Dutch frigate arrived from Batavia, which had
been thirty-seven days out. They informed us that the
<i>Alexander</i> transport, Lieutenant Shortland, agent, was
there.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 155]</p>

<p>He, with the <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Friendship</i>, persevered
in the passage to the northward, when the <i>Prince of Wales</i>
and <i>Borrowdale</i> parted company off Port Stephens.</p>

<p>In the straights of Macassar they were in so distressed a
situation from sickness as to be under the necessity of sinking the
<i>Friendship</i>, that with both crews they might be able to
navigate the <i>Alexander</i> and when she arrived at Batavia the
Dutch frigate that gives us this account sent an officer and people
on board her to furl the sails and secure the ship. They continued
on board with some people from an English eastindiaman, to refit
the rigging, and while their own miserable crew were landed for
their recovery. When this ship left Batavia the <i>Alexander</i>
was fitted ready for sea and waited only for the recovery of her
people.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 January 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 27th. Came in a Portuguese ship, that had been blown
out of this bay and kept at sea five weeks in a wretched situation,
having but few of the crew on board when she drove to sea and four
hundred slaves, all sickly, and of which they did not bring in one
hundred again.</p>

bore up and ran to sea to the northward of Robben Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 February 1789</p>

<p>Friday, 6th. A large French ship passed through the bay in the

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 156]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 February 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 11th. Had accounts from a Dutch ship from Rio de
Janiero, that the <i>Borrowdale</i> and <i>Prince of Wales</i>
transports were both ready for sea and at single anchor the middle
of December.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 February 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 18th. The <i>Alexander</i> arrived. We found, by
Lieutenant Shortland, that the accounts given by the Dutch frigate
correspond with his account of their distresses.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Shortland discovered a dry sand bank with a shoal of
considerable extent and an island, on the coast of New South Wales.
The sand bank he fixes in 29°20'S, 158°48'E, which he called
Middleton's Shoal. The island he fixes in 28°10'S, 159°50'E, lies
from the shoal, by their run, N35°E, 97 miles. This he named Sir
Charles Middleton's Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 February 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 19th. The <i>Haspy</i>, South Sea whaler, arrived. She
left England in October. By her we hear that there had not any
transport been taken up New South Wales, but that they only waited
for the accounts of our arrival in that country.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 February 1789</p>

<p>Friday, 20th. Having taken in as much of those articles as were
most wanted at Port Jackson, as the ship could stow, at 10 am
weighed and made sail. At noon were hauling out round the north end
of Robben Island.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="mar89" id="mar89"></a>March 1789</p>

<p>From which [20th February] to the 10th of March, we had
unfavourable winds. We also experienced very strong and strange
currents, for until 5th they ran to the NW and when in 40°S, 20°E
they took a turn and set with greater force to the E and SE.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 157]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 March 1789</p>

<p>The 5th. The weather was very unsettled and fog banks very like
two islands. It came on to blow a gale of wind suddenly at S and
continued between S and ESE to the 9th.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 March 1789</p>

<p>The 10th. The weather cleared up with a fresh gale at SW in
41°52'S, 22°11'E and but little current by the timekeeper.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 March 1789</p>

<p>The 12th. It fell calm, after which a fresh gale sprung up at NE
and blew a hard gale of wind.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 March 1789</p>

<p>On the 15th it shifted to NW in a heavy squall. The wind
continued between NNE, SW and W to the 7th April, with few and
short intervals of SW winds, which usually came after heavy rain
with the NW winds. During this time we had very unsettled weather
with some hard gales, violent squalls and a very high, confused
sea.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 March 1789</p>

<p>The 22nd of March it blew so hard and the sea so high and
irregular that, although the wind was abaft the beam, the ship
could not bear the reefed foresail. This obliged us to bring too
under the balanced mizzen for some hours, until the sea became more
regular.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="apr89" id="apr89"></a>April 1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 April 1789</p>

<p>7th. Had moderate breezes from the NNW and NNE with clear
weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 April 1789</p>

<p>The 11th. The weather became squally with fog and rain.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 April 1789</p>

<p>16th. Fair weather for a few hours enabled us to get some good
observations of [sun] and [moon] and a meridian altitude for the
latitude, five minutes after which a thick fog came on again, and
continued to the 19th with very unsettled weather, sometimes calm,
then blew very strong a few hours and fell calm again.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 158]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 April 1789</p>

<p>The 19th. A hard gale of wind came on suddenly at SW and on the
20th came to the southward and blew with such violence that we
could not carry either of the reefed courses this day. We were so
unfortunate as to have three storm staysails give way at nearly the
same time, that we had only the balanced mizzen left.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 April 1789</p>

<p>The 21st. Knowing that we were settling down upon the land and
being doubtful of clearing it as the wind came to SSE, we set the
reefed foresail before night, in case of falling suddenly in the
swilly. We passed this night in the most anxious situation but saw
nothing.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 April 1789</p>

<p>22nd. Soon after noon the double reefed mainsail was set, the
wind being dead upon the shore, and blew with great violence with
thick rain. At 3pm saw the land on the lee bow, the weather too
thick to make out what part of the coast it was, and not being able
to weather it, we wore, in hopes of clearing the land to the
westward. The ship was already much pressed with sail, yet in our
situation it was necessary to make more, to beat clear either to
the westward or eastward, to effect which, one reef was let out of
the mainsail, the balance taken off the mizzen and the close reefed
fore and main topsails set over the single reefed courses, and all
hands stationed ready, whatever might happen, as first to fall in
with the land to the westward could not weather it and had just
room to wear clear. It was very dark, violent squalls with heavy
rain. The hand of providence now interfered.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 159]</p>

<p>The ship lay two points higher, standing to the estward, than
she did before on the same tack, which gave us some small degree of
hopes that we should clear the land.</p>

<p>At 2am we again fell in with the land to the eastward, about a
point before the lee beam. We had no alternative, being close under
it, but to push on with our only chance. This proved a most
fortunate circumstance, for had we seen it on the lee bow so near
us we should have wore and then all hands must have perished. This
land was no sooner abaft the beam than the ship broke off those two
points which had enabled her to reach to windward of it at about
two miles distant, but how near we passed to those rocks lying off
it we are ignorant of, as breakers could not be distinguished from
that of the sea, which was all a breach to the horizon.</p>

<p>This point of land appeared to be Tasmans Head, for we saw the
land on to the northward as we passed it, from which it appears
that that point which we could not weather standing to the
westward, was the South Cape of Van Diemen's land.</p>

<p>We passed to windward of Maria's Islands and saw them twice.
During the whole of the time, from our first seeing the land until
clear of Maria's Islands, the ship was so pressed as to keep the
pumps constantly going. The sea washed away the figurehead and a
part of the cutwater. In the situation the ship was in all night,
it was really pleasing to find the whole ship's company, with
confidence in their officers and a just sense of their danger,
particularly attentive and cheerfully alert.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 160]</p>

<p>Soon after we had passed Maria's Islands, it fell little wind
for some hours and then blew again with great violence. We found
that the knees on which the security of the bowsprit in part
depended, were started and worked considerably. We therefore got
all the weight from the bowsprit and some additional securities to
it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 April 1789</p>

<p>To the 25th we had very unsettled weather, this and the 26th.
Moderate light breezes which continued to 7pm of the 27th, when it
suddenly came on a gale of wind with thunder, lightening and heavy
rain. At noon, moderate weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 April 1789</p>

<p>28th. To 6pm light breezes with rain wind variable. At 7 blew
strong and came on as suddenly as the last evening. The wind in the
night shifted frequently W to N, and a great confused sea.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 April 1789</p>

<p>29th. The gale continued with frequent and heavy squalls at W
and NW. Much lightening in the night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 April 1789</p>

<p>30th am. The weather became moderate and fair, wind
northerly.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may89" id="may89"></a>May 1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 May 1789</p>

<p>May 1st: At 5pm it again came on to blow very hard at N and
shifted to SW at 2 am, in a violent squall and severe lightening.
At noon, moderate.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 May 1789</p>

<p>2nd. Fresh gales from SW to WNW with frequent hard squalls.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 May 1789</p>

<p>3rd. Towards the evening, fell. Little wind and calm at
times.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 May 1789</p>

<p>4th. Calm until 5pm then suddenly come on a fresh gale at ENE.
Much lightening during the night.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 May 1789</p>

<p>5th. Steady fresh gale from ENE to SE with fair weather.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 161]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 May 1789</p>

<p>6th. Coming on to blow very strong from the southwward. We, at
noon, fell in with the land to leeward of Port Jackson. The North
Head bore S50ºW, distant 10 leagues. Found the timekeeper [? 1 ¼]
degree to the westward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 May 1789</p>

<p>7th. Wind continued to the southward. The ship fell to
leeward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 May 1789</p>

<p>8th. At 4pm fell calm. At 10, a breeze from the land enabled us
to stand along shore to the southward until 6am when the wind again
came to the southward. At noon, after tacking twice, we were
reaching in for the North Head of Port Jackson</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 May 1789</p>

<p>9th. Falling to leeward of the North Head we made a trip with
success and at 3 passed between the Heads. At 6, anchored in Sydney
Cove where we found the <i>Supply</i>.</p>

<p>We found that a native man had been taken by force by Lieutenant
Ball, commander of the <i>Supply</i>, for the Governor, it not
being possible to persuade any of them to come amongst us. He was
for some time kept with an iron about his leg and, when on board
the <i>Supply</i> going down the harbour, he jumped overboard, but
was taken up and prevented from joining his countrymen and old
companions who were near. He was so well reconciled to his
situation when we arrived that he was allowed to walk about by
himself. His irons were taken off.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 162]</p>

<p>When an old man and his child were brought up to Sydney Cove
with the small pox out on them, soon after this old man, another
native man was found in the same situation, with a child laying by
him, both of which were brought up to the hospital. The native at
the Governor's (Arrabanoo) met them without fear of the disorder,
by which it was then supposed that he was ignorant of that
disorder, or that he had had it and was recovered. The two men died
before we arrived, but the children were then on the recovery.</p>

<p>From the great number of dead natives found in every part of the
harbour, it appears that the small pox had made dreadful havoc
among them. We did not see a canoe or a native the whole way coming
up the harbour and were told that scarce any had been seen lately
except laying dead in and about their miserable habitations, whence
it appears that they are deserted by their companions as soon as
the disorder comes out on them, and those who are attacked with
this disorder left to shift for themselves. We judge this from
their having been found not buried, in every part of the harbour.
Some have been found with a child laying dead close to them and
some, who have apparently used their utmost exertions to get at
water, having been found laying dead between a cave and a run of
water.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 163]</p>

<p>How this disease came among them, or whether they were strangers
to it before is doubtful. The two children, before mentioned,
recovered soon after our arrival and were placed, the boy with the
surgeon at the hospital, He was about seven years of age, and the
girl, about thirteen, was put under the charge of the parson's
wife.</p>

<p>A party of marines was discharged from the <i>Sirius</i> to
complete the battalion, which had been reduced during our absence,
by 6 having been executed together for robbing the provisions
store, 1 killed in a quarrel with other Marines and 3 lost in the
woods and perished. Captain Shea we also found had been dead a
considerable time.</p>

<p>The <i>Golden Grove</i> transport, in her passage to Norfolk
Island in October 1788, discovered a shoal of considerable extent
and which we suppose, from the account of its situation, to be the
same that Mr. Shortland discovered and named Middletons Shoal in
July last and gave an account of at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 May 1789</p>

<p>18th. Arrabanoo, the native of the Governor, died of the small
pox, which it is supposed he caught from the native children. He
was taken ill about the time of their recovery. He was a great
loss, being quite familiarized and very happy, quite one of the
Governor's family, and had got some of our language as well as
communicated much of theirs. He was remarkably good tempered and
had he lived would no doubt have been of infinite use to us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 164]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 May 1789</p>

<p>19th. A party from the <i>Sirius</i> went to Rose Hill, to which
place a company of marines and considerable numbers of convicts had
been detached in October last, for the purpose of cultivating that
part of the country. Their situation is pleasant, the soil good,
the country open and promises much to the success of the colony. It
is 12 miles above Sydney Cove and 4 from the flats, from which a
creek runs up, navigable for barges or lighters, observing the
tides. We met with 6 canoes as we went up and saw the same number
of fires as we returned in the cove, just below the flats.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jun89" id="jun89"></a>June 1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 June 1789</p>

<p>June 2nd. Twenty canoes passed Sydney Cove, going down the
harbour. This was the first time any number of them had been seen
together since the small pox having been among them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 June 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 6th. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for Norfolk Island with
an officer and additional number of marines and provisions for that
island. The Governor and Captain Hunter went to the northward to
trace those parts of Broken Bay which had been left unexamined. The
master of the <i>Sirius</i> and a midshipman was were round with
two boats to meet the party who walked over.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 June 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 11th. A native man was met with at Botany Bay who had
just recovered from the small pox. He had a child with him and made
signs that the mother of it had died of that disease.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 165]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 June 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 17th. The Governor and party returned from Broken
Bay. In the branch running to the NW out of the SW arm they
discovered that an opening round an island, which had not been
examined before, led to a fresh water river up which they went
about twenty miles from the island at the mouth of it, when they
were obliged to return for want of provisions to enable them to
proceed.</p>

<p>When they gave up their pursuit they had 6 fathoms water and
made use of it both for drinking and cooking. They met with but few
natives and found some that died of the small pox laying near the
path between Port Jackson and Broken Bay.</p>

<p>In a Cove of the southern arm they met with a woman who had just
recovered but was so reduced and weak that she could not accompany
her companion who ran away on the boat coming in near where they
were. This poor creature crawled in among the long grass to hide
herself and was by chance found in that situation. After having
received every relief that could be given her, she became familiar
as her fears subsided, but was not to be found when the boats came
away. By Captain Hunter's Observation, taken near the inner South
Head of Broken Bay, it appears to be 15 miles to the northward of
Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 June 1789</p>

<p>Friday, 19th. The <i>Sirius</i> went over to the cove on the
northern side of the harbour, to be cleared and refitted for the
purpose of examining the ground tier* and strengthening her upper
works with riders.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 166]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* ground tier: the lowest tier of articles
stowed in a ship's hold. <a href=
"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ground%20tier">Merriam-Webster</a>.
Perhaps it may also refer to the lowest storage area in the hold.
Ed.]</p>

<p>In the night, 3 of the natives appeared on the shore near the
ship, where they remained a short time and went away. They did not
speak and we observed them creeping along to avoid making any
noise. This appeared to be a visit of curiosity to see who they had
near them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 June 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 20th. In Spring Cove 70 of the natives were seen in
one party by our fishing boat.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 June 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 25th. The Governor went to Rose Hill in consequence of
receiving information of a large piece of water being discovered
some distance to the Westward of Rose Hill but, he being anxious to
pursue his discovery of the river in Broken Bay, left this for the
present.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 June 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 29th. The Governor, Captain Hunter and party went to
Broken Bay to trace the river to its source. The master, as before,
went round to meet this party in the South Arm with three weeks'
provisions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 June 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 30th. An officer returned from a visit to those at Rose
Hill. During his stay there, they made a party to the westward,
eighteen or twenty miles, when they were obstructed by water, which
they found to be fresh and apparently a part of a very considerable
river. They found natives there who had traps for catching ducks,
great quantities of which were seen. They also had snares for
taking opossums and other animals.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 167]</p>

<p>This part of the River, which Captain Tench fell in with, bore
nearly west from Rose Hill, estimated distance eighteen miles. It
is conjectured to be a part of that river which the Governor is now
gone to trace. They did not observe any tide but a constant set to
the NE by N, in which direction the branch they fell in with lay.
Its breadth they reckon about eighty fathoms and, to appearances,
deep water. Captain Tench attempted crossing it in an old canoe
which was found there, but was obliged to give it up by her
filling. The banks appeared very high and as if they were subjected
to great torrents in the rainy season. In this excursion they met
with level, open country for some miles and the grass was short, so
as not to be troublesome in walking.</p>

<p>Near the banks, on the eastern side, they found a party of
natives sitting round a fire broiling a kangaroo rat. They all ran
away as soon as they discovered any person near them. Amongst other
things found there was a piece, made of the skins of small animals
sewed or laced together. Some part was of the opossum skin, the
rest of some animal, the fur much superior. These were curiously
carved on the inside, every skin having a different pattern and the
whole formed a piece that, it was supposed, they might use to cover
a child with.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 168]</p>

<p>The needle they use was found. It is a hard piece of wood much
in the size and shape of a small bodkin, with which they make holes
(it not having an eye) to receive the thread, which was found, and
appears to be the sinewy fibres from the tail of some small
animal.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jul89" id="jul89"></a>July 1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 July 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 7th. A second party returned from Rose Hill, after
having visited the river that had been discovered to the westward.
Some small distance lower down than the former party had been they
supposed it to be fordable, but did not venture on account of a
strong set and a fall with it. One of the party crossed it in an
old canoe, buoyed up with bundles of reeds and the wild fig tree,
which they found would swim. They found wild yams on both sides of
the river.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 July 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 14th. Finding that the Governor was in the north arm,
we sent a boat for him and his party. On this boat landing, to the
utter astonishment of all in her, they saw the sailmaker who had
been missing three days, going about the hill close to the ship.
Saturday afternoon he lost himself and wandered into the woods.
Parties were sent in all directions each day to look for him, to no
purpose, and boats along the shore Monday and Tuesday, on which
days guns were fired on board the <i>Sirius</i> to direct him to
the ship.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 169]</p>

<p>The guns on Tuesday morning being heard by the Governor's party
in the lower part of the harbour, they supposed the cause to be a
man lost and in their walk towards Middle Harbour to look for a
boat, found the print of a man's foot with a shoe on, which served
to convince them that they had judged right and determined them to
search for him.</p>

<p>They fired a volley of muskets and soon after, by a single
musket, which being repeated on both sides, they soon came within
hail and, calling to the lost man to stand still, they soon found
him. His joy on seeing them was such that for some time he was like
an idiot.</p>

<p>This man experienced a most singular deliverance from perishing
in the woods. He had not more than half a dozen charges of powder
when he left the ship and no provisions. Although he tried to fire
his musket until he wore the flint to a stump, he could not get it
to go off, only at night to get a fire to rest by. From this
circumstance alone he was enabled to answer the Governor's party
when they first began firing volleys for him. Then he again had the
same good fortune, his gun not missing fire on either of these
occasions and his stock of ammunition just sufficient for those
purposes.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 170]</p>

<p>The Governor returned the same evening to Sydney Cove. They had
traced all the branches of the river, which they discovered in
their last visit to Broken Bay. About 3 mile within the entrance of
the river it branched away to the South six or seven miles, in
which were other inconsiderable and shoal branches from this.</p>

<p>The main river ran some miles, then taking a SW direction and
branching away to the northward, which branch was extensive but
shoal water. Captain Hunter observed the latitude three miles below
that, past where it was too shoal for the boats to proceed, to be
33°21'S. The main channel to the SW took many windings, following
which until they got into very shoal water with very large hard
stones, of which the natives make their hatchets etc., and at the
beginning of the falls they found themselves at the foot of a hill
which they ascended. Captain Hunter observed the latitude on it
33°37'S. The Governor named it Richmond Hill.</p>

<p>As they proceeding up the river, the trees had much the
appearance of there being great torrents in a rainy season. Grass,
mud and pieces of timber were found in them, measured thirty feet
from the surface of the river to that of the tree, where they had
been lodged in the great freshes or torrents. This river, by
Captain Hunter's estimated distances following the course of the
main river, runs fifty-five miles to Richmond Hill, which is by
ditto twenty-seven miles west and by observation two miles south of
the inner south head of Broken Bay. This river, the Governor named
the Hawkesbury.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 171]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 July 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 16th. The boats returned from Broken Bay. They met
with a man woman and child. The woman was the same that they met
with before in the south arm, just recovering from the small pox,
who was now quite recovered of the disease, but one of her legs was
contracted. This family would have been taken by force, but the
wind not being fair, the officer in the boat did not think it a
proper opportunity.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 July 1789</p>

<p>Friday, 31st. The parson and the native girl went down the
harbour to endeavour to have an interview with the natives. They
met with a party of them, some of whom the girl said were her
relations. She told them how well she was treated, that she had
recovered by the care taken of her and that she was very happy. She
used every persuasion to get one or more of them to return with
her, but to no purpose.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="aug89" id="aug89"></a>August 1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 August 1789</p>

<p>Sunday August 2nd. The Surgeon General, with the native boy,
went about the harbour for the same purpose. They soon met with a
party of the natives who knew the boy, but they could not prevail
on any (of them) to come with them. The boy was much inclined to
join the naked tribe.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 172]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 August 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 8th. The <i>Supply</i> arrived. Having landed the
party of marines, stores etc. at Norfolk Island, she proceeded in
search of Middleton's Shoal, and the island discovered by Mr.
Shortland, but did not meet with either, after having passed over
their situation, as given by him. Nor did they meet with that shoal
seen by Mr. Blackburne in the <i>Golden Grove</i> and was supposed
to be part of that which Mr. Shortland had named Middleton's
Shoal.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 August 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 10th. The carpenter, with a part of the crew only, came
on board to examine into and repair the ship's defects, for which
purpose she had long since been cleared.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 August 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 18th. A party went down the harbour to take a native,
if a good opportunity afforded. They met with several in the
northern arm and found them very friendly. They did not take much
notice of the native boy who accompanied the party, nor the boy of
them. They were a considerable time with them but had not an
opportunity of taking one.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 August 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 27th. Captain Hunter went by the sea coast to Broken
Bay, to examine the Bays etc. between Port Jackson and it. Two
boats were sent round with the first lieutenant to meet them and
proceed on the survey of Broken Bay. At 2 in the afternoon the
boats arrived at Broken Bay, and met Captain Hunter there the next
morning. During our stay in the southern arm, only three of the
natives were met with, and but few other seen.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="sep89" id="sep89"></a>September
1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 September 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday September 8th. Having surveyed the bay, south and south
west arms, up to near the entrance of the Hawkesbury, returned to
Port Jackson. Broken Bay is easily known when to the southward of
it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 173]</p>

<p>By the land of the South Head, which forms a high round bluff to
the sea from a low neck, and when the entrance of the bay is well
open, another bluff head will show itself, round which is the south
arm. As you approach the entrance, an island which lies in the bay
and off the south and south west arms, will appear, and very high
toward the sea. This is the mark to lead you into either of those
arms. Passing to the southward of the island, the SW arm lays from
it, about SW½W by compass, and the south arm nearly south.</p>

<p>The South Arm has fresh water in several of the coves. There is
a flat at the entrance which extends more than two thirds of the
channel, over from the east point, between which and the west shore
is three fathoms at low water and shoaling very gradually on the
bank.</p>

<p>Going into this arm, steer in for the west point keeping the
land forming the east point, or inner South Head, open until well
over on the west shore, which keep on board until the north head of
the bay comes on with the inner south head. Then you may haul over
to the eastward. After passing this flat there is not anything
found that will take a ship up in the fair way up to the arm, or
into any of the coves, that a ship may choose a birth as may be
most convenient.</p>

<p>Just within the inner south head, Captain Hunter observed the
latitude 33°35½'S and at the upper part of the southern arm 33°41'.
This arm the Governor has named Pittwater*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Bradley has Pitt Water.]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 174]</p>

<p>There is a middle ground with less than three fathoms on it in
some parts, near the entrance(or outer part) of the SW arm. There
is good room on both sides. It shoals gradually to the middle
ground. When near it, the eastern side is deepest water and best
channel, as you are landlocked on that side when abreast of the
middle ground. There is a rock which lays a small distance off the
point, forming the arm above two little sandy bays, which you avoid
by not opening the north head of the bay with the eastern end of
the island, until the length of that point. Then, by keeping it
just open, you avoid the middle ground to the eastward. The water
near the shore on the eastern side is deep.</p>

<p>When you are the length of the north point, forming a branch to
the NW out of this arm, you are above the middle ground and may
anchor where you please in this arm, in which are several branches
and coves forming very good harbour, with good depth of water and
fresh water in several of the coves. The branch leading to the NW
has a large flat near half way over from the northen shore to
which, in the channel up, it shoals gradually to three feet.</p>

<p>As you come into this branch an island will show itself to the
NNW about two miles up. There is a flat round to the southward and
eastward, some parts of which dry at low water, but there is a very
good channel round the northern part of it and when to the
northward and westward of this island the opening leading to the
Hawkesbury River will show itself to the westward, between two
islands which form the entrance of it, in going to which you leave
two large openings to the northward. These are large pieces of
water but too shoal for anything except boats.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 175]</p>

<p>The rive Hawkesbury, following the course of the main channel
is, by Captain Hunter's estimated distance, fifty-five miles to the
falls, near the foot of Richmond Hill, on which Captain Hunter
observed latitude 33º37'S and, near the top of a shoal branch of
the river leading to the norethward, 33º21'S, which is some miles
to the northward of any part of the northern arm of the bay, as
examined by our boats.</p>

<p>The north arm of Broken Bay is very shoal, with a large flat
laying off the entrance of it, on which the sea breaks a
considerable distance out, except in very fine weather. It is only
fit for boats, through a very narrow channel and frequently
dangerous.</p>

<p>The bay, except that part on the northern side just mentioned,
appears to be clear ground with regular soundings in behind both
the rocky points at the southern end of the sandy beaches. In the
bay is good shelter for boats in any weather, or for small vessels
to push for if caught in the bay and not able to reach the S or SW
arms. I think either of these bights far more safe than to attempt
the northern arm. By Captain Hunter's observation, the entrance of
Broken Bay is sixteen miles to the northward of Port Jackson</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 176]</p>

<p>The coast between forms several bights, two of which a boat
might shelter in if caught upon the shore and could not reach
either of the harbours. The one is round the North Head of Port
Jackson, between the high cliffs and the sandy beach. The other is
in that bight off which is a reef of rocks about three miles to the
northward of Port Jackson. Going along the shore to and from Broken
Bay twice in the boats, I observed that the flood set to the
southward and the ebb to the northward regular. We observed the
tides at Broken Bay to be nearly the same as at Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 September 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 15th. A party went to visit the river to the westward
of Rose Hill. They found that the freshes had been very great and
marks of its rising near thirty feet. The course of the stream,
when they left it, they supposed to be seven knots.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 September 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 20th. Captain Hunter, with the masters of the
<i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i>, went to Botany Bay to survey
it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 September 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 24th. The purser of the <i>Sirius</i>, being down the
harbour to get cabbage tree, was met by some natives who took an
opportunity of stealing his axes and running away. On being
pursued, they left two children behind them. These were taken to
the boat, very soon pacified, and even went to sleep in the boat.
One was seven or eight, the other not more than two years old.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 177]</p>

<p>Some considerable time after this, the men appeared again and
were given to understand that they should not have the children
until they brought back the axes. They, after some hesitation,
fetched the axes and took the children. They did not seem to care
about the eldest but were very anxious about the little one.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 September 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 26th. The man usually employed shooting, for the ship,
when near the middle harbour was suddenly attacked by the natives
with stones. He did not see them until a stone passed close to his
head. Looking round he saw three of them with clubs and spears
advancing toward him. He gave them the contents of his musket which
then was loaded with small shot. This they did not mind, only by
standing still, and gave a shout. In a very short time he saw fifty
of them had got together and were advancing towards him with spears
and clubs, making a great noise. He was now well prepared, having
loaded with large buck shot while they were collecting. He stood
his ground to receive them, letting them advance to within about
fifty yards, and fired among the thick of them. Two fell and the
others ran off immediately, taking their two dead or wounded
companions with them. The man, being alone, did not follow
them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 September 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 30th. Captain Hunter returned from Botany Bay, having
surveyed the bay and taken an eye sketch of the branches, all
except that to the NW which they only traced a few miles. They met
but few natives and those were all friendly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 178]</p>

<p>In some of the caves, skeletons of some and loose bones of
others were found, who had no doubt died of the small pox, by their
bodies not having been removed.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="oct89" id="oct89"></a>October
1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 October 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 5th October. A vessel of twelve tons was launched, which
was the first built in the country. Her construction was that of
the lighter and of an easy draught of water, for the purpose of
carrying stores and provisions over the flats to Rose Hill.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 October 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 7. The Governor went to Rose Hill to trace a piece of
water near it, supposed by those who first fell in with it, to
communicate with the NW Arm of Botany Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 October 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 10. He returned. He fell in with a fresh water river
about four miles from Rose Hill to the southward and which had many
windings. They followed the course of it down on one side of the
banks, not having a boat, as far as the gullies, which they were
obliged to walk round, would admit of. They found a rise of four
feet where the water was fresh and some distance below that part
they met the salt water, which had every appearance of
communicating with Botany Bay or, a small distance to the southward
of it, with the sea.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 179]</p>

<p>But this, for want of a boat, they could not ascertain, being
upon the forked part of a branch, at one part of which a kangaroo
was closely pursued by the greyhound that they had with them. The
kangaroo took to the water. The dog followed and got hold of the
kangaroo, which attacked the dog and tore him so much, that one of
the people was obliged to go in and cut the kangaroo's throat, to
save the dog.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 October 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 31st. The <i>Sirius</i>, <i>Supply</i>, battalion and
convicts put to two-thirds allowance of provisions.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="nov89" id="nov89"></a>November
1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 November 1789</p>

<p>Saturday November 7th. Having repaired the defects of the
<i>Sirius</i>, completed her bottom and fixed the necessary riders,
we went over to Sydney Cove where the repairs to the upper works
could be more conveniently done.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 November 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 8th. Mr. Hill, one of the mates, having been absent
since Thursday, and finding that he had left Sydney Cove early
Friday morning and landed on the north shore to walk round to the
cove where the ship was refitting, we concluded some accident had
happened to him. Several parties were sent to the north shore, with
boats up and down the harbour, to endeavor to meet with him. guns
were fired on board the <i>Sirius</i> every two hours from daylight
until eight at night, all to no purpose.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 November 1789</p>

<p>Monday, 9. Parties and boats as yesterday without success.</p>

<p>Tuesday, 10th. Parties etc. continued. One of the boats was
attacked by the natives in the northern arm. These people had met
the boats crew and been some time together, quite friendly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 180]</p>

<p>Soon after the natives left them, they were surprised with
several spears flying among them and, not a native to be seen at
that moment, they soon appeared and were advancing toward the boat.
When a musket ball was fired among them they stopped, which gave
the people time to get out of their reach with the boat. None of
our people were hurt although the spears passed through amongst
them.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 November 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 11th. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for Norfolk Island
with convicts and provisions for that place.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 November 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 12th. We left off firing guns. The parties and boats
all returned without meeting with the smallest trace of the
unfortunate young man who, there is scarce a doubt, had been killed
by the natives, many of them at that time being about the north
shore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 November 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 15th. A man belonging to the <i>Supply</i>, who had left
her before she sailed and ran into the woods, gave himself up. He
had been absent eleven days. He heard all our guns but, his
intentions not being to return just then, he did not avail himself
of so favourable an opportunity of directing himself back, but
after this he was reduced to the necessity of returning to take the
punishment awaiting him or perish in the woods.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 181]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 November 1789</p>

<p>Saturday, 21st. The <i>Sirius'</i> fishing boat was attacked by
the natives in one of the lower coves, just as they were leaving
the shore. Four musket balls were fired before the natives
retreated. Their spears passed over and in the boat; one struck in
her and broke. Very luckily, they all passed clear of the people in
the boat. Another boat was also attacked this day, laying at a
grapnel off a point of the northern arm. Several spears were
thrown, on which the people moved farther off. A great number of
natives then appeared. The women came close to the rocks and used
every wanton lure to entice our people to land. When the women came
forward, a party of men were observed to walk away, no doubt to be
ready for an attack if our people had been so improvident as to
land. This artifice having been practised by them before, the
people were well aware of it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 November 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 25th. Governor Phillip, judging it necessary that a
native should be taken by force, no endeavor to persuade them to
come among us having succeeded, I was ordered on this service,
having the master, two petty officers and a boat's crew with me, in
one of the Governor's boats.</p>

<p>As we went down the harbour we got some fish from the boats that
lay off the northern arm fishing, and proceeded up the arm in which
we saw a great number of natives on both sides, and several landed
on the beach at the north cove, hauling their canoes up after
them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 182]</p>

<p>As we got near the upper part of the north cove, we held two
large fish up to them and had the good luck to draw two of them
away from a very large party by this bait. These people came around
the rocks, where they left their spears and met us on the beach
near the boat and at a distance from their companions sufficient to
promise success without losing any lives. They eagerly took the
fish. Four of the boats crew were kept in the boat, which was
winded and backed close to the beach where the two natives and the
rest of our people were. They were dancing together when the signal
was given by me and the two poor devils were seized and handed into
the boat in an instant.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a> <img src=

<p class="caption">'Taking of Colbee &amp; Bennelong. 25 November
1789'</p>

<p>The natives, who were very numerous all round us, on seeing us
seize those two, immediately advanced with their spears and clubs,
but we were too quick for them, being out of reach before they got
to that part of the beach where the boat lay. They were entering on
the beach just as everybody was in the boat and, as she did not
take the ground, we pulled immediately out without having occasion
to fire a musket.</p>

<p>The noise of the men crying and screaming, of the women and
children, together with the situation of the two miserable wretches
in our possession, was really a most distressing scene. They were
much terrified, one of them particularly so. The other frequently
called out to those on shore apparently very much enraged with
them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 183]</p>

<p>They followed the boat on both sides as far as the points of the
cove and then returned to the beach. We saw them take up the two
fish which their two unfortunate friends dropped, on being seized.
On our landing at Sydney Cove we were met by Nanbarry, the native
boy, who was much pleased and called them by name, Colbee and
Bennelong. Colbee, we have frequently heard spoken of by the boy as
a great warrior and a leading man among them.</p>

<p>They were taken to the Governor's house, where they were soon
met by Abooroo, the native girl. she called them by name, the same
as the boy had done, and was quite frantic with joy. They were
assured by these children that they would be well treated and
thereafter allowed to return to their friends, but all that could
be said or done was not sufficient to remove the pang which they
naturally felt at being torn away from their friends, or to
reconcile them to their situation.</p>

<p>It gave me great satisfaction to find by the children that
neither of them had wife or family who would feel their loss, or to
be distressed by their being taken away. It was by far the most
unpleasant service I ever was ordered to execute. These people were
shaved, washed and clothed. An iron shackle was put on one leg,
with a rope made fast to it, and a convict charged with each of
them. They were very sullen and sulky, continued so several days,
yet it did not by any means affect their appetite, if we may judge
from the quantity they now eat, which is beyond everything
incredible. Twelve pounds of fish does but little towards
satisfying them for one meal.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 184]</p>

<p>They made several attempts to get away by gnawing the rope in
the night but, being unacquainted with the securities on doors and
windows, they might have as well remained fast. When their keepers
awoke, they found them groping about the room to find an opening by
which they might escape.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="dec89" id="dec89"></a>December
1789</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 December 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, December 1. The first lieutenant and master of the
<i>Sirius</i> were sent to examine the NW branch of Botany Bay. On
the 5th they returned. They had found it to be a creek of about
eight miles length to the north-west, with a winding shoal channel,
which ended in a drain to a swamp, all salt water.</p>

<p>Saw several natives in small parties. They would not come near
us. On our return, we landed in a bay about three miles to the
northward of Botany Bay. The wind was fresh and a considerable
swell right on the shore, yet we landed smooth at the beach where
there is a fine run of water. The inner parts of this bay are open
from SE by S to ESE, the water shoaling gradually with soft bottom
to the beach. The inner points which break the sea off are about a
cable or cable and a half across and five fathoms water mid
channel. Within the outer point is 7 fathoms, from which it runs up
rather more than half a mile to the NW and is a very good place for
a boat to stop, in going along the shore and night coming on, or a
contrary tide coming on.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 December 1789</p>

<p>Wednesday, 9th. Lieutenant Dawes, with a party, went to Rose
Hill for the purpose of penetrating to the westward towards the
mountains.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 185]</p>

<p>Saturday, 12th. Notwithstanding that the two natives had got
themselves loose several times and were prevented from escaping,
Colbee this evening got away by the very same means which had
before been detected. The man who had charge of him was severely
punished for his neglect, and the man who had charge of Bennelong
was now chained by the wrist, the other end being fastened to the
shackle on Bennelong's leg, instead of a rope which was before
used. Bennelong was nearly loose when the other was missed and in a
minute more would have been after him. He was much alarmed, no
doubt expecting punishment, or to be put to death.</p>

<p>In the course of two or three days he became quite composed, and
seemed reconciled better to his situation than before. He came on
board the <i>Sirius</i> without the smallest apprehensions for his
safety. He looked with attention at every part of the ship and
expressed much astonishment, particularly at the cables.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 December 1789</p>

<p>Thursday, 17. Mr. Dawes and party returned. They found it
impracticable to get near the mountains in the direction which they
went.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 December 1789</p>

<p>Tuesday, 22. The <i>Supply</i> arrived from Norfolk Island. She
brought very favourable accounts of the crops of corn. She called
at Lord Howe Island, with very little success in getting
turtle.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 December 1789</p>

<p>Sunday, 27th. Mr. King, second lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i>,
being established by the Governor as commandant at Norfolk Island,
was discharged from the ship and Mr. Maxwel, third lieutenant,
being insane, was invalided. Mr. Newton Fowell and Mr. Henry
Waterhouse were appointed to act as second and third
Lieutenants.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jan90" id="jan90"></a>January

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 186]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 January 1790</p>

<p>January 8th. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for Norfolk Island with
convicts and provisions.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 January 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 20th. A look out post was established at the South
Head. Captain Hunter, with a party, went to that station.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 January 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 29th. The first lieutenant, with a party, went to the
South Head to relieve the look out post. Black kangaroos were seen
about there.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 January 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 31st. Caesar, a notorious convict, a native of
Madagascar, delivered himself up to the officer at Rose Hill. He
had been absent since the 22nd of December, when he ran off with a
canoe from Garden Island and on the 23rd paid them a visit in the
night and stole a musket, which he dropped in a garden at Rose
Hill, a few nights since, being closely pursued.</p>

<p>The account he gives of his subsisting himself so long a time
was that where he saw a party of natives with anything on, or about
their fire, that he frightened them away by coming suddenly on them
and swaggering with his musket, then helped himself to whatever
they had left. In this manner he made out very well without
ammunition, sometimes robbing gardens. When he lost the musket he
found it impossible to subsist himself. He was then attacked by the
natives and wounded in several places and escaped from a party of
them through a very thick brush, when he surrendered himself.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="feb90" id="feb90"></a>February

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 187]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 February 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 3rd. The Governor and Bennelong visited the look out
post. Bennelong being now well reconciled, generally accompanies
the Governor in little excursions. He threw a spear on the South
Head, against a strong wind, ninety-eight yards, which was
considerably farther than I ever noticed before. In their return to
Sydney Cove they saw some women on a point of land near Rose Bay,
to which they rowed, and threw them a jacket and several other
things. Among this party was a woman whom Bennelong was very fond
of, (Barangaroo) and with whom he had much conversation. He wanted
her to come to the boat, telling her that he was fast by the leg
and could not get to them. They learned from these women that
Colbee was then fishing on the other side of the hill and that he
could not get the shackle from his leg.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 February 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 7. Nanbaray (the native boy) was at the look out post on
a visit. This day, among other amusements, he went through the
ceremony of a burial, which he did by first digging a grave,
putting into it a quantity of dry sticks. The body was laid at
length in green brush, which he tied at both ends and placed it
upon the dry sticks, then piled sticks over it above the surface of
the ground and signified that they set fire to the pile and threw
ashes and earth all together, leaving the ground in shape of the
grave usually met with. That part of the ceremony of lighting the
fire he was obliged to omit, not being strong enough to get it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 188]</p>

<p>He showed us the manner in which it was done by two sticks, one
placed horizontally. The other, pointed, is applied to this which,
by constant friction, makes a small hole through which fire is
communicated to some very dry stuff placed under for that purpose.
It appears to be rather tedious and laborious.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 February 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 10th. A sail was seen in the offing, which was soon
known to be the <i>Supply</i>. She, falling in to leeward of Port
Jackson, bore away for Botany Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 February 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 12. The <i>Supply</i> arrived at Port Jackson. She left
a party on Lord Howe Island, in her passage to Norfolk Island, for
the purpose of getting turtle. She took the people off in her
return. They did not get any turtle.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 February 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 14th. The <i>Sirius</i> was ordered to be got ready for
sea, it being judged that the state of the colony with respect to
provisions was such as made it necessary that she should be sent
for supplies, to relieve it, and China was determined as a proper
place for that purpose. Some days after, this plan was changed and
it was judged necessary to divide the people in the settlement.
Norfolk Island was fixed on to remove the Lieutenant-Governor with
his part of the Battalion and convicts.</p>

<p>It was therefore ordered that the <i>Sirius</i> and
<i>Supply</i> should take those people to Norfolk Island and return
to Port Jackson after which, if there was not a ship arrived from
England, the <i>Sirius</i> was to go to China as before resolved
on. The Governor and one of the mates, with 6 people, took charge
of the look out post.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 189]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 March 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 2 March. Having got the provisions and stores on board
for Norfolk Island, we went out of Sydney and anchored in the
stream.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 March 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 3rd. Received on board the <i>Sirius</i> Major Ross,
4 lieutenants, 2 sergeants, 2 corporals, 2 drums and 20 private
marines. The <i>Supply</i> received 1 captain, 1 lieutenant, 2
sergeants, 2 Corporals and 26 privates.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 March 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 4th. Received on board the <i>Sirius</i> 96 men and 65
women convicts with 23 children, the surgeon and assistant, who
were appointed to Norfolk Island. The <i>Supply</i> received 20 men
and 2 women convicts and 3 children.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 March 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 5th. Sailed with the <i>Supply</i> in company but, the
weather being squally and very unsettled, we came to in the lower
part of the harbour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 March 1790</p>

<p>Saturday, 6. Wind fresh from the southward. Sailed out of Port
Jackson, <i>Supply</i> in company.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 March 1790</p>

<p>The 8th. We found by observation for the latitude and
timekeeper, that the current had set us 38 of latitude to the
Northward and 49 of longitude to the eastward. Weather moderate,
wind southerly.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 March 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 9th. At 1pm saw Lord Howe Island, Mt.Gower NE by E 23
leagues. Mt. Gower and Mt. Lidgbird with these bearings make in two
round hills with a space between them and in clear weather Ball's
Pyramid lying to the SE of Mt. Gower may be seen nearly at as great
a distance in a peak. The land which joins the two mountains is not
to be seen until much nearer, 15 or 16 leagues, and the low land of
the island not until within 6 or 7 leagues. Found a current which
set us this day 16 N and 49 of longitude E. The <i>Supply</i> stood
into the bay to try if any turtle could be got.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 190]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 March 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 10th, pm. Passed through between Balls Pyramid and
Mt. Gower, they bear from each other S51ºE and N57ºW by compass 5
or 6 leagues distant. To the southward of the pyramid, which is a
very high inaccessible peaked rock, are several rocks which show
above water. Between Lord Howe Island and the Pyramid is a clear
passage. We had soundings near Mt. Gower but none before or after.
We found a very strong current setting through to the NE.</p>

<p>From good meridian observation and good altitudes for the
timekeeper, only 3 days out of Port Jackson when its rate was
determined on our sailing, we make Mount Gower, the southern end of
Lord Howe Island, to lay in 31º35' southern latitude, longitude by
the timekeeper 159º12'E, and by [sun] and [moon] 158º51'E.
Variation of the compass. 9º30'E.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 March 1790</p>

<p>After leaving Lord Howe Island we did not find any current until
we came near the stream of Norfolk Island, when we again found a
strong easterly current. We made Norfolk Island Saturday, 13th at 2
am. Brought to at 4 and made sail in for the island at daylight. As
we came in with Sydney Bay, south side of the island, saw the
signal that there was no landing. The <i>Supply</i> was sent to see
if landing was good in Balls Bay on the east side of the island.
Lieutenant Ball could not land, but backed the boat in so as to
throw a letter on shore to the commandant. We then went round to
the northern side of the island and found landing practicable at
low water in Cascade Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 March 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 14. Landed the marines and men convicts early in the
afternoon and the next morning the Lieutenant-Governor and part of
the women convicts in Cascade Bay, by backing the boat in, from
which they jump on a rock, one at a time, keeping the boat on her
oars and frequently obliged to pull out several times before a boat
load can be landed. The rock on which you land cannot pass from
after half flood, it being separated from the shore and there being
always a surge upon it. The shore would be dangerous crossing after
half flood or until half ebb. This rock being detached, and steep
too, makes safe landing in southerly winds. The rock for landing
lies to the eastward of the stony beach, some distance.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 192]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 March 1790</p>

<p>Monday, 15th. The wind coming to the eastward, we had drifted so
far to leeward that it was a considerable time before we could get
the ship far enough to windward for the boats to reach the landing
place. About noon we landed the remainder of the women convicts and
thought ourselves exceeding fortunate in having made so good a
passage and having had so good an opportunity of landing so great a
number of people. But the most difficult part yet remained, that of
landing the provisions and stores for them and which could only be
done in Sydney Bay, where the settlement is made. While off Cascade
Bay we made the landing place, by several observations in latitude,
29º02½', longitude 168º02'E by timekeeper.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 March 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 16th. Coming on a gale of wind at east, bore away and
ran under the lee of the island. Sent on board the <i>Supply</i> as
much provisions as she could stow, that no time might be lost in
getting it landed should the <i>Supply</i> have an opportunity of
getting into Sydney Cove before the <i>Sirius</i>, which was
reasonable to suppose she would, from her superiority in sailing
and working.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 March 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 17th. It blew very strong from the eastward. We were
beating up under a press of sail, but could not reach Sydney Bay
before the evening, when it would be too late, and too much wind,
to send a boat. The <i>Supply</i> at noon was well in with the
Bay.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 193]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 March 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 18th. The gale increased with very heavy squalls. The
<i>Supply</i> got far enough in to send a boat on shore, on the
return of which Mr. Ball bore away and informed us that landing was
dangerous and as the weather had a very bad appearance, he
recommended standing off as the night came on, which we did under
the reefed foresail and storm staysails. We lost sight of the
<i>Supply</i> in the night. At noon we were about ten leagues to
the leeward of Phillip Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 March 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 19th, pm. The gale moderated. We made what sail the ship
would bear to endeavour to beat up to Norfolk Island. In the night
the wind coming to the SE enabled us to fetch so far to windward as
to have Norfolk Island on the lee bow at daylight, am. At 9,
standing close in with Phillip Island, saw the <i>Supply</i> under
Norfolk Island. the signal being up on shore for good landings and
that longboats might land, stood in for Sydney Bay, out reef
topsails. Steered close in with the southerly point of Nepean
Island, wore and brought to, main topsail to the mast, with the
ship's head to the SSW. Out boats, loaded one of them with
provisions and sent her away.</p>

<p>While we were loading the other, Mr. Ball hailed from the
<i>Supply</i>, then on our lee bow, and waved his hat towards a
reef of sunken rocks which lay off the west point of Sydney
Bay.</p>

<p>We sent the boat away half loaded, filled the main topsail, set
the foresail and mainsail to make a trip to windward. The
<i>Supply</i> could not weather these rocks. She tacked and passed
just clear under our weather bow. Lieutenant Ball hailed and said
we were both too near in. At this moment the wind shifted two
points to the southward. We could not weather the reef.</p>

<p>The wind baffled and baulked the ship in stays. She missed and
fell off. Hauled the after sails and paid her round upon her heel
and hauled our wind on the starboard tack, out first reef mizzen
topsail, and set the driver to endeavour to fetch through between
Nepean Island and the east point of Sydney Bay, as the only chance
of saving the ship.</p>

<p class="caption">'Part of the Reef in Sydney Bay, Norfolk Island,
on which the "Sirius" was wrecked. 19 March 1790.'</p>

<p>Anchoring when the ship missed stays would have been unavoidable
destruction, the bottom being full of spiral rocks, the lee part of
the bay and the shore inaccessible. The ship settled in upon the
shore, shoaled the water to 5 fathoms. Put the ship in stays. When
she, getting fresh stern way right in upon the shore, cut away the
small bower anchor, let go the topsail, halyards etc., but before
the cable could check her, she struck violently on the reef which
lays along parallel to the shore in Sydney Bay and some distance
from it.</p>

<p>The carpenter almost immediately reported the ship bulged and 7
feet water in the hold. The quartermaster, then attending in the
main hold, called up that the water was flowing in fast.</p>

<p>Cut away all the masts. The ship, by the heavy surf which broke
over her, was thrown well in upon the reef. It being impossible to
hold an idea of getting her off again, everybody was employed
getting provisions, as it could be got at, on the gun deck and
securing it there.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Ball came as near the ship in his boat as he could,
to ask if the <i>Supply</i> could be of any use. Captain Hunter
told him No! that the <i>Sirius</i> was gone and desired him to
take care of the <i>Supply</i>.</p>

<p>The surf increasing in the evening and the weather having a bad
appearance, Mr. King, who had now been more than 2 years on the
island, signified to us that it would be dangerous to remain in the
ship all night.</p>

<p>We got a hawser from the ships quartermaster. To the shore by
means of a cask floating a small rope through the surf, which the
people on shore got hold of and hauled the end of the hawser on
shore. We got a heart on it for a traveller and fixed hauling
lines, by which the people belonging to the island hauled a part of
the ships company ashore though the surf to the reef, from which
they crossed to the shore in a small boat employed inside the reef
for that purpose.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 196]</p>

<p>The reef being covered at half flood and night coming on, more
than half of the ship's company were left on board. As the tide
flowed, the cable checked her so much that at high water her
situation was altered three or four points more, in and out. She
struck violently at high water time, but at low water lay
quiet.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 March 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 21st, am. At daylight began to get more of the people on
shore, the surf still very high, and the tide rose too much for
those on the reef to work before all the people could be removed
from the ship.</p>

<p>At 3pm all the people were got on shore, in which we were so
fortunate as not to lose a life. Several were so near drowned as to
be quite senseless for a time. Although we had all escaped from
shipwreck with our lives, yet our situation with respect to
provisions was alarming and very precarious, it being doubtful
whether any could be saved or not.</p>

<p>In the morning, Lieutenant Ball came over from Cascade Bay. He
informed us that both Friday and Saturday the tide set to the
westward the whole of each day except about 2 hours, a circumstance
he had never met with before at this island. On the contrary we had
always been given to understand that the ebb set to the eastward
and ran 9 hours and that the flood was only a drain to the westward
and ran about 3 hours.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 197]</p>

<p>To this unaccountable change in the current usually found we
attribute the first cause of the ship being lost, for it was more
than 2 hours ebb or eastern tide when we brought to with the ships
head SSW. In full assurance that we had a strong weather tide we
stood nearer in than we should otherwise have done before we
brought to. One boat was loaded and sent away before we observed
her settle in upon the shore.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 March 1790</p>

<p>Monday, 22nd. We got over from Cascade Bay 3 tierces* of pork
and 8 barrels of flour which was all the provisions the
<i>Supply</i> could spare us, and even this in our situation was an
object. We had now landed near 400 people and scarce any of the
provisions, when the unfortunate accident happened. The timekeeper
was saved and sent aboard the <i>Supply</i>. AM martial law was
proclaimed and half allowance of provision ordered.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* tierce: a cask, or vessel, holding 42 wine
gallons.]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 March 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 23. The master and mates, with a gang of hands, got on
board to get ready for sending provisions on shore. The
<i>Supply</i> came off Sydney Bay but the surf was too high to send
the people who were to embark in her. She bore away and ran to
leeward to Cascade Bay.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 March 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 24, pm. Made an unsuccessful attempt to get a cask of
provisions on shore.</p>

<p>AM. Sent over to Cascade Bay where they embarked on board the
<i>Supply</i> for Port Jackson, the second and third lieutenants, 4
midshipmen, 1 surgeon's mate, 23 seamen and 2 marines. Mr. King,
the late commandant on this island, also went on board the
<i>Supply</i>, to proceed to Port Jackson. This forenoon we were
fortunate enough to get 18 casks of provisions on shore.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 198]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 March 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 25th, pm. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for Port Jackson,
this and the following days until the 28th. We had good enough in
getting provisions from the ship and several other articles of
consequence.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 March 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 28th, am. Very heavy surf. The small bower cable parted.
The surf hove the ship further in upon the reef and, not having
anything to keep her bow steady, she complained very much. The
master, who was on board, expected that she would part at high
water. It was the next low water time before those on board could
venture to come on shore which they, with great difficulty, did
without the loss of any.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 March 1790</p>

<p>Monday, 29th. Surf very high. At high water the surf hove the
ship's head round in upon the reef and further in upon it bodily.
This made it necessary to get a hawser with a traveller to the bow
of the ship and to cut the bridle port so as to allow of cask and
large articles of stores going out, which was done the 30th, the
surf being more moderate.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="apr90" id="apr90"></a>April 1790</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 April 1790</p>

<p>From which day to the 14th of April we were employed from half
ebb to half flood getting on shore every article of stores
belonging to the ship and the colony that could be got at. Sixteen
half barrels of powder were also got on shore. The remainder, being
spoiled, was started into the sea in the magazine.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 199]</p>

<p>The situation of the ship being bulged, fore and aft, many of
the beams fallen and the lower deck given way, the sheet and best
bower cables were left on board and many other stores, it being
impossible to remove them without cutting so much through the deck
and beams as to render the attempt dangerous. With the quantity of
provisions which we had been so fortunate as to save, there
appeared, on a survey, to be in the settlement 14 weeks at half
allowance.</p>

<p>Parties were allowed to go for birds: for the seamen, marines
and convicts twice a week each, and limited not to bring more than
a proportion of 3 for each man. These birds are very numerous and
burrow in the ground about the hills, particularly about Mount
Pitt, which is the highest land in the island. It was the practice
before we came to dig them out of their holes in the day time, but
the people now take them as they settle in the evening and early
part of the night and, were they not restricted, they could bring
away almost any number.</p>

<p>These birds are nearly the same as the English puffin or Manks
Puffin as described in Brooks' Natural History, found on the Isle
of Man and Scilly Isles, and is the size of a tame pigeon. The
colour on the upper parts is brown or black and, on the under,
brown and white, legs black. The bill is narrow and black, about an
inch and half in length, the upper chap is crooked at the point
like that of a cormorant and at the base there is a bald skin in
which the nostrils are placed.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 200]</p>

<p>The wings are long and the tail is a palm in length. It feeds at
sea and although such incredible number settle on the hills to get
into their holes at the approach of night, a great number has been
taken in the daytime, by being dug out with a grubbing hoe or
brought our by terrier dogs. They lay but one egg, which is larger
than that of the common hens. They are said to be in and about this
island from March to August. When the young are ready to fly they
all go off together, about which time another sort is said to come,
but not in such numbers.</p>

<p>These birds are a great resource to us. They enable us to go
with the cultivation of the land for the crops, which we must soon
depend on if we are not relieved and which, I fear, will not keep
us without feeling pangs of extreme hunger.</p>

<p>Fish (with which the sea abounds) is too precarious to be
considered as any resource, on account of the surf, it being
impossible to keep a boat for that purpose at any other part of the
island except at Sydney Bay, in which is a reef from the east point
to the bight on the west side, which is dry at half tide but no
landing on it with a boat.</p>

<p>There are two small gullies in the reef, close to each other,
that will just admit a boat (in one of which there is not breadth
for a common six-oared cutter's pass) and that only when there is
but very little surf on the reef. It is frequently many days
together that the boats cannot go out and is, unless very smooth,
always dangerous.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 201]</p>

<p>I shall collect into a separate table from the general one of
weather etc., an account of the surf from the time of our being
wrecked to the time of our happy deliverance whenever it comes, and
bring it in course with leaving the island, distinguishing the days
on which the boat could go out for fish (and no opportunity is
lost), and those of high surf to prevent it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 April 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 20th. Half a pound weight of salt provisions were
ordered to be deducted from the week's allowance and parties
allowed to get birds every day to make up the deficiency.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 April 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 22nd. Went out in the cutter to sound round Nepean
Island. Between it and the east point of Sydney Bay found a rock
about mid channel, or rather nearer the island, with only 2½
fathoms on it at low water and another not so much as 1/3 over from
the east point of Sydney Bay with 3½ fathoms on it, both which were
seen to break some days before. Between these rocks is nine
fathoms, then 5 and nine again. It appears to be all foul and very
uneven bottom from more than mid channel around to the north east
part of the land, forming the east point of Sydney Bay. The passage
through, if a ship should be obliged to it, is to keep the island
close on board, but I do not by any means recommend it as a safe
passage.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 202]</p>

<p>There is a very dangerous reef off the south east part of Nepean
Island, which lies nearly south east from it about a half mile to
the outer rock, on which the sea only breaks in bad weather or
great swell. We passed between this and a rock, dry at low water,
and had 8 fathoms crossing the ledge and 12 on each side about a
quarter of a mile from the island.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may90" id="may90"></a>May 1790</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 May 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, May 2nd. The birds taken at Mount Pitt being found very
sufficient to supply every person, orders were given not to shoot
any birds on the island during the continuance of the Mount Pitt
birds.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 May 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 14th. A council was held by the Lieutenant-Governor and
all the commissioned officers, to take into consideration the
present reduced state of the provision store and to consult upon
what measures were most proper to be pursued in order to preserve
life until such time as we might be relieved by some supplies
arriving, and bring the season round that we may expect some relief
from the crops which the ground, already cleared and clearing, may
produce.</p>

<p>All which, having been duly considered, the ration of provisions
was reduced to the following quantity: 3lb of flour, 1½ lb of salt
beef or 17 oz. of pork, and 1 lb of rice or calavances per week to
each man and woman. To children more than 1 year old, half the
aforementioned ration and to children under 1 year 1½ lb of flour
and 1 lb of rice per week. At which allowance there remain in store
17 weeks flour, 16 beef and pork together, and 21 of rice and
calavances together.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 203]</p>

<p>The parties for birds were now increased and allowed to bring in
as many as they thought proper, there not yet appearing to be the
smallest decrease in the numbers.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 May 1790</p>

<p>Saturday, 22nd. A practice being made known, which several of
the people going for birds had, of destroying them for the sake of
the egg, after they had taken as many birds as they as they wanted
to carry away, and leave the birds laying about so as to become a
nuisance round the hills, the parties were not allowed to go out
until 3 in the afternoon and to return by 10 at night.</p>

<p>These birds were now so plenty that the people could get as many
as they wanted and the practice of destroying and throwing away the
bird having been put a stop to, they seldom brought in any but
those with the egg in them, letting the other go again after taking
them. Our people generally return about 8 o'clock loaded. They have
between 3 and 4 miles to go for them to Mount Pitt and the hills
about it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 204]</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jun90" id="jun90"></a>June 1790</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 June 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday. June 1. Went out to sound between Nepean Island and the
east point of Sydney Bay, about those rocks which I was on with the
boat the 22nd of last month. Found a flat with 5 fathoms round the
rock nearest the island and discovered the bottom to be full of
spiral rocks or large stones laying on a flat coral bed. These
rocks lie just at the edge of a bed of rocks which appear to spread
nearly over to Nepean Island. The sounding very irregular, on the
rock next to Point Hunter 3½, and on that nearest Nepean Island
only 2½ fathoms. I crossed the channel and found the bottom very
uneven and all rocky, and although I had not less then 5 fathoms,
except on those rocks beforementioned, I think it probable that in
many parts there may be much less, from the rippling of the tide
and from the breakers which we see in bad weather.</p>

<p>I also went along by the island to try for a passage. The sounds
within half a cables length of it are more regular than any other
part of the Channel, 7 and 6 fathoms, but the tide making very
strong prevented my being able to determine whether there was a
safe passage through or not. The <i>Supply</i> has gone through but
I think it rather dangerous. The rocks which are known are so small
that many of the same kind may have as yet been passed over without
being noticed.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 June 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 2nd. A large patch of level ground about 2 miles to
the westward, which was said could easily be cleared, was fixed on
as an elligible situation to detach some people to for that
purpose.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 June 1790</p>

<p>Friday, 4th. At noon, the detachment of marines fired 3 volleys
in honour of the Day.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 June 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 15. The fishing boat was suddenly overtaken by a gale
of wind, that she could not reach the landing place in Sydney Bay
or land, if she could have got to windward, which obliged them to
run under the lee of the island.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 205]</p>

<p>Our people were sent over and had the good luck to save the boat
by hauling her up in Balls Bay, on the east end of the island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 June 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 17. A captain and company of marines and a party of
convicts were detached to the ground lately discovered, for the
purpose of cleaning it for cultivation. It was named Charlotte's
Field.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 June 1790</p>

<p>Wednesday, 23. The <i>Coble</i> was launched from Balls Bay and
brought round. This was the first day that it was practicable on
account of the surf, since the day that she was obliged to run to
leeward of the island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 June 1790</p>

<p>Thursday, 24th. Got some empty casks from the ship. She was
found to be bulged the whole way fore and aft on both sides and the
keel broke right up into the after hold</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 June 1790</p>

<p>Tuesday, 29th. The fishing business was given into charge of the
officers and people belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, that the two
crews of convicts kept for the <i>Coble</i> might be turned to
cleaning ground. We also made hooks and lines for carrying it on
with. The birds at Mount Pitt are yet taken in the usual quantities
without appearing to have diminished in their numbers, which has
already far surpassed everything we can have an idea of, but the
Divine Hand of Providence. Fish we have been very badly off for
this month, being mostly high surf.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jul90" id="jul90"></a>July 1790</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 July 1790</p>

<p>Monday, 19th. The reduced state of the provisions store made it
absolutely necessary that the issuing of salt provisions, however
small the ration, should be stopped while any birds were to be
had.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="aug90" id="aug90"></a>August 1790</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 August 1790</p>

<p>August, 3. The Lieutenant-Governor assembled the council for the
purpose of determining on the best plan, in our distressed
situation, to secure to ourselves the means of subsistence, until
we may be relieved by the arrival of some ship. The birds now
became scarce, and the young being nearly ready to fly, are about
to leave the island. A reduction of provisions to 2lb of flour and
1 pint of rice per week was judged necessary to take place on
Saturday the 7th following.</p>

<p>It having been as practice for some people to abscond from their
work and take to the woods living by plunder, and the section of
the Articles of War relating to Martial Law being established not
affecting the lives of such people without their having robbed or
plundered being fully proved, it became absolutely necessary from
the situation we were reduced to, that a law should be established,
deeming such as quitted their work and were absent one week, to be
outlawed and to be put to death if met with, or if brought in to be
punished with death on a proof of their having been absent one
week.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 207]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 August 1790</p>

<p>The 4th. The appearance of a ship to the eastward and working up
towards the island, filled every soul with a most heart felt
pleasure and extravagant joy, some crying some laughing, running
about like people without reason. Parties were sent to Balls Bay
and Cascade Bay, not doubting but a boat would land there. But
after standing close in with Cascade Bay about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, she bore away and made sail to the northward.</p>

<p>The gloom with which the island was now overspread, our feelings
on this disappointment cannot be expressed by words. Such a sudden
change almost threw everybody into a state of despondency. The only
idea that could be suggested' to rouse and give us hopes' was that
there were ships at Port Jackson and that this ship might have been
ordered to show herself off the island, but the commander of her
not having any intercourse with us when he could so easily have
done it, and without loss of time, is I think unpardonable and not
worthy the character of a man but rather that of a brute.</p>

<p>This disappointment had a very bad effect on the working people,
who now considered themselves as without a hope of relief and, the
birds being scarce, impressed the idea of distress more fully on
their mind. The idea of there having been arrivals at Port Jackson
was encouraged by all the officers, yet it had but little effect on
the lower class.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 208]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 August 1790</p>

<p>Saturday, 7th. At daylight a sail being seen to the southward
again filled us with a sudden joy and hopes of being speedily
relieved from the gloomy prospects now before us. This was the day
appointed for reading the proclamation beforementioned respecting a
new law and and further reductions of provisions, but it was
deferred, a ship being in sight, although at too great a distance
for a boat to reach her:</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 August 1790</p>

<p>Sunday, 8th. At 3pm a boat was sent out to the ship in the
offing. The boat was scarce without the reef when they saw another
ship coming close round the island and to which they went.Found her
to be the <i>Surprise</i> transport form Port Jackson with convicts
and provisions for this island, that the ship in the offing was the
<i>Justinian</i>, also with provisions, and that the ship that
passed was the <i>Lady Juliana</i> which ship had been cleared at
Port Jackson and dispatched on her voyage to China. The
<i>Justinian</i> and <i>Surprise</i> being also chartered for
China, we are yet without an opportunity of being removed form
Norfolk island. Besides these ships, the <i>Neptune</i> and
<i>Scarborough</i> had arrived at Port Jackson and although all
these arrivals were in the beginning of June and in the course of
the same month, it was not judged necessary to send relief to the
unfortunate on Norfolk island until the 27th July and 1st August on
which days the <i>Justinian</i> and <i>Surprise</i> left Port
Jackson.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 209]</p>

<p>The reason for their having been so long detained seems only to
be known to our very humane Governor, who no doubt must have felt
much for the distressed situation of the five hundred inhabitants
on Norfolk island. If we even allow him to possess only those
feeling which a reasonable being would have for a fellow creature,
it is unaccountable what could have kept him from relieving us
sooner. These transports, besides provisions, stores and convicts,
brought out part of the Forest Rangers an independent corps raised
for the protection of the colony in New South Wales.</p>

<p>We are informed that the <i>Gorgon</i> was very soon expected at
Port Jackson with the new Lieutenant-Governor and the remainder of
the Forest Rangers, provisions, stores etc. The marines are to be
relieved by this corps and we are informed by the Governor that the
fficers and company of the <i>Sirius</i> are also to return to
England in the <i>Gorgon</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Guardian</i>, a new 44-gun ship, commanded by Lieutenant
Riou, which sailed from England in September '89, with provisions
and stores, and very amply supplied with every necessary for the
settlement, had taken a great quantity of cattle and other articles
on board at the Cape of Good Hope and proceeding on her voyage, in
lat. 44° south and long. 44° east unfortunately run upon a piece of
drift ice from an ice island which she struck on her bow. The Ice
overset and as she passed struck her abaft, carrying away the
rudder and part of the stern post.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 210]</p>

<p>In this situation, which was thought impossible for her to keep
above water long, she was deserted by part of the officers and crew
who, having permission, took to the boats. The long boat, in which
was the master, was taken up by a French ship, which ship the
<i>Justinian</i> spoke with. The account they gave of the
<i>Guardian</i> was that she had foundered. This circumstance
induced the master of the <i>Justinian</i> to push for New South
Wales, with touching at the Cape of Good Hope, supposing the colony
was much distressed.</p>

<p>By letters received from Lieutenant Riou we find that the
<i>Guardian</i> was brought into the Cape and, after laying some
time, was hauled on shore in Table Bay. We also hear that the
<i>Supply</i> sailed from Port Jackson the 17th of April for
Batavia, at which place a ship was to be hired to take in
provisions for the relief of the settlement, that she was ordered
to call at Norfolk island but not to lose more than 5 days in doing
it. We conclude that the strong easterly winds, which at that time
prevailed, prevented Lieutenant Ball from making the island.</p>

<p>The Governor has, by these ships, ordered spars for masts to be
got ready against the arrival of the <i>Gorgon</i>, which are
intended to be taken in her to England for trial at the Kings Dock
Yards. The 1st lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i> was sent on board on
one of these ships and a midshipman on board the other to assist
them with the knowledge our own misfortunes had given us of the
place.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 August 1790</p>

<p>The 17th. A cutter belonging to the <i>Sirius</i>, with
Provisions and convicts in, was thrown upon the reef by a sudden
surf. The boat instantly went to pieces.</p>

<p>Two seamen, one convict man, three women and one child were
drowned. Clearing these ships was rendered very tedious by the
surf, until the 22nd. When the weather settled moderate and but
little surf on the 27th, they were both cleared. The same day
martial law was discontinued, the cause for which it was judged
necessary being done away by the supply of provisions landed from
the two ships. Whole allowance was now issued.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 August 1790</p>

<p>Monday, 30th pm. The <i>Surprise</i> sailed for China and at
11am the <i>Justinian</i>. The island being now relieved and at
full allowance of provisions, every public work went on in the
usual way according to the directions given by Major Ross, who had
a detached party about 2 miles to the westward of Sydney Bay,
building huts etc. for the reception of people who were to be sent
there to cultivate that part of the island.</p>

<p>A person who had been sent for the purpose of manufacturing the
flax was settled at Cascade Bay, at which part of the island there
was little else done, although by far the most eligible part for
settling the hills surrounding the valley first cultivated by Mr.
King, employed the other labouring people.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="feb91" id="feb91"></a>February
1791</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 212]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 February 1791</p>

<p>February, 6th. At daylight a sail was discovered to the SW which
proved to be the <i>Supply</i> from Port Jackson, at which place
she had been 3 months before Governor Phillip thought proper to
send her for that information so necessary for him. It was now 11
months since our misfortunes had brought us to a miserable and
uncertain state and although there were ships that could have
returned after relieving the island in August last, time enough to
have saved the season to China, it was not thought necessary to
remove the <i>Sirius</i>'s ships company, or to have any return
from the island, although the last accounts of us were that not a
cask of provision was, at that time, saved from the wreck but that
some had been lost in making the attempt.</p>

<p>The <i>Supply</i> made a tolerable passage to Batavia,
discovered a shoal off the Coast of New South Wales north end of it
in latitude 21°24'S, 159°24'E and passed to the northward of it.
They made the east part of that land named by Mr. Shortland New
Georgia and passed along the east coast of it until squally weather
obliged them to leave it and steer to the northward.</p>

<p>They arrived at Batavia the [no date in journal] of July soon
after which Mr. King sailed in a Dutch packet with dispatches for
England. Lieutenant Ball took on board as much provisions as the
<i>Supply</i> could store and hired a Dutch snow which was also
loaded and sailed soon after the <i>Supply</i> from Batavia. She
arrived safe, was cleared and ready to sail when the <i>Supply</i>
left Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 213]</p>

<p>The season while the <i>Supply</i> was at Batavia was very
unhealthy. Several of her people died there and Lieutenant Fowell,
who was sent to conduct the third vessel to Port Jackson, died on
board the <i>Supply</i> soon after she sailed, he having been taken
on board her as the only chance of saving his life when the fever
attacked him. One of the midshipmen was left in his stead. The
whole of the crew belonging to the Dutch vessel also died and left
only the commander who had to get hands to man his vessel, a second
time. They brought some account of a war between Great Britain and
Spain, but by no means circumstantial or from good authority.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 February 1791</p>

<p>Saturday 12th, pm. Captain Hunter, with the officers and crew of
the <i>Sirius</i>, embarked on board the <i>Supply</i> and sailed
immediately for Port Jackson, where we arrived the 26th.</p>

<p>Directions etc. for ships going to Norfolk island. Norfolk
island is situated in 29°03'S, 168°02'E, is 5 miles in length, east
and west, and about 3, north and south. Three miles to the
southward of Norfolk island is Phillip island, about 1¼ miles in
length and ½ mile in breadth. There is a high sugarloaf peak runs
up from the south side of it, which may be seen as far as the
highest part of Norfolk island. Between there is a smaller island
called Nepean island, about ½ mile from the east point of Sydney
Bay, which is situated on the south side of Norfolk island and
where the settlement was made in March 1788.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 214]</p>

<p>This Bay is sheltered somewhat by Nepean and Phillip islands
from the E and SE winds, but the ground is very bad for anchoring,
that which is clear of rocks being loose sand and coral that a ship
would find it difficult to ride in a fresh breeze of wind. There is
a reef of clay and coral extends along the bay which dries from ½
ebb to ½ flood, the outer part more than half a cable's length from
the shore. Through this reef, just to the westward of the
flagstaff, is the channel leading to the landing places, which is
nothing but a gully through between the end of this reef which
dries all the way from the east point of the bay and rocks just
below the surface to the westward of it. Round this point of the
reef one passage runs in through the coral reef in an angle to the
flagstaff and is the safest channel, being sheltered by the point
of the reef when round it and those stones which had hitherto
rendered it dangerous for boats at low water being removed.</p>

<p>The other channel is straight in from the end of the reef,
through broken parts of the coral reef to the westward of the
flagstaff and in the narrowest part is not room for a 6 sand (sic)
cutter's oars, which together with its being exposed to a second
surf after having passed the end of the reef makes it very
dangerous and it was much more so before a middle rock (which boats
could not pass over at low water) was removed by the
<i>Sirius</i>'s people at the same time they cleared the other
channel. There is always an outset in both passages and sometimes
so strong that I have seen a boat with 6 oars several minutes
without being able to get ahead.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 215]</p>

<p>It is generally strongest just as the reef begins to be covered,
or when the surf is high and beats over the eastern part of it,
there being a large space of water between the flagstaff and east
point within the reef, which forces itself at these times over that
part of the reef that dries to the flagstaff and forms a passage to
the landing place through which it runs out like a sluice.</p>

<p>From the knowledge I have of this circumstance, I think it but
common justice to the memory of Mr. Cunningham, who was drowned in
this passage, to declare that the reflection cast on him in a book
published by Stockdale and said to be compiled from papers
furnished by the public boards, is not only unjust, but that he
lost his life using his utmost endeavours to obey the orders of Mr.
King the commandant, which were an impossibility to effect, instead
of not attending to them as is so shamefully and falsely
represented in that publication.</p>

<p>There is no danger in approaching Norfolk island, or those
adjacent from the sea, there not being anything laying more than ½
a mile from the Shore. Ships coming to this island with west, south
west or southerly winds scarce ever meet with an opportunity of
landing in Sydney Bay on their arrival. It would be much better for
a ship to wait a smooth time (which frequently happens for several
days together) than to risk a boat when the surf is high at times,
although smooth at intervals.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 216]</p>

<p>In general there is landing in Sydney Bay with the wind from the
south east round to the northward to west, but when to the
southward of west or south east, very seldom. Sometimes the surf
rises without any apparent cause. I have seen a very heavy surf
when the wind has been two days off the land after its rising. When
there is no landing in Sydney Bay there is generally smooth water
in Cascade Bay, about a mile round the NE end of the island. The
landing is on a black rock standing out from, but joining, the
shore and steep too, a little to the eastward of a kind of stoney
beach composed of very large stones. To this rock the boats back
in. Here people and small packages may be landed, and I think the
landing of provisions very practicable by fixing a derrick in the
black rock, which is of sufficient base, and making a rowling way
from it to the valley at the beach where the flax manufactory is
carrying on and where a store could be built to receive it until it
could be conveyed over to the general store.</p>

<p>If this was done a ship would never long be detained as she
could be clearing on one side of the island or the other. Sydney
and Cascade Bays are the only places where provisions or stores can
be landed, but people may, at times, be landed in Balls Bay, which
is to the southward of the NE point of the island. At Duncombe Bay,
which is between Cascade Bay and the NW point of the island and at
Ansons Bay which is situated round a point about a mile to the
southward of the NW point, from either of these it would be
impossible to remove stores or provisions, on account of the
perpendicular hills that surround them.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 217]</p>

<p>The ground off the north side of the island is much clearer of
rocks than off the south side. A ship may lay safely and smooth
with SW or S winds off Cascade or Duncombe Bay and by anchoring
prevent being driven away to the eastward. There is also good
anchoring ground to the NE of Nepean island, the flagstaff on with
Point Hunter in 14 fathoms, mud and sand and is the only muddy
bottom I know about the island.</p>

<p>There is a reef off the west point of Sydney Bay running SE by S
from near ½ a mile from the shore to the outer sunken rocks which,
being just below the surface at low water, it always breaks, unless
the sea is uncommonly smooth. The tides in general are equal each
way. Flood runs to the SW by S and ebb to the NE by S. Ebbs and
flows very regular by the shore and is high water full and change ¼
before 8 o'clock. The tide makes two hours sooner on the Norfolk
island shore than in the stream or over by Phillip island.</p>

<p>We have experienced that the tides are subject to unaccountable
turns, sometimes running the greatest part of the day to the SW and
sometimes the contrary. Although this but very seldom happens it
makes it necessary for the safety of a ship that she should bring
too and lay the tide before she comes into the bay within a line
drawn from the outer rocks of the reef off the west point to the
south part of Nepean Island. Seven fathoms is full near enough to
come to the back of the reef in the most favourable time.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 218]</p>

<p>The SE and S winds are baffling, frequently shifting several
points, particularly when close over to Norfolk Island, which
should be attended to, for if a ship cannot lay up SSW the eastern
tide will heave her in upon the shore. The west side of the bay is
full of rocks and not safe for a ship to go farther over than to
bring the two flagstaffs in one.</p>

<p>There is a bed of rocks to the westward of the little bay in
Nepean Island and more than a cable's length from it, on some parts
of which there is not more than 3¼ fathoms at low water. This lies
much in the way coming into the bay from the eastward and makes it
dangerous for a ship to go within the island unless the wind is
steady and off the shore, or a strong weather tide, as there is not
any safe passage between Nepean Island and the east point of Sydney
Bay, the whole being a bed of rocks on several of which is only 3,
and on two of them only 2 fathoms at low water and probably many
more not yet discovered. I have crossed this channel several times
and kept sight of the bottom all across, by which alone I was
enabled to find the top of those rocks, which are so small that
they might be passed over unnoticed in a boat rowing across and,
keeping the lead going in the usual way, the middle is all a rocky
flat of 5 fathoms with rocks or stones rising from and laying upon
it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 219]</p>

<p>Within less than ½ a cable of the island is the part I would
recommend if a ship should be under a necessity of attempting it.
The <i>Supply</i> has been through, but that was before any dangers
were discovered in it. She was fortunate enough to pass clear of
all. Going through between Phillip and Nepean Islands, take care of
a reef which runs off to the eastward of the south end of Nepean
Island about a ¼ of a mile to the outer sunken rock between which,
and the outer part of the reef that dries at low water, is a
passage with 8 and 10 fathoms through which a ship may go, but
unless pressed I would recommend going round it, which you do by
keeping the western extreme of Norfolk Island open to the southward
of Nepean Island until you open the points of Balls Bay, when you
may haul round to the NE.</p>

<p>The marks for this outer sunken rock are the two points of Balls
Bay on and the bluff on the SE part of Nepean island. Sight on with
the dry reef. It breaks in bad weather and has 10 fathoms close
round it. There are several ragged rocks running out from that part
of Phillip Island opposite to Sydney Bay, one of which is but just
above the surface and lies farther from the island than the others.
They are steep too, and deep water round them. SSE ½ mile from the
west end of Phillip Island is a little rock above water, from which
all round the south side of the island appears to be foul
ground.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 220]</p>

<p>There are sunken rocks off the NE point of Norfolk Island which
do not always break. They lay NE from it about ¼ of a mile and 20
fathoms just without it. It is necessary to give it a good birth in
hauling round for Cascade Bay. There is sounding 30 and 40 fathoms
some miles round Norfolk Island. In Sydney Bay, the flood runs SW
by S, ebb NE by N. On the east and west ends southward, ebb to the
northward as the land lies, and on the north side nearly west and
east. The flood sets strong over the NE end of Phillip Island and
along by the shore as the land lies, the ebb the same over the west
end.</p>

<p>Between the islands the tides are very strong. It flows ¼ before
at full and change rises 6 or 7 feet and makes 2 hours sooner on
the Norfolk Island shore than in the stream, or by Phillip
Island.</p>

<p>A ship may water in Sydney Bay very well with small casks
particularly if the island boats are used for that purpose.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island is a very healthy situation as will appear from
there having been only 3 natural deaths since it was first settled
in March 1788. The casual deaths are 2 killed by trees falling on
them and 14 drowned, at which time a small party was sent under the
command of Lieutenant King of the <i>Sirius</i>, since which time
the number of inhabitants have been continually increasing by
draughts from Port Jackson and in March 1790 the Lieutenant
Governor, with 2 companies of marines and 200 convicts, were sent
there, and Lieutenant King removed. After the <i>Sirius</i> was
wrecked, the number of people on the island was 507 and in August
following, 200 more were sent from Port Jackson.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 221]</p>

<p>The soil is in most parts good and by those who are judges, from
having been long used to farming, said to be capable of producing
anything. The ground has been much infested with the caterpillars
which run over it, clearing all before them, and particularly this
last season, when the crops were scarce seed corn for the
ground.</p>

<p>The pines which are in size equal to any in the world, are said
to be, by the carpenters, of very bad quality. Not having any
terpentine in the tree [they] will never be fit for masts. What
little terpentine they have is between the bark and the tree. The
body of the tree has a moisture like water all through it, which
makes it very heavy and when that water is drained from it, they
think the wood of no substance. However we have cut down and left
there a top mast and topsailyard for a 74 gun ship, a 32 gun
frigate, and a sloop of war, and a rough spar ready to be taken to
England for trial as ordered. In getting those 7 spars, 34 trees
were cut down, 27 of which proved defective. It makes good plank
for flooring, etc.</p>

<p>There are several other kinds of wood on the island, a great
variety of the fern tree and great quantities of the palm
cabbage.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 222]</p>

<p>The birds, which so providentially afforded us subsistence from
March until August, when relief arrived from Port Jackson, cannot
again be expected for some years, from the vast number of eggs and
young birds that were destroyed and the ground in which they
burrowed being torn up, but for a small number of inhabitants the
birds may always be a resource in case of accident happening to a
ship with supplies or other failure.</p>

<p>I do not think that fish can ever be considered as a resource to
trust to, from the danger and difficulty of getting them and the
scarcity of them in the winter season, during August,
September.</p>

<p>October and until the latter end of November, we did not get
fish, the boat returning several times without one and whilst the
<i>Justinian</i> and the <i>Surprise</i> were about the island from
the 4th to the 30th of August there was not a fish caught on board
either of them, although they tried on every side of the island.
They are very plenty in the summer season, mostly of the snapper
kind. Many sharks are met with and during the months of July and
August several whales were about and between the islands. The
number of people on Norfolk Island after we embarked were as
follows;</p>

<pre>

Officers, marines and free people  93
Men convicts                      227
Women convicts                    245
children of ditto                  62

Total                             627

</pre>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 223]</p>

<p>The ground cleared at Norfolk Island when we left it was 130
acres, from the best accounts I could get, including gardens,
private and public. Tobacco thrives very well as does the plaintain
and sugar cane. The vines were just beginning to bear this season.
The ground is certainly capable of producing everything usually
found in the same climate and although the crop of corn belonging
to the public failed the last season, there were some remarkable
fine crops on the ground belonging to some of the officers who had
followed the same plan as had been at first adopted, which was not
the case with that belonging to the government. However, the whole
of that failure is laid to the caterpillars.</p>

<p>The island is very well watered, except just at the west and
north west end, and there, in the summer season, the runs or
streams are quite dried up. At all the other parts of the island it
has never failed. It rises from springs in different parts of the
island, one of which takes its course through the valley first
cleared and empties itself in a little bay formed by the east part
of Sydney Bay.It passes under ground and forces itself up through a
hole in the rocks (which dry at low water) a fathom deep. Neither
Phillip or Nepean Islands have any water on them, from which
circumstance and the great difficulty of landing on them, they are
of no other use to Norfolk Island than that of breaking the sea
from Sydney Bay in SE or E winds. The whole three taken together do
not contain more that 16 square miles which is but a small spot for
the purpose that government have sent so many people to.</p>

<p class="caption">'Governor's House at Sydney, Port Jackson,
1791'</p>

<p>It was the 22nd before we made Lord Howe Island, which we passed
15 leagues to the northward of, at which distance the land joining
the two mountains is just seen. We had very unsettled weather,
arrived at Port Jackson the 26th, where we found the Dutch snow
laying, and that there had not been any arrivals from England since
those ships that arrived last June, chartered for China, in
consequence of which, and having been particularly disappointed at
not yet seeing the <i>Gorgon</i> who was to have sailed immediately
after those ships, the Governor had detained the Dutch snow and
entered into a contract with the master of her to carry the
officers and crew of the <i>Sirius</i> to England.</p>

<p>We found that the natives had lately become familiar, several of
them staying chiefly in the camp, and at the Governor's. Bennelong
had, sometime since, made his escape and joined his old friend,
Colbee, and other companions. Early in September the Governor,
hearing that Bennelong and Colbee had been seen in Collins Cove in
the northern arm, went down there and, after passing some time in
the most familiar and friendly manner, was suddenly wounded with a
spear, the particulars of which occurrence I take from Lieutenant
Waterhouse who was present at the time and saw the whole
transactions. His words are:</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 226]</p>

<p class="newspaper">On Tuesday, 7th September ultimo, I went down
the harbour with the Governor and Captain Collins to the look out
post at the South Head at which place the Governor marked out the
ground and gave directions for building a column, or landmark, for
ships coming in from the sea, and was returning up the harbour when
a boat that was coming up from Collins Cove (after having landed a
party who were going to Broken Bay) made signals to speak with us.
On their coming up, the coxswain informed the Governor that the
gentlemen going to Broken Bay had had a long conference with Colbee
and Bennelong in Collins Cove, that they had enquired for every
person whom they knew and particularly for the Governor, that
Bennelong had sent him a piece of whale and said he would return
with the Governor if he would go down to him. In consequence of
which the Governor went immediately to the look out post, it being
the nearest place, and got everything that he thought would be
acceptable and frunished themselves with 4 muskets and a pistol
[and] went down into Collins Cove. In our way down we found that
only two of the muskets could be fired, both of which were loaded,
as was the pistol. When we got into Collins Cove, we saw several
natives assembled round a fire opposite to a whale that had been
thrown ashore. The Governor stood up and asked (in the native
tongue) where was Bennelong. He [Bennelong] answered immediately
that he was there. He [the Governor] told him that he was the
Governor, his father, which name Bennelong had desired to call him
by, while living with him.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 227]</p>

<p class="newspaper">The Governor, after desiring Captain Collins
and me to stay by the boat and have the muskets ready, stepped out
and advanced up the beach with his hands and arms open. They did
not seem much inclined to come down, however the Governor
persevered and followed them into the woods until out of our sight
and had a parley with some of them, One of whom (found afterwards
to be Bennelong) repeatedly called him Governor and Father, after
which and having shook hands together, the Governor returned to the
boat and took a man up with him with some wine, beef and bread and
some presents. On his holding up the bottle, one of them called out
wine and repeated several English words. Two of them came forward
and received the things and one of them drank some wine. In a short
time the Governor came again to the boat, told Captain Collins what
he had done, but that Colbee or Bennelong was not there, and asked
Captain Collins to walk up with him, desiring me still to remain by
the boat. As they went up I frequently heard a man on the right of
them call out Bennelong, and told him of something he had observed
as we kept the boat on her oars, which might reasonably occasion
some mistrust as the same precaution was observed when they were
forcibly taken away and in the same cove where the boat was now
laying. Shortly afterwards a man came to me, said that Bennelong
and Colbee were there, and that Bennelong had enquired for me and
that the Governor desired that I would come up, which I immediately
did.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 228]</p>

<p class="newspaper">On my getting up the bank I perceived several
of the natives on each side and eight or ten in the front all armed
with spears, except Colbee and Bennelong with whom the Governor
appeared to be in earnest conversation. I went up to them, but did
not know Bennelong until he was pointed out to me. I then
recollected him very well and we shook hands. I asked him several
questions alluding to circumstances that had happened while he
lived with us, which he perfectly understood and both him and
Colbee asked me several. Bennelong, at the time the Governor was
up, had a remarkable good spear, which he asked for. Bennelong
either could not, or would not, understand him but took the spear
and laid it down in the grass, during all which time perfect
harmony subsisted. The natives appeared now to be closing round us,
of which the Governor took notice and said he thought we had better
retreat. There were then 19 armed men near us and many more that we
could not see. The Governor then assured Bennelong he would return
in two days and bring with him the clothes he used to wear and 2
hatchets, which they are remarkably fond of, one for Colbee and one
for himself, with which they seemed much pleased and often repeated
it that it might not be forgot. Just as we were going, Bennelong
pointed out and named several of the natives that were about us,
one in particular to whom the Governor presented his hand and
advanced towards him, at which he seemed frightened, and seized the
spear that Bennelong had laid down in the grass and immediately
threw it with great violence.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 229]</p>

<p class="newspaper">All those who were near retreated with great
precipitation. The spear struck the Governor, entered the right
shoulder and went through about 3 inches, just behind the shoulder
blade, close to the back bone. I immediately concluded that he was
killed and supposed there was not a chance for any of us to escape.
I turned round to run for the boat as I perceived Captain Collins
running that way and calling to the people in the boat to bring
muskets up. The Governor also attempted to run, holding the spear
with both hands to keep the end off the ground, but owing to the
length of it, the end took the ground and stopped him short. I
suppose it was 12 feet long. He then begged me, for God's sake, to
haul the spear out, which I immediately stopped to do, when I
recollected that I should only haul the barb into his flesh again
which we knew to be an inch long. I then determined on breaking it
off and bent it down for that purpose, but owing to its length
could not do it. I then bent it upward but could not break it. Just
at this instant another spear came and grazed the skin off between
the thumb and forefinger of my right hand. I own it frightened me
and I believe added to my exertions, for the next sudden jerk it
broke short off. Spears were then flying very thick, one of which I
perceived fall close at Capt Collins feet as he was speaking to the
boat crew. The Governor then fired a pistol which, with a musket
that was fired by the sailors who had then got between the natives
and us, enabled us to get down to the beach.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 230]</p>

<p class="newspaper">The Governor was lifted into the boat, he
being very faint. Captain Collins soon joined us with the boat
crew, when we put off, and got up to Sydney within two hours, when
the surgeons who were immediately sent for made us all happy by
confidently assuring the Governor there were not any fatal
consequences to be apprehended. The spear was then extracted and in
6 weeks he was able to get about again.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>There are different opinions as to Colbee and Bennelong being
accessary to this assault, which I cannot but mistrust was the
case. However they were afterwards encouraged to come up to the
camp, which was soon effected and now they are chiefly about the
Governor's House with many more of their friends. Bennelong has a
house built for him on the east point of Sydney Cove which he and
his companions frequently visit. Notwithstanding this apparently
friendly intercourse I cannot think they are to be trusted, from
their having so frequently attacked those who they thought were not
provided with fire arms and surprising and murdering some who had
muskets. In one instance, soon after our arrival from Norfolk
Island, Bennelong and his friends behaved very well in swimming off
to a boat that had overset just off Sydney Cove. They brought the
people, boat and everything belonging to her safe ashore and helped
them to repair the boat and launch her again.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 231]</p>

<p>Bennelong's sister and two children (who she swam to shore with)
were in the boat when she overset. The Governor and those gentlemen
who attend to the getting a vocabulary of the native language have
made considerable progress in it, but many of the customs of these
savages yet remain doubtful as to the cause.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="mar91" id="mar91"></a>March 1791</p>

<p>While we were at Port Jackson, I went with the Governor and a
party to Bennelong's house on the east point of the cove to see a
dance, according to previous notice given to Bennelong, who had
assembled many of his friends for the purpose of entertaining us.
They began soon after dark, having several small fires for the
purpose of giving light. They placed us in a ring within which they
were to perform. Their music was that of a man beating two sticks
and singing to it and some of the women who did not dance,
accompanied the music by beating on their thighs with the hollow of
their hands. The dance began with the little boys and then the men
joined in. They danced a variety of figures, all of which were
observed to have regularity and good order in them, so much that if
any of the fires were in their way they danced through them. The
number that danced were 24 men, women and children. There were
several more there and plenty of spears laying by them. After
entertaining us about an hour and they supposed we were going,
Bennelong asked if we would have one more dance, which was agreed
to, and we then parted, several of the children returning with
us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 232]</p>

<p>I also went to Rose Hill, of which I can say but little. The
soil does not go any depth. A few inches in many parts goes into a
perfect sand and it is but in small patches in any part that the
soil is a foot deep. The return got from the last crop only bore
the proportion of 5 to 2 that was sowed, which is only 2½ for one.
It is the opinion of some that it never will produce good crops of
corn. The quantity of ground cleared at Rose Hill this 9th March,
is</p>

<pre>

Land cleared for corn, 213 acres
Land for buildings, gardens etc., 80 acres
Area in three parks, 121 acres

Total 414 Acres

</pre>

<p>But it is to be observed that the trees are only cut down and
removed, and the ground cleared and turned up with the roots of the
trees remaining in it, that all the labour is with the grubbing hoe
and spade. The plough cannot be used until the ground is more
effectually cleared. There has been several excursions made into
the country, all of which serve but to furnish as many proofs of
the sterility of the inland parts of the County of Cumberland. The
other parts of the coasts or country have not yet been
examined.</p>

</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[between Pages 232-233]</p>

<h2>Account of the different kinds of Timber and the use it is fit
for, in Port Jackson</h2>

<p>No. 1. Gum Tree. The gum very dark; the wood white; fit for
little but the fire, but very good for that.</p>

<p>2: Iron Wood. No gum in it; grows very tall and large all about;
but near Rose Hill in particular; fit for large beams, girders,
etc.; a very good timber for such large uses though very hard to
cut and to work.</p>

<p>3. Corkwood. Called so because the bark is like cork; grows near
the sea side, just within the harbour; none inland, not even so far
as Sydney; it is a very good timber though very scarce; no gum in
it; the largest that has been seen was about 2 feet diameter; fit
for almost any purpose, but for boats and for light boarding in
particular, such as doors etc.</p>

<p>4. The Peppermint Tree: So called because the leaves taste
strongly like peppermint and give an oil, much like the oil of
peppermint; would make very good and handsome furniture, but has
not been at all used by us in buildings, because it does not run
sufficiently long before it branches; there is some gum in it.</p>

<p>5. The Tea Tree. So called because a little of the leaves being
put into the native tea gives it a pleasant spicy taste; works very
easy and smooth; more fit for furniture than anything else; they
are mostly unsound, though no gum in them.</p>

<p>6. The Swamp Mahogany: Grows in, or close to swamps; some of it
turns out very good timber and perhaps all would if not very old;
fit for furniture, or framing, such as doors etc.; the largest to
be found is about 18 inches diameter; no gum in it to damage it at
all.</p>

<p>7. The High Ground Mahogany: Grows on higher ground; is best
wood for furniture of any in the country; it runs to about 2½ feet
diameter and sound; fit for doors, wainscots, door frames, etc.</p>

<p>8. Brown Barked Gum Tree: Exceeding good timber for large uses;
grows in the kangaroo ground and about Rose Hill; to the height of
80 to 100 feet without a branch; some have been cut which were 9 or
10 inches diameter at about 80 feet from the base and quite sound;
it is fit for very large beams etc., boards for flooring, door
frames and for every use in common; no gum to hurt in it.</p>

<p>9. Blue Barked Gum Tree: But little different from that last
mentioned, and nothing inferior in respect to size or use.</p>

<p>10. Turpentine Tree. So called because a very small quantity of
a kind of turpentine is found between the bark and the timber; the
largest from 3 to 4 feet in diameter at the base; fit for any kind
of building uses, board, flooring etc.; no gum in it.</p>

<p>11. Pine Tree: So called for no other reason than that the
leaves nearly resemble those of the pine tree; very good framing
timber; also for laths, shingles, flooring etc.; no gum in it.</p>

<p>12. Honeysuckle Tree: Called so because it bears a flower which
contains a great quantity of honey; Grown in sandy and rocky
ground; has been used particularly for staves and felloes of
wheels, wheelbarrows and some boards etc.; does not often grow to
more than 10 to 12 feet high and from 1 to 2 feet diameter; very
crooked; no gum in it.</p>

<h2><a name="acc-bounty" id="acc-bounty"></a> Account of the
<i>Bounty</i> by Lieutenant Bligh</h2>

<p>Bounty Armed Vessel:</p>

<p>I introduce here among my general memorandums, as it in some
degree relates to the new colony and public service.</p>

<p>Cape of Good Hope, December 20th 1789</p>

<p>Sir, Having been so unfortunate as to lose His Majesty's Armed
Vessel <i>Bounty</i>, I have transmitted to you an account of the
failure of the voyage I had the honour to be entrusted with and
also a description list of the pirates. I passed through Endeavor
Strait in the latitude of 10°30'S, between the Prince of Wales's
Islands about which are a number of dangerous shoals. I saw but a
few islands to the northward of me and I have reason to think that
a tolerable fair passage may be found through to the westward about
the latitude of 10°00'S. I was to have explored this strait, which
I should have done from the side of New Guinea. Coupang, in Timor,
lies 12 miles to the NE of the SW part of the island in latitude
10°12'S, longitude by my account 125°45'E, but by the Dutch
121°5'E. It is a safe and convenient road and affords good water
which can be conveniently got. Other supplies are doubtful, but
what cattle they can spare are tolerably good. It is a pleasant
village situated on the sides of a fine river. The resident with
four other people in the civil department and about 30 soldiers are
the whole of the Europeans. The northside of the island is the most
eligible way for a ship to come from the eastward. One ship trades
here for the Dutch East India Company and is not allowed to lie in
the road before the 10th of March.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 234]</p>

<p>In April the easterly monsoon is set in and continues until the
middle of October or beginning of November. The wind is however a
little variable until December when the west monsoon is steady with
rains as the east monsoon is in May with fine weather. The island
Pamow gives good anchoring places in the west monsoon. Oranges,
limes, breadfruit, fine coconuts, nancas, karambolas and other
fruit are to be got at Timor. The horses are small and but few
sheep or goats. No more rice or Indian corn is cultivated than is
used. They have the mountain rice which does not require any more
water than the common rain. There are some Portuguese settlements
on the north part of the island, who are, from report, a very
miserable set of people. I have thought it my duty to say so much
of Timor as it is a place but little known and lies eligible for a
stopping place if Endeavour Strait is found a safe route for
shipping.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bligh's account of the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>Lieutenant W. Bligh presents the following account of the loss
of His Majesty's Armed Vessel <i>Bounty</i>, unto His Excellency
Arthur Phillip Esquire, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of December 1787 I sailed from Spithead with H.M.S.
<i>Bounty</i> under my Command for Otaheite, there to take on board
the breadfruit plant for the West Indies. The burthen of the ship
was nearly 215 tons; her extreme length on deck 90ft. 10in. and
breadth from outside to outside of the bends 24ft. 3 in.; a flush
deck and a pretty figurehead of a woman in riding habit. She
mounted 4 four pounders and 10 swivels and her complement was:</p>

<pre>

1 Lieutenant and Commander, 2 master's mates, 1 gunmen mate,
1 master, 2 midshipmen, 1 carpenters mate, 1 boatswain, 1 clerk,
1 sailmaker, 1 gunner, 2 quartermasters, 1 armourer, 1 carpenter,
1 quartermaster's mate, 1 carpenter's crew, 1 surgeon,
1 boatswain's mate, 1 corporal, 24 able seamen

Total 45, one of which is a widow's man.
There was likewise a botanist and his assistant.

</pre>

<p>On the 23rd. of March 1788, I doubled Staten Land and attempted
to make my passage round Cape Horn between the latitudes of 59° and
61°, but I met with such dreadful tempestuous weather and high seas
with hail and snow storms, that although I tried 30 days I could
not accomplish it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 236]</p>

<p>I therefore, (as my people were getting ill and as I had the
honour to have the most discretionary orders to do as I thought
best for the voyage) determined to bear away for the Cape of Good
Hope on the 23rd of April and repassed Staten Land the next day. On
the 24th of May I anchored in False Bay and, having refitted and
completed my stores and provisions, I sailed on the 1st of July,
arrived at Van Diemen's Land 20th of August and after wooding and
watering, I sailed from thence the 4th September.</p>

<p>On the 19th September, after having passed the south part of New
Zealand, I discovered very dangerous rocky islets, never known
before. They extend 3½ miles east and west and 1½ north and south.
They lie from the traps off the south end of New Zealand, S89°E,
146 leagues latitude of them in 47°44'S, 179°09'E. Called them
Bounty Isles. I arrived at Otaheite the 26th of October and
remained until the 4th April 1789, when I sailed with 1015
breadfruit plants and many other fruit kind, in all 774 pots, 39
tubs and 24 boxes. Observed in Totourah harbour, 17°31'30"S,
210°31'37"E. I anchored at Anamocka the 24th April and left it the
26th.</p>

<p>On the 28th a, little before sunrise, Fletcher Christian, who
was mate of the ship, and officer of the watch with the ship's
corporal, came into my cabin while I was asleep and, seizing, me
tied my hands, assisted by others who were also in the cabin, all
armed with muskets and bayonets. I was now threatened with instant
death if I spoke a word.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 237]</p>

<p>I, however, called for assistance and awakening every one, but
the officers who were in their cabins were secured by centinels at
their doors, so that no one could come to me. The arms were all
taken possession of and I was forced on deck in my shirt with my
hands tied behind my back and secured by a guard abaft the mizzen
mast, during which the mutineers expressed much joy that they would
soon again see Otaheite.</p>

<p>I now demanded of Christian the cause of such a violent act, but
no other answer was given but <i>hold your tongue sir, or you are
dead this instant</i> and, holding me by the line which tied my
hands, he often threatened to stab me in the breast with a bayonet
he held in his right hand. I however did my utmost to rally the
disaffected villains to a sense of their duty, but to no
effect.</p>

<p>The boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out and while I
was kept under a guard abaft the mizzen mast, the officers and men
not concerned in the mutiny were ordered into the boat. This being
done, I was told by Christian, <i>Captain Bligh, your officers and
men are now in the boat and you must go with them</i>, and with the
guard they carried me across the deck with their bayonets presented
on every side. When making another effort, one villain said to the
other, <i>blow his brains out</i>. I was at last forced into the
boat and we were then veered astern, in all 19 souls. I was at this
time 10 leagues from Tofoa the NW most of the Friendly Islands.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 238]</p>

<p>The boatswain and carpenter, with some other, whilst the boat
was alongside, collected several necessary things and water, and
with some difficulty a compass and quadrant were got, but arms of
no kind, nor any maps or drawings of which I had a valuable
collection. The boat was very deep and much lumbered and in this
condition we were cast adrift with about 28 gallons of water, 150
lbs of bread, 30 lb of pork, 6 quarts of rum and 6 bottles of wine.
The day was calm, attended with light breezes and I got to Tofoa by
7 o'clock in the evening but found no place to land, the shore
being so steep and rocky:</p>

<p>On the 30th I found landing in a Cove on the NW part of the
island and here I remained in search of supplies until the 2nd of
May when the natives, discovering that we had no fire arms, they
made an attack upon us with clubs and stones, in the course of
which I had the misfortune to lose a very worthy man (John Norton,
quartermaster) and most of us hurt, more or less. Getting into our
boat was no security, for they followed us in canoes loaded with
stones, which they threw with much force and exactness. Happily,
night saved the rest of us.</p>

<p>I had determined to go to Amsterdam in search of Poulahow, the
King, but taking this transaction as a sample of their natural
dispositions, there was little hopes to expect much from them, for
I considered their good behaviour hitherto as owing to a dread of
our fire arms and now, knowing that we had none, would not be the
case and that supposing our lives were safe, our boat and every
thing would be taken from us and thereby I should never be able to
return.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 239]</p>

<p>I was also earnestly solicited by all hands to take them towards
home and when I told them no hopes of relief remained for us but
what I might find at New Holland, until I came to Timor, a distance
of 1200 leagues, they all agreed to live on one ounce of bread per
day and a gill of water. I therefore, after recommending this
promise forever to their memory, bore away for New Holland and
Timor across a sea but little known and in a small boat deep loaded
with 18 people, without a single map of any kind and nothing but my
own recollection and general knowledge of the situation of places
to direct us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we lost part of our provisions, our stock now only
consisted of 20 lbs of pork, 3 bottles of wine, 5 of rum and 150
lbs of bread and 28 gallons of water. I steered to the WNW, with
strong gales and bad weather, suffering every calamity and
distress.</p>

<p>I discovered many islands and at last on the 28 May, the coast
of New Holland, and entered a break in the reef in latitude about
12°50'S and longitude 145°00'E. I kept on in the direction of this
coast to the northward, touching at such places as I found
convenient, refreshing my people by the best means in my power.
These refreshments consisted of oysters and a few clams. We were
greatly benefited by them and a few good nights rest. On the 4th of
June I passed the north part of New Holland, steered for Timor and
made it on the 12th, which was a happy sight for every one,
particularly several who perhaps could not have existed a week or a
day longer.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 240]</p>

<p>I followed the direction of the south side of the island and on
the 14th, in the afternoon, saw the island of Rotty and west part
of Timor, round which I got that night and took a Malay on board to
show me Coupang, where he informed me the Governor resided. On the
next morning before day I anchored under the fort and about 11
o'clock I saw the Governor who received me with great humanity and
kindness. Necessary directions were instantly given for our support
and perhaps a more miserable set of beings were never seen. Thus
happily ended, through the assistance of Divine Providence, without
accident, a voyage of the most extraordinary nature that ever
happened in the world. Let it be taken in its extent, duration and
so much want of the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The secrecy of this mutiny was beyond all conception, so that I
cannot discover that any who were with me had the least knowledge
of it, and the comparing this with the description list will show
the strength of the pirates.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 241]</p>

<p>I remained at Timor until the 20th of August when I sailed and
arrived at Batavia the 1st of October, from whence I sailed in a
Dutch packet on the 16th of October and arrived at the Cape of Good
Hope 16th of December.</p>

<p>The mutineers, after turning Captain Bligh adrift, made sail and
steered for the island Tubai, at which place they had determined to
fortify and settle themselves, but on their arrival, found
themselves destitute of almost every necessary towards effecting
their purpose. It was then agreed to go to Otaheite for those
necessaries, making the best story they could to deceive the
natives, in which they succeeded by telling that they had been at
an island, where they had met their old friend Captain Cook, (who
they had supposed was dead) and that he had kept Captain Bligh and
all those who were with him, at Tubai, and sent Mr. Christian with
the ship for what supplies they could grant.</p>

<p>They readily believed the story and were so overjoyed at hearing
that Captain Cook was alive and again in that part of the world,
that they furnished Christian with everything he wanted and even
gave them a bull and cow. With these they again all went to Tubai
and went on with every success towards settling; but soon
quarrelling among themselves, Christian lost his authority and
nothing was done. He then took their opinions, the majority of
which were for going to Otaheite, to which place Christian carried
them and afterwards left the island with the remainder and some
natives of Otaheite and which is the last account gained of
Christian by the <i>Pandora</i>.</p>

<p>Those who were left at Otaheite, built a schooner in which some
of them had embarked under the direction of Morrison, the
boatswain's mate, but soon, losing confidence in him, they again
returned to Otaheite, where Churchill was made a chief by the
natives and killed by Thompson in a quarrel, the consequence of
which was that the natives killed Thompson and offered him up as a
human sacrifice according to the custom used among them.</p>

<p>March 22nd. The <i>Supply</i> sailed for Norfolk Island with a
detachment of the New Corps to relieve the same north of the
marines. A native boy who had been living sometime with the captain
commanding this detachment embarked with him and was much pleased
at the idea of the voyage. He is the first who has had confidence
and courage enough to go to sea.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 March 1791</p>

<p>On Monday the 28th March we sailed out of the harbour with a
light land breeze. As we stood off shore we saw the column, or
landmark, on the South Head, to the distance of 6 leagues. Yet I
think a stranger who did not exactly know where to look for it
would not discover it at more than half that distance, except
coming along the shore from the southward.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="apr91" id="apr91"></a>April 1791</p>

<p>We were to have called at Norfolk Island in our way to the
northward, but were so unfortunate as to be driven to the southward
2 degrees by a series of contrary winds and bad weather, which
prevented our making any progress to the northward until the 14th
of April when the wind came to the south and, hauling round to the
south east and east as we approached Norfolk Island, forced us 20
leagues to leeward of it when we crossed its parallel. This
circumstance, together with that of the wind appearing to be steady
and fixed at east, it was determined not to lose time in
endeavouring to beat up to it, but proceed immediately on our
voyage, intending to pass to the south and east of New Caledonia,
but the wind continued so far to the east that, on the 23rd
[April], we made the Isle of Pines and could not weather it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 247]</p>

<p>We stood off for the night, and in again at daylight and,
finding that we could not get to windward of it, we bore away at 9
o'clock to run to the westward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 April 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 24th. Standing along by the shore passed 5 low islands
which seemed to be encircled by a reef. At ½ past 2pm we hauled off
without the outermost land then in sight, about 4 breakers were
seen to the S by W and soon after to the SW and more to the west
and seemed to be connected, having some small islands within it. We
now discovered that we had mistaken the Isle of Pines for Queen
Charlotte's Foreland and that we had got into the bight between the
Isle of Pines and the shoals to the SW of it, the wind and a great
swell setting right over them. Our situation was very
dangerous;</p>

<p>We continued all night to work the ship with a great press of
sail to keep her to windward, in which we succeeded so well as to
be able to stretch along the reef at daylight and passed the south
extremity of it at 10am at 3 miles distant. Near the south
extremity is a considerable opening and smooth water within it,
over which the reef was seen to the NW as far as the eye could
reach from the masthead.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 248]</p>

<p>We did not see breakers close home to the foreland, but some
small islands showing themselves between it and the breakers which
we saw, gave us reason to suppose that it is one extensive reef
from that land running about SE by S 32 miles to the south
extremity round which we passed, and lies from the highland of the
Isle of Pines SW by S ¼ W by compass 29 miles and is in 23°00'S,
167°17'E, according to our longitude corrected. It is a very
dangerous reef and appears to be on considerable breadth. The SE
trade appeared steady with which we steered to the northward,
giving the west side of New Caledonia a reasonable birth.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 April 1791</p>

<p>On the 29th the trade* freshened into a gale with very squally
weather in 20°39'S, 162°18'E, and continued, sometimes blowing very
strong with much rain,</p>

<p class="footnote">[*trade = trade winds. <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds">Wikipedia</a>]</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may91" id="may91"></a>May 1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">5 May 1791</p>

<p>until the 5th May in 11°56'S, 163°58'E, at 8pm it suddenly fell
calm and variable, light airs. After which we had moderate breezes
with frequent squalls and variable winds. We passed between Queen
Charlotte's Islands and the land discovered by Lieutenant Ball in
the <i>Supply</i> last year without seeing either.</p>

<p>Our longitude when we passed the parellel of Gonont Island was
nearly the same as Captain Carteret had fixed [for the] west coast
of that island to lie in, our longitude being determined from
observations taken some days before and after. I am inclined to
think the error is likely to be with him and that he has placed
them too far to the westward. How much is impossible for us to say,
but it was observed that nearly about passing the parallel of those
islands we had every indication of land being very near us to the
eastward.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 249]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 May 1791</p>

<p>Monday 9th at 7 am. Saw land to the WNW which had the appearance
of being an island. Soon after saw another to the eastward of it.
At 9 bore away and stood towards them. At 10 saw 2 more islands and
at noon another came open with the island first seen. they are very
small islands, 5 in number, forming an irregular figure that 11
miles would circumscribe. We saw broken water between some of them
but passed at too great a distance to ascertain whether they are
all connected by a reef or not.</p>

<p>From our latitude we at first supposed this land to be Careteret's
Island but we were soon satisfied that it could not be, from the
extent of this little group and, to be more clear, we stood to the
northward for Gower's Island and not meeting with it convinced us
that this was a new discovery. The middle of the group is in
8°26'S, 163°07'E by observation of the [sun] and [moon] taken the
preceding day. They lie N14°E, 50 leagues from the eastmost point
of Ball's Maiden Land (discovered by him in the <i>Supply</i> last
year). They are covered with trees of the palm and coconut and some
large trees on one of them. We did not see the least appearance of
inhabitants. Just to the northward of these islands we found a
ripling like a race, through which we passed in a few minutes.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 250]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 May 1791</p>

<p>We steered from these islands WNW with a fine steady eastly wind
and on Thursday 12th at 9am saw breakers on the starboard bow,
immediately after which, saw the sea break nearly in the ship's
wake, which shoal she must have passed over very close, the water
being exceedingly smooth until near 9 o'clock it did not break when
the ship passed it and it was but seldom that it did break
afterward. Those on the bow were a continual foam of broken water
and it appeared to be sand banks by the colour of the water round
them. At half past 10 we were abreast of the northmost at 3 miles
distance, when more breakers were seen on the larboard beam and
abaft it, in two detached shoals. We could not clear these, or the
others before seen, by hauling our wind on either tack. We
therefore stood on our course and passed clear through.</p>

<p>How far they extend NE and SW we could not ascertain, their
extent NW and SE is 7 miles by our run and the breadth of the
channel through which we passed is 8 miles from shoal to shoal. We
could not get any soundings 130 fathoms in passing through. The
middle of this channel which is called Waakzamheydt Passage, from
the name of the ship, lies in 6°52'S, 161°06'E by [sun] and [moon], and
is situated N52°W, 51 leagues from the little group of islands
discovered on the 9th. They are very dangerous shoals. Those to the
northward of us broke in 6 detached parts and those to the
southward in 2, one of which was an extensive range of broken
water. They appear to be but little below the surface, steep too,
and no part dry.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 251]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 May 1791</p>

<p>Steering on the same course WNW on Saturday 14th, at daylight.
Saw land from NW to SE, appeared to be several islands. At 6,
thirty two, including rocks above water, were counted from the
masthead. At 7 there were 20 distinctly seen, small, low and well
covered with trees. The largest island is about 4 miles in length
east and west. Our course carried us along nearly parallel to them.
At 9 another island was seen to the NNW of the westmost of those
first seen. Some rocks were seen above water, but as we did not
pass nearer than 9 miles we could not determine whether any of them
were joined or surrounded by a reef:</p>

<p>About 10, we saw 6 canoes with sails coming from different parts
of the land towards us. We still kept on our course, so that it was
noon before any of them came up with us and then only one canoe
with 9 people in it. They came close to the ship, but would not
come on board. Some nails, beads etc. were thrown to them and they
in return threw back pieces of coconuts. They were tall and stout.
One of them was painted red over the face and appeared to be a
chief or leading man. they were not provided with anything for
trade, nor had they any weapons with them. Their hair, or long
wool, was tied close upon the head as is the custom in many parts
of the East Indies. They either had not any beards, or were close
shaved.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 252]</p>

<p>They wore ornaments round their necks, arms etc., the chief of
which appeared to be hair plaited with bone and shells made fast to
the ends. They wore ornaments also through the nose, and which we
took to be hair plaited or twisted and put through on both sides so
as to hang down as low as the lips. On the ends of some of these
were fastened pieces of shells in imitation of teeth. They appeared
to be very friendly disposed and wanted us to go to the islands.
They were naked except for a piece of matting round the waist. Some
of the gentlemen on board observed that they were tatooed but I
noticed nothing but the marks of paint or dirt on any of their
bodies.</p>

<p>The canoe I take to between 30 and 40 feet in length, very
narrow, with an outrigger. The sides consisted of two planks laced
or sewed together and brought to a point at both ends rather
inclining downwards than rising. They use single paddles and have a
lateen sail. They were about half an hour with us and some of the
others close up when, the breeze freshening, we left them. These
islands have every appearance of supplying the inhabitant very
plentifully with the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>It is probable that these islands extend farther to the
eastward, as the eastmost of those we saw was on the quarter and 7
leagues distant. When the first were seen at daylight, those which
we saw and determined the situation of, extend from 5°18'S to
5°29'S and from 159°14'E to 159°36'E, by [sun] and [moon].
Variation of the compass 8°00'E.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 253]</p>

<p>These islands lie NW by W 44 leagues from the shoals which we
passed through [on] the 12th and might afford relief to any who may be
so unfortunate as to get on those shoals, provided they could
escape with their boats or otherwise, if the ship could not be
removed. Whether this is a new discovery, or part of those islands
seen by an American vessel bound to China in 1787, I am
doubtful.</p>

<p>A great quantity of our water having leaked out owing to the
badness of the casks we were furnished with at Port Jackson made
it absolutely necessary that we should recruit it. We therefore
steered for Cape St. George intending to water at one of the ports
in the strait between New Britain and New Zealand that Captain
Carteret had visited. We found the eastly winds very weak at this
time.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 May 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday 18th. At half past 8am saw land, which was soon
discovered to be low islands covered with trees and from our
situation they were the south easterly most of the 9 islands
mentioned by Captain Carteret. At the same time we saw high land to
the SW which had every appearance of forming a strait between the
land discovered by Mr. Ball in the <i>Supply</i> and New Georgia of
Lieutenant Shortland. We stood for the islands until within 3 miles
of the southmost and then along by a reef which ran off W by S
from it and seemed to surround the other islands in sight.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 254]</p>

<p>They extend north 5 miles and WNW 8 miles from the southmost of
them. The reef seemed to be a sandy spit with some rocks on it and
dry in many parts and in one place between the southmost and
westmost of these islands, just round the point of the spit along
which we passed, there was an opening seen and the appearance of
deep water and good shelter within it. We saw several of the
natives on the dry sand and some canoes came out and made towards
us, but the breeze freshening, they could not come up. These
islands are small and have a beautiful appearance, being covered
with coconuts and other trees, with sandy beaches to the water
side.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 May 1791</p>

<p>Thursday 19th. We steered W by S and W½S along by the shore of
New Georgia at the distance of 10 or 12 leagues, and which had the
appearance of being islands. At 2am we passed the western extremity
of the land seen at sunset at 5 leagues distance, sounded
frequently 130 fathoms no ground. At 5am saw Sir Charles Hardy's
Island, bearing N2°W 5 leagues and land which had the appearance of
being an island, S48°E 6 leagues, which we conclude is the land
mentioned by Captain Carteret, Winchelsea Island, and appears by
our run and the angles taken, to be the same land we passed at 2am
and had much the appearance of being a projecting point of the main
land. When to the east of it, it is very high, running out to the
northward in a low sandy point on which the sea breaks very
high.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 255]</p>

<p>We did not see any land to the southward of it. At 5am had
several very good observations for the longitude by the moon and á
Aquila*, from which the latitudes observation, this and the
preceding noon's, I fix the following places.</p>

<p>["by the moon and on Aquila"? -- Aquila: a constellation in the northern
hemisphere represented by the figure of an eagle.]

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 May 1791</p>

<p>Friday, 20th. At 6pm saw Cape St. George bearing N80°E 7 leagues
and the north extreme of New Ireland N26°W. Hitherto, we had not
met with any current to speak of, but this night bringing too off
Cape St. George we were carried to the southward out of sight of it.
At 6 am we again got sight of it and, the wind being favourable, we
steered right in for it. Cape St. George, by our observations, is in
4°51'S, 153°15'E which is only 6 miles to the eastward of that
given in the New Requisite Tables and 56 miles to the east of
Captain Carteret's [Island?]. We also found nearly the same difference between
Captain Carteret's account of the 9 islands, Sr. Charles Hardy's
and Winchelsea Islands.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 256]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 May 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 21. The wind southerly with light breeze. AM stood for
Gower's Harbour, but had so light a breeze the tide or current
carried us so far to the westward, that when a fresh sea breeze
came in from the SE by S we could not fetch it, but stood in for the
land to leeward of it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 May 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 22nd. At 2pm bore away for Carteret's Harbour, which port
we unfortunately overshot. Having missed both harbours, we stood
for the NW along the shore in hopes of finding a watering place. At
8 it fell calm and continued so with variable light airs until 2am
the next day when a breeze sprung up from the SW and enabled us to
get the length of the east point of the Duke of York's Island.
Whilst we were thus becalmed, we did not observe a NW current
setting through, but an equal tide as much one way as the other,
and the same on both shores. We sent the boat along the shore of
New Britain, Cape Bulbes and Cape Palliser to look for anchorage
but they did not find any.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 May 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 23rd am. At daylight, being off the NE part of the Duke
of York's Island, sent the boat to examine the coast on the north
side of it and look for water. Following with the vessel, the boat
was met by a great number of the natives in their canoes. They were
very friendly and exchanged some coconuts for pieces of iron hoop.
Our people gave them 2 kegs to fill with water, which they returned
with to them in a few minutes. They were very numerous all along
the shore, walking along as the ship passed and the canoes
accompanied the boat.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 257]</p>

<p>We did not find anchoring ground until near the NW part of the
island, where we followed the boat into a very fine cove where we
anchored at noon in 25 fathoms. Natives very numerous and friendly.
Some of them came on board.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 May 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 24th pm. An officer was sent on shore to look for the
watering place; found one in the SE bend of the cove. The natives
were very numerous and all armed with spears, clubs or slings and
nets full of stones. They walked into the water to meet the boat as
we landed and seemed quite familiar, but as our party was going up
into the wood with them they were met by an old man who insisted
that they should return to the beach. This old fellow, appearing to
have the control of the multitude and seeming to be much
displeased, it was judged best to return on board. They all came to
the waterside with us, the same as on our landing.</p>

<p>Soon after the boat returned, two guns were fired from the
vessel into the woods. This occasioned those natives who were on
board to jump overboard instantly and all the canoes pulled to the
shore. Great numbers of the natives had assembled on the beach,
several of them blowing a white powder out of their hands which
appeared like smoke. This seemed to show displeasure and a degree
of defiance. It was observed that the men who did it always
advanced on the beach and blew it off towards the ship.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 258]</p>

<p>Some of them in canoes, in passing the ship, did the same. They
were blowing conchs and making a great noise all night and it
appeared by their frequently calling to each other at different
stations that they kept a look out upon us. At daylight, an armed
party was sent on shore with the waterers and armed boat, to lay
off and cover them. They found the natives troublesome and seemed
to be much disposed to quarrel. They blew off the white powder in
several of our people's faces.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 May 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday 25th pm. The natives still continued to be very
troublesome and at length threw some stones which struck the armed
boat, on which a firing began from the boat and armed party on
shore and several guns with round and grape were fired from the
ship into the woods in different parts of the cove. The natives
instantly fled, and when any of them came in sight they were fired
at by the armed party, which effectively kept the watering place
clear.</p>

<p>AM. At daylight we weighed and warped the ship over towards the
watering place and moored with a hawser, head and stern, to keep
our broadside to bear both on the watering place and that part of
the beach where the natives had assembled. We fired some guns with
round shot into the woods before our party landed. They were not
the least interrupted. Many of the natives left this cove with
their canoes, whilst others came in from the westward offering
coconuts and, by signs, gave us to understand that it was not them
that had behaved ill.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 259]</p>

<p>No notice was taken of them. They soon went leisurely out of the
cove. In all, parties of them were seen about the cove but not one
appeared near the watering place.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 May 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 26th. In the evening, as soon as our people had left
the shore, several of the natives came down on the beach near the
watering place, with green boughs in their hands and unarmed,
bringing coconuts and showing every sign of their earnest wishes to
make peace. Others brought coconuts, plantains etc. and laid them
down on the beach in two heaps and on the top of each was put a
young dog with its legs tied. As soon as the boats came off, one of
them was sent with an officer to receive their peace offering, and
establish friendly intercourse with them;</p>

<p>On the officer's landing, he was presented with two long boughs
about which were several plaited lines, made fast at the top and
about half way down the stick, the bight hanging slack. When these
were received they expressed great joy and immediately shouting a
kind of song brought everything to the boats that had been laid in
the two heaps on the beach and the two little dogs. In return they
had a dog and bitch spaniel given to them, with which they were
much pleased and, shouting a song, retired in small parties.</p>

<p class="caption">'Port Hunter, Duke of York's Island, May
1791'</p>

<p>In the morning several of them came to the watering place but
unarmed. They brought coconuts with them for our people and so much
afraid of giving offence that they would scarce move or speak for
some time without observing the countenances of our people to see
if they were pleased. Several canoes came about the ship but very
few coconuts or other useful articles could be procured. Some
spears, slings etc. were exchanged for mere trifles. Iron they do
not value.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 May 1791</p>

<p>Friday 27th. The water being complete soon after noon, I had the
boats to survey the cove. Having occasion to land near the water
place, we were met by a great number of the natives who presented
the bough the same as yesterday and then carried several coconuts
to the boats. We returned on board about sunset and had only time
just to survey the cove, without examing further to the westward,
than to see that there was another cove and the appearance of a
very good harbour round the west point of it.</p>

<p>AM. At daylight, sent the boats for a turn of water to fill all
up. This morning several women came in canoes to the ship, which
was now entirely surrounded by the natives of all descriptions, but
very few useful articles were exchanged. At 9, a breeze springing
up from the SE, weighed and stood out of the cove. The master of
the transport, with his own officers, now took charge of navigating
the vessel and of the respective watches, which had hitherto been
done by Captain Hunter and the officers belonging to the
<i>Sirius</i>.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 261]</p>

<p>We were very unlucky in not having an opportunity of getting any
observations for the longitude. We therefore determined it from
those taken off Cape St. George, 152°37'E, by observation. At anchor
4°08'S this cove lies within a mile of a small woody island forming
the NW point of Duke of York's Island and is very convenient for a
ship to stop at, coming through St. George's Channel, off the east
point of the Bay, half a cable's length, is a reef of rocks running
out from the shore, after passing which there is no danger. The
soundings in the bay are 20 and 25 fathoms, muddy bottom by the
lead, but the people fishing brought up several large pieces of
coral rocks. There is another cove just round the west point of
this which has good anchorage in it, and to the SW of that there is
every appearance of a fine harbour.</p>

<p>Although we only got a few coconuts and yams, we saw that the
island produced breadfruit, plantains, bananas, mangoes and several
other fruits, very fine sugar cane, beetle nuts, the wild nutmeg,
coconuts and yams in great abundance. They have hogs, dogs and
poultry among them but we could not procure any of either. The men
in general are stout and well made, long woolly hair and beards
which most of them keep covered with a powder that appeared to us
to be made from burnt coral. It is white when first used but the
heat of the sun turns it to a reddish brown and in time takes great
part of the hair off. the women that we saw were very diminutive
and ugly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 262]</p>

<p>Both sexes go quite naked. They have a variety of ornaments
which they wear chiefly about the neck and round the arms,
consisting of bone, shell and the teeth of some animal. They are of
very different complexions, some being quite black and others not
darker than the malays. They appear to live in society, their huts
being many of them close together. They have enclosures for their
plantains etc. but as not one went into the country we only
conjecture that it is in most parts cultivated and from the very
robust appearance of the men, they no doubt live in plenty.</p>

<p>Some of the gentlemen planted indian corn, garavances, peas,
pumpkins, melons and made them understand that the produce from
them was good to eat, and the corn particularly so for their
poultry. Their huts are not above 5 feet high with a small door and
without any window. The floor is hard clay and very smooth and
before each hut is a small clear plot. Their weapons are spears,
clubs and slings, with which they throw stones. Spears and clubs
they have a great variety of and appear to be used in close
fighting. The sling is made of flax neatly twisted, each part about
4 feet long, of the size of a small fishing line. These are made
fast to a kind of basket, 3 inches long and 1½ broad, in which they
put the stone. They carry nets filled with stones about with them
they fish with spears, nets which are very neatly made and
strong.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 263]</p>

<p>They also use hooks and lines. We did not observe any of their
spears, either for fishing or fighting, to be barbed. They show
great ingeniousness in the workmanship of their canoes, weapons
etc. being all neatly carved and ornamented. The bottom of the
canoe is hollowed out of a tree, on which is a streak of 9 inches
or a foot very neatly and securely on each side and brought to a
point at both ends, on each of which is fixed (not very firm) a
kind of ornamental prow, turning abruptly up, inclining inwards and
coming in a curve to a point. They are of different lengths from 12
to 30 and 40 feet and none more that 16 inches in breadth. They
have an outrigger which is neatly but not firmly fixed. The paddles
are single blade which is broad and with which they row very fast.
They are ornamented with carve work and paint. We did not observe
that any of them used a sail.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">28 May 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 28th. Wind at SE, steered to the westward along by the
shore of New Ireland at about 12 leagues distant. At 8am saw
Sandwich Island, the latitude and longitude of the south coast of
it I fix from observation, and bearing at noon, east point 2°58'S,
150°26'E, west point 2°56'S, 150°06'E.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 May 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 29th. At 3pm passed the western end of Sandwich Island.
At 5 leagues distance, the length of the island east and west is 21
miles and does not appear to be more than 4 or 5 north and south.
the coast of New Ireland is about 5 leagues from the north side of
it.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 264]</p>

<p>This island has every appearance of being equally fertile with
Duke of York island, and considerably larger. There does not appear
to be any danger about the shore, which seems to promise good
shelter for shipping. We did not see any canoes. I suppose our
distance and being directly to windward prevented their coming out
to us. At 5 saw the west part of New Ireland and the islands laying
off it and New Hanover, which we passed in the night at 7 leagues
distance.</p>

<p>AM. At 5 saw the Portland Isles from N by W to NW and passed
them steering W by S by compass at the distance of 4 miles from the
southmost of them and which appeared to be near the middle of the
group. It is situated in 2°38'S latitude. We saw 9 islands, all
small and covered with trees. They extend east and west from
149°10'E to 149°06'E. It is necessary to observe that, from the
constant cloudiness of the weather, those places since passing Cape
St. George, which we have determined the situation of as near as
circumstances would admit, may be liable to some error.</p>

<p>We found St. George's Channel a very clear good navigation and
affords refreshments to those passing through without much loss of
time. We found a regular tide until the length of Sandwich Island,
where we found a strong westerly current which appeared to alter
its direction to the northward between New Hanover and New
Ireland.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 265]</p>

<p>We did not see the appearance of any shoal all through the
channel, nor could we ever get sounds, but just off and in the cove
where we anchored. The shore of New Ireland is very mountainous and
appears to be but thinly inhabited. New Britain is moderately high,
covered with trees, appears to be cultivated and very full of
inhabitants. Near the north point of New Britain are three hills
or mountains, called by Captain Carteret the Mother and Daughters,
from one of which a vast column of smoke almost constantly issued.
We found the winds variable between Cape St. George and Sandwich
Island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 May 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 30th. Squally unsettled weather. At 7am saw an island
to the NW. At 9 saw 2 more, which at noon we discovered to join and
form one large island.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">31 May 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 31st. Moderate and fair weather. At 3pm saw a canoe
with a sail standing out from the island first seen, but the ship
being to windward, and a fresh breeze, we soon lost sight of her.
At 4 this island bore north 7 miles, from which I fix its situation
2°19'S, 147°52'E. It is about 1¼ miles in length and has a very
beautiful appearance. The shore towards the west end, off which
lies a reef, is rocky cliffs and to the eastward and top of the
hills it is covered with trees, with some open patches delightfully
green on the sides. As we stood on to the westward we saw another
island. The wind being from the southward, [we] could not weather
the large island. We brought to for the night and at daylight found
ourselves nearly in the same situation as when we brought to.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 266]</p>

<p>Many other islands were seen bearing from S25°W round to the
westward and northward to N23°E, and the island we passed yesterday
bore north 80°E, 15 miles. Some canoes came off from the large
island. At 8 we were within 4 miles of it and nearly calm. The
canoes came near the ship but would not come alongside. I take them
to be about 30 feet in length. They had a platform, or stage, in
each, in the midships, which went out some distance on the
outrigger on the larboard side and projected with a rising over the
starboard side. There were people on these stages, besides those
who paddled. The greatest number I saw in one canoe was 5 on the
stage and 6 at the paddles. One of those on the stage had evidently
the command of the canoe. They had bows and arrows with them, but
we saw nothing hostile in their manner.</p>

<p>We had reason to suppose they had been visited before, from
their signifying to us by signs that they wanted to exchange some
things with us and one of them went regularly through the motions
of shaving himself. These people were ornamented with shells and
bones in rings round their arms and hanging about their necks. They
had something about their waist which was supposed to be bow
strings. The man who we supposed to command had his hair tied on
the top of his head and was painted on the face and breast.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 267]</p>

<p>They were near half an hour about the ship. A fresh breeze
springing up from the southward with rain, they left us. We steered
to the westward to get through between some of the islands but
finding them very thick in that direction and some shoals showing
themselves, we bore away to the NW for a passage between two
islands that appeared to be clear.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jun91" id="jun91"></a>June 1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 June 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday, 1st June. Modest breezes and showers of rain. PM. at
1, passed through between two of the islands (had no soundings) and
saw a very extensive island to the westward. We steered WNW for the
eastmost part of it and at daylight found it to be the NE point of
a very large island, the north coast of which lay nearly east and
west as far west as the eye could reach from the masthead. We did
not see the appearance of any islands or rocks laying off the
northward of it. The wind shifting to the WSW prevented our ranging
along the shore. The extremes of this island seen, and some of the
other islands, are determined by the latitude observed and
longitude corrected, as follows.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>There are several islands laying to the ENE of these, the tops
of which were only seen from the mast head.</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 268]</p>

<p>This land comprehends a very extensive and beautiful country to
appearance, and is divided into a numerous cluster of small
islands, besides two of considerable extent, both of which appear
to afford shelter for a ship. They appear to be full of people and
are a part of those islands named by Captain Carteret, Admiralty
Islands. He passed to the southward of the large island and did not
see those which we sailed through, in passing to the northward.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 June 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday, 3rd am. Saw 3 islands through which we passed and by
angles taken, and the ship's run, I fix them in 1°33'S, 145°34'E;
0°51'S, 146°17'E; and 0°44'S, 145°54'E. They appeared high but of
no considerable extent.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 June 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 6th. Crossed the line in 144°48'E, longitude, variation
of the compass, 5°00' easterly.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jul91" id="jul91"></a>July 1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 July 1791</p>

<p>From this time to the 12th of July we had variable light breezes
and a strong easterly current, which we found by lunar
observations. Had set the ship 10°21'E of the log in that time,
sometimes going at the rate of 40 miles per day and at other times
less. This very unfavourable circumstance, and with every prospect
of its continuance, occasioned a consultation to determine what was
best to be done.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 269]</p>

<p>It was the general opinion that it was absolutely necessary that
we should make the best of our way to Macao in China, circumstanced
as we were with respect to provisions, which as now [had] become
very short.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 July 1791</p>

<p>The wind being at SW, we bore away on the 13th and steered to
the northward. AM At 9, saw land. It appeared to be an island
bearing N by W. Soon after, we saw 2 other islands to the NW by N.
As we approached the first, we found that they were all three
connected by a reef and dry sand bank, extending 7 miles in nearly
a WNW direction and 3 miles in breadth. The eastmost of these woody
patches, which at first appeared to be seperate islands, is about a
mile in length and lies in 8°06'N, 140°30'E, deduced from lunar
observations taken two days before and 2 days after.</p>

<p>The two westmost patches are very small and close together and
lie in 8°08'N, 140°23'E. It breaks very heavy upon the sand all
round, except just to the eastward of the two woody patches on the
northside of the sand, where there appears to be a small opening.
We passed the east point of this island at about 3 miles distant.
Saw several of the natives come out of the wood to the beach, but
did not see any of their canoes or habitations. We had an amazing
number of birds and fish about the ship and many bonettas were
caught.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 270]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 July 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 14th.The wind hauling round to the east and northward
we could not pass to the eastward of a group of the New Carolines
which were near. We therefore ran close along to the southward of
them, but it being thick rainy weather we did not see any of them
until the 18th, when we discovered land and which proved to [be]
the westmost of the Caroline Islands. At Noon they were seen to be
3 islands and a rock above water. The north part of the middle
island, which is the largest and has some high land upon it, lies
in 9°35'N, 137°39'E, by observation of the moon and [stars]. At 10
the following evening, they are well covered with trees of which we
had but an imperfect sight as we passed at 19 miles distance from
the nearest;</p>

<p class="date-jnl">19 July 1791</p>

<p>At half past 4, when the largest island bore S13°W per compass,
24 miles, we came suddenly over a ledge of rocks, saw the bottom
very plain and had 15 fathoms, but I think we were in less water
before the lead was hove. This ledge appeared to extend to a
considerable distance both to the north and south of us in a N by E
and S by W direction. We stood on our course NW by W and in about
10 minutes had no soundings. I suppose it to be 2 or 3 cables
length in breadth and every appearance of deep water round it.
There was a considerable swell and had it communicated with the
islands in sight, I think we should have seen breakers between us
and the shore, of which there was no appearance all round.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 271]</p>

<p>These islands are called Ladda in the old charts and are to SW
of the groups called the New Carolines. It was now judged more
eligible to alter our route and, instead of going to Macao, to go
for the Port of Manilla. We accordingly shaped a course for Cape
Espiritu Sancto.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 July 1791</p>

<p>At the entrance of the channel leading to it, the wind favoured
us until Sunday the 24th in 11°57'N, 131°27'E, when it came to the
northward and then round to the westward with squally weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 July 1791</p>

<p>The 26th. It increased to a strong gale with which we kept on
the tack that would keep us most in with the land. The gale blew
with great violence until the 29th with very heavy squalls. The
weather cleared up with SSW wind and continued with moderate
weather and a few squalls between SSW and W, of which changes we
took every advantage, to get in with the land.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="aug91" id="aug91"></a>August 1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">3 August 1791</p>

<p>On the 3rd of August we found that the observation gave a degree
to the southward of the log for the last two days and we saw the
looming of the land to the westward.</p>

<p>We were in this situation 45 leagues from Cape St. Espiritu
Sancto bearing N70°W of us. The wind settled at SSW and SW, blowing
a steady fresh gale, and although the strait leading to the port of
Manilla was to leeward of us, and at so short a distance, it was
now determined to beat to windward along the east side of St. John's
and Mindanao and make the passage through the Strait of Macassar,
which had before been deemed impracticable at the time that Macao
[was] at first determined on.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 272]</p>

<p>As we came near the east cost of the Phillipine Islands, found a
strong southerly current which set from 25 to 50 miles per day,
wind S and SW.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 August 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 4th August. Saw land to the WSW but at too great a
distance to ascertain what part it was. We had variable light airs
and calm all night. At daylight saw the land again to WSW, of
considerable extent. We stood in W by N. I take the northmost part
of this land to be the N or NE point of the island of St. John,
stretching out to the northward in a low point from very high
land.</p>

<p>This point, by our observations, is in 9°30'N, 126°30'E, which
situation nearly corresponds with the Dutch East India Directory
but not with ours. We continue to work to the southward with great
success. The current setting is more than 1 knot per hour to the
southward. The weather was hazy and clouds hanging heavy over the
land prevented our having a good view of it and ascertaining any of
the projecting points or bays that may be there. A few miles to the
southward of the NE point of St. John's is the appearance of an
island laying near the shore and shelter behind it.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">6 August 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 6th. Had some good observations of the [sun] and
[moon] from which, and the latitude at noon, I fix the situation of
a projecting point running out to the northward and appeared to
form a bay behind it, 7°41'N, 126°28'E. We were abreast of it at 6
leagues distance. The north extreme of land then in sight bore NNW
a low point, and the other Extreme S by W, high land.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 273]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">7 August 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 7th. Clouds hung so heavy over the land that it could
not be distinctly seen. Wind from the S by E to SW. Found the
current had set us 51 miles to windward, these 24 Hours. At noon
could just discern the land through the haze to the WSW.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 August 1791</p>

<p>Monday 8th. Stood off to the SE until 8pm, then tacked and
stood to the westward and at 6 am saw an island with a remarkable
peak on it and low land to the westward. At noon it bore ESE 7
leagues from which I make its situation 5°33'N and longitude by
ship's run from [sun] and [moon] yesterday 126°35'E. Suppose it to
be the island called Palmas in the old charts. Found the current
had set us 32 miles to the southward these 24 hours.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 August 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday 9th, am. Saw land to the WNW. We had light breezes from
SSW to WSW. At daylight saw the south point of Mindanao and the
islands laying off to the southward of it. The SE point then bore
N2°W, 9 leagues. Had very good observations of the [sun] and [moon]
in the afternoon and of the [stars] on the opposite side in the
evening. I fix the SE point of Mindanao (or middle point between
that south point and Cape St. Augustine) in 6°00'N, 125°49'E and
Cape St. Augustine from Captain Carteret's run, 6°12'N, 126°30'E.
We did not find any current these 24 hours. The land of the south
coast of Mindanao is very high, running down to those parts which
appear to be projecting points and terminating in land of moderate
height.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 274]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">10 August 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday, 10th. Moderate breezes with fair weather, wind
southerly. We gained but little to the westward. AM at 9, finding
that we could weather the islands, we bore away for a passage
between the two eastmost of them, but on seeing breakers in the
passage we stood back until the boat was got out and went ahead,
when we followed her through.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">11 August 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 11th. Found the passage a very good and safe one, the
reefs on both sides showing themselves and the depth of water 20 to
13 fathoms, rocky near the reef and muddy in the channel through
which we passed. There is a reef laying some distance off the east
side of the middle island along parallel to the shore which, being
near the surface, always shows itself. There is also a reef laying
half a mile or more from the eastmost of the islands running out to
the ENE from it. The sea breaks very heavy on it and some of the
rocks are above water. Several of the natives appeared on the
middle island and retired as we approached.</p>

<p>We stood to the westward and tacked occasionally, as the wind
favoured most. About 5pm, standing over for the largest of these
islands, called by Captain Carteret Hummock Island, saw 2 canoes or
boats coming towards us, with white flags which was answered by our
hoisting a white flag at the ensign staff. One of them, a canoe,
came alongside before dark, asked many questions concerning the
vessel and her destination, and informed us that the Raja lived on
the south side of the largest island, which they call Loorongo,</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 275]</p>

<p>and that he was appointed by the Dutch East India Company, from
Ternate, to govern at these islands, the Dutch having established a
trade with them, and that their small vessels frequently came with
trade from Ternate, an island on the west side of Gilolo, where the
Dutch have a settlement.</p>

<p>They asked for a paper with the ship's name, captain's name,
where bound to etc. for the Raja, which was given to them and they
went away well satisfied. Having Malays on board and a native of
Ternate we understood each other perfectly by conversation. they
were most of them clothed with jackets, trowsers etc. and armed
with a cress or long dagger.</p>

<p>About 8 o'clock the others, who were in a large boat, came close
up under the stern, asked many questions, said that they had things
to sell, but that it being dark they would not dispose of any until
the morning. They said that they would show us a good anchoring
place and left us, steering over for the middle island where we
should have followed, had not the wind prevented us. We, therefore,
stood over towards Hummock Island, or Loorongo, in hopes of getting
good anchorage there. When with 1½ or 2 miles of the shore, got
soundings, 80 fathoms, and at noon came to in 25 fathoms sand and
shells, about ¾ of a mile from the shore abreast of us on the NE
side of Loorongo.</p>

<pre>

The point of that island bore S38°E and N86°W
The Hummock SW
The middle island S49°E to N40°E
The north most of the 3 islands N37°E

<p>Soon after we anchored, several of the natives came on board,
appeared very well disposed and traded very fairly. Most of them
had cresses by their sides.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 August 1791</p>

<p>Friday, 12th, pm. A boat with some people of consequence came
off with a Dutch flag flying. They brought an answer to the letter
sent to the Raja last night and which mentioned that we could get
wood and water, goats, poultry etc. but that they had but little
rice or paddy to spare. They also brought on board what they called
a pass, dated 1791, from the Dutch Company, authorising the Raja to
govern these islands and the vessels trading here from Ternate.
Several of the natives came on board but few articles were
purchased this afternoon.</p>

<p>The boats were sent for a turn of water and returned before dark
with a raft of 14 casks. They found it a very good watering place
and convenient except just at low water, when the reef dries some
distance off. The natives showed where to fill the water and then
retired. AM, soon after sunrise several of the natives came off
bringing many useful necessaries to trade with us. Poultry, sago,
tobacco, honey, wax, sugar cane and various fruits were exchanged
for cloth, iron, buttons, knives etc., in all which they dealt very
fairly and honestly.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 277]</p>

<p>Watering went on very well. Many of the natives brought fruit
etc. to trade to the watering place and exchanged with our people
for what things they had to give them. Our party on shore were not
armed any part of the time.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13 August 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 13th. The Raja came on board. He was saluted with 3
guns, as was the second in command when he came, and on their
leaving the ship they were saluted by with a volley of small arms
from the poop. An armed party having been previously stationed
there in case these people might show any hostile intentions, which
not appearing in the smallest degree, the muskets were discharged
as a salute.</p>

<p>The Raja promised to come the next day and bring a sufficient
quantity of rice and paddy for all our people. He had a present of
a piece of silk given him by the master of the vessel. He was on
board about an hour, in the course of which time he showed a paper
signed by Captain Vanholm, Commodore of the State's Ships then
employed in India, appointing him the King of these islands. Many
useful necessaries were procured this day and 10 bags of paddy on
the public account. AM. At daylight when the boat was towing a raft
of casks on shore it came on to blow very fresh from the WSW by
which several of casks were lost and we were prevented from
completing our water.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 278]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 August 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 14th, pm. It continuing to blow fresh from the WSW, it
was judged necessary to go the sea before night with what water and
refreshments we had procured. About 5 o'clock the Raja came on
board, according to his promise, but instead of bringing the
articles he mentioned yesterday, he only brought 20lb of rice, on
which the commander of the vessel remonstrated and told him that he
had broke his word and I have reason to think threatened him with
confinement until those things were brought. He having declared
that to be his intentions, but as their conversation was in the
Malay language, what passed could not be well understood by us
farther than by their actions.</p>

<p>The instant words arose which I supposed to be threats, an old
man who stood near drew his cress, and would have immediately
stabbed the commander of the vessel had not the Taja prevented him.
The Raja then went to the ship's side, where his boat was, and
several of his people coming in with their cresses drawn, he made a
stand as if he meant an attack, but by this time several of the
officers were armed and all hands coming aft with handpikes,
capston bars etc. they made a very precipitate retreat throwing
themselves over the quarter into their boat and some into the
water. They immediately cut the boat adrift, the Raja himself,
after throwing a spear into the ship, took an oar to endeavour to
get the boat away from us.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 279]</p>

<p>She was scarce astern of us when a strong party was collected on
the poop at small arms, who kept up a very smart fire on them for
some time. Every ball going through their awning of slit bamboo
into the boat, great execution must have been done the whole of
them except the Raja and one man being in the body of the boat,
some were seen to fall in attempting to get to the oars and we have
great reason to think that the Raja fell at one of the oars.</p>

<p>Some great guns were fired when they had got a little distance
off, but only the grape shot struck the boat, the round shot going
over her. The boat belonging to the ship was at this time returning
from the shore with some goats and other articles, which one of the
natives of some consequence had sent off as a present.</p>

<p>Our watering party were luckily all on board but unfortunately
one of the Malays, who had been left to take care of some casks
that had drifted on shore, was not thought of until it was too
late, as there was a necessity for our going to sea immediately,
night coming on, the ship having drove close to a reef and the lee
tide nearly made against us and which would set us over the reef
and only one little boat that we could have sent to the shore. We
weighed and stood out to the eastward about 8 o'clock.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 280]</p>

<p>The road in which we anchored is sheltered from the NE to the
southward and westward to west, by the point of the island Loorongo
and those laying near it. The bottom does not appear to be good
holding ground as we drove without any sea setting in upon us.
There is every appearance of good shelter in deep coves along the
west side of the middle island, as also of as clear passage out
from thence to the southward, but for want of a boat we could not
ascertain either.</p>

<p>These islands afford plenty of goats, poultry sago, yams, sweet
potatoes, honey and wax in great quantities, tobacco, sugar cane
exceedingly large and fine, and all the fruits usually found
between the tropics. We saw some nutmegs, but whether they got them
from the Dutch or were the produce of the island we could not
learn. They have turtle about these islands, the shell of which is
an article of commerce. A ship might get every refreshment here,
provided a friendly intercourse with the natives could be
established.</p>

<p>Our anchorage lies in 5°26'N, 125°12'E from a mean of 50
observations of the [moon] and [stars] on each side of her, from
which and the bearings taken, I make the south point of Mindanao to
lie in 5°40'N, 125°08'E, the hummock on Hummock Island or Loorongo,
5°23'N, 125°09'E, and the small islands the northmost of the three,
5°36'N, 125°21'E. Variation of the compass 1°00'E.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 281]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 August 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 15th. Wind SW to south. Passed 5 islands to the westward
of us, and saw more to the SW and one very large one to the SSW,
before night. Between those two of the islands first seen there
appeared to be a reef, but the distance we passed from the others
prevented our being able to see whether they had any dangers about
them. We had but little wind all night and at daylight found that
the current had set us close up the islands and rocks laying about
to the NW and NE of the large island.</p>

<p>About 11 we were set close in between two of the islands,
hoisted a boat and sent her to examine the passage, and if they
found it clear they were ordered to go on to the small island and
try if anything was to be got there. We had drifted considerably
within this island when a fresh breeze spring up. Made signal for
the boat. She returned without having landed but was near enough to
see several natives on the beach and that the island was covered
with coconut and plantain trees and had the appearance of a little
garden. Sounded 70 fathoms sand.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 August 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 16th, pm. We had just got without this passage again
when it [became] calm. We were carried along by the current to the
westward, close along by the other small islands and had no
soundings. About 12 the land wind came off with which we stood
clear out to sea between the NW point of Point Sanguy, and an
island laying about 9 miles to the northward of it. These islands,
being covered with coconuts and plantains, have a beautiful
appearance.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 282]</p>

<p>We saw some canoes fishing but they did not regard us. In
passing from Loorongo to Point Sanguy, we found a chain of small
islands all in sight of each other. The situation of those that we
saw are as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote">[Table not reproduced &mdash; see original
journal]</p>

<p>We had light breezes chiefly from SSE to SW and having clear
weather and good observation every day for the longitude were able
to determine our situation very near and found a little westerly
current. We passed a great quantity of drift wood and some very
large trees.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 August 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 25th. Saw the land and at noon the NW point of Celebes
bore S by E, 11 leagues. The wind, when we had any, was chiefly
from the SW. We had much calm and made but little progress. It was
not until the 28th that we brought the NW point of Celebes to bear
East of us. We then began to feel a southerly current though not
very strong and considered ourselves as then entering the Strait of
Macassar.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 283]</p>

<p>From our situation at noon the last 4 days and the bearings
taken I make the NW point of Celebes to lie in 1°19'N, 121°02'E,
and another point to the south and west of it and which has much
the appearance of an island 1°09'N, 120°35'E. We found the
variation of the compass so trifling, that the compass would
sometimes give a few miles east and sometimes west.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">29 August 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 29th. A fresh breeze sprung up from the SSW with which we
stood over towards the Borneo shore. The wind continued steady
until 4am when it shifted to the westward in a heavy and sudden
squall, blew strong for about an hour, and then settled in a
moderate breeze at WSW, from which quarter we have mostly found the
winds prevail even so far to the eastward as the New Carolines.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">30 August 1791</p>

<p>30th at 6pm. Saw the east coast of Borneo bearing WSW 12 leagues
and the Taba Island (the southmost) WNW 4 leagsues. We had then
run 93 miles from the NW point of Celebes on nearly a West course,
which differs considerably from Captain Carteret's run in the
<i>Swallow</i>. At 10 am, saw both shores being then in latitude
1°00'N and which I take to be the narrowest part of the strait and
which, by observations and bearings taken, I make 70 miles. The
mountains show on both sides before you see the land of the sea
coast. The wind, when we had any, was chiefly from the S to SW and
sometimes light land winds for a few hours from the Celebes
shore.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 284]</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="sep91" id="sep91"></a>September
1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">2 September 1791</p>

<p>We crossed the line September 2nd, in longitude 119°25'E at 13
miles distance from an island laying under the line and close to
the Celebes shore. Having light airs and calm, we made very little
progress. On the 7th at noon saw a point on the Celebes shore
bearing east 8 leagues, which was the southmost part of it that we
saw and lies in 1°47'S, 119°19'E by observation.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">9 September 1791</p>

<p>The 9th. Standing over towards Borneo, at daylight saw breakers
to the SW by W and an island behind them. At noon the sland bore
WSW and was seen over a range of very heavy breakers, with some
rocks showing above water, which I take to be the NE part of the
shoals and from which we were then 3 miles. That part lays in
2°57'S, 117°57'E. We could not ascertain the situation of the
island, not knowing the distance it was at the back of the reef. It
appeared to be surrounded with very dangerous shoals extending some
miles both to the NW and SE of that part to which we were nearest.
We had 35 fathoms sandy bottom 12 miles to the NE by E of them.</p>

<p>They are called the Triangles in the Dutch chart, but no notice
seems to be taken of them in ours, unless they are there called the
little Pater Nosters and then they are very erroneously placed. We
crossed the whole of their extent in latitude in the day time
2°15'S to 2°31'S, as given by Captain Carteret at the distance of
10 to 18 leagues from the Celebes shore, without seeing anything
and ran between 80 and 90 miles from Celebes before we saw the
Triangles.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 285]</p>

<p>We stood well across the straight several times between the
Latitude of 1½°N and 2½°S and saw nothing of the Harig(?), Van
Coe's Reef, Seven Islands, or the Little Pater Nosters, although we
passed close to their intersections, as placed in the English Chart
belonging to us. Nor are any of them marked in the Dutch charts
belonging to the vessel, by which, and our not meeting with either
of them, I think there are no such islands and shoals.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Little Pater Nosters, so called by
Captain Carteret, may be a group of small islands and rocks laying
under the Celebes shore.</p>

<p>We stood from the Triangles E½S 35 miles and tacked, on seeing
the appearance of a shoal ahead (which I believe was imaginary),
and stood to the SW 58 miles, when we suddenly found ourselves in
shoal water and saw the bottom very plain. We had 12 fathoms when
the lead was hove and passed over a much shoaler part of it.</p>

<p>A dry sand bank was immediately seen from the mast head bearing
NNE 6 miles, with very heavy breakers off it. The shoal over which
we passed appears to be a spit running all the way from it, in an
SSW direction, 6 or 7 miles. I suppose the shoal water to have
extended a mile without us.</p>

<p>We stood on to the WSW and very soon had 20 fathoms. This shoal
and sand bank is called Zealand in the Dutch charts and is not
marked in our India Directory.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 286]</p>

<p>It is a very dangerous shoal, being only a low sand bank of
small extent. It lies in 3°35'S, 187°01'E by [moon] and [stars] and
bears from the Triangles S6°E 38 miles. AM, at daylight saw land
bearing WSW½W 3 leagues which we soon discovered to be some small
islands called the Brothers, laying off the large island Point
Laudt on the SE end of Borneo. They bear from the shoal S84°W 59
miles. After passing the spit to the southward of the sand bank we
had 22 and 20 fathoms sand and mud all across to the Brothers and
17 when within 3 miles of them. They are in 3°41'S, 117°02'E.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 September 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 12th. We found that the swell and a strong indraught
between Point Laudt and Borneo carried the ship in upon the shore
that, laying up SW by S, we could not clear the land. We stood into
12 fathoms and then stretched off in hopes of getting out to the
eastward of the Brothers again, which we could not accomplish until
the 13th in the am, at noon on which day they bore WSW 16 miles so
that we were again carried into the strait, after having supposed
ourselves clear.</p>

<p>While between the Brothers and Borneo we found the sounding very
regular from 20 to 12 fathoms, blue mud, at the distance of 7 to 2
leagues from the shore. The shore of Borneo appeared low and woody
with many openings and some islands laying off between Point Laudt
and Borneo. There is a hill which shows over the lowland and is the
only high land that we saw between Point Laudt and a projecting
point which we take to be the south point of Borneo, and it is a
low woody point.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 287]</p>

<p>We saw land without it to the SW which appeared to us to be
islands, on one of which is two mountains or very high hills,
exactly resembling each other. This was supposed by some to be the
south point of Borneo. I think it doubtful which of the two is the
south point, this last mentioned in 4°14'S, 116°20'E or the low
woody point beforementioned in 3°59'S, 116°34'E.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 September 1791</p>

<p>The 14th and 15th. We endeavoured to work up to the SW but lost
ground, the wind inclining to the westward of south and a great
swell running in upon the shore. We were then under a necessity of
stretching out to the eastward as the only chance of getting far
enough to the southward to weather the Brothers of south part of
Borneo.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 September 1791</p>

<p>We fell to the northward of the sand bank Zeelandt and, at 8 am
the 17th, saw it bearing W by S 5 or 6 miles, from which I judge
that we passed to the northward of it in the night at 5 or 6 miles
distance, making an E by N or ENE½E course from the Brothers and
had from 17 to 25 fathoms across and 28 to 30 passing along to the
eastward of it at 4½ miles distance. The wind favouring us we
stretched to the southward and had 30 fathoms at noon, the sand
bank bearing N by E, 12 miles.</p>

<p>It is very low and appears to be just a heap of sand. We did not
see anything like a bush upon it and it cannot be seen more than 6
or 7 miles from a ship's deck. There appears to be good soundings
to it on all sides except the south, off which runs the spit that
we passed over, and from the rocks that we then saw laying on the
bottom and the irregular soundings, I think the south side should
be passed with great caution and not within 7 miles.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 288]</p>

<p>We were just a week from having passed it the first time and
found the situation we had then fixed it in to correspond with our
run this time from the Brothers and which is settled by several
lunar observations.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 September 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 18th. At noon, in 4°03'S, 117°48'E I consider ourselves
clear of the Straight of Macasser in which we were 24 days from
making the NW point of Celebes. I would not by any means recommend
this passage for ships bound to the westward, the SW wind being so
prevalent all through and, indeed, we found them at times as far to
the eastward as St. George Channel and after passing through it we
were forced to the northward of the Admiralty Islands by SW winds
and after laying more than 4 weeks becalmed and swept away to the
eastward by a current, the SW wind again prevailed with which we
stood to the northward, had the easterly trade for a day or two in
9° latitude north and then found the SW monsoon met us again along
to the southward of the New Carolines, coast of Mindanao, and
through the Strait of Macasser. We saw many proas, all of which
appeared to be for plunder as they never kept a steady course as if
bound on any trade.</p>

Saw the shoal extend some miles to the NNW and SSE of us that to

<p class="date-jnl">20 September 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 20th. Saw land bearing from W by N to W by S 6 or 7
leagues, which we suppose to be Little Point Laudt. We saw a large
and a small island, the SE part of which is in 4°53'S, 116°16'E. We
passed to the southward of them and had 25 fathoms, muddy
bottom:</p>

<p class="date-jnl">21 September 1791</p>

<p>Wednesday, 21st. At 12pm saw Solombo, NNW 3 or 4 miles. The
soundings between little Point Laudt and it were from 25, 28, 20,
18 and 16 when abreast of Solombo, and soon after we passed in 32.
I make the south side of Solombo 5°41'S, 114°14'E by [sun] and
[moon].</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 September 1791</p>

<p>Friday, 23rd. At 6.am saw Carimon Java bearing West 6 or 7
leagues. We passed to the southward of them at 4 or 5 leagues
distance. Carimon Java appears to be a large island with 2
remarkable hills upon it, with several small islands laying off
both to the eastward and westward and several rocks above water,
scattered about the islands. The latitude of the middle of the
south side of the large island is 5°51'S and longitude 110°35'E.
They are several miles in circuit.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">24 September 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 24th am. Soon after sunrise a very sudden change in
the weather (which was clear and serene) took place. Clouds came
very fast from over the land with several whirlpools all about, two
of which passed very near the vessel. These were succeeded by
tremendous water spouts which drove the water up as high as our
lower mastheads in a foam all round them and, making a rapid
progress along the water, two of these came very near us at which
we fired 2 shot, without effect. They passed clear to leeward and
in half an hour afterwards dispersed, when the weather cleared up
again.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 291]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 September 1791</p>

<p>Sunday, 25th. At 5pm saw the land of Java W by S and the
Boomkins NW 9 or 10 miles. They are two low islands laying about
NNW and SSE of each other, covered with trees. There is a reef
laying off to the northward of them on which is some rocks above
water. We passed 8 miles to the southward of the innermost, the
middle of the south side of which is in 5°55'N, 108°37'E.</p>

<p>From Solombo to Carimon Java, is S87°23'W, 219 miles<br>
Carimon Java to the Boomkins, S88°40'W, 118 miles<br>
Boomkins to Carawary Point S86°42'W, 87 miles<br></p>

<p>By our observations the Boomkins appear to be much misplaced in

latitude.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 September 1791</p>

<p>Monday, 26th. Passed several ships and vessels working along
shore to the eastward. At sunset, saw Carawary Point S.55°W, 4 or 5
leagues. The point next to the eastward of Carawang Point has some
remarkable trees on it, which look like ships at an anchor and is a
very good mark coming from the eastward along the coast of Java to
know when you are near Carawary Point.</p>

colours and pendant were hoisted, the ship being left to the
direction of Captain Hunter. We had hitherto continued healthy but
now began to feel the effects of the climate, which is certainly
one of the worst in the world and had been particularly so these
last 2 years. The number which have died at Batavia in that time is
incredible and not to be ascertained with certainty.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 293]</p>

<p>At Onrust, which may be considered their dockyard, where they
heave their ships down and repair all defects, they have now only
200 carpenters and other artificers and labourers left out of 2,000
which were employed there 2 years ago. They have lost 1,800 on the
island, besides the supplies of some few which every indiaman from
Holland brings out with them for that purpose. The master carpenter
told me that he was one of the only 5 European carpenters left
alive there. We were told at Batavia on our arrival that the
sickness was just then inconsiderable to what it had been and from
what our officers saw, who lived ashore at Batavia, the mortality
was then very great.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 October 1791</p>

<p>Thursday, 20th am. Sailed from Batavia road but having some
stores to take in at Onrust we anchored there about noon and on the
22nd at daylight sailed and stood out to the westward between
Middleburg and Ontory Java. Not being able to weather the shoal
point off Man Eaters Island, we anchored at noon in 4½ fathoms sand
and mud, the beacon on the spit bearing SW by W ½ mile and
Maneaters Island WSW. Sent the master to examine the channel, found
it a very good one. We found the shoals had marks on them, but some
being beacons, and others buoys we were sometimes a little at a
loss but passed very well through by a Dutch chart which we got at
Batavia. The next morning we weighed and stood to the westward with
the land wind between Pulo Bay and Bantam Point.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 294]</p>

<p>But not being able to weather St. Nicholas Point when the sea
breeze came in, we anchored off it in 22 fathoms, the point bearing
WSW 2 miles. While at anchor we found a strong westly current and
at daylight weighed again, working to the SW through the Strait of
Sunda.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">25 October 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 25th pm. Spoke to an English ship from Bombay, bound to
Batavia. By Her we heard that all was peace in Europe. A Dutch boat
came on board soon after from Anger Point, with turtle etc. to
sell. There was a Dutchman in her who brought a book to take an
account of the ship's name etc. By examining this book for English
ships that might have passed the strait lately, we found that the
<i>Leopard</i>, Captain Blankett, with a small squadron and convoy
from China amongst which were the 5 ships from Port Jackson, has
passed this strait in April last. The wind fixing at SSE, we
continued to work to windward through the strait, which we cleared
the 26th, having Java Head E½S 8 or 9 Leagues.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">26 October 1791</p>

<p>At 6 am, the 26th, the weather became squally with rain and
continued so until the 30th, in 10°S latitude, when the SE trade
appeared to be fixed and blew a steady fresh gale.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="nov91" id="nov91"></a>November
1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">1 November 1791</p>

<p>Tuesday, 1 November. At 3pm saw Cocos or Keelings Islands from
N8°W to N35°W, about 5 leagues distance. At 4 the middle of them
north 5 leagues from which I fix the situation of the south side of
those islands 12°03'S, 98°20'Et by our account from Java Head.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 295]</p>

<p>There are 3 distinct islands and some rocks above water with
very heavy breakers all about them. They extend about 3 leagues
east and west and are very dangerous, being so very low that they
cannot be seen more than 5 leagues. We find their longitude nearly
the same as given by Captain Hudson in Herbert's East India
Directory but differ in latitude 13 miles. Probably he may have
passed to the northward of them and given the latitude of the north
side of them and, it being hazy when our observation was taken,
there might be an error of 2 or 3 miles in that. We could not
ascertain their extent north and south.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 November 1791</p>

<p>The SE trade continued until the 20th November, between E by S
and SSE, sometimes light and sometimes squally, but in general a
steady fresh gale and fair weather.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">18 November 1791</p>

<p>On the 28th it became rather variable, but chiefly from the NE
to the SE and S.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="dec91" id="dec91"></a>December
1791</p>

<p class="date-jnl">14 December 1791</p>

<p>December 14th at 4 am. In 35°53'S, 21°59'E got soundings 70
fathoms sand and mud, Cape Lagullas then bearing N51°45'W, true
bearing 36 leagues and had 27½° west variation, from which
situation we steered NW by W per compass 24 miles, NW 22 and had 53
fathoms sand and stones, then N by W 26 and had 60 fathoms coarse
sand and stones then N by W 26 and had 60 fathoms coarse sand and
broken shells.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">15 December 1791</p>

<p>We then hauled in NNE at 5am the 15th and after running 10 miles
saw the land from NNW to NNE off shore 6 or 7 leagues. We then
steered NW 20 miles inclining in with the land to noon at which
time we knew to be Cape Lagulhas, and bore N by W by compass 4
leagues and which by observation I make in latitude 34°46'S, from
which and taking its longitude 20°15'E of Greenwich.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 296]</p>

<p>The situation of the ship at 4am the 14th is reduced back by the
log. Cape Lagulhas (the most southern part of the land forming it)
is a low sandy point. The land moderately high behind it and coming
from the SE has much the appearance of being a sandy beach in a
bend of the coast which falls in a bight to the NE round it but as
you come near the shore makes in a projecting point and is the most
southern point of the whole coast. It may also be known by the
Gunners Quoin which is a high hill about 4 leagues to the westward
of it much resembling the Bill of Portland when to the eastward of
westward of it, but loses its remarkable appearance when abreast of
it. For a considerable distance both to the east and westward of
Cape Laghulas, at the distance of 4 leagues from the shore, the
water was of a green, muddy colour and appeared to be shoal, but as
we did not heave the lead, can only judge from the appearance.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">16 December 1791</p>

<p>16th December. At 8am passed the Cape of Good Hope at 7 or 8
miles distance with a fresh gale at SE. Saw the Bellows break very
high.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">17 December 1791</p>

<p>Saturday, 17th pm. Standing in for Table Bay, met the SE wind
out of the bay so strong that it obliged us to anchor 2 miles to
the northward of the proper anchorage.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 297]</p>

<p>We saw an English ship of war and brig in the road. A boat from
the ship soon informed us that it was the <i>Providence</i> sloop
and assistant brig going to the Society Islands for the bread fruit
plants. The <i>Providence</i>, commanded by Captain Bligh who, soon
after his return to England, when forced away from the
<i>Bounty</i>, was made Port Captain and these vessels fitted out
for the same voyage. We found also that the <i>Pitt</i> indiaman
was in the road bound to New South Wales. She had on board Major
Grosse, the new lieutenant-governor of that territory, with part of
his corp, and men and women convicts.</p>

<p>By meeting with these ships we got accounts from England to the
latter end of July which, in our situation was very interesting. We
heard that the <i>Gorgon</i> had sailed from the Cape last July and
that the other ships for New South Wales had passed all well.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">20 December 1791</p>

<p>We made several unsuccessful attempts to get up to the anchorage
off the Cape Town and lost ground every time and on the 20th at 4pm
it blew so violent that we found the ship would not ride with 2
anchors ahead and a whole cable upon each. We therefore cut and run
out to sea (to prevent driving too near the north shore and then
not be able to do it) to the northward of Robben Island and were so
fortunate as to regain the bay and anchor off the Cape Town.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 298]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 December 1791</p>

<p>The 22nd, at 6pm. We stood in for bay with the signal of
distress and had every assistance from the <i>Providence</i> and
other ships, that could be given, and before dark got an anchor and
cable from the shore with which we moored.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 December 1791</p>

<p>Friday, 23rd. The <i>Swan</i> sloop of war arrived from England
bound to the East Indies, sailed from England 23 September last.
The same evening the <i>Providence</i> and assistant sailed on
their voyage.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="jan92" id="jan92"></a>January
1792</p>

<p class="date-jnl">12 January 1792</p>

<p>January 12th 1792. After having refitted the ship and waited
several days for the recovery of the sick, we were under the
necessity of leaving 5 of them at the hospital. The others were
taken on board but by no means perfectly recovered. The wind being
unfavourable it was the 18th before we could get to sea at noon,
passing Robben Island.</p>

<p>Whilst we were at the Cape, we fitted the spare main topmast for
a mizzen mast and got down the trysail mast and gaft as the vessel
was in want of after sail. Having experienced that she was
considerably over-masted, we reefed both the topmasts 4 feet and
made some other necessary alterations for the security of the
masts. We had the wind from the south to the SW until in the
latitude of 23° when we got the SE trade which, in general, was
moderate and fair weather.</p>

<p class="caption">'James's Valley, St Helena, 1792'</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="feb92" id="feb92"></a>February
1792</p>

<p class="date-jnl">4 February 1792</p>

<p>Made the island of St. Helena the 4th of February and anchored
off James's Valley at noon the same day.</p>

<p>In standing towards St. Helena, it is best to keep to the SE of
the island before you get close in with it. It may be approached
without fear. The only landing places are on the NW side of the
island and the anchoring ground off the town being not more than
one mile and the outer edge of the bank not more than two miles, it
is necessary to keep the shore close aboard as you haul round the
NE end of the island (Barn Point) which you may know coming from
the SE by a very ragged hill on the east side and about a mile to
the southward of it, with a small sugar loaf top and a look out
house on it, where they hoist signal flags and show balls. Before
you get the length of that hill, you will see the top of Sugar Loaf
Hill with a flag and fort on it showing over the land between this
look out and Barn Point. When you pass Barn Point, which you may do
at a cable's length distance, haul close up for Sugar Loaf Point,
which runs steep down to the sea from the fort before mentioned and
is about 2 miles to the westward of Barn Point. It is necessary to
keep close in with Sugar Loaf Point if the trade wind is fresh,
otherwise I think not nearer than ½ a mile as the wind baffles very
much when the trade is not brisk. As you approach Sugar Loaf Point
you open the road, which bears from it about SW by W per compass,
between 2 and 3 miles.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 300]</p>

<p>A small distance to the southward of Sugar Loaf Point is
Rupert's Valley (or rather Gulley) off which you have anchorage if
pressed to it. The hill forming this valley to the SW also forms
James's Valley to the NE. It has a square fort near the water and
another fort or battery on the top and is called Munden's Point.
The anchoring ground is off James's Valley, 12 or 15 fathoms, and
is a very good birth. You will then be rather more than ¼ of a mile
from the beach. I would recommend always to moor, or steady with
the stream, being subject to have strong flaws off the land and,
between those flaws, baffling winds from all quarters. We found
watering very convenient, there being a wharf and crane built
farther out than that one formerly used for the purpose, and proper
moorings laid down off it for a boat to go and lay with stoppers to
veer in and haul out occasionally by stern and head ropes. The boat
lays in deep water, and the crane, projecting well over the boat,
the empty casks are got up and full ones struck over, with great
ease and expedition. It very seldom happens that the surf is so
great as to prevent watering, but that may always be seen. On
coming in with Sugar Loaf Point it is necessary to send a boat
ahead and inform the fort, which is near the water on the point,
what ship it is, and they convey that information as to the nation,
force, etc. by signals to James Valley.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 301]</p>

<p>Captain Hunter was saluted with 11 guns on his going on shore
and on embarking to go to sea. We found everything very scarce and
dear except fish, occasioned by their having had two very dry
seasons following. Variation observation, in the Road, 15°30'W.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">13-27 February 1792</p>

<p>Monday, 13th at 3pm. Sailed from St. Helena and passed to the
westward of Ascension the 20th. We saw a ship in close but did not
speak with her. We crossed the line the 27th of February, in 22°18'W
longitude.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="mar92" id="mar92"></a>March 1792</p>

<p>We kept the trade fresh until the 1st March when it became light
and variable and sometimes squally before we got into the NE trade,
which we did on the 5th of March in 5°09'N, 25°W. We were carried
to the Westward to 46 degrees of
longitude and in the parallel of 28½°N latitude when, on the
30th March, the wind backed round to the E and SE and soon
became variable, as generally found in the Western Ocean.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="apr92" id="apr92"></a>April 1792</p>

<p class="date-jnl">8 April 1792</p>

<p>April 8th. Passed the meridian of Corvo, 31 leagues to the
northward of it. Spoke [to] an American ship from Bristol, by whom
we heard all was peace in England.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">22 April 1792</p>

<p>Sunday, 22nd. At 4pm saw the Lizard, bearing N15°E, 6 leagues, do.
by last lunar observations N47°E, 9 leagues. At 9am saw Portland,
bearing NNE 4 or 5 leagues and at noon were nearly abreast of St.
Albans, the weather very hazy over the land.</p>

<p class="page-jnl">[Page 302]</p>

<p class="date-jnl">23 April 1792</p>

<p>Monday, 23rd. At 1pm saw the Isle of Wight and took a pilot on
board. At 5, passed the Needle Rocks and at 8 anchored in
Portsmouth Harbour, off the Common Hard. Found Vice Admiral
Roddam's flag flying on board the <i>Duke</i>, with the guardships
belonging to the port, in the harbour.</p>

<p class="date-jnl">27 April 1792</p>

<p>Friday, 27th. A court martial was held on board of the
<i>Brunswick</i> to try Captain Hunter, the officers and crew of
the <i>Sirius</i>, for the loss of the said ship, when it appeared
that everything was done, that could be done, to save the ship.</p>

<p class="month-jnl"><a name="may92" id="may92"></a>May 1792</p>

<p>Captain Hunter, the officers and crew, were honourably acquitted
and removed from the <i>Waakzamheydt</i> to the Admiral's ship,
where they were paid off the 4th May 1792.</p>
