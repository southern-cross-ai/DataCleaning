  The Priest And The Miser</b></h2>
  <p>In a portion of the great metropolis, described in the Postmaster-General&rsquo;s
  map of London as the North-Western district, is a congeries, or braided mass,
  of narrow streets, squares, courts, and alleys, the dingy and dilapidated
  houses of which are thickly tenanted by men, women, and children, who (dock
  labourers and Spitalfields weavers excepted) perhaps find it harder to make &ldquo;both
  ends meet&rdquo; than any other corresponding number of the Queen&rsquo;s
  subjects. The neighbourhood is one in which the O&rsquo;Mulligan of Bally
  Mulligan (Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s acquaintance) might hope to find lodgings
  suitable to his means, if not to his taste; but any gentleman residing thereabout
  might also be reasonably excused if he did not press his hospitality upon
  his friends, and preferred to give his address at &ldquo;the club.&rdquo; Some
  of my readers may have heard of the district I refer to&mdash;a few may know
  it&mdash;under its title of Somers Town.</p>
  <p>In a room in one of the best houses standing in one of the best streets
  of this quarter, described by otherwise conflicting testimony as &ldquo;a
  miserable garret,&rdquo; a few years ago, a lone, unfriended old man was
  slowly dying. As I am in truth, not writing romance, but history in the garb
  of fiction, it may be just as well to be a little precise and minute, and
  say that this narrative opens on the 28th of February, 1847. It was Sunday
  morning. The old man&rsquo;s name was Carr&eacute;&mdash; Maturin Carr&eacute;.
  He was seventy-seven years of age, and looked quite as old as his baptismal
  register indicated. He was a native of France, but had been many years in
  England. He came to London from Jersey, and arrived on that speck of debatable
  geography from the South of France.</p>
  <p>People who knew him best, with one exception, commiserated him most. His
  age, and the external indications of poverty, elicited many delicate attentions
  from the needy Irish devotees who frequented the Roman Catholic chapel adjacent
  to his home, and at the same time it screened him so well from the notice
  of the richer members of that communion, that neither the lawyer who will
  figure in this story, nor the priest who afterwards made oath that he had
  been for three years preceding his death Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s spiritual director,
  was apparently at this exact moment aware of the existence of such a person.
  It is presumed that he never went to the confessional, and it is said that
  he attended the chapel more for the purpose of obtaining material relief
  than spiritual guidance or consolation.</p>
  <p>A mystery surrounded the man which nobody cared to penetrate. Rumours had
  been heard about a marriage to which he had been a party&mdash;a child, and
  a faithless wife; but these reports died away almost as speedily as they
  were uttered. His principal means of subsistence were unknown. It was thought
  he earned a few shillings now and then by teaching his native and other languages.
  He had, in fact, been in his earlier days much employed in that way, and
  until utterly prostrated by the illness which had brought him into contact
  with the grim fiend, he made a little income by teaching.</p>
  <p>The reader may also perhaps be concerned to know that Maturin Carr&eacute; was
  a political refugee. His exile was caused by his attachment to the fallen
  fortunes of Charles X. He had many years received a pension from a fund which
  had been raised for the sustenance of the refugees of that party. At one
  time it was forty pounds a year, but it had dwindled to fifteen pounds.</p>
  <p>When his usual reticence forsook him, he would tell stories about Robespierre
  and the Reign of Terror, and there is no reason for supposing him guilty
  of untruth when he asserted that, if he had been content to serve under the
  merciless dictator, he might have played an important part in the terrible
  drama of the French revolution, instead of being compelled to find safety
  in a miserable exile.</p>
  <p>The interesting rumours about a wife and child were, however, pure fictions.
  It is doubtful whether that repulsive nature had ever been softened by the
  gentle emotions of love. He was a bachelor, and for a long time had uniformly
  betrayed an aversion to the society of women. It is said that as long as
  possible he performed every domestic office with his own hands, and his bed
  in Somers Town had never, as far as he knew, been smoothed or adjusted by
  fairy or crone in human shape. His fare was the simplest and cheapest which
  markets that contain no luxury offer to a purchaser. If the reader
  will imagine the most wretched condition that solitary old age could bear,
  he will have a true conception of the existence led by Maturin Carr&eacute;.</p>
  <p>I described the old man as dying. He was conscious of the fact, but anxious,
  as nearly all men are&mdash;not excepting the most forlorn and wobegone&mdash;to
  prolong the remnant of his days to their utmost span. Christian charity is,
  after all, not quite so rare as it is often said to be. Medical aid is, at
  all events, within the reach of the poorest and the most obscure. The doctor&rsquo;s
  advice, and his physic, are to be had without pay, by everybody who chooses
  to ask for them on these terms. Maturin Carr&eacute; was not a proud old
  man. He asked for the assistance of a doctor, who belonged to the church
  he attended, and that gentleman was directed to visit the exile. He called
  to see him very early on the morning of Sunday, the 28th of March, 1847.</p>
  <p>The miserable patient lay stretched on a sort of box, rather than bedstead.
  When the surgeon, after early mass, looked in to see and prescribe for his
  necessities, the landlord of the house, who showed the pious son of Esculapius
  to the garret, was present at an interview between them, and noted their
  conversation.</p>
  <p>Maturin Carr&eacute;, it was as obvious to the shrewd nonprofessional eye
  as to the most skilful in diagnosis, had not long to live, and no landlord
  could be altogether indifferent about the fate of a dying lodger, so that
  we may excuse his presence as a third party on this occasion. It is to be
  observed, however, that the hopeless sufferer was not at all desirous to
  partake of those spiritual consolations that I have been told the Roman Catholic
  faith can bestow at such a time more liberally than a Protestant creed.</p>
  <p>It was not the doctor&rsquo;s first visit to Carr&eacute;, and the man of
  physic had previously recommended that a priest should be called in: but
  the advice was more unpalatable than the contents of his bottles and pillboxes.
  On the Sunday morning I speak of, the surgeon repeated the obnoxious suggestion.
  Bronchitis had almost done its work upon a feeble system. Drugs might as
  well have been thrown to the dogs, or into the common sewer, as down the
  wheezy throat of the expiring champion of decayed Bourbonism. The only real
  means of relief to the sufferer were not kept in gallipots, or the drawer
  of a surgery. The diet suited to a man in <i>extremis</i>, Carr&eacute; had
  no visible funds to purchase, and the doctor had no money at his disposal
  to expend in obtaining them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the doctor in French&mdash;after feeling
  the pulse of his patient&mdash;for he was a Frenchman&mdash;&ldquo;I must
  tell you, I think you are a little worse than you were the day before yesterday,
  Shall I ask Father Andrews to call and see you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man, with an effort, shook his head, and muttered a word of dissent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will send you another draught,&rdquo; rejoined the surgeon, who
  observed by the shock his former advice produced, that the approach of death
  had not excited the latent religious feelings of the patient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think our friend had better let me ask Father Thomas to call,&rdquo; in
  a few moments the doctor said, turning his eyes in the direction of the landlord,
  as if to obtain some further influence from this direction, and in the hope
  that it might be a personal objection to the priest whose name had been first
  mentioned, which led to the rejection of his ministrations.</p>
  <p>The landlord expressed his concurrence; but the lodger spasmodically ejaculated &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and
  fell backwards.</p>
  <p>It was quite plain that M. Carr&eacute; had no wish to avail himself of
  the comforts of the faith he professed. May I not say it is certain that
  he had no faith in the efficacy of the religion he professed! Is it not reasonable
  to suppose that the dying man had for some time, and up to this moment, been
  an unbeliever in all religions, and although not unconscious that the hand
  of death was upon him, its approach had not broken through the gloom which
  unbelieving selfishness, and the lack of sympathy from and towards his fellows,
  had engendered during his isolated existence? Without extending hypothesis,
  it may surely be written down as a truth, that Maturin Carr&eacute; was not,
  on that Sunday morning, entitled to be regarded as &ldquo;a good Catholic.&rdquo; So
  thought the Doctor; and although he was not, consequently, disposed to withdraw
  from attendance at the old man&rsquo;s bedside, or inclined to then resent
  the ungracious disbelief in his creed, by stopping the supply of physic,
  he saw it was useless on this occasion to follow up what had all the appearance
  of undoubtedly kind, disinterested, and seasonable advice to call in either
  of the priests he had named.</p>
  <p>In a few minutes, after the patient had somewhat recovered himself from
  the shock produced by this conversation, the doctor withdrew.</p>
  <p>As he descended the stairs he observed the landlord close upon his heels.
  This person had left the garret with the surgeon in order to perform a simple
  office of courtesy by opening and closing the street-door upon the beneficent
  visitor. As he did so they exchanged a few words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s little or nothing
  I can do for him; he wants port wine and arrow-root, and such things; but
  it&rsquo;s impossible he can get them. It&rsquo;s a melancholy case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These fragmentary sentences took the landlord by surprise, but why they
  should have done so is yet unaccountable. All we know is, that the reserve
  of the auditor forsook him, and that he yielded up at once a real or pretended
  confidence, which he had long treasured as a secret of value.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir,&rdquo; somewhat hastily replied the landlord, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
  got plenty of money. Order what you think he wants; he can buy anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A critical person, or one skilful in detecting hidden thoughts and half-concealed
  emotions, might possibly have observed a slight change pass over the countenance
  of that unimpassioned French Roman Catholic charity doctor. The landlord
  noticed nothing of the kind. The surgeon shook his learned head, as if he
  doubted the accuracy of the intelligence. He went on his way, and the landlord
  closed the door.</p>
  <p>The words of the landlord appeared to have had a rather grotesque or eccentric
  influence upon the mind of the doctor.</p>
  <p>While it seemed impossible to procure those small luxuries he prescribed
  wine and arrow-root; but when told they were at the command of the patient,
  this medical genius, judging by his conduct, deemed them unnecessary. The
  reputed wealth of the dying man awakened a new and extraordinary solicitude
  for his spiritual welfare.</p>
  <p>When the doctor first saw his patient, he certainly recommended him to call
  in a priest, yet, as I have said, he did not press the suggestion; but now,
  having reason to presume that the dying man had an abundance of cash, it
  became necessary to save his soul, if that were possible, against his will.
  The surgeon did not, therefore, return at once to his own house, but went
  straightway to the chapel hard by, and held a consultation with Father Andrews.</p>
  <p>Let me here say a word or two on behalf of this zealous priest. I will not
  attempt to sketch his features in pen and ink. The portrait of one Roman
  Catholic clergyman is so very like the picture of another, that I should
  be needlessly wearying the reader. The discipline, or system, which crushes,
  or extinguishes, the mental individuality of its professional exponents,
  somehow mutilates those salient distinctions which Providence marks upon
  every human face in infancy. Did the reader ever see two Romanist priests
  walking in the street, side by side? If so, unless there was a great disparity
  of age between them, or one had the advantage of six inches in stature over
  his brother, none but a most intimate acquaintance could trace an intelligible
  line of distinction in their features. The countenances of any two Roman
  Catholic priests of the same age will, in juxtaposition, be found to resemble
  each other almost as nearly as two peas extracted from the same pod. It will
  therefore be enough to say that Father Andrews was a man of portly bearing,
  who trod the earth like one aware he exercised enormous power over his fellows.
  He was about fifty years of age, but the cares of life and the severity of
  his penances had been met by a vigorous constitution, so that he might have
  been mistaken for a younger man. If it were safe to predicate anything about
  his character from his physiognomy, it would be that Father Andrews had a
  resolute will of his own, controlling, if not overpowering, his native caution.</p>
  <p>He had the reputation of being a zealous priest, but he was not a Jesuit.
  He was indeed most anxious the world should know that he looked unfavourably
  upon the institutions and followers of Ignatius Loyola.</p>
  <p>Yet I should be doing him an injustice if. we did not admit&mdash;what this
  narrative demonstrates&mdash;that he regarded the advancement of the interests
  of his Church as the cardinal, or perhaps the sole object of his existence.</p>
  <p>This was the person sought without delay by the doctor. He had not long
  finished the celebration of an early mass when his friend entered the chapel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, doctor,&rdquo; was the solemn greeting of the priest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; responded the surgeon, in livelier tones. The
  worthy men glanced at each other knowingly, and coldly shook hands. There
  was a slight pause on the threshold of the conversation. The priest may have
  thought it the business of his subordinate to make the communication he had
  to make without waiting for the formality of being asked. The doctor being
  conscious of the value of the suggestion he had to make, was in no hurry
  to part with it.</p>
  <p>The priest broke silence by asking, &ldquo;What news, doctor? Does any rich
  patient of thine, standing on the verge of eternity, need the offices of
  our holy Church?&quot;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, reverend father,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, &ldquo;but a decrepid
  old man, who lives in an adjoining street, and reputed so poor that he has
  partaken of our pious charities, is dying, and I have discovered that he
  is in fact a cheat and a miser, who has a hoard of wealth. I have urged him
  to make his peace with God and our holy Church. I think you had better see
  him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The quick-witted priest readily comprehended the urgency of the matter,
  and promised to give it immediate attention. The clergyman then shook hands
  rather heartily with the doctor, who went on his round of calls. Father Andrews
  trotted home, ate a substantial breakfast, and after duly considering the
  part he was about to engage in, he paid a visit to the dying miser.</p>
  <p>Maturin Carr&eacute; was sitting or leaning, half erect, on his miserable
  pallet, when Father Andrews entered the room unbidden, within a short hour
  or two after the doctor had left it. What passed at this solemn interview
  no living man, except the priest, can tell. I will not draw upon my imagination
  for a description of the mode by which the strong will of the priest conquered
  the obstinate selfishness of the exile, or pretend to relate how the hoary-headed
  sinner was led to penitence. All I have ascertained for a fact is, that Maturin
  Carr&eacute; laid open his heart to the ken of his spiritual adviser. He
  confessed how he had obtained money from time to time, and how, by extreme
  self-denial, by falsehood, the simulation of poverty, and miserly thrift,
  he had saved it, invested principal with its usufruct, until the whole amount
  had reached the total of nearly &pound;10,000, which sum then stood to his
  credit in the reliable custody of the State. Then, whether on the recommendation
  of Father Andrews, or in obedience to his own penitential emotions, I offer
  no opinion, Maturin Carr&eacute; sought to make his peace with the Almighty
  by bestowing a small portion of his accumulated wealth upon his poor kindred
  in France, and the greater part thereof to a Roman Catholic charity. The
  zealous priest was delighted to perceive that he had already secured the
  very acceptable sum of &pound;7,000 for the propagation of his holy faith,
  by a process which relieved the conscience of the testator. Maturin Carr&eacute;,
  however, entreated the holy father to bestow upon him, in return for these
  bequests, the consolations of religion.</p>
  <p>The priest hesitated for a moment. There was yet a little secular formality&mdash;it
  might be a test of the penitent&rsquo;s sincerity&mdash;to be gone through
  ere that boon was granted. Upon a scrap of paper the holy man wrote in pencil
  a few words; he read them over to the dying penitent, who, in a sort of gasp,
  conveyed his assent to this appropriation of his estate: and having done
  all it was that morning possible to do for the advancement of his faith,
  Father Andrews gave the forlorn miser absolution for a long career of greed
  and deception. He stayed a few minutes longer, until the wearied penitent,
  overcome by the trial he had passed through, dropped almost insensible upon
  his bed, and in the softest tones a priest could utter, he whispered &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; urged
  poor Carr&eacute; to devote all his thoughts to God, and quitted the house.
  The scene had been a trying one to both parties, and the conclusion was a
  relief to each of them.</p>
  <p>Let nobody complain that Father Andrews called in the aid of a lawyer on
  Sunday. The highest authority has declared the lawfulness of doing good on
  the Sabbath day. M. Carr&eacute; was <i>in extremis</i>. Time was of the
  most precious value. The remnant of the miser&rsquo;s life was reduced to
  days, perhaps to hours. Even yet death might rob the Church of a penitent&rsquo;s
  bequest. The priest therefore sent a trusty messenger to a member of his
  congregation whose assistance had now become necessary. As this gentleman
  has gone to render his final account in a court of record where special pleas
  are not admitted, and where all virtue, as well as vice, is rewarded, we
  are warranted in believing that justice has been, or will be done to him,
  according to his merits; but this does not release us, as faithful chroniclers,
  from doing him immediate justice in this narrative. A cynic has declared
  that the memory of good men dies with them, and that the evil alone survives
  fragile mortality. This is a libel or a slander. We believe the poet who
  says that &ldquo;the actions of the just smell sweet and blossom from the
  dust,&rdquo; is nearer the truth. At all events I will deal honestly with
  this lawyer. His name shall be emblazoned in type. It was Cooke&mdash;John
  Athanasius Cooke, Esquire, Barrister-at-Law. This gentleman had been for
  twenty years a member of what is called the &ldquo;Equity bar,&rdquo; although
  some people (notably an illustrious novelist) have questioned the accuracy
  of the title. He was a famous &ldquo;Equity draftsman,&rdquo; which phrase
  being interpreted for the benefit of the vulgar, means, in this instance,
  a clever hand at drawing wills and trust-deeds for Roman Catholic religious
  endowments. One special claim to the admiration of the enlightened British
  public in this dashing, adventurous age, presented by the life of Mr. Cooke,
  is the fact that, with a Roman chisel, he carved his way to fame, if not
  to fortune. He had been an attorney&rsquo;s clerk, and a Protestant in religion,
  but had lifted himself or been lifted&mdash;by what power we know not, unless
  it were his own and that of the Romish Church&mdash;into an upper sphere
  of the legal profession, and the loftier faith of the Papacy. For eight years
  prior to the date of this narrative, Mr. John Athanasius Cooke had also been
  a member of Father Andrews&rsquo; congregation, and so by virtue of long
  communion, and a reputation for skill in such matters, my lawyer obtained
  the honour of that reverend gentleman&rsquo;s confidence on this occasion.</p>
  <p>The lawyer obeyed the summons of the priest with alacrity.</p>
  <p>That Sunday afternoon witnessed their conference. The task he had to perform
  was set before him. Mr. Cooke explained that the whole transaction was &ldquo;a
  little irregular,&rdquo; and begged that the form of calling in a solicitor
  to instruct him might be gone through, just to comply with the etiquette
  of the profession, which looked upon such matters as this with a critical
  and suspicious eye. Father Andrews rebuked the lawyer&rsquo;s scruples, and
  reminded him of his material obligations to the Church he had adopted. The
  priest sardonically inquired whether this was the first instance in which
  our barrister had, with his own hand, and without a solicitor&rsquo;s intervention,
  done a little favour of the kind for a dying penitent?</p>
  <p>Mr. Cooke yielded up his scruples. He felt that the power which had made
  could unmake him. He owed all that he possessed to the Church whose humble
  servant he was; and at whatever risk to his professional status, he must
  obey the orders of his priest.</p>
  <p>Father Andrews drew from his pocket the memorandum he had drawn up in the
  chamber of M. Carr&eacute;, and to which that poor wretch had in terror,
  or perhaps between fear and hope, given his assent.</p>
  <p>Mr. Cooke having promised to draw a will according to these instructions,
  and neatly engross the same with his own hand, so as to limit the circle
  of confidence, he was allowed to quit the holy father&rsquo;s presence. I
  must not, however, neglect to say that arrangements were made to meet next
  evening at Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s bedside. Evening was selected, because,
  as Father Andrews stated, a day&rsquo;s remorseful thought and its exhausting
  effect upon a worldly mind, might facilitate the pious labour of completing
  the bequest. The morning was suggested by Mr. Cooke; but the priest replied,
  that at such a moment the greed and irreligious thoughts of the testator
  might prevail over all ghostly influence. So the next evening was determined
  upon for the execution of a will which the barrister agreed to bring in his
  pocket.</p>
  <p>Reader, let us follow this astute lawyer to his chambers. We may be permitted
  to see the legal craftsman at his work. It will be a novel sight. You have
  probably seen a few manufacturing processes, but if you are a reflective
  person, nothing half so unique, and, perhaps interesting (although it certainly
  is not beautiful), as the machinery by which kindred&mdash;oftentimes widows,
  orphans, and aged parents&mdash;have been and are plundered, even in this
  enlightened country, by unscrupulous lawyers, who are the instruments of
  designing priests. Will you, dear reader, observe with care the various stages
  in the manufacture of Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s will?</p>
  <p>The lawyer rose at daybreak, after a night of imperfect slumber. The conscience
  of his early manhood had not been moulded into the exact form, or taken the
  precise colouring, that his new masters could have wished. Yet he did not
  long hesitate. Some hours before the drowsy, ill-clad, sinister-looking boy,
  denominated a clerk, arrived, and to the astonishment of a blear-eyed old
  woman, called a laundress, who was supposed to be cleaning the dingy apartments,
  Mr. Cooke entered them! After dismissing the crone, he fell into a reverie,
  and thus soliloquised:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten thousand pounds! No&mdash;seven thousand and three thousand!
  Good&mdash;that is fortunate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So it might, indeed, have been fortunate for the priest, as this story will
  show.</p>
  <p>He gazed vacantly at his book-shelves, and from thence to the blackened
  ceiling. No reproach came from the worthies whose thoughts were enshrined
  in those goodly tomes, nor through the roof from a just Heaven. Superstition
  lent her influence to the clients.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A special Providence has so arranged it. It was not my division,
  nor that of Father Andrews. The funds are already divided into the proportions
  we require,&rdquo; he continued; and this sagacious man half hoodwinked himself
  into the delusion that there was no trickery herein on his part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven thousand Reduced Stock; that is for our holy Church. Three
  thousand Consols; that sum is for relations. Let, me see. One, two, three,
  four&mdash; seven hundred and fifty pounds each. Admirable. Faithful executors
  will administer the trust, and preserve the secret. How fortunate the money
  was not all invested in one Stock? The division by us might have awakened
  inquiry and caused trouble.&rdquo; Thus proceeded the lawyer&rsquo;s soliloquy.</p>
  <p>Now he rose, paced the floor of his workship; then he paused, sat down,
  and took a pen in hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, half audibly, but nobody was listening. &ldquo;Executors
  are the first consideration, and I usually begin my wills by their appointment.
  A grim smile passed over his hard features. He recalled an observation by
  the late Mr. Joseph Miller, of facetious renown,&mdash;&ldquo; Leave your
  property to whom you please, if you make me executor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He now began to write in a distinct hand, like any clerk. The first executor
  was the Roman Catholic bishop of the district, then in the quiet enjoyment
  of a British and not a foreign territorial title.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Should there be more than one executor? It would be as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who shall I name as the second? Myself: why not? It would not, perhaps,
  look well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lawyer recollected that he had not seen the testator. He thought it
  possible the old man might object to a lawyer, and Mr. Cooke would not risk
  a miscarriage of the scheme by collision with such a prejudice. A blank was
  left for the second name, with the reserved intention to fill it by inserting
  that of Cooke, and the address of his chambers, if the testator did not object.</p>
  <p>The remainder of the document was soon prepared. It would not do to make
  the &pound;7,000 bequest directly and obviously to the Roman Church; that
  would render it legally invalid. The wisdom of the Legislature had, by an
  Act of Parliament, long ago declared this. It would not do to give the priest
  an apparently beneficial interest in it. The dying testator might object
  to this; and it was, moreover, against the policy of the Church of Rome.
  The fund must be left in trust for some pious object, so as to secure the
  interest or usufruct in perpetuity to the nominees of the Roman College,
  which undertakes this duty.</p>
  <p>An English charity must be named as the beneficial legatee. What institution
  should it be? There was a girls&rsquo; school attached to Father Andrews&rsquo; chapel;
  that would do exceedingly well There was, indeed, something pleasant in the
  notion. The idea of rescuing &pound;7,000 from a miser, and devoting it to
  the education of young women, was a pretty idea.</p>
  <p>So the lawyer wrote down &ldquo;that the sum of seven thousand pounds should
  be given to the executors in trust to apply the dividends and annual income
  in perpetuity for the benefit of and for the maintenance and support&rdquo; of
  the school referred to. That school might not, however, always have an existence.
  This contingency was easily provided against by the subtle craftsman. What
  lawyers call &ldquo;a trust over,&rdquo; or provision, that if the one school
  should ever cease to exist, the fund should be held for and applied to some
  other like charitable institution, got rid at once of the peril of a failing
  trust.</p>
  <p>There was another provision requisite. The artful people who thus extracted
  funds from the grasp of a dying miser, took care to guard its investment,
  and keep the proceeds in their own hands. Mr. Cooke inserted a provision,
  that in case one trustee should die, go to reside abroad, or decline or become
  incapable to act, the other trustee might appoint a colleague. Is it necessary
  to show how this would operate? The secular person appointed to save appearances
  in the eyes of the testator, and of any curious man who should ever go to
  Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and pay a shilling to inspect Mr. Cooke&rsquo;s skilful
  performance&mdash;a mere creature of the Roman Church&mdash;would, or might,
  be called upon to resign his trust; in which case another priest would, or
  could be, nominated. Thus the fund would be effectually secured for the Church.
  It might be applied as a college at Rome, or its servants there, wished.
  Nobody would know; there was nothing even to suggest inquiry.</p>
  <p>Cunning priest, clever lawyer&mdash;combination almost omnipotent! You think
  that the miser&rsquo;s hoard&mdash;or at least more than two-thirds of it&mdash;have
  been snatched from those very poor relations of Maturin Carr&eacute;, who,
  a distance off, in the South of France, have only a dim, vague notion that
  the old exile lives, and think that he has amassed fabulous riches. You,
  priest and lawyer, are the only persons in England who know the names of
  Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s relations. There may be time for a sister or
  a brother to pay a last tribute of affection to the lonely wretch. To such
  a man, that would, in all probability, be more consoling than the offices
  of your religion. It would, in any case, be a consolation to any dying man.
  It is, however, no portion of your plan or policy to let the Carr&eacute;s
  in France know anything about their dying brother. You, Father Andrews, assert
  that he does not entertain any affection for them. You say that he wanted
  to bequeath the whole of his savings to your Church; that you vindicated
  the claims of family and of blood; that you induced the penitent to distribute
  about &pound;3,000 among those poor people. Some folks will be ungenerous
  enough to doubt the truth of your assertion. I place your statement in this
  narrative, and leave the reader to judge of its credibility and its value. &rsquo;Tis,
  withal, a pity that your advocacy of family rights stopped short at the point
  it did. Perhaps you had some higher motive; but I know that you had a wish
  to save appearances. If you had only contrived, by the exercise of your spiritual
  influence, to reverse the arrangement&mdash;to have given &pound;7,000 to
  relatives and &pound;3,000 to the Church&mdash;the affair would undoubtedly
  have looked better. But I must not omit to explain all that the legal servant
  or slave of the Roman Church in England did, with his priest&rsquo;s concurrence,
  for Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s relations. Maturin Carr&eacute; had two
  brothers and a sister living, or supposed to be living, when this will was
  made. One sister, after getting married and bearing children, died. To each
  of the three living kindred, &pound;750 in Stock was given; while between
  the children of the deceased sister the like amount was divided.</p>
  <p>The lawyer, having so far completed his task, rose from his chair again,
  and went out to enjoy a morning walk in the dusky purlieus of his manufactory.
  He had done his work skilfully, and perhaps enjoyed the consciousness of
  that little fact. One satisfaction his patrons might have felt if they were
  capable of duly appreciating it&mdash;the writing was a clear, intelligible,
  round hand. No other person had been taken into confidence&mdash;no heretical
  copyist had been employed. The advantage of this will be obvious to the reader.</p>
  <p>That afternoon the lawyer and the priest were again closeted in the apartments
  of the latter, and the holy father graciously smiled as he perused the document,
  and bestowed an approving look upon his faithful friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well done, my son,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;You have performed
  your duty to our holy Church excellently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Over the lawyer&rsquo;s harsh countenance there glided a faint smile. A
  compliment was grateful to him. Then his features settled into their usual
  rigidity. Misgivings as to the propriety of his share in this business disturbed
  him. What if the plan should miscarry, notwithstanding all their devices
  and precautions? What if the Benchers of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn should hear
  about it? What if the case should be investigated by them or become sooner
  or later the subject of judicial investigation? From the first, he could
  never perfectly shake off that fear of detection.</p>
  <p>The priest observed this moodiness with a feeling of contempt for his legal
  man-of-all-work, and was silent with reference to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall require two witnesses, who are to derive no benefit from
  the will,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Cooke, a little abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course we shall. I am lawyer enough to know that, and have provided
  two of the right sort&mdash;persons who won&rsquo;t see more than I want
  them to see. They&rsquo;ll witness the old man&rsquo;s signature, but see
  nothing else, I warrant you,&rdquo; was the ready sardonic answer.</p>
  <p>All arrangements had now been made by the friends and servants of the Church.</p>
  <p>Shortly afterwards, the two gentlemen called upon the dying man. Maturin
  Carr&eacute; was not in the frame of mind they expected. The influences of
  the day had not reduced him so low as had been calculated. They found him
  argumentative and stubborn. He doubted whether he had so short a time to
  live as the doctor had informed him. He said that he did not like to make
  a will, because it appeared like resigning all hope of recovery, and urged
  many other common pretexts for not completing the bequest.</p>
  <p>During this conversation two ladies called at the house in which Carr&eacute; lived.
  One of them was the priest&rsquo;s housekeeper, the other was a schoolmistress,
  and a lady under many obligations to him.</p>
  <p>Their business may be imagined. Their call explains the half mysterious
  response of the priest to the lawyer. The holy father knew, as he said, that
  the pious or charitable bequest would be inoperative unless disinterested
  persons saw the testator attach his autograph, and also placed their signatures
  at the foot of the document. Father Andrews, with benign forethought, had
  asked these ladies to follow him at a respectful distance, to the bedside
  of the testator. The landlord of the house and his daughter, or some fellow-lodger,
  might have been relied upon to discharge the trivial obligation of witnessing
  the dying man&rsquo;s will, but the priest had sagaciously resolved that
  none but faithful communicants should have the honour. Beyond doubt no one
  could have been more gratified to play that humble part in the drama than
  either of the ladies.</p>
  <p>But it was not so ordained. Carr&eacute; was incurably obstinate.</p>
  <p>The priest heard the expected knock of his female friends at the street-door.
  He presented an appearance at that moment more easily imagined than described.
  His look half terrified his learned friend, but, strange to say, the enfeebled
  miser did not quail under the furtive glances of the confessor.</p>
  <p>The landlord, who, as the reader may have supposed, did not belong to &ldquo;the
  true faith,&rdquo; had begun to suspect a proceeding not altogether in accordance
  with his ideas of spiritual propriety. He opened the street-door, and stopped
  the further progress of the ladies. He would not let them ascend the stairs
  until he had announced their names to his lodger. The message gave him an
  opportunity he desired, to see what was going on in the abode of death. His
  worst suspicions were strengthened.</p>
  <p>The messenger announced the names of the fair visitors, and the impatient
  priest exclaimed:&mdash;&ldquo;Tell them to go home, I don&rsquo;t want them
  to-day. I shall soon come after them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he did as he promised. Baffled, humiliated, and crest-fallen, consumed
  by a rage he strove hard to conceal, it may have been through pride, or it
  may have been from cunning, and in the hope that disease would soon once
  more place Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s handwriting in his control, the priest
  did not prolong the argument or the interview more than ten minutes after
  the ladies had returned.</p>
  <p>The atmosphere of the close room affected him more than it did the expiring
  miser. The ghostly man longed for a breath of pure air. The lawyer, who had
  been silent during the latter part of the interview, saw, or fancied he saw,
  the priest&rsquo;s wish in the changing tints of his face.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;equity draughtsman,&rdquo; like many other people, thought most
  during taciturn intervals. Although silent, he had now been very thoughtful.
  He was also a man for emergencies. More legal acumen had been exercised in
  the quiet breast of the will-maker in Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s garret,
  and within five minutes, than in his own chambers, where he was at liberty
  to soliloquise during as many hours. All the possible objections to the will
  had been concentrated into one brief reflection. All the dangers to himself
  and his friends flitted across his mental vision like (if the simile be permissible)
  an electric panorama. He, too, was glad to make his escape from the loathsome
  presence of his aged victim, and the fetid air of the apartment.</p>
  <p>Obstacles had sharpened his wits. He had struck out a new line of procedure.
  The Church should have its expected legacy, if death alone were not inexorable.</p>
  <p>With this resolution in his heart, the lawyer&rsquo;s facile tongue began
  to move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, my good man, if you are unwilling to do it, we&rsquo;ll
  not press you,&rdquo; observed Mr. Cooke.</p>
  <p>The holy father made a sign, and the old man trembled.</p>
  <p>Summoning all his courage again, Maturin Carr&eacute;, in broken but decided
  accents, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m not going to die; I&rsquo;ll not make a will&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
  kill me. Leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be calm, my friend,&rdquo; the lawyer rejoined; &ldquo;we will leave
  you to think over the matter for a day or two. There, don&rsquo;t get excited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he spoke, he assisted the miser to lie down, and with considerable delicacy
  adjusted the pillow, so that a feverish head might rest upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be calm,&rdquo; he said again, and turned his eyes from the rude
  couch. His companion readily took the hint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call again in a day or two, say on Thursday, and see
  how you get on. Pray don&rsquo;t excite yourself,&rdquo; were the last words
  used at this meeting.</p>
  <p>Priest and lawyer then quitted the house, without taking leave of the landlord.
  They went to the priest&rsquo;s residence, and there discussed what next,
  and next, should be done to secure the &pound;7,000. The plan agreed upon
  and pursued will immediately appear.</p>
  <p>Two intervening days have elapsed, but they are not taken into account in
  this narrative. None of the actors, except Mr. Cooke, the versatile and persevering
  lawyer, took any account of them. The doctor never called during Tuesday
  and Wednesday upon poor old Maturin Carr&eacute; to ascertain whether he
  needed pills, powders, draughts, or lotions, or whether the miser had procured
  the wine and arrow-root that on Saturday had been considered of more use
  than physic.</p>
  <p>Father Andrews who on Saturday, when informed that a miser was lying <i>in
   extremis</i>, hastened to the bedside of Carr&eacute;, never called to
   see that wretched old man on Tuesday or Wednesday. Poor Maturin was left
   alone in his attic for two days by doctor, priest, and lawyer; but the
   last gentleman was not all this while idle. He had, in truth, been somewhat
   busy.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday morning he went to the Bank of England, and bespoke an instrument,
  or the form of an instrument&mdash;called a power of attorney&mdash;that
  would enable the dying man, if he should be so minded, to get the &pound;7,000
  transferred from himself to the nominees of his Church, without removing
  from his bed. The authorities of the Bank, as Mr. Lawyer knew beforehand,
  required two days to prepare this agent in the transfer. He went himself
  on Thursday and got the needful paper. He also worked diligently upon two
  documents which the new plan of operations required he should get ready before
  he visited Carr&eacute; again.</p>
  <p>On Thursday, after leaving the great institution in Threadneedle Street,
  the lawyer made the best of his way to the house of the priest in Somers
  Town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to see you,&rdquo; abruptly exclaimed Father
  Andrews, as his satellite entered; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s still alive, I have
  had the house watched, although I have not been to see him since Monday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray that all will be right. I have, I think you will say, done
  my part to accomplish the task we have set ourselves for the glory and advancement
  of our holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The holy father was testy. In truth he began to fear that the prize would
  not be carried off, and that the ugly affair might get disclosed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have been long enough about it,&rdquo; the priest rejoined. &ldquo;Suppose
  the old man had died while you were doing your part, our holy Church would
  not then have had much to thank you for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lawyer timidly explained the fault was not his, but that of the authorities
  of the Bank; and he went on to show how profitably the time had been used
  by him.</p>
  <p>He drew from his pocket a deed. It had been drafted by him, and neatly engrossed
  on parchment by a law stationer. The lawyer&rsquo;s eyes glistened as he
  looked at this portion of his own work. It was a Deed of Gift. It was a specious
  document, By this, Carr&eacute; was to &ldquo;cut away from himself,&rdquo; or
  with the power of attorney transfer the &pound;7,000 at once from his own
  name to those of trustees. It was no small recommendation in itself of this
  Deed of Gift over a will that it saved the nice sum of &pound;700, or thereabouts,
  which, as legacy duty, the Government would otherwise have received; but
  this was, perhaps, about the least recommendation of it in the eyes of the
  lawyer. He was consoled by the reflection that such a deed as this, when
  it passed only personal property, required no registration or enrolment.</p>
  <p>As Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s family all dwelt a long way off, and were,
  very illiterate persons, not at all likely to be able to unravel this wicked
  plot, its authors had, it would really seem, secured a practical impunity
  by their own device. All that remained to be done was to get this deed executed.
  Then the giver might die as soon as the Almighty pleased. If any of the miser&rsquo;s
  kindred should visit this country, or instruct a friend to search the records
  of Doctors&rsquo; Commons, they would trace no will containing the remotest
  direct or indirect reference to this sum of &pound;7,000. Was not this better
  than a document open to the inspection of any one whose curiosity led him
  to expend a shilling for that liberty,&mdash;a paper, wherein the trusts
  under which the &pound;7,000 nominally passed would have to be set out? All
  these things Mr. Cooke expounded to Father Andrews, whose cunning leer of
  satisfaction was the lawyer&rsquo;s present reward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we shan&rsquo;t require any will?&rdquo; Father Andrews observed
  interrogatively, for he, as he said, knew a little law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;there is the fund of &pound;3,000
  for Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s family. It will be desirable to have a will for
  several reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who are named in the deed as trustees?&rdquo; inquired the holy father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The same persons as were executors in the former will; but I have
  added a provision by which, after my death, or if I should cease to act as
  trustee, every other succeeding trustee &lsquo;shall be a bishop or priest
  of the holy Roman Catholic Church.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; ejaculated the priest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you also approve of the will?&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied the priest, who, astonished at the facility
  with which every species of property, except freehold land, could, under
  the present law of mortmain, be wrested from its owners, began to crave the
  remainder of the miser&rsquo;s property. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I
  now almost think it was wrong of us not to have taken the whole. I warrant
  no part of the old man&rsquo;s hoard will be preserved save that appropriated
  to pious uses.&rdquo; Then, again, recollecting the old man&rsquo;s positive
  refusal to sign the former will, the priest was haunted by a dread that he
  might this evening be as obstinate. So that it was perhaps as well, thought
  the holy father, to adhere to the original division, and let kindred have
  a dole of the miser&rsquo;s wealth.</p>
  <p>Looking his lawyer steadily in the face, the priest inquired how the &pound;3,000
  was to be disposed of.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;exactly in the way arranged; it
  is cut up into four parts of &pound;750 in Stock; You see,&rdquo; he added,
  handing in the paper, &ldquo;it is a very short and simple affair. Taking
  out the &pound;7,000 has much simplified the will; but it is very complete.
  Nothing on the face of it can suggest to the inquiring mind that we took
  a huge slice out of the property just before its owner died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The priest was charmed by the skilful arrangement of his lawyer.</p>
  <p>Lawyers have told me that no will need have been drawn if the simple purpose
  of it had been to secure the transmission of the &pound;3,000 in the direction
  of the bequest. In the ordinary course of law, under letters of administration,
  it would have been distributed exactly as the will provided. The real, and
  indeed the sole, object of the will, was to hand over the administration
  of the &pound;3,000 to friendly executors, who, by being thus brought into
  communication with the legatees, would stop inquiry into the use of, or indeed
  the existence of another fund&mdash;the &pound;7,000.</p>
  <p>The time had not yet quite arrived for calling upon the recalcitrant. All
  the preparations had, however, been made; so the two worthies who played
  leading parts in what I shall now venture to style the conspiracy, conceived
  they were entitled to a little enjoyment: and they had it. The remainder
  of the chat took a lively turn, as it usually does over a dinner-table when
  the host provides such good cheer as Father Andrews was able to place before
  a guest.</p>
  <p>When the priest conceived that the proper time for paying another visit
  to Maturin Carr&eacute; had arrived, he had been joined at his house by two
  other persons. One was a lady, already introduced to the reader, whose profession
  was that of schoolmistress, and who, it may be here also stated, had before
  this supplemented her ostensible vocation by little odd jobs of the kind
  now about to be described. The other was a gentleman&mdash;that is to say,
  he was clerk to a private banker who then carried on business in the neighbourhood
  of Covent Garden market, and was greatly patronised by the Roman Catholic
  clergy and gentry, who suffered terribly when his bank broke a few years
  ago.</p>
  <p>The lady and gentleman had been invited by Father Andrews to be the witnesses
  of this nefarious scheme at its culminating point. It was a prudent step
  thus to conceal from heretical eyes how modern Roman Catholic priests can
  behave towards penitents who have money, in the days, hours, or moments which
  precede the soul&rsquo;s flight to its abiding-place. Father Andrews had
  truly described these persons. The eyes of these witnesses would be able
  to see, or would certainly bear testimony to nothing dishonouring to the
  Church to which they were attached by solid material links, in addition to
  those of faith.</p>
  <p>At length the proper time arrived. Priest, lawyer, and witnesses, all strangers
  to the testator, all well acquainted with each other, three of them without
  souls to call their own, but dependent upon the fourth, set out in company
  for Maturin Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>Carr&eacute; had, however, not been quite so wretched or so feeble in mind
  or body as some persons hoped, during the interval between my second and
  third days. He had partially rallied, and was this evening somewhat stronger
  in intellect and muscle than he had been for a fortnight at least. Whether
  this was in any degree attributable to the doctor&rsquo;s non-attendance,
  the abstinence from physic, or the priest&rsquo;s forbearance, the reader,
  who is left by me to determine so many things, may decide. A self-willed
  spirit may perhaps be in a measure attributable to the influence of that
  Protestant landlord, who was the marplot of the whole design. He had been
  very much in the company of his lodger during the period I skip in order
  to abbreviate our story. This profane man had represented Father Andrews&rsquo; conduct
  in anything but a favourable light, and he had cast shadows of doubt upon
  the honour of the Roman Church&rsquo;s standing counsel, Mr. Cooke. Maturin
  Carr&eacute; had so been roused to a pitch of irreligious boldness, higher
  than that he attained on Monday, and had resolved that he would have nothing
  more to do with the priest, and the lawyer, or their projects. He had instructed
  the landlord of the house not to admit these pretended friends when they
  next called.</p>
  <p>Upon the arrival of the <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> at Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s residence&mdash;the
  priest leading the way, followed by the lawyer and the witnesses&mdash;the
  door was opened by the protecting landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Carr&eacute; is very ill, and can&rsquo;t see you to-day,&rdquo; said
  the host, half dismayed by the numerical, if not the moral, strength of the
  party.</p>
  <p>The astonishment of the visitors at this abrupt announcement was naturally
  great. The pious schoolmistress afterwards confessed, in language more didactic
  than scholastic, that she was &ldquo;regularly non-plushed;&rdquo; and the
  Catholic banker&rsquo;s clerk also naively admitted that he began to fancy &ldquo;something
  queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Priest and lawyer glanced at each other and at the landlord who barred the
  passage, or staircase, from intrusion. There was safety for reputation in
  delay, risk to character by precipitation. Death was, however, imminent,
  the hours of the miser were numbered, and hesitation might sacrifice &pound;7,000.
  The dominant characteristic of Father Andrews prevailed over his caution.
  In two or three seconds his decision had been, taken. The stake, he thought,
  was worth the risk.</p>
  <p>The priest&rsquo;s eye measured the landlord from head to foot, in order
  to judge the probabilities and capacity of resistance, and formed an opinion
  about them. As to the latter, I shall have occasion to explain what he thought.
  Of the former, it is enough to say that he saw no reason to apprehend &ldquo;a
  scene&rdquo; if the attack were dashingly made.</p>
  <p>Father Andrews, within less time than this description has occupied, threw
  himself forward, simultaneously exclaiming, &ldquo;I am not to be treated
  in this manner,&rdquo; and by a stroke of the arm removing the impediment
  from his path.</p>
  <p>The priest rushed up stairs, turned the handle of the apartment, and stood
  before the trembling miser, who yet resisted his ghostly assailant.</p>
  <p>The landlord then politely invited the embarrassed witnesses and the lawyer
  into the parlour, where, by a remarkable coincidence, there happened to be
  another gentleman, a friend of the host&rsquo;s, whose presence excited the
  barrister&rsquo;s notice, if not his fears.</p>
  <p>The reader&rsquo;s imagination will be good enough to follow me up stairs
  after the priest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray let me alone, I can&rsquo;t do any business to-day. I don&rsquo;t
  know what I am about. What do you want?&rdquo; were sentences, in English,
  that proceeded through the chattering teeth of the old man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you revoke your promise&mdash;your sacred gift to our holy Church,
  wretched man?&rdquo; inquired the priest sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no; but do leave me; call another time. I can&rsquo;t do it to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-day? To-morrow will see your body in the grave, and your soul
  in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no; I will, I will. Where are the papers?&rdquo; And the dying
  wretch held out his hand as though he wished to grasp a pen, and by conveying
  all his worldly wealth to a priest, avert the completion of a sentence.</p>
  <p>Father Andrews quickly went outside the room, and over the staircase shouted
  for the barrister and witnesses to &ldquo;come up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The witnesses proceeded upstairs at once. The lawyer, who would have given
  half his own expected legacy to have secured the absence of that stranger,
  and of the marplot landlord of the house, but knowing this desirable intermediate
  consummation was not practicable, he thought the next best thing was to make
  them observers, if not parties in the transaction.</p>
  <p>He had great faith in the lower motives of the human heart, as nearly all
  the members of his profession have. It was just possible, he thought, that
  such a tribute to their self-importance might win over the fidelity or the
  silence of these persons. The barrister did not exactly know, or even conjecture,
  the true situation of affairs in &ldquo;the second floor back&rdquo; between
  the priest and the impenitent. The landlord and his friend accepted the invitation.</p>
  <p>When the priest saw the landlord enter the room, he was terribly disconcerted,
  and embarrassment made him additionally rude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not wanted here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The barrister became alarmed. He knew that any deed or will executed by
  that weak human creature, on the brink of the abyss of death, surrounded
  as he was by strangers, would be set aside if challenged by the next of kin.
  He was terrified by remembrance that his own conduct would be severely condemned
  by the heads of that honourable profession he was degrading, and he knew
  that public opinion would anathematise all the actors in the conspiracy according
  to their demerits.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him stay, let everybody remain; I beg he will stay,&rdquo; said
  the barrister, and the priest, who conjectured that there were reasons for
  desiring their company, made no further objection to their presence.</p>
  <p>The landlord and his friend did remain, to tell afterwards all that took
  place.</p>
  <p>The barrister, to keep up a show of appearances, and not doubting for a
  moment that Father Andrews had prepared the way, went to the bedside of Carr&eacute; with
  the intention of explaining the documents. The old man who had been more
  than a little confused by the entrance of so many persons to his room, was
  frightened by the magnitude and solemnity of this &ldquo;equity draftsman&rsquo;s&rdquo; work.
  The vulgar mind usually looks upon a parchment deed with something like awe,
  and Maturin Carr&eacute; could not have been much more unnerved by the unfolding
  of a death warrant in which his own name appeared, than he was by the crumpling
  sound of this pious deed of gift.</p>
  <p>His glazed eye wandered rapidly from lawyer to priest, and scanned as well
  as it could the other strangers, who came, as he thought, at that moment
  to rob him of his evil accumulations. Again and again, as he looked at the
  priest, he trembled, and the perspiration oozed freely through his sallow
  skin. &ldquo;Leave the papers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till another day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sensation ran through the company at this expression of dissatisfaction
  with the affair, uttered in the presence of the holy father. The lawyer observed
  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Cooke, &ldquo;we will leave them. I can,
  if you please, make another appointment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lawyer was about to fold up the papers and take his departure, but the
  priest laid hold of his arm and bade him stay.</p>
  <p>The priest stepped up to the wretched bedside, and addressed the dying man.
  What he said no living person can tell, for he selected a language which
  nobody else present, except Carr&eacute;&mdash;not even the lawyer&mdash;could
  understand. Father Andrews slowly addressed the dying miser in French. Each
  word quickened the pulse of old Maturin, set his teeth chattering, and again
  brought the damp perspiration through his skin.</p>
  <p>The French discourse, whatever it may have been, had not proceeded far when
  the dying wretch exclaimed: &mdash;&ldquo;Yes, yes, I will sign them: don&rsquo;t
  leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After this, Mr. Cooke was anxious to make one or two explanations, which
  he thought might satisfy the scruples of the heretical witnesses. He explained
  to Carr&eacute; the solemn mockery that this deed of gift would not deprive
  him of the beneficial interest in his &pound;7,000 so long as he lived; that
  he had a life interest secured to him therein, and that although the trustees
  would take what lawyers call &ldquo;the legal estate&rdquo; in his money,
  they would have to pay him the interest thereof as long as he lived; that
  it also contained a power of revocation, so that he could at any time during
  his life, by another regular deed, call upon the trustees to cancel this
  one, and hand him back his wealth. All these sage and important announcements
  were, however, unintelligible to the penitent, and not understood by the
  landlord or his friend.</p>
  <p>The will, too&mdash;that was explained. Old Maturin saw his landlord before
  him, and remembering odd kindnesses he had received from that quarter, requested
  that everything in the house at the time of his death, money and goods, should
  be given to him. Neither priest nor lawyer objected to this, because it placed
  the landlord under recognizances not to disclose the affair.</p>
  <p>If the will were set aside, this legacy, worth about &pound;100, would
  be lost to him as the informer. Father Andrews suggested to the penitent
  that the lawyer ought also to have a legacy. The poor old wretch agreed to
  this. Fifty pounds was the amount named. The barrister went through the form
  of saying that was not necessary, the priest urged it, and it was so written
  down.</p>
  <p>The several documents were formally executed and witnessed, and the heroes
  of this extraordinary modem romance, as soon as they could with an outward
  show of decency, withdrew to congratulate themselves on the final success
  of their scheme.</p>
  <p>The execution of these documents by M. Carr&eacute; was no easy task. He
  had been so reduced by illness, and so prostrated by the French discourse
  of the holy father, that it became necessary to assist him. The priest raised
  him up in his bed, placed the pen in his hand, and supported his back while
  he feebly traced on each of the three instruments&mdash;Deed of Gift, Power
  of Attorney, and Will&mdash;the name of Maturin Carr&eacute;.</p>
  <p>But the transaction was not then quite complete. Suppose Maturin Carr&eacute; should
  happen to die before the &pound;7,000 Stock is transferred from his name
  to those of the trustees. If he should happen to die with what the lawyers
  call &ldquo;the legal estate&rdquo; in that Stock in him, it will pass to
  his next of kin. There will be a smart race between Death, the patron of
  the next of kin, and Mr. John Athanasius Cooke, legal servant-of-all-work
  to the Anglo-Roman Catholic Church.</p>
  <p>It was, after all, not a good arrangement on the part of Father Andrews,
  that the conferences with Maturin should take place in the evening, although
  it proceeded from an artful design. It prevented anything being done on the
  same day which might be necessary to give effect to the pious acts of the
  miser. A day, an hour&mdash;or as the result proved&mdash;even a few minutes,
  would determine whether the Roman Church should have the &pound;7,000, or
  whether the money should legally pass to the kindred of the deceased.</p>
  <p>Mr. Cooke did all that he possibly could, as he put it, &ldquo;in order
  to carry out the benevolent intentions of the testator.&rdquo; Nothing could
  be done at the Bank of England on the Thursday&mdash;the third day of my
  narrative. Nothing effectual could be accomplished until the Saturday&mdash;my
  fourth day.</p>
  <p>In the interim, the lawyer made what preparations were necessary. Nothing
  could possibly exceed the vigilance of this learned gentleman. At the early
  hour of ten next morning (Friday), he paid a visit, in a cab, to the Bank,
  in company with a stockbroker of unquestionable orthodoxy, and entreated
  the officials to lose no time in making the transfer. The officers of the
  government and company who transact this business for the State are a rather
  torpid, or slowly moving set. The payment of an extra fee will, however,
  stimulate them a little. The barrister, duly sensible of the value of time
  in this instance, paid the &ldquo;expedition money&rdquo; and went home.
  There was no alternative. He could only wait another day, and hope that in
  the interval the old man would be good enough not to die, and so defeat the
  object of much labour and cunning.</p>
  <p>Carr&eacute; during the same period, was fast sinking into his grave, and
  neither doctor nor priest thought to aid or comfort him. Neither of these
  gentlemen cared to send him physic, nor to soothe him by a prayer, This appears
  to be a grave mistake. A tonic, or an anodyne, and some dainty nourishing
  food might have extended the duration of his life, until the lawyer had,
  beyond all doubt, completed his work. The trial of the third day had much
  accelerated the crisis. His mind was now an almost total wreck. At moments
  he would resolve to send for the priest and demand that the papers should
  be delivered up to him, or cancelled before his eyes; but immediately afterwards
  he would repent the thought, and derive a scanty sense of pleasure from a
  partial belief that he had appeased the Almighty by yielding to the priest&rsquo;s
  artifices. In this way, but approaching hour by hour nearer and nearer to
  his end, the Friday was tided over by Maturin Carr&eacute;, and the Saturday
  approached.</p>
  <p>Saturday, the 6th of March, 1847, beheld the completion of the priestly
  fraud.</p>
  <p>The lawyer rose from his uneasy bed at an early hour; he had slept but little
  that night. Long training from an immature youth to ripe manhood had not
  been given him as to a priest, so as to warp his natural understanding, cloud
  or distort his vision, and prevent his really seeing this odious affair in
  its real light and situation. If he had not already gone too far, he would
  have drawn back; this he thought was now impossible. Apart from the hostility
  he would thus earn from his patrons, and the consequent poverty he would
  have to brave, he saw the peril of a disclosure from the adoption of such
  a course. Safety, or the probability of avoiding detection, now assuredly
  lay in the direction he was expected to take. There was, practically, no
  course open but that he was pursuing.</p>
  <p>By ten o&rsquo;clock that morning he was in the office of a stockbroker,
  in one of the narrow thoroughfares of the city. This gentleman had not arrived,
  and was not expected for at least another hour, from his delightful suburban
  home.</p>
  <p>Here, again, was a vexatious delay. Life was ebbing fast out of that wretched
  old man in Somers Town; and the barrister, in his impatience, took the clerk
  at a desk so far into confidence as to explain that &ldquo;the benevolent
  intentions of the testator&rdquo; might be frustrated if the broker should
  not soon arrive.</p>
  <p>At length the stockbroker&rsquo;s carriage brought that important gentleman
  to his office door. Mr. Cooke, standing on the threshold, saw his arrival.
  As he was emerging from the vehicle the lawyer thrust him back, and stepped
  into the carriage himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the Bank Transfer Office,&rdquo; he said to the driver, who knew
  the place very well.</p>
  <p>To the broker a few words of explanation were tendered, and accepted as
  apology for this unseemly haste.</p>
  <p>Two or three minutes at most brought the carriage to the Bank. How long
  it took to get the transfer completed I am not able to say; but at half-past
  one o&rsquo;clock that important ceremony was an accomplished fact.</p>
  <p>Intense anxiety was seated on the countenance of the barrister as he passed
  out of the Bank of England. Was Maturin Carr&eacute; yet alive? Vital question!
  Had death anticipated and baffled priest and lawyer? What if the scheme should
  wholly miscarry at the last stage? Exposure and ruin to him&mdash;scandal
  and injury to the Church. Conscience sorely punished Mr. Cooke that day.</p>
  <p>As he halted to reflect an instant, an empty cab moved past. He hailed it,
  and told Jehu to drive rapidly as he could to a certain street in Somers
  Town. As the horse was a good one, he travelled over the ground at a pace
  that would have been pleasant to a railway traveller, but a pace withal that
  Mr. Cooke considered torturingly slow.</p>
  <p>In due course the miser&rsquo;s abode was reached.</p>
  <p>The lawyer alighted, and knocked at the door. It was opened by the landlord
  in person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dead, sir,&rdquo; was the reply to an unspoken inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long has he been dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About an hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure? It can&rsquo;t be quite so long as that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not quite. It might be a little more, it might be a little
  less.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>How very tantalizing! Who can wonder that the barrister was a little excited.
  What a pity for the Church that the old man did not live, say another hour,
  so that witnesses might have seen him alive&mdash;say half-an-hour or so <i>after</i> the
  transfer of his Stock had been made. What a pity for those needy kindred
  of the miser in France he did not die an hour earlier, so as to make it clear
  that he was a corpse when the transfer was effected. One hour more or less,
  such as those which the remnant of his life was composed of, could not be
  of importance to the lonely exile and miser.</p>
  <p>Wonderful efforts were afterwards made to show that Carr&eacute; did breathe
  his last before the transfer of the stock was effected. Equal efforts were
  made to prove he survived that operation, of which, of course, he was unconscious.
  The best evidence I think went to show that, in reality, the last breath
  quitted his attenuated frame, and his pulse ceased to beat, as nearly as
  possible about ten minutes before the transfer was effected.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The main thread of my story has run out, but there are a few incidents it
  is worth while adding as a sequel to this strange and true narrative. The
  landlord of the house and his friend were not satisfied with the proceedings
  I have described. In a week or two, accordingly, the former wrote to one
  of the relatives of the deceased, and told the story as well as he could.
  The family clubbed together their slender means, and deputed one of their
  number, a nephew of Maturin Carr&eacute;, whose name, Francois Metarie, has
  become famous in the legal annals of this country, to visit England and inquire
  into the affair. Poor man, he was not equal to the task. When Metarie called
  upon the lawyer, whose address he obtained from the landlord, this gentleman
  Jesuitically assured him of the literal fact&mdash;presuming Carr&eacute; died
  before the transfer was effected&mdash;that he died worth only &pound;3,000.
  Metarie was also informed by many shrewd people in London, that even if it
  were possible to upset the deed of gift, he was not the man to effect this,
  because he was poor, and the machinery of our courts of equity could only
  be employed with advantage, if at all, by rich persons. The illiterate Frenchman
  went back to France. Still the family would not abandon the hope of recovering
  their due. Again and again Metarie came over here, no less than six times,
  until at length an eminent solicitor took up the case, and brought a suit
  into the Court of Chancery to set aside the deed on several grounds, but
  chiefly on the ground of fraud. I was employed to search into the case, and
  was not long in getting hold of sufficient facts to warrant a belief, in
  my own mind, and in that of my immediate employers, that foul play had been
  used towards the dying man or his relatives.</p>
  <p>The primary merit of this discovery, however, belongs to a distinguished
  nobleman, who has rendered good service to this country, Lord Brougham, who
  has a chateau in the South of France. Carr&eacute;&rsquo;s family got introduced
  to him. He heard their story, saw the fraud, and knew how it might be defeated.
  He induced this solicitor, who employed me, to take up the case, and there
  can be no doubt that all the money might have been recovered if the family
  of the deceased had not given way. But they had a taste of what else they
  might have expected from the hands of the priesthood and the mob in France.
  Francois Metarie was a hand-loom weaver at La Mayenne, near Bretagne. He
  had a large family. The part he took in this business exposed him to bitter
  persecution. Two of his children were expelled the communal school; he was
  pointed at in the streets, and his wife was insulted in public; he was pronounced &ldquo;a
  bad man,&rdquo; and life was rendered so intolerable that he was ultimately
  driven from France, and had to find a home and a subsistence in this country.
  In this way the kindred of the miser were induced to compromise the suit.
  The arrangement was that the family should have a further sum of &pound;4,500,
  and the priest and his party be allowed to retain the balance.</p>
  <p>Of the lawyer it may be well to state that poetical justice overtook him.
  The censure of professional brethren, who ascertained the real nature of
  his avocations through these proceedings, the denunciations of Mr. Bethel
  (the present Lord Chancellor) in open court during the investigation, and
  the anathemas of the public threw him on to a bed of sickness, and accelerated,
  if they did not produce his death. Of the priest, it may also be well to
  explain that he had to endure for awhile in Somers Town treatment very like
  that Frangois Metarie experienced at La Mayenne. People pointed at him in
  the streets, and spoke of him in terms the reverse of complimentary or polite.
  The populace of that demonstrative neighbourhood looked upon him as a thoroughly &ldquo;bad
  man;&rdquo; when they told him so, as they often did, they qualified their
  opinion by adjectives unfit for reproduction in these pages. The consequence
  was that his ecclesiastical superiors thought it desirable to remove him
  to some other locality, where his zeal for the Church was not so notorious.
  Poor Frangois Metarie brought over his wife and all his children to London,
  set up in business as a cobbler, and by honest labour in this free and happy
  land he has been able to provide decently for them.</p>

  The Troubles And The Escape Of A &ldquo;Perfect Young Lady.&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;m, but I think you have lost something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lost something, sir! Lor! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you not lost your purse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear me, no, sir; I&rsquo;ve not lost any purse. I know I had it in my
  hand just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you oblige me by just feeling in your pocket?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lady did as she was asked, and then brushing aside her flounces, cast
  a glance on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not there, ma&rsquo;m; I know where it is; be kind enough
  to step out of the room at once, before the next song. I will explain all
  about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lady was too much bewildered to reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pocket has been picked, ma&rsquo;m,&rdquo; the gentleman observed.</p>
  <p>Recovering her speech, the lady inquired&mdash;&ldquo;Who could have done
  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The young woman who was just sitting next you; but pray don&rsquo;t let
  us talk about it here, and make a commotion. If you will step out, I will
  tell you all about it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s impossible, sir! She was a very nice young person,&mdash;a
  perfect young lady, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a slight emphasis, not, however, inconsistent with the most delicate
  politeness, the gentleman then observed, &ldquo;I must ask you to follow
  me, ma&rsquo;m,&rdquo; and he glided through the bevy of gentlewomen nearly
  unnoticed, as a cantatrice advanced from the rear to the front of the orchestra,
  the observed of all observers.</p>
  <p>The lady, hesitatingly and tremblingly&mdash;as if she were going to receive
  condemnation for a crime of her own perpetration&mdash;followed her interrogator.</p>
  <p>This conversation took place one fine morning in the month of August, 1857,
  in that well-known place of amusement set apart by prescription, usage, or
  custom, for the upper ten thousand of the metropolis&mdash;the Hanover-square
  Rooms.</p>
  <p>A peculiarly select, and withal numerous audience had been brought together
  by the choice and ample programme which Madame Tuyere had distributed among
  her aristocratic patronesses and patrons. The company was (perhaps two or
  three persons excepted,) composed of the fairest, gentlest, and highest ladies
  in the land, with a sprinkling of elite young manhood, whose possessions
  or expectations, whose escutcheons and whose ancestors, could be warranted.</p>
  <p>One handsome person stood apart, or glided in and out of the assembly. He
  was about thirty years of age. He had been pronounced rather more than that
  age, but he might have passed for somewhat less than thirty. He was rather
  thin and delicately formed, with a pale face, grey eyes, forehead neither
  high nor low, eyelashes, eyebrows, whiskers, and an undergrowth of beard,
  which, to save time, and be intelligible, we may say might be reckoned among
  the great successes of Truefit. His dress was faultless. The white cravat
  reached Brummell&rsquo;s ideal of colour and symmetry. The waistcoat was
  so aesthetical that a Young England politician once asked the wearer for
  the name of his tailor. The coat and trousers must have been constructed
  by Stultz and Buckmaster. Those patent leather boots, with imperceptible
  soles, were doubtless Medwin&rsquo;s best material and workmanship.</p>
  <p>This exquisite, just before he addressed our friend, Mrs. Tenderheart, had
  been seen, or might have been seen, with apparent listlessness, standing,
  Dundrearylike, near the door of the concert-room&mdash;his taper fingers
  encased in the neatest and softest white kid gloves&mdash;playing languidly
  with his crushed <i>Gibus</i>.</p>
  <p>Who could he be? The order of men to which he belonged, the trade, profession,
  or pursuit he followed, have been more than suggested. He was a friend of
  mine, and it is from him I heard the particulars of this interesting little
  case. I may also, at once inform the reader that he was a police-officer
  of the detective force. His name was Slimy&mdash;Inspector Slimy&mdash;but
  he was commonly called &ldquo;the ladies&rsquo; man.&rdquo; The special duty
  allotted him by his grand masters of Scotland Yard, Whitehall, was to scent
  out, watch, and capture elegant thieves of the gentler sex, who plied their
  vocation in or about the model parish of St. James&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>While thus innocently playing with his collapsed chapeau, Inspector Slimy&rsquo;s
  grey eye had been running over the crowded seats of the concert-room, and
  had alighted on the bonnet of the nice young lady who sat next to Mrs. Tenderheart.
  He was an expert. Something Madame Devey might not have observed, and something
  he could not have explained, told him that this perfect young lady&rsquo;s
  presence at Madame Tuyere&rsquo;s concert was obnoxious to the administrative
  reformer&rsquo;s cardinal principle. She was not an example of the right
  woman in the right place, or to clothe his ideas in the language of a policeman,
  he felt sure that she was after no good that fine morning.</p>
  <p>With this conviction, he kept the perfect young lady under a keen scrutiny,
  and his suspicions were soon justified by observing an incident that led
  him to adopt proceedings not over pleasant to the object of his attentions.
  Perhaps indiscreetly, she left the concert-room a few minutes after this
  incident occurred, and on attempting to quit the building she was arrested
  by a couple of stout officers. When this had been effected, Inspector Slimy
  returned to his post of observation. Piatti at that moment held the eyes
  and ears of the assembly captive by his bow. On this performer retiring,
  the ladies&rsquo; man stepped towards Mrs. Tenderheart, and the brief conversation
  we have noted took place.</p>
  <p>The lady who had lost her purse was told she must proceed with my friend
  the Inspector to a station-house hard by. She did so with reluctance, protesting
  there must be some mistake, that the young lady could not be a thief; that
  she&mdash;that is, Mrs. Tenderheart&mdash;would certainly not prosecute;
  that she was a mother, and had a mother&rsquo;s feelings; that the alleged
  thief was just the same age, as nearly as could be, of a poor dear daughter,
  who, too good for this world, had been removed to a better, not more than
  a year and a-half ago. At the station-house the generous soul reiterated
  her faith and her decision. A purse had been found on the interesting criminal
  by the female searcher. Its identity was undeniable, and Mrs. Tenderheart
  scorned to tell a lie by denying her property.</p>
  <p>The peculiarity or comparative worthlessness of its contents, removed any
  shadow of doubt which otherwise the kindness of its real owner might have
  availed itself of as an escape from the ordeal of prosecution. The unlucky
  culprit had only extracted from the lady&rsquo;s pocket a few shillings and three
  peppermint drops.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think, as a Christian mother, I am going to transport a young
  woman for such a trifle?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Tenderheart, and as the authorities
  made no answer to her inquiry, she replied to her own interrogatory by an
  emphatic &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was told she must sign the charge-sheet, and did so, still protesting
  that no merciful judge would compel her, perhaps to break a father and a
  mother&rsquo;s hearts, taint the ambition of numerous brothers, corrupt as
  many sisters&rsquo; hopes by shame. She left the receptacle of crime with
  a final and sorrowful declaration that she would not prosecute&mdash;no power
  on earth should make her do it.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Tenderheart that afternoon went to her solicitors&mdash;the eminent
  firm of Tomlinson, Cute, Tape, Worm, and Tomlinson. She did not ask their
  advice; she gave them her instructions. They did not offer their advice;
  they acted upon her instructions. They did not profess to undertake &ldquo;criminal
  business.&rdquo; When any highly respectable client compelled them, as it
  were, to institute a prosecution, they went about their work tardily, and
  did it unskilfully. No dream of costs, therefore, warped their sense of duty
  in this instance. Mr. Tomlinson the elder, and Mr. Tape were both present
  at the interview with their client, and complimented her benevolence. They
  assured her that her instructions should be carried out, if possible, to
  the letter, and they thought the magistrate would not compel her to prosecute
  against her will. She had better not attend the police-court, but authorise
  them to instruct some counsel learned in the law to appear on her behalf.</p>
  <p>On the following day, the &ldquo;perfect young lady&rdquo; was brought up
  before Mr. Slingem, a vigilant stipendiary magistrate, charged with having
  picked Mrs. Tenderheart&rsquo;s pocket of a purse containing eight shillings
  and three peppermint drops.</p>
  <p>On behalf of the accused, Mr. Tortuous Dodge, the London Thieves&rsquo; Attorney-General,
  was instructed to bully the prosecutor, prattle wildly about his client&rsquo;s
  respectable character, and defy all the policemen and all the jailors of
  England to say that she had ever been charged, or held in custody on suspicion,
  before the present occasion. This was a fact, as Slimy had explained; for
  although he knew&mdash;but how he knew is yet a mystery I am not at liberty
  to explain&mdash;that she belonged to a &ldquo;bad lot,&rdquo; she was yet,
  he said, &ldquo;a new hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The prosecutor was not present, because, as Mr. Fitz Gisippus Glum (instructed
  by Messrs. Tomlinson, Cute, Tape, Worm, and Tomlinson) explained, she was
  in such a state of nervous excitement over the matter, that her friends dreaded
  the effect of her appearance in court; and there was, moreover, reason to
  hope that this affair, if not an accident, a mystery, or &ldquo;a fortuitous
  combination of circumstances reconcileable with a theory of innocence,&rdquo; it
  was at all events&mdash;under the worst aspect&mdash;a case of mania, and
  a first offence on the part of the prisoner. He was, therefore, instructed
  to ask that the prosecutor might be allowed to withdraw from the prosecution;
  and as several of the most eminent judges who had ever adorned the incorruptible
  bench of the Central Criminal Court had laid it down as wrong to set the
  law in motion for a first offence, and by branding the young criminal as
  a convict, impede the work of reformation, he was quite certain that the
  well-tempered judicial mind of a Slingem would say the course Mrs. Tenderheart
  had elected to pursue was one dictated by lofty Christian philanthropy, and
  a sincere regard for the interests of the public.</p>
  <p>The doctrine about prosecutions for first offences had certainly been laid
  down in my hearing, in courts of justice and elsewhere by eminent judges
  and commentators, but Mr. Slingem did not admit its force in this instance.
  He was inexorable. He would not permit Mrs. Tenderheart to retire from the
  prosecution, but declared that a duty she owed to society was the conviction
  of the prisoner if the evidence went to prove her guilt.</p>
  <p>So stern and uncompromising was Mr. Slingem, that upon the request of Mr.
  Inspector Slimy, the vigilant magistrate refused Mr. Tortuous Dodge&rsquo;s
  earnest entreaty for the liberation of his interesting client on bail. She
  was remanded for two days, and Mrs. Tenderheart&rsquo;s counsel was informed
  he must produce her evidence at the next examination.</p>
  <p>At the adjourned examination of the prisoner sufficient evidence was accordingly
  produced to warrant Mr. Slingem in sending the accused to take her trial
  at the next session of the Central Criminal Court. Another urgent entreaty
  to admit her to bail was disregarded. The &ldquo;perfect young lady&rdquo; was
  removed in the prison van, along with less showy prisoners, and lodged in
  Newgate. Poor Mrs. Tenderheart was sorely grieved, but found some consolation
  in the reiterated assurance to all her friends that she &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t
  help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The day after the perfect young lady&rsquo;s removal to that famous prison,
  a rude cart, drawn by an unkempt horse, covered with dust, and bearing on
  one of its panels the inscription, &ldquo;John Brown, Farmer, E&mdash;, Middlesex,&rdquo; stopped
  at the door of Messrs. Tomlinson, Cute, Tape, Worm, and Tomlinson. An old
  man, dressed in a smock-frock, like one of the last of the farmers of an
  almost extinct generation, alighted from this primitive vehicle. Mr. Tortuous
  Dodge, true to an appointment, had arrived at this spot a few minutes earlier,
  and was sauntering up and down the street to kill time.</p>
  <p>After a few words had passed, the &ldquo;Thieves&rsquo; Attorney-General&rdquo; and
  the old man, his companion, sought an interview with the firm. The object
  of this visit was to ask them if, should an application be made to a Judge
  at Chambers to admit the perfect young lady to bail, the firm would consent
  to his lordship releasing her.</p>
  <p>The venerable white-haired man pleaded so hard on behalf of his unfortunate
  child, and so vividly, in unlettered eloquence, portrayed the mother&rsquo;s
  anguish of mind&mdash;threatening a lunatic asylum, if not a grave&mdash;that
  the head of the house, the elder Tomlinson, was inclined to strain a point,
  and see if he could not safely aid in letting the prisoner out of Newgate
  for a few weeks until the trial.</p>
  <p>Mr. Tape, however, who was also present at this interview, thought the reputation
  of the house might suffer by any arrangement with a prisoner. The lawyers
  retired for a few minutes to another room, and discussed the matter.</p>
  <p>Upon their return, Mr. Tomlinson announced to the old gentleman their inability
  to grant his request. The father&rsquo;s lamentations were exceedingly dolorous;
  but the firm had taken its resolution, and could not depart from it, however
  copious the flood of tears that domestic woe might cause.</p>
  <p>As the farmer and the attorney drove slowly off in their creaking trap,
  Mr. Dodge exclaimed &mdash; &ldquo;Two muffs, my boy; they don&rsquo;t understand
  criminal practice. It&rsquo;s all right, leave everything to me. I&rsquo;ve
  done it before many times, and I will again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Within three days of this visit by the distracted parent to Messrs. Tomlinson,
  Cute, Tape, Worm, and Tomlinson, an application was made to the Judge, then
  sitting in Chambers, to make his order for the release of the prisoner on
  bail. This was supported by an affidavit, setting forth, among other things,
  that she had never before been accused of a criminal offence.</p>
  <p>His lordship asked what the prosecuting solicitors had to say about the
  matter. The Thieves&rsquo; Attorney-General&rsquo;s clerk explained that,
  although served with the usual notice, these gentlemen were not present.
  It was understood, and their absence seemed to prove, that they had no objection
  to the prisoner&rsquo;s application. His lordship said, he must have proof
  that they knew of the application. Mr. Dodge&rsquo;s clerk said he could
  produce the affidavit of the person who served the notice. This was procured;
  and the Judge made an order that, upon finding two sureties who would enter
  into a bond of &pound;100 each, with her own obligation in &pound;200, she
  should be liberated until her trial This bond was perfected behind the back
  of Mrs. Tenderheart&rsquo;s solicitors; and the perfect young lady walked
  out of Newgate a temporarily free woman.</p>
  <p>In due course the sessions were held, and her name appeared in the calendar,
  with a statement of the offence for which she was to be tried. Mrs. Tenderheart,
  being placed under recognizances to prosecute, was in the motley crowd awaiting
  a call to give evidence. Mr. Fitz Gisippus Glum fluttered about from the
  New Court to the Old, and the Old Court to the New with his solitary brief&mdash;that
  for the prosecution of this perfect young lady. Mr. Cute had condescendingly
  come down from his professional standard of reticence to further instruct
  the learned counsel as the case proceeded. Mr. Inspector Slimy was, of course,
  in attendance, with other police witnesses.</p>
  <p>Everybody regarded the conviction and punishment of the offender as accomplished
  facts&mdash;except Slimy. He declared before the trial that the bird had
  flown, and said Mr. Glum would have nothing to do but ask that her recognizances
  should be estreated. The elegant detective was right. No perfect young lady
  pickpocket surrendered to prove her innocence by the tests of criminal jurisprudence.
  The case was called on; no prisoner answered. Mr. Cute endeavoured to hide
  his mortification under a forced smile; Mr. Glum looked very glum indeed,
  and savagely performed the humble lot assigned to him by the exquisite policeman;
  Slimy was vexed, but gave no outward sign thereof; and Mrs. Tenderheart,
  who asked with pathetic significance, &ldquo;Who could have thought it?&rdquo; felt
  more inclination to transport the parties concerned in the bail-trick than
  to prosecute for the loss of her shillings and peppermint-drops. After a
  brief running commentary on the matter, all parties separated, and so the
  story would end, except for an explanation or two afterwards communicated
  by Mr. Slimy to the eminently legal firm of Tomlinson, Cute, Tape, Worm,
  and Tomlinson, and which I may now tell my reader.</p>
  <p>One day Mr. Cute met the polite inspector on a tour of observation through
  Regent-street and Bond-street, and exchanged civilities with him. Mr. Slimy
  availed himself of this opportunity to improve the lawyer&rsquo;s knowledge
  of criminal practice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out how it was done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When
  that fellow, Dodge, saw he had a respectable firm like yours to deal with,
  sir, he knew he could do what wouldn&rsquo;t have been safe with the Humphreys,
  Wontners, Beards, and Lewises. He just got a rascal he calls a clerk of his
  to swear that he had served upon you the notice of application to admit to
  bail, which he hadn&rsquo;t done, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that he never did,&rdquo; responded Cute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; added the detective. &ldquo;But what can a judge
  do when there&rsquo;s an affidavit saying that it was served? He says to
  himself, here&rsquo;s evidence that the prosecutor knows of this application,
  and don&rsquo;t oppose it&mdash;silence gives consent. I think as it&rsquo;s
  a first offence I ought to let the prisoner out on bail, and so he does.
  But Dodge wouldn&rsquo;t, I say, have tried that on with the knowing members
  of his profession, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cute felt humiliated, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It cost them a pretty penny, though,&rdquo; continued Slimy. &ldquo;I
  have found out all about it. She was, as I said, a young hand, and rather
  clumsy at her work.</p>
  <p>She was the sister-in-law of Joe Atkins, one of the most notorious fences
  in London. I caught her at her first job, and all the gang she belonged to
  were in an awful fright lest she should reveal their schemes. They would
  have spent a thousand pounds, if necessary, and I reckon that five hundred
  pounds would barely cover what she did cost them. First of all, it wasn&rsquo;t
  a trifle they had to give Dodge, the lawyer, for getting that bit of perjury
  done about the service of the notice at your office, sir; then the bail had
  to be squared by giving them two hundred pounds to satisfy the Crown, and
  something handsome for themselves; and then they had to make it right with
  the young woman and her husband, for she was married, and was the wife of
  a railway guard. They gave her husband something tidy to be quiet, and sent
  him and his wife over to Australia or New Zealand, I haven&rsquo;t learned
  which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Cute had been musing, and now drily observed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity
  that scoundrel, Dodge, can&rsquo;t be hung. He is a monstrous disgrace, Slimy,
  to my profession. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind prosecuting him at my own expense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave <i>that</i> to me, sir,&rdquo; said the exquisite policeman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  on his track, sir; and now I know his trick, he&rsquo;ll not long escape
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slimy was as good as his word. He caught Mr. Tortuous Dodge repeating his
  affidavit trick, and that marvellously clever attorney got a long term of
  penal servitude; as a public reward for his ingenuity.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Number3"></a>Number 3<br>
  A Railway &ldquo;Plant&rdquo; Blighted</b></h2>
  <p>During the summer of 1854, Mr. W. J&mdash;, a man of extensive experience
  in such business, or professional enterprise, was lessee of the Theatre Royal,
  at B&mdash;. Somehow or other, it is not in the power of the most indefatigable
  and skilful manager of theatres to command success, although we never knew
  one of that versatile and conscientious order of geniuses, from the great
  Lumley of operatic renown to Mr. Wilde of peripatetic notoriety, who would
  not, if the assertion had been made on the threshold of eternity, affirm
  that he constantly, uniformly, and without exception, endeavoured to deserve
  it.</p>
  <p>Numerous circumstances, over which no management can exercise the slightest
  control, such as the weather, the state of trade, competitions in the &ldquo;entertainment
  line,&rdquo; and last, but certainly not least, that shifting eccentric,
  kaleidoscopic, intangible thing called public taste will overthrow preliminary
  calculations, and turn golden hopes into blank disappointment.</p>
  <p>No blame, then, can attach to Mr. W. J&mdash;, nor should it excite astonishment
  in the reader to learn that a more than usually hazardous venture, the summer
  season, had not up to the moment of our narrative prospered. In truth the
  spec. had turned out very badly, as every member of Mr. W. J&mdash;&rsquo;s
  company could tell, at least as well as he could.</p>
  <p>One morning, the manager had risen from&mdash;or, to speak with more precision&mdash;in
  his bed, to read half a dozen letters just brought him by the post. He grasped
  them with avidity, for, as he afterwards declared, amid a variety of solemn
  expletives and adjurations, he had a presentiment that &ldquo;something good
  would turn up,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;luck was in store for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. W. J&mdash; never relates this story without a very ample preface about
  a dream he had the night before, and an exposition of the reasons why he
  felt assured the empty exchequer of that and former nights were and must
  be followed by &ldquo;glorious triumphs,&rdquo; &ldquo;crowded houses,&rdquo; an
  abundant exchequer for him, and the rare blessing of a full salary for each
  member of his company. We spare the reader these details. It is enough for
  our purpose to say that Mr. W. J&mdash; was in the position to reject &ldquo;no
  reasonable offer&rdquo; which might descend from &ldquo;a star&rdquo; to
  his lowly boards&mdash;or from any other man or woman. He, therefore, patiently
  and thoughtfully read over each communication brought to him that morning,
  although, at least, all but one would, in seasons of prosperity, have been
  hastily thrown aside with ejaculations more emphatic than elegant. All the
  present communications were, however, after due consideration set down as
  unworthy of reply&mdash;except the last. That letter ran thus:&mdash; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;Terrace, Islington, London,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;10<i>th
 July</i>, 1854.<br>
 &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Having perceived, from the frequent encomiums of the impartial
 critics of the <i>Era</i> newspaper, that you have recently taken the B&mdash; theatre
 for a summer season, and that you have, in a spirit worthy of the reputation
 you had earned many years before entering upon your present arduous but creditable
 undertaking, resolved to place upon your stage and before the people of B&mdash; only
 the works of the great Shakspeare and our most celebrated modern legitimate
 dramatic authors, I am emboldened to make a proposition to you, that will,
 I hope, be not unacceptable, and which being accepted, will, I hope, assist
 in rendering your (I may say noble) experiment remunerative to you, as it unquestionably
 deserves to be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may, without further preface, say that I shall be happy to arrange
  with you to appear in a series of leading female characters under your spirited
  management.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not, it is true, had much experience&mdash;having only appeared
  a few times in amateur representations&mdash;but I am assured, by two or
  three very competent advisers, that I have genius and dramatic power, which
  may, I hope, atone for, if not compensate for my deficiency in practice.
  At the same time, I admit the force of an objection to my inexperience so
  fully that I shall be perfectly satisfied to play a role of characters without
  any remuneration at all, and shall be very willing to treat with you afterwards,
  in a liberal spirit if my first strictly professional appearances should
  prove successful, as I certainly hope, and am egotistical enough to think
  they will be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having so far distinctly and frankly explained my views and wishes,
  I think it expedient to add, that I do not disregard those aids to effect,
  which so materially contribute to enlarge and deepen the influence of the
  truest and highest order of genius. My friends, who share my notions on this
  point, have, I am happy to say, therefore purchased me a wardrobe of unusual
  elegance, and appropriate jewellery at great expense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you be good enough to give this rather long letter your best
  attention, and oblige me with a line or two in reply at your earliest convenience.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
  am, Sir, yours very respectfully,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ellen
 Wilkinson&rdquo;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;W&mdash; J&mdash;, <i>Esq</i>.,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Theatre
 Royal, B</i>&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I have, in confidence, given you my real name and address;
  but, I should, of course, not like to have the former appear in the local
  papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The manager sat firm and rigid in his bed for a few moments. Then he broke
  out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove, a sensible letter, at any rate. A splendid soul that woman
  has got in her, I&rsquo;ll be bound. I&rsquo;m not a marrying man, and I&rsquo;m
  getting a little too old for romantic courtship, or I should be inclined
  to fall in love with Miss Ellen Wilkinson at once, without having seen her.
  And why not? Professor Somebody, that advertising chap, is right&mdash;character
  is best judged by handwriting and diction. I say she is a splendid woman.
  I know it as well as if she were my own sister, or&mdash;confound it&mdash;wife,
  I was going to say. All! but can she act? That is the question, as Hamlet
  says. It is not every clever, or even beautiful woman who can make a sensation
  in these days. Now, what a pity she does not give some further particulars.
  It&rsquo;s just like these clever people, these geniuses, as they call themselves,
  and especially like female geniuses. She writes a devilish clever letter,
  as I said, but she has left out some particulars she ought to know that I
  should like to be informed of. I wonder how high she stands in her tiny shoes?
  Is she fair or dark&mdash; slim or buxom&mdash;(single I take it for granted
  she is). But, confound her, I say, she might have told me her age&mdash;that
  is, within a few years, more or less. Yet I think she&rsquo;ll do. She&rsquo;s
  got a fine wardrobe, that&rsquo;s plain; and jewels, too&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  good. I&rsquo;ve no doubt she&rsquo;s young, and tolerably good looking&mdash;slim,
  graceful, genteel, I fancy. I&rsquo;ll engage her, at least, for the first
  role. I can&rsquo;t do any harm by that. She&rsquo;ll cost me nothing, and
  may bring me lots of pewter. The wardrobe and the jewels are a first-rate
  draw. Won&rsquo;t the gods applaud if she&rsquo;s got any of the real stuff
  in her? My risk is what?&mdash;now, let me see exactly&mdash;a few advertisements,
  some bills for the walls, and some for distribution. I&rsquo;m sure to get
  as much by her as will pay for these things. I&rsquo;ll engage her&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  settled in my own mind; but I must not appear to bite at the offer like a
  ravenous starving gudgeon would at a fat maggot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus soliloquised the manager.</p>
  <p>He then adjusted his nightcap, and dropped his head upon a snow-white pillow-case,
  stuffed with genuine down, drew the clean bed-clothes over him, and tried
  to sleep; but the glaring sun made the visit of its early rays obnoxious
  to slumber, and the daydream of an overflowing treasury rendered sleep impossible,
  So, after turning again uneasily, after the method of Dr. Watts&rsquo;s sluggard,
  the man of unwearied industry rose and called for breakfast.</p>
  <p>This wholesome meal was soon despatched; and with the aid of an old gentleman
  who had seen better days, but now existed as a supernumerary of the theatre,
  or a hanger-on of the great manager, that worthy concocted a reply to his
  fair correspondent, which ran thus</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;THEATRE ROYAL, B&mdash;,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;11<i>th
 July</i>, &rsquo;54.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&mdash;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your
  very polite and ably written favour of yesterday&rsquo;s date. That letter,
  I see, is the production of a highly cultivated mind, and of a lady who entertains
  an exalted (but very proper) sense of the noble mission which the drama,
  under conscientious management, is destined to fulfil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am, Madam, almost persuaded by your letter to accept your very
  fair and reasonable offer, and agree to incur the heavy expenses which the
  due publicity and other preparations for your appearance in a role of legitimate
  characters would entail upon me. But I am quite sure you will pardon the
  slight hesitation which second thoughts (not always the best, although a
  poet has said they are) have induced. There are a few little matters upon
  which I desire some information; and if you could either pay a visit to B&mdash; yourself
  (which I humbly venture to suggest would be the best plan), or get some prudent
  friend&mdash;a man who understands business&mdash;to come down and see me
  on your behalf I think there is no doubt an arrangement mutually satisfactory
  could be effected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be kind enough to let me hear from you further on this subject by
  return of post, as I was on the point of making other engagements when your
  letter of yesterday reached me; and if from any cause we should not come
  to an arrangement, it will be necessary for me to conclude these other engagements
  at once.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am, Madam, your very obedient
  servant,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;W&mdash; J&mdash;.<br>
 &ldquo;<i>Miss Ellen Wilkinson</i>.&quot;</p>
  <p>This letter was a source of delight to Miss Ellen Wilkinson and her friends.
  They saw that the engagement was already practically made.</p>
  <p>Miss Wilkinson was, in some respects, a decidedly strong-minded woman. It
  was resolved by herself and friends in council that she should run down from
    London to B&mdash;, and finish the negotiations. She found this no difficulty.
  Within half an hour after her arrival in the town she had settled with the
  manager all she cared to arrange. She was to play a role without fee or reward.
  The manager tried to get a consideration for allowing her to appear upon
  his stage. He suggested that he ought to have &pound;50 towards his outlay
  (which, in fact, did not exceed &pound;10), and he made a stand for a few
  minutes upon &pound;20 or &pound;25; but the lady assured him that her friends
  had expended so much upon her wardrobe that she knew it would be impossible
  to get anything further out of them, and she could not, indeed, ask them.
  She added, in tones of emphatic sincerity, that if her gratuitous services
  would not justify the risk of his outlay in advertisements and printing,
  she must abandon, for the present, the hope of appearing at the Theatre Royal,
  B&mdash;. The manager saw the danger of breaking off a negotiation by which
  at all events he could not lose more than a trifle, if anything, and might
  realise a tolerable sum of money. The interview had not led this shrewd and
  experienced man to expect in Miss Ellen Wilkinson another Miss O&rsquo;Neill,
  a Kemble, or a Tree; but his confidence that she would prove a star of the
  third or fourth magnitude, or, as he expressed it, &ldquo;a perfect god-send&rdquo; to
  him in his emergency, was strengthened. He made a few inquiries&mdash; some
  of which had reference to the wardrobe and the jewels&mdash;and in a round
  of platitudes about the delight it gave him to aid the development of young
  ambition, and bring out hidden genius, he consented to accept the gratuitous
  services of the lady.</p>
  <p>The reader will not, I hope, expect me to describe the sort of announcements
  which Mr. W. J&mdash; &nbsp;inserted in the journals of B&mdash;, and placarded
  on the walls of that town. This manager believed himself a genius in this
  line, and I am bound to say, in his favour, that Mr. Vincent Crummles could
  not have done his work on such an occasion better than Mr. W. J&mdash; did.
  It is, therefore, enough to add, that the new <i>tragedienne&rsquo;s</i> first
  appearance on any stage was announced in the most effective style.</p>
  <p>The first appearance of Miss Ellen Wilkinson took place under favourable
  circumstances. No rival attractions were in B&mdash; that night. A panorama
  of the Holy Land intended to exhibit itself in the town that week, but the
  sight of the Theatre Royal&rsquo;s big posters alarmed either the sanctity
  or the financial wisdom of its proprietor, who &ldquo;moved on&rdquo; to
  the next town, where the good picture had no counter-attraction, and did
  a large stroke of business. The opening night of the engagement was a decided
  success. The house was in reality half full, which permitted the lively imagination
  of the manager to advertise a crowded house, and to apologise for the apparent
  discourtesy of refusing money at his doors. In other respects the engagement
  was not a failure, and assuredly paid the manager, if not the lady and her
  friends&mdash;about whom, and which financial part of our story, I crave
  the reader&rsquo;s patience.</p>
  <p>I must not forget to generally describe Miss Ellen Wilkinson&rsquo;s appearance
  and her wardrobe. She was about twenty-six years of age, of rather slender
  form, round but pale features, betraying the signs of extinguished hues,
  dark eyes set a little back in, or slightly more over-arched by a forehead
  than is usual with ladies. That forehead was a little broader, and perhaps
  a little higher&mdash;but it was certainly broader&mdash;than is customary
  with her sex. She was rather above the middle height, not tall, imposing,
  or of a commanding mien. She had received what, for a woman, must be considered
  a liberal education; but it embraced no remarkable or peculiar width of tuition
  or development. To sum up her intellectual attainments and powers, and put
  their description in a familiar phrase, she may be described as &ldquo;a
  clever woman,&rdquo; but a woman without genius, or even a high order of
  talent. Patience and perseverance were, however, qualities belonging to her,
  although not conspicuous, for she did not in fact exhibit one decidedly prominent
  trait, or what in Carlylese, is called individuality. The local critics,
  who did not violently praise, or at all censure the lady&rsquo;s performances,
  severally declared them &ldquo;creditable, ladylike, careful, well-studied,
  polished, and appreciative.&rdquo; One censor encroached near enough upon
  the offensive to say that the lady was &ldquo;a respectable sample of the
  mediocrity common in our day,&rdquo; but this was the hardest thing said
  about her. The audiences were tolerably well pleased with her; and her wardrobe,
  to which gentle reference was made, or rather hinted, in the play-bill, was
  admired in boxes, pit, and gallery, as it deserved to be.</p>
  <p>Time, the destroyer of illusions, the great maker and unmaker of reputations,
  quickly broke the charm which a manager&rsquo;s advertising skill had invested
  this lady with. It became evident in less than a week that Miss Ellen Wilkinson
  would not make him a fortune, or indeed retrieve the bad luck of a season.
  She had answered pretty well, but had not realised his expectations. How
  far she dropped below the anticipations he had created, I would rather not
  say. So he resolved to get rid of her as soon as the first engagement had
  run out. But a crisis and a rupture took place before this natural termination
  of the contract. A week only had elapsed from the first appearance when some
  little misunderstanding occurred between a female member of the company and
  our heroine, who appealed to the manager, and found in him not the partisan
  she hoped to find. This led to a remonstrance, and the remonstrance to a
  cancelling of the engagement. And here, in justice to both parties be it
  said, a degree of seemliness, if not of moral dignity, was shown on both
  sides, which actors and managers do not always display, as the records of
  a Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s Court have, not long ago, testified. Miss Ellen
  Wilkinson and Mr. W. J&mdash; , in the most ladylike and most gentlemanly
  fashion, agreed to part, and did part. No angry word was uttered on either
  side. The last sentences were despatched from the hotel of the lady to the
  green-room of the manager, and were complimentary. The retreat of the tragedy
  queen was neatly covered by managerial tact. She had fortunately not stirred
  up his vengeance, which might have led him to adopt a course, with the view
  of injuring her professional character and hopes, which might have had an
  injurious recoil upon him. As it was, being able to reason coolly on the
  subject, the manager saw that his interest, no less than the lady&rsquo;s,
  lay in the maintenance of a show of success. He, therefore, gave out that
  her engagement at his theatre was only an experiment, and that her brilliant
  triumph in B&mdash; would be shortly followed by her appearance in the great
  metropolis, unless some of her friends (for she was highly connected), who
  objected to the course of her ambition, prevailed on her to abandon the stage&mdash;which
  he, the manager, thought would be a national calamity.</p>
  <p>The mention of the hotel leads to an explanation that the lady hired apartments&mdash;a
  sitting and sleeping-room&mdash;in one of the best hotels in the town, and
  no other town in England can put to shame the two hostelries of B&mdash;,
  in one of which the actress took up her quarters. The incidents of her arrival,
  and the scene she produced among the ladies and servants of both sexes in
  the establishment, have not been described That was not necessary; but the
  reader will be good enough to understand that her departure was an event.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she said, to the upper chambermaid, the night before
  her departure, &ldquo;remember that I go to London by the express train to-morrow,
  and I have a great deal to do, as you see, in arranging and packing my things.
  Don&rsquo;t let me lie later than eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;and
  can I get anybody who is trustworthy to help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will assist you, miss, if you please,&rdquo; replied the servant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, I am much obliged; but I should not like to trouble
  you so much alone. I will accept your offer, but can&rsquo;t you get another
  person&mdash;one of the under servants&mdash;also to assist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, miss, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t spare Susan, the under chambermaid,
  and the housemaid has so much to do that I am afraid master would blame me
  if I asked her to help us. But the laundress is a very honest woman, although
  poor; shall I get her to stay tomorrow morning when she comes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly; a very good thought of yours. And who will see my boxes
  safely to the station when they are packed? Dear me!&rdquo; with a sigh, &ldquo;I
  wish I had asked one of my cousins to come down and see to these things for
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as for that, miss, our head boots is as honest as the day.
  You may trust him. Lor&rsquo; bless you, miss, why the commercials trust
  him with ever so many hundreds of pounds every night. You know when a commercial
  writes his letters, he wants to send home to the house all the money he&rsquo;s
  got, and he counts up his sovereigns at night, and he says to our head boots, &lsquo;John,
  here&rsquo;s two hundred pound; get me notes for it.&rsquo; And our head
  boots says, &lsquo;Yes, sir;&rsquo; and he gets bank-notes sometimes from
  one place, and sometimes from another. And it isn&rsquo;t one commercial
  as does this, nor two either, but many of them does it reg&rsquo;lar, you
  know. You may trust our head boots, miss. He wouldn&rsquo;t, I assure you,
  steal one of your rings, if they was diamonds&mdash;which, I dare say, for
  the matter of that, they is&mdash;and worth a thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps the reader has begun to think that the eloquent head chambermaid
  had a tenderness for the head boots. Perhaps she had; but as that point had
  nothing to do with the mystery of the loss of the wardrobe, I didn&rsquo;t
  stop to investigate it, and can afford no information.</p>
  <p>It was finally arranged that the actress should have the united assistance
  of the head chambermaid and the honest laundress to pack the jewels and wardrobe&mdash;head
  boots, who was to see the precious packages afterwards conveyed to the station,
  being also engaged, through the agency of his eulogist, to lend a hand, if
  need be, in the preliminary work.</p>
  <p>The head chambermaid took leave of the lady after these arrangements had
  been settled, and of course related all that had passed, with perhaps an
  air of importance, to the other servants of the hotel. Some little jealousy
  was produced by the thought that all the credit, and all the expected profit,
  of the event were to be monopolised by one upper servant. An intense curiosity
  was also aroused by the extraordinary account of the richness and brilliancy
  of the clothes and the gems belonging to the actress, which curiosity was
  not mitigated by a night&rsquo;s refreshing slumber.</p>
  <p>Next morning, the packing of jewels and wardrobe began about nine o&rsquo;clock.
  The two female servitors and the actress set about the work, and head boots
  kept himself (anticipating a liberal compliment) entirely at the lady&rsquo;s
  disposal. A housemaid, too, found herself at leisure, and tendered her additional
  services. These were not thought requisite by the head chambermaid; but Miss
  Wilkinson&rsquo;s anxiety to render the task as light as possible induced
  her to insist upon the other women availing themselves of this further assistance.</p>
  <p>At length gems, not so rare or so extensive as a peeress high in the table
  of precedence would feel satisfied with, but far more costly than an actress
  usually possesses, and about the genuineness of which, I have ascertained
  there could be no doubt, with satins, and silks, and laces, were safely deposited
  in several boxes. These were each carefully directed, and then handed over
  to head boots, who followed the truck drawn by under boots from the hotel
  to the railway station. The trusted agent of the commercial-room also saw
  the precious luggage put into a van under the eye of the guard, and he&mdash;that
  is, head boots&mdash;never left the station or took his eyes off from the
  van until the train had started. Nothing is plainer, or less open to be challenged,
  than the fact that the boxes contained the jewels and wardrobe, and that
  the guard&rsquo;s van contained the boxes, when the iron horse darted off
  at express speed to the metropolis, with the property and its owner, along
  with other persons, at its tail.</p>
  <p>A word here about the actress on the morning of her departure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor soul,&rdquo; afterwards observed the chambermaid to her fellow-servants, &ldquo;she
  was flurried, though. She couldn&rsquo;t eat no breakfast, and if I hadn&rsquo;t
  positively made her, she wouldn&rsquo;t have taken a mouthful of anything
  with her; but, as I said, you can&rsquo;t get anything until you reach London.
  The train only stops once, at R&mdash;, and you won&rsquo;t get nothing that&rsquo;s
  nice there. So I went to our barmaid and says, &lsquo;Cut me a few nice sandwiches
  for Miss Wilkinson, for she ain&rsquo;t had anything for breakfast, and she&rsquo;ll
  want something before she gets to London.&rsquo; So I got her some sandwiches,
  and I put &rsquo;em in her reticule, and I says to her then, &lsquo;Miss,
  you must take a mouthful of something to eat with you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>As no accident occurred on the road, the train arrived in due course in
  the London Station. The breakfastless lady having, it must be presumed, not
  eaten her sandwiches, began to experience a faintness as she approached the
  metropolis. Immediately the train stopped she therefore went direct to the
  refreshment-rooms for a bun, and in a few minutes she returned to get her
  luggage.</p>
  <p>It could not be found; somehow or other these valuable boxes had disappeared!
  How could that have happened? The lady was distracted; short of losing a
  husband&mdash;and supposing him to be a good one&mdash;or a well-beloved
  child, nothing could wring a woman&rsquo;s heart so violently as the sudden
  and total bereavement of wardrobe and jewels in this fashion. She clasped
  her hands, she paced rapidly up and down the station, exclaiming, &ldquo;Where
  are my boxes?&mdash; where are they?&rdquo; and would not be consoled. The
  few passengers left behind, and the officials, offered various opinions of
  more or less sagacity; but all agreed that it was a strange matter, and ought
  to be inquired into.</p>
  <p>At length the distracted actress, whose performance in that railway-station
  had been fine enough to have taken captive the town of B&mdash;, got into
  a cab, and tearfully went home.</p>
  <p>Consultation with friends led to consultation with an attorney. He saw what
  somebody else had seen before him,&mdash;that the railway company&rsquo;s
  liability was clear, and that the evidence was almost perfect. The value
  of the wardrobe and the jewels could, in a general way, be shown; precise
  evidence of value was all he had to procure. The delivery of the boxes to
  the guard at B&mdash; could also be established by a most independent witness,
  whose honesty scores of commercials knew. The contents of the boxes could
  be shown by other equally independent testimony. The legal practitioner said
  he never had a better case. It was for the company to show what had become
  of the property so distinctly traced to the hands of their agents, How would
  they do this? The lawyer repeated his question in a kind of soliloquy, and
  gave it as his very distinct advice that Miss Wilkinson had a remedy against
  the company, and that nothing short of a miracle could prevent his obtaining
  her legal rights&mdash;full and ample compensation for the lost wardrobe
  and the costly <i>et ceteras</i>.</p>
  <p>The attorney wrote the usual letter, which not being answered by a cheque
  upon the company&rsquo;s bankers for the sum demanded, he issued a writ,
  and carried an action to trial in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench at Westminster.</p>
  <p>The upper chambermaid, the head boots, the honest laundress, the housemaid,
  and the under boots, related their parts of this tale. Other evidence as
  to the value of the articles was given, and the company had really no answer
  to make. They could not dispute the fact that the luggage had been given
  to their servants, or the value of the contents of the boxes. To have done
  this would have been to charge with perjury a number of disinterested witnesses
  whose characters were unimpeachable. All the learned gentlemen who held the
  defendants briefs could do was to cross-examine the witnesses; which only
  made the evidence stronger, and in a speech say in effect, that it was a
  strange and mysterious affair. Yes, there was another topic of commentary.
  Mr. Lynx, Q.C., the leading counsel for the defendants, did also say, that
  he was bound to admit the witnesses exhibited all the signs of being honest,
  truthful witnesses, and he had no complaint as to the witnesses who had been
  produced, but he thought it remarkable, and very unfair to his clients &mdash;not
  to say a suspicious circumstance&mdash;that the fair plaintiff had not been
  put into the box. His learned friend, Mr. Serjeant Birdlime, had said that
  this lady could give no evidence in the case. &ldquo;The jury would see,&rdquo; continued
  Mr. Lynx, &ldquo;that she was not requisite as a witness on her own side&mdash;that
  was got up complete without her&mdash;but he thought a cross-examination
  by him might have been useful to the defendants, that most respectable railway
  company he had the honour to represent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One or two of the jury seemed inclined to resent this attack upon the plaintiff,
  and appeared to regard it as an attempt to prejudice their judgment. Mr.
  Serjeant Birdlime was longing for the chance, or lamenting that, as the company
  called no witnesses, he had not the opportunity of retorting upon what he
  would have called a most wanton and unscrupulous attack upon a lady of unblemished
  reputation.</p>
  <p>The Judge summed up the evidence, the jury turned round, had two minutes&rsquo; conference
  in their box, and then gave a verdict for the fair plaintiff in the sum of &pound;250,
  the amount of the value of the lost wardrobe and jewels.</p>
  <p>The company&rsquo;s solicitor was anything but satisfied, although, as he
  said, he did not see how the jury could have returned any other verdict.
  He roundly asserted that his clients had been defrauded, and he suspected
  Miss Ellen Wilkinson to be one of a body of conspirators. He said in an audible
  whisper to Mr. Lynx, as that learned gentleman returned his brief endorsed
  with the result of the trial:&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the work of that gang,
  sir, depend on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The railway company did not pay the money. They succeeded in making out
  a case upon affidavits sufficiently strong to induce the judges to grant
  a <i>rule nisi</i>, calling upon the plaintiff to show cause why a new trial
  should not be had in the cause. That argument would come on in the form of
  another motion to make that rule for a new trial absolute, and the defendants
  thus got about three weeks to pursue their investigations.</p>
  <p>All the detective agencies of the company were set in motion, but without
  success. I was then employed, and had no doubt, in my own mind, that I should
  be able to clear up the mystery, of what I also at once saw was a fraud,
  but I did not anticipate so easy a task as I had. I did, however, save the
  exchequer of the company from the legal extortion of conspirators, and cleared
  up a mystery, although the wretches who perpetrated the crime escaped.</p>
  <p>Women have been correctly described as the marplots of conspiracy. This
  is true enough in a direct sense, but additionally true in the indirect one.
  The action of jealousy frustrated several of the schemes of the gang to which
  this histrionic impostor belonged, as we are now at liberty to confess. To
  this cause, on another occasion, the discovery and punishment of several
  of its principal members must be attributed. To this cause society is indebted
  for the ultimate destruction, about three years ago, of the abominable confederacy.</p>
  <p>Miss Wilkinson had two admirers in the conspiracy, both privy to this fraud.
  One of them, smarting under a repulse, had conceived the design of betraying
  his rival and unkind lady-love, when he ascertained that I had got the matter
  in hand, and he made my acquaintance. Upon being promised his own safety,
  he disclosed the scheme to me. He related, circumstantially, how money had
  been advanced by the capitalist of the conspirators to buy the jewels and
  the wardrobe; how the scheme had been &ldquo;put up;&rdquo; and how executed.
  He made it appear that the engagement at the B&mdash; theatre was a device
  to give a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> aspect to the initiation of the fraud, how
  apartments had been hired at the hotel in order to secure independent testimony,
  how the fuss about packing up was but a dexterous little manoeuvre to enlist
  other honest witnesses in the scheme; how every detail, even to the departure,
  breakfastless, was but a phase of trickery, in the last instance an excuse
  to account for leaving the platform and going into the refreshment-room&mdash;all
  the while keeping an eye upon the guard&rsquo;s van that beheld the apparent
  triumph of the <i>coup</i>, and was ready to cover a mishap if one had taken
  place.</p>
  <p>Nothing is simpler than the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the plot. The moment
  when that always punctual express train would arrive was known. A cab drove
  into the station as the train arrived. A man, presenting the external appearance
  of a gentleman, alighted, and was merged in the crowd of passengers honestly
  seeking their own luggage.</p>
  <p>He met another man who had entered the station on foot, and who, after hastily
  shaking hands with his associate, got into the same cab with him. The boxes
  containing the wardrobe and the jewels were claimed in the hurly-burly by
  one of the two thieves. The actress, who, of course, knew of the arrangement,
  saw all this. If the guard had by any chance known and remembered that the
  boxes had been confided to him by a lady, if by any favourable accident the
  officers of the company had been induced to challenge the man&rsquo;s right
  to the boxes, Miss Wilkinson would have stepped out of the refreshment-room,
  explained that the gentleman was her husband, and have left with him and
  the property in the cab.</p>
  <p>The plot would in such case have miscarried&mdash;a thing tantalizing and
  annoying enough to the thieves &mdash;but that would have been the extent
  of the mischief they would have had to deplore. Such a catastrophe did not
  ensue. The lady saw the boxes and her friends carried out of the station
  in the vehicle. She finished the consumption of her bun, and when she thought
  her associates beyond the immediate reach of policemen, she began to inquire
  for her luggage of the porters.</p>
  <p>This narrative would, I think, terminate more satisfactorily than it does,
  if I could inform the reader that the wretches concerned in the plot were
  punished as they deserved. Truth, however, does not warrant me in saying
  this. On the contrary, it somehow became known to the lady and her favoured
  lover that there had been treachery in the gang, so they gave up the legal
  contest, and hid themselves for awhile. When a motion was made in the Court
  of Queen&rsquo;s Bench to make the rule absolute for a new trial, neither Mr. Serjeant
  Birdlime nor any other man, in silk-gown or stuff, held a brief for the plaintiff.
  The company escaped the extortion of damages and costs; but public justice
  was defrauded of its title to submit Miss Wilkinson and a nameless paramour
  to penal servitude for a few years.</p>

  Mrs. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s Life Policy</b></h2>
  <p>One day I was desired to call upon the Unimpeachable Insurance Company,
  which at that time had its office in West Strand, London. During an interview
  with Mr. Bland, the manager and secretary, he laid before me a letter which
  he had received about six months previously from a gentleman in Dublin named
  McGrath, applying for the position of agent of the company in Ireland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I had some disinclination,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;to
  advise my Board to accept this offer, for I had reason to know that several
  offices had been robbed by fraudulent insurances from the sister isle. To
  such extent had these frauds been perpetrated (my informant proceeded to
  say) that several London offices determined under all circumstances to decline
  Irish business. As, however, mine was a young office, I thought we could
  not afford to throw away any reasonable promise of a connection, and I therefore
  submitted the letter to my Board, the result being that the applicant was
  duly appointed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The letter was handed to me. It in substance alleged that the writer was
  an estate agent in very considerable practice, and that he could bring to
  the office insurances on a rather large number of the best lives. I may also
  remark, that at the head of the letter, was an engraved address, and the
  words&mdash;&ldquo;Established 1795.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here is a copy of my letter in reply, enclosing a minute of the Board,&rdquo; said
  the manager, &ldquo;and here is a copy of the agent&rsquo;s acceptance of
  the office.&rdquo; He then continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Three weeks after the
  date of the last communication I have shown you, we received from him a proposal
  for insurance upon the life of a lady, 56 years of age, for &pound;3,000.
  This proposal happened to arrive,&mdash;unfortunately, I think I may say,&mdash;during
  my temporary absence from the office through illness. Our agent wrote to
  enquire what he should do, as the lady&rsquo;s private medical adviser was
  our local medical officer. This appointment had been made by the agent, under
  a general authority from us to select a thoroughly respectable man to act
  as our medical adviser in Dublin. Our reply was, that as we took it for granted
  he had been careful in the selection of a competent medical man, there could
  be no objection to his report in the case. The usual papers were accordingly
  transmitted to London, and laid before our principal medical officer for
  inspection.</p>
  <p>My instructor proceeded,&mdash;&ldquo;Our chief medical officer was a very
  eminent man, celebrated as a physiologist, while his personal skill in diagnosis,
  and his authority as a writer, had been brought to my knowledge in several
  previous cases. Well, the papers were critically examined by him, especially
  the Irish medical report, a copy of which I have had made for you. You will
  observe, that in it he describes the lady as being perfectly healthy, of
  good constitution, in whose habits and mode of life there were no circumstances
  to shorten the term of existence. One half-year&rsquo;s premium was paid
  upon the insurance. The money handed to our agent was duly transmitted to
  London by his own cheque, and, for the time being, the matter ended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I returned to my desk I desired our clerk to let me see the
  Policy Register, and I had laid before me the papers relating to all important
  business transacted during my absence. My eye was arrested as I glanced down
  the columns of the &lsquo;Policy Register&rsquo; by the figures &lsquo;&pound;3,000,&rsquo; and
  the word &lsquo;Dublin.&rsquo; I was a little surprised at receiving so heavy
  a proposal from this agency in the first instance, and no other business
  up to that moment from that quarter. But the papers allayed my doubts. There
  could be nothing more satisfactory than the medical report, and the answers
  made by the two private friends of the assured. I was not a little strengthened
  in my confidence when I thought of the great ability and experience of our
  own medical officer in London.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should call your attention,&rdquo; continued the manager, &ldquo;to
  the fact that this insurance is effected upon the life of a lady for her
  own benefit. The proposal distinctly states that no other person is interested
  in that life. You will be good enough to let that fact be the key to your
  investigation. And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we have what I cannot help
  regarding as in itself distinct evidence of fraud. Only four months have
  elapsed since that proposal for insurance was sent to us, and now we have
  a claim made upon us for &pound;3,000. I have the strongest suspicion of
  fraud in this case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With these instructions, and taking up the papers which had been so judiciously
  prepared for my guidance, I started for Dublin, to make an investigation
  into the circumstances. If the case was a fair sample of what happens to
  life insurance companies generally through their Irish business, I can readily
  understand how it comes to pass, as the manager of my office told me, that
  with all the care exercised by them in the selection of their lives, the
  rejection of what are discovered to be in the slightest degree unsound, or
  the insurance of those accepted only at an extra rate&mdash;assuring them
  as five, ten, or fifteen years older than they are, according to circumstances&mdash;the
  mortality among persons whose lives are insured exceeds the average of the
  whole nation, as shown by the Registrar-General, in which average is included
  men and women who follow the most injurious occupations, and live under conditions
  the most unfavourable to longevity.</p>
  <p>My inquiries were, of course, carried on secretly for some time. The police,
  with whom I put myself in communication, would render me no aid, and appeared
  to not exactly like the notion of an Englishman being employed on what they
  may have considered their peculiar duty. I am not at all sure that they kept
  faith with me. I have, on the other hand, a suspicion that some of the officers,
  who became aware of the mission I was upon, communicated its object in some
  quarter through which it travelled to the ears of the confederates in this
  fraud. Without, however, as far as I knew, letting a soul, except the police,
  guess my business, I ascertained that a woman of the age, and otherwise like
  the assured, died on the day named at the address given; that she had been
  attended by the doctor who acted for the insurance company as their medical
  adviser in Dublin; and, on the face of things, so far as I had yet proceeded,
  there was nothing to denote fraud.</p>
  <p>I reported these investigations and their apparent result to Mr. Bland,
  the secretary and manager of the company, but added, that the opinion he
  had created in my mind still remained. I could not say it had not been weakened,
  but it certainly had not been removed.</p>
  <p>Another matter of great urgency at this time demanded my attention. I knew
  that by one of the conditions of the policy, the office was not bound to
  pay the amount for six months, and then only to the legal representative
  of the deceased. Up to the present moment, I learned that no executor, had
  come forward to prove a will, and that letters of administration had not
  been applied for. I therefore craved leave from my employers to return to
  England&mdash;after taking one or two further steps, which I advised&mdash;and
  to revisit Dublin a month or two later. This was assented to. Before leaving,
  I thought however that I would just take another step in the case.</p>
  <p>I then adopted an open course of inquiry with the view of throwing the perpetrators
  of the fraud&mdash;if it were a fraud&mdash;off their guard. I had my portmanteau
  removed to the station, as though I was about to return to England by the
  next rail and boat. After it had been left in charge a few hours, I changed
  my mind, and had it taken to another hotel, where I took care to arrive at
  the same time as a number of passengers from Kingstown. After partaking of
  some refreshment, to keep up, or rather to keep down, the blind, I was driven
  in a car to the agent&rsquo;s office. This gentleman, established in&mdash;,
  received me with the well-sustained appearance of an honest man. He said
  that the case was unfortunate; he especially regretted it. If he had been
  as fortunate with the agency as he expected to have been, and had sent the
  company a number of proposals, so that the profit of that &ldquo;good business&rdquo; might,
  in some degree, have atoned for the dropping in of this life so soon, he
  would not have cared so much.</p>
  <p>As it was, however, he seriously meditated resigning the agency. This intention
  weighed upon me. It looked like saying, my game with the one office is played
  out. My suspicions were quickened. To disarm his suspicions of me, I said,
  however, in effect, that I could understand his feelings. The case was, of
  course, annoying to the company, but although the directors were a little
  vexed, and anxious for further information about the matter, yet, I supposed
  it couldn&rsquo;t be helped. I, as the company&rsquo;s clerk, instructed
  to investigate the case, should make my report, and then the money would,
  no doubt, be paid. As I approached the end of this speech, I critically scanned
  the features of my man, while I spoke in tones of pretended indifference.</p>
  <p>He was wonderfully self-possessed, but I thought I traced a gleam of satisfaction
  run over his features at the prospect of an easy settlement. Upon this he
  asked me to dine with him, which I agreed to do, and I passed the rest of
  the evening with him.</p>
  <p>Nothing further transpired that day. Rather early I retired to my hotel,
  on the plea of fatigue. Next morning, as it was arranged, Mr. Agent and I
  called upon the doctor and the referees of the deceased.</p>
  <p>Here we discovered nothing. The two friends echoed the surprise of the agent
  at the sudden death of a lady upon whose life, four months ago, either of
  them would have been prepared to have taken a lease.</p>
  <p>The doctor was as much astonished at the unexpected death, after two days&rsquo; illness,
  of a woman who he had thought it sure would have enjoyed considerably more
  than the number of days which experience said were allotted to human beings
  of her age. I professed to be satisfied, and said I would report that satisfaction,
  and left Ireland next day.</p>
  <p>The agent, the two friends, and the doctor, and somebody else, no doubt,
  were highly delighted by the prospect of getting &pound;3,000 from the Saxon
  shareholders of the Unimpeachable Assurance Company.</p>
  <p>I kept my promise to my Irish acquaintances, so far as to faithfully report
  the tenor of my interviews with them; but I also added to that narrative
  the expression of my own somewhat strengthened belief that the case, although
  enveloped in mystery, was tainted by fraud, and I advised that before the
  money was paid, a rigid inquiry should be pursued.</p>
  <p>Shortly after this, as I learned, a will of the deceased was proved, in
  due form, and a claim against the company (of which notice had already been
  given to the office) was received from the executor. This executor was also
  the legatee of the assured. The instrument was copied from one of the precedents
  in daily use, and it bequeathed to Edward O&rsquo;Halloran all the estate,
  both real and personal, of the testatrix. It was not a little remarkable,
  Mr. Bland thought, and so did I, that the two attesting witnesses to this
  document were the referees to the insurance company&mdash;the persons who,
  four months before her death, had given so favourable a report as to the
  health and habits of the deceased. But for this circumstance, the company
  would have paid the money, as my report on the case had certainly not disclosed
  any valid excuse for resisting payment.</p>
  <p>About three months after the occasion of my first visit to Dublin, in connexion
  with this affair, I returned there to renew my investigations. My tactics
  had to be varied. It was no longer of any use to pretend confidence on my
  own part in the justice of the claim. I had to inform the agent that the
  company had been led, by a communication to them on the subject, to suspect
  fraud, and to state I was directed to probe the depths of the case. The agent
  thereupon assumed an air of injured innocence&mdash;which I interpreted into
  the signs of fear. If I could have made terms with this knave, I have not
  the least doubt that I should have got a whole confession from him&mdash;but
  it would have been an unprincipled act to enter into a compact with the man
  who had, I believed, violated his trust as the company&rsquo;s representative.
  Beyond asking him the formal question&mdash;had he anything to offer in explanation
  of his share in the transaction, and eliciting for answer, that he certainly
  had not&mdash;nothing passed between us.</p>
  <p>For a fortnight I pursued my inquiries, and as I do not wish to claim credit
  for skill to which I am not entitled, I may confess that I had got no information
  that would save the pockets of the shareholders in the Unimpeachable Insurance
  Company. I learned that Edward O&rsquo;Halloran, the nephew of the deceased,
  had been a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk, and a man on whom the police told me
  they had long had their eyes steadily fixed, as he had no ostensible means
  of livelihood&mdash;although he lived at rather a faster rate than he did
  formerly when in regular employment. The witnesses to the will were respectable
  men. The doctor was above reproach. The agent was a man of whom people spoke
  contemptuously, but he had never figured in the annals of crime, nor did
  the police regard him as a man likely to perpetrate a crime known to the
  law.</p>
  <p>I confess that I was nearly baffled. At last, as I was not very much limited
  to time, or at all limited as to expenses, I resolved to concentrate my attentions
  upon Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran. I knew a shrewd fellow in London, a native of
  the sister island, and wrote him to come over and bring his wife with him.
  I had ascertained that there was a Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran, or rather a lady
  who wore that title, but had no right thereto. The nephew had taken possession
  of his aunt&rsquo;s late abode, and to letting lodgings. This might have been a
  blind, or it might have been a matter of necessity. The deceased had done
  the same until half a year before her death, when she found the duty of waiting
  upon lodgers so irksome that she gave them notice. The reputed Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran
  happened to be a vain, an impulsive, a talkative, and a revengeful woman.
  I thought that with the aid of my man Conroy, and Mrs. Conroy, who was a
  sharp little body, keen, subtle, and reticent, I should be able to find out,
  in an uncommonly short space of time, whether or not this claim upon the
  company was founded in justice or not.</p>
  <p>Conroy and his wife came over immediately, and I withdrew from Dublin, as
  arranged. My absence was remarked. O&rsquo;Halloran, and others, thought
  they had quite defeated me, and were jubilant, perhaps I might say, indiscreet.
  A lawyer, named O&rsquo;Kavanagh, who had been employed to prosecute the
  claim, wrote in terms of warm indignation to the Unimpeachable Office, complaining
  of the unjust and groundless suspicion of his client, and threatening, in
  consequence, that if the whole amount of &pound;3,000 were not paid on the
  exact day whereon the company had covenanted to pay it, he should, without
  delay, or further notice, bring his action to recover the money, and expose
  the shameful conduct of the office. This letter was handed over by Mr. Bland
  to Messrs, Oldboy, Pursy, and Twitchem, the company&rsquo;s solicitors, who
  curtly acknowledged its receipt, and said they should await his next communication
  on the subject. I thought it desirable to return to London, as I rather fancied
  that my presence in my office here would be notified to O&rsquo;Halloran,
  and throw him farther off his guard.</p>
  <p>On the arrival of Conroy and his wife at Dublin, they put up at a somewhat
  humble hostelry, where he gave it out that having saved a little money in
  a situation at Manchester, he intended to begin business in some small way
  in Dublin. To avoid expense, he thought it desirable to take private lodgings
  just while he was looking about him. Mine hostess had a son, a sleepy youth;
  would she let him just go about and show Conroy where he might look for the
  sort of lodgings he wanted, with a reasonable prospect of finding them? It
  was such a long time since he had been in Dublin before, that he had almost
  forgotten his native place.</p>
  <p>She was very obliging, as anybody must have been, to such pleasant folks
  as Mr. and Mrs. Conroy. My shrewd man led the boy, while he pretended to
  be led by him, until they came to O&rsquo;Halloran&rsquo;s house, where he
  found the apartments he wanted. They were, he thought, just the thing, but
  he cautiously declined to hire them, although they were not too fine; and
  sure, he was glad to say, the price, if Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran would just &rsquo;bate
  a shilling a week, would not be unreasonable at all. Mrs. Conroy was at the
  inn, and would come on directly and see the rooms. She did so. After a little
  fighting about price between the two ladies, they &ldquo;split the difference.&rdquo; Mrs.
  O&rsquo;Halloran bated sixpence a week in the rent, and the lodgings were
  entered upon that day.</p>
  <p>Of course, Conroy and his wife (who had been a female searcher at a station-house)
  took care to make themselves agreeable, and also to keep up their assumed
  character. The men, Conroy and O&rsquo;Halloran, liked one another at once.
  Their worldly wisdom made them suitable companions, and if that had been
  his game the former might have wormed his way, by slow degrees, into the
  confidence of &ldquo;my aunt&rsquo;s sole legatee.&rdquo; The wives, especially,
  became affectionate, and within narrow limits, reposed confidence in one
  another the first time they were left alone.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Conroy saw enough of the latent weakness of her new friend to ask on
  this occasion if she might intrude so far as to request that her servant
  might fetch a dram of whiskey. Her Mike had virtues she enthusiastically
  extolled, but he was too particular in respect to a woman&rsquo;s drinking.
  Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran had no earthly objection to oblige her lodger in this
  respect. While the liquor was being obtained by the girl, Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran
  reciprocated confidence by a statement that her husband was not unreasonable
  in the matter of her drinking, and she had not, indeed, any special cause
  of complaint that she knew of&mdash;that is, that she was sure of&mdash;but
  she rather suspected that he had lately been flirting with some &ldquo;creature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two salient traits in the character of Mr. O&rsquo;Halloran had now been
  ascertained. Conroy wrote me word that he should directly &ldquo;cut in straight,&rdquo; and
  I saw that whiskey and jealousy were the instruments he intended to employ.</p>
  <p>The real mission of the Conroys was never suspected. My withdrawal was set
  down to the account of discomfiture. O&rsquo;Halloran and his associates,
  who made sure of getting the money, were, as I have said, indiscreet&mdash;Mr.
  Edward O&rsquo;Halloran particularly so. His imagination saw &pound;3,000
  realised, and divisible in a small circle, He took his pleasure in all ways.
  Most unfortunate of all for him, his desires led him in direct collision
  with his female partner&rsquo;s greatest weakness&mdash;jealousy.</p>
  <p>The reader will spare me the necessity of minutely describing the special
  occasion and circumstances which induced the lady known as Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran
  to decide on being revenged upon the villain O&rsquo;Halloran &mdash;as she,
  I think, accurately styled him. It will be enough to say, in print, that
  she had witnessed with her own eyes what roused a thirst for vengeance, and
  that the whiskey-bottle, instead of consoling her, only inflamed her passion.
  Mrs. Conroy worked up her friend&rsquo;s excitement to the point of frenzy,
  when the latter poured the story of her wrongs and O&rsquo;Halloran&rsquo;s
  frauds (which his reputed wife said ought to transport him) into the ears
  of my clever female assistant.</p>
  <p>Conroy was, as I have said, a shrewd fellow. He believed the drunken shrew&rsquo;s
  story; and, in order to fix her as an ally, he now thought it desirable to
  work upon her own selfish fears. He told her who and what he really was,
  and threatened to hand her over to the police at once, unless she turned
  approver&mdash;a course she therefore took, after a slight show of reluctance.
  Upon this he promised her a pardon, and took down the narrative of the fraud.</p>
  <p>The scheme was bold, audacious, and wonderfully perfect, but it was very
  simple. O&rsquo;Halloran, who was not an old hand at fraud, but a crafty
  and reckless man, won over the old-established, although broken-down house
  agent, and a needy fashionable doctor, to his scheme; then he enlisted his
  aunt in it. The referees and witnesses to the will were innocent parties,
  and there was, after all, nothing in the coincidence which I and Mr. Bland
  attached so much importance to. The plan of the conspiracy was that McGrath
  should get appointed agent to the insurance company; that he should get the
  doctor appointed medical adviser for the company, so that no other medical
  man in Dublin should frustrate the plan, and that a woman who could establish,
  through referees, (not in the fraud) her perfect healthiness, should be proposed
  for insurance. This was how the proposal for assurance, and its acceptance
  by the office, were arranged. That was comparatively easy. The next part
  was to kill the woman, or get her proven dead, by satisfactory evidence.
  That was also arranged by the genius of O&rsquo;Halloran, and the aid of
  accomplices. Mrs. Fitzgerald, his aunt, took to her bed on an artificial
  attack of fever, which report alone scared away her many &ldquo;friends.&rdquo; Our
  doctor attended her for a few days. One night she, in fact, disappeared.
  Report was that she had died of typhus. She had indeed gone off to Liverpool,
  from whence she sailed, or rather steamed away to America. Another body had
  been lain in her bed; it was that of a woman of about her own age, bulk,
  and stature. How was this obtained? The doctor had learned that a woman aged
  about fifty-five, was dying of cancer, under the hands of a charity doctor
  in the city. Mrs. Fitzgerald took to her bed, as the old pauper was ascertained
  to be, beyond all doubt, near her end. She luckily died, or absconded, within
  an hour after the breath had left the body of the cancerous victim of the
  grim fiend.</p>
  <p>Our doctor knew the undertaker who contracted for the burial of out-door
  paupers. The son of Esculapius, or rather the pretended disciple of Vesalius,
  went to the undertaker in a state of great anxiety for such a subject. Cancer
  was a disease he wished to trace in all its forms. He would give any reasonable
  sum for the body of this wretched victim of the malady. Would the undertaker
  let him have it for a couple of pounds? The dark servant of the grave pleaded
  the law, and talked in ornate periods about his &ldquo;jewty.&rdquo; Would
  he take three pounds? The law and his &ldquo;jewty,&rdquo; was the reply.
  Four pounds? &ldquo;Jewty&rdquo; was his pathetic answer. As the insurance
  risk in the undertaking mind against law had been arrived at, he dropped
  one objection to the nefarious bargain. Would he take five pounds, golden
  sovereigns, paid down? &ldquo;Jewty&rdquo; yielded to this golden argument.
  The corpse of the woman who died through cancer was taken to the doctor&rsquo;s
  house for a dissection that it never underwent. That body was, an hour after
  its arrival in the doctor&rsquo;s surgery, taken by O&rsquo;Halloran to his
  aunt&rsquo;s house, and placed in her bed. The pauper&rsquo;s coffin was
  filled with stones, and buried.</p>
  <p>The coffin of Mrs. Fitzgerald (supplied by a different undertaker) was filled
  with the pauper woman&rsquo;s remains. As Mrs. Fitzgerald was thought to
  have died of typhus fever, nobody cared to look upon her countenance, except
  her nephew&rsquo;s reputed wife, who, by the way, had helped to discolour
  the skin a little, just for appearance sake. This body was followed to the
  grave by Mrs. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s friends, and deposited alongside of her
  dear departed husband&rsquo;s rotted bones.</p>
  <p>Does the reader want to know what became of Mrs. O&rsquo;Halloran? I cannot
  tell. We never troubled ourselves about her after we got such information
  as would have enabled us to make out a complete case. What became of Mr.
  McGrath, O&rsquo;Halloran, and the infamous doctor, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
  <p>The Unimpeachable Company&rsquo;s solicitors, after the arrival of Conroy
  and his clever little wife in London, and I had made my further report, wrote
  to the Irish solicitor of O&rsquo;Halloran to say that before he proceeded
  with any action, he had better either call himself or direct his London agent
  to call upon them. The Dublin solicitor called upon the company&rsquo;s solicitor.
  Mr. O&rsquo;Kavanagh made a journey from Dublin to London on purpose, and
  there the matter ended. Were not the conspirators prosecuted? asks my reader.
  Oh, no!</p>
  <p>The Unimpeachable Assurance Company saved their &pound;3,000, and were
  content.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Number5"></a>Number 5<br>
  Emily H&mdash;. A Sad Story</b></h2>
  <p>A FEW years ago I was instructed by an eminent solicitor, the partner in
  a large house at the West-end of London, to penetrate the mysteries of one
  of the most cruel frauds that ever came under the range of my professional
  observation; and the principal facts of this sad case are embodied in the
  following narrative.</p>
  <p>Mr. H&mdash; was the senior partner in one of the largest cotton manufactories
  in the North of England. His mills in the town of W&mdash; gave employment
  to, I believe, nearly 3,000 persons, men, women, and children. He was reputed,
  and, was, beyond all doubt, a millionaire. The fabrics woven by his looms
  were famed throughout Great Britain, and all over the world&mdash;a distinction
  yet, I am told, enjoyed by his partners and successors. He was a proud and
  vulgar man, who in his person and manners realised one of the descriptions
  of Mrs. Trollope. Popular rumour in the neighbourhood of his residence and
  factory, charged him with all manner of meanness, petty and sensual vice.
  But let that pass. It is only important to say that several years before
  he died, he became a sleeping partner in the business he had created; and
  that vinous or spiritual indulgence sent him to his grave much earlier than
  in all human probability he would otherwise have gone there. When he expired,
  no one lamented his death. The operatives lost an employer, but as the steam-engine
  only ceased its panting one day, and the looms and spindles only stopped
  during this brief period, after which all went on as before; and as nobody
  lost anything worth mentioning by the fact, and nobody cared anything about
  a selfish old man, he dropped into his grave without the honour of a monument,
  or the homage of a tear.</p>
  <p>The old cotton manufacturer left behind him a widow, two daughters, an ample
  fortune, and a carefully drawn will. This will deserves mention. It was a
  rather peculiar sort of instrument. It was compounded of the old man&rsquo;s mind,
  and that of his best friends&mdash;if he can be said to have had any&mdash;put,
  as he used to say &ldquo;ship-shape&rdquo; by Mr. B&mdash;, his lawyer, who,
  in fact, employed a skilful Chancery barrister to perform this work.</p>
  <p>The widow and the daughters were each provided with a considerable sum,
  which each was at liberty to do as she pleased with. Annuities were left
  to each of them&mdash;a comparatively liberal allowance to the widow, and
  a comparatively small sum to each of the daughters. These annuities were
  so fenced about that no husband with whom either lady should intermarry would
  have control over her income, nor would it become liable to his debts or
  obligations; nor could the annual allowance (paid quarterly) be mortgaged
  or anticipated. Beyond this, a considerable sum, part of the residuary estate,
  was vested in trustees for the benefit of the young ladies.</p>
  <p>The widest latitude was given as to the allocation of these bequests in
  the will that was proved by the executors, but I was told that letters, or
  secret testamentary papers of some kind, expressing the views of the testator,
  were given to the trustees. In general terms, I may state, I was informed
  that if either young lady married &ldquo;an unworthy object,&rdquo; the trustees
  were requested to give the bulk of her share in this residuary estate to
  her sister; to settle what they did grant or give to the young lady so marrying
  as carefully as they could, in the form of an annuity for her sole benefit,
  beyond the reach of her spouse; or, indeed, do very nearly as in the exercise
  of their discretion seemed best.</p>
  <p>The old man was decently interred. The will was proved. The executors took
  possession of the property, and realised the estate; the trustees entered
  upon the initial exercise of their functions. The will had been duly published,
  and the young ladies had been given to understand the extent to which they
  were in the power of their trustees.</p>
  <p>Not very long after the old cotton-spinner had gone to his final account,
  his widow and her daughters were heard to bemoan his loss in lachrymose periods.
  They could not endure the painful associations they encountered on every
  hand, at every turn, in the town of W&mdash;; and, as they alleged, in order
  to escape the mental ordeal of their native place, they resolved, under&mdash;they
  also declared&mdash;the advice of very dear friends, to take up their abode
  in the great metropolis.</p>
  <p>Some ill-natured people declared that it was pride which drove them from
  the town in which their fortunes had been made; that they wanted to run riot,
  in a respectable sort of way, in the giddy pleasures of a London season;
  and that mamma was privy to a design by the young ladies to catch husbands
  in a more genteel sphere than the North of England.</p>
  <p>I am bound to say that my investigations did not lead me upon any evidence
  of the truth of these assertions to the disadvantage of the heroines. It
  is, however, a fact that within a few months after the old man had been buried,
  the family he left behind him removed to London, and took an elegantly furnished
  residence at Kensington. The house agent who let it them, styled the cottage
  a bijou; and the change of scene did exercise a visible and beneficial influence
  upon the health and spirits of the mother and daughters.</p>
  <p>The new arrival caused &ldquo;a sensation&rdquo; in Kensington. Tradesmen
  were on the alert, solicited custom, and bribed servants for patronage. Of
  this there was no lack, and it is needless to add, that everything consumed
  or ordered was duly paid for.</p>
  <p>The servants who were lucky enough to get situations with this family, declared
  they were the best mistresses in the world; and as it is not easy to satisfy
  the inmates of kitchens and pantries, I take it for granted that the domestics
  were well cared for. Not, however, to weary the reader, I may say that the
  H&mdash; &nbsp;family lived in brilliant style, although on rather a small
  scale; that their reputation, I mean the fame of their wealth, was a constant
  theme of speculation and commentary.</p>
  <p>Some persons who attended their sumptuous little parties believed all that
  rumour assigned to the family; other persons, who were not of these parties,
  affected to disbelieve the reports about the wealth of the Misses H&mdash;;
  and even ladies and gentlemen of the latter set have been heard to throw
  such epithets as &ldquo;stuck up,&rdquo; &ldquo;snobs,&rdquo; &amp;c. The <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
  Belgravia and of Tyburnia held aloof distrustfully. The Misses H&mdash; were
  not of the <i>ton</i>, and their mother was excessively vulgar in the eyes
  of these persons. Yet there was no lack of people, deserving to be considered
  highly genteel, who found what pleased them on the table of the cotton-spinner&rsquo;s
  widow.</p>
  <p>Among the favoured guests at the widow&rsquo;s residence was a certain gentleman
  about twenty-five years of age. He was rather tall, slenderly built, of dark
  complexion, hair approaching to jet black. His countenance was more than
  intelligent. It indicated mental activity and strength. There was an expression
  in the eye which I, who saw him a few months after his first visit to the
  residence of Mrs. H&mdash;, did not much like; and there was also an expression
  on the face and mouth which betrayed a latent villany of character. I said
  this when a miniature of the rascal was first put into my hands; and when
  I made the acquaintance of the original, my first impressions were only confirmed
  or justified.</p>
  <p>People who had met him in company were nearly agreed that he was a pleasant
  and agreeable companion. Few persons had, however, met him at Mrs. H&mdash;&rsquo;s.
  Important engagements usually prevented his accepting invitations to the
  parties. He was almost always obliged to apologise for an absence on these
  occasions, which, of course, caused him much annoyance. He, however, compensated
  for his absence from the parties by his frequent attendance at the house
  when nobody else but the family was there. Many afternoons were thus spent,
  to the hearty satisfaction of mother and daughters, especially Miss Emily
  H&mdash;, the youngest, who had privately agreed to become the wife of this
  man within a month of the date of her first interview with him.</p>
  <p>Emily H&mdash; was a pretty little young woman, twenty-one years of age,
  just two years younger than her sister. She was a rather pert and simpering
  girl, whose character exhibited many of the best traits of the stock from
  which she came, spoiled by the flimsy education of boarding-schools. There
  she learned a false morality, a dangerous sentimentalism, and a habit of
  intrigue which, as this sad story shows, proved her utter destruction.</p>
  <p>When this suitor, whom I shall now call Charley Edwards (although he went
  at Kensington by another name), proposed a clandestine courtship, she did
  not refuse. She knew that, according to the regulations of polite society,
  her sister ought to be disposed of in marriage before her turn came; and
  she knew that such was the order of mamma&rsquo;s programme. This fact was
  artfully pleaded by the villain of this true story as the pretext and excuse
  for secresy. When so much of his plan had succeeded, the rest he saw was
  easy. He knew enough of female human nature to know that a silly girl, if
  once tempted to break one regulation of social life, will be restrained by
  no sense of prudence afterwards, unless it be on the threshold of sin, and
  it was no part of this knave&rsquo;s project to outrage the young lady, or
  do her wrong, until he had made her his wife. The correspondence went on
  for a short time between them as lovers before it was detected, and as I
  am telling the truth, I may as well state that there was a quarrel, or perhaps
  half a dozen scenes, in the bijou of Mrs. H&mdash; , as violent and as rude
  as ever occurred in the lowly walks of life.</p>
  <p>The mother raved and wept, the elder daughter vented her rage in a variety
  of modes easier imagined than described. Miss Emily retorted in kind, and
  would not be convinced of the error of her conduct. On one point she was
  firm; she was her own mistress. She would incur all risks. She would marry
  the man she loved whenever she liked. Her mother and her sister need not
  trouble themselves about her fate or fortune. Marry him she would at once,
  if he would have her. A drawn battle ended the dispute.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the lovers, who had prepared for such a contingency as this, corresponded
  and met. Miss Emily&rsquo;s maid contrived the trysts. A week after the discovery,
  Emily H&mdash; became Mrs. &mdash;. She did not then know her husbands name,
  and the reader must never know it. A secret marriage was the termination
  of a clandestine correspondence.</p>
  <p>All went on pleasantly enough for a short time. The bride had some ready
  money, and so had the bridegroom. The mother and sister affected an indifference
  they did not feel, and Mrs. Edwards was too charmed with her new situation
  and her husband&rsquo;s friends to care about the relatives in Kensington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Charley&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; she said in a letter to a country
  cousin, &ldquo;are the divinest fellows I ever met with in my life;&rdquo; and
  agreeable companions enough were those she was permitted to see, although
  it may be here mentioned, that he had another set, or series of sets, whose
  demeanour and language would have shocked even her notions of propriety,
  which were not of the most superlative or keen description. They chatted
  on topics neither above nor below the comprehension of a lady of the stamp
  of my heroine, smoked the choicest cigars in her presence, and voted her
  round compliments because she permitted this liberty. They drank, but not
  too deeply, and played freely, &ldquo;like gentlemen&rdquo; she declared.</p>
  <p>When the immediate stock of funds had been exhausted, Charley found it not
  difficult to raise more on his note of hand, and some kind of security or
  pledge of his wife&rsquo;s estate.</p>
  <p>The three first weeks were spent at Scarborough. On their return the week
  after, which rolled on for about three months in the way I have described,
  during all of which time Kensington had not come to Notting Hill, Notting
  Hill had not been to Kensington. Each party was playing a waiting game, and
  the old lady might have been reconciled to her daughter, if dear Charley
  hadn&rsquo;t so very obstinately refused to make, or let his wife make, the
  first advance in that direction. It was plain to some people that he didn&rsquo;t
  want, and would perhaps rather not have the friendship of his wife&rsquo;s
  kindred. It might indeed have embarrassed his plans, and he had good reasons
  for preferring to be free from their good offices.</p>
  <p>One morning Charley was in a dressing-gown, yawning over his coffee, and
  was listlessly puffing at a meerschaum, as he professed to read the paper,
  much as a bachelor with a competent independence might do. His darling Emily
  was trying to kill time with a crochet needle, or working at some &ldquo;mania,&rdquo; I
  forget which. A visitor was announced. It was one of the rattling, jovial,
  and apparently generous fellows whose praises she had so lauded in her familiar
  epistle, whose name I will call Robinson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What! Charley, my boy, how is this? What was up last night? Eh! Mrs.
  Edwards,&mdash;I beg your ten thousand persons&mdash;almost forgot you, I
  declare.&rdquo; Thus rattled on the intruder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing was up last night, I assure you,&rdquo; returned Charley, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he
  added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s confoundedly dull in London just now, and I and
  Em were just taking out our married bliss quietly, you know, not expecting
  Rattlebrain here yet for a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you see I know that I am always welcome, am I not, Mrs. Edwards?
  and I shall always come when I like; but I say, old fellow, if you find London
  dull, why don&rsquo;t you come to Paris with me and Jack Nolan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to Paris? When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, we haven&rsquo;t exactly named the day, as
  the old maid said about her wedding, but in about a week, I suppose. Will
  you come? Oh don&rsquo;t pout, Mrs. Edwards; make the wretch take you with
  him, I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say about it Em?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Em was silent. It was that sort of silence which may always be safely defined
  as consent, and so Charley interpreted her meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see Em would like to go, only she&rsquo;s a little thoughtful about
  the pocket of her hub. A good wife&rsquo;s a treasure, young Rattlebrain.
  When are you really going to get married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, cut that. When shall we go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, say next Monday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monday&mdash;no, Tuesday&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got an appointment with
  the governor on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The governor, eh?&rdquo; And Charley laughed as if he thought that
  assertion such a very good joke that he might laugh at it without fear.</p>
  <p>Fear of what? the reader asks.</p>
  <p>Well, of anything like falsehood or guile, my dear reader.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Edwards thought it time to say and do something, so, after the manner
  oftentimes rehearsed, when a girl at what is appropriately called &ldquo;a
  finishing establishment,&rdquo; she pulled &ldquo;dear Charley&rsquo;s&rdquo; whiskers,
  kissed him, and asked, &ldquo;When shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tuesday, if you please; let it be Tuesday&mdash;any day you please.
  It&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This point being settled, the conversation was changed to some insipid topic
  which this precious set of human creatures appeared to enjoy. Mrs. Edwards
  seemed at last, about one o&rsquo;clock, to reflect that her appearance was
  not exactly becoming a deceased millionaire&rsquo;s daughter, or the wife
  of such a fine gentleman as dear Charley, so she adjourned to her room upstairs,
  and left the two men alone.</p>
  <p>The conversation now took a more subdued tone and serious air. Rattlebrain
  was quiet and attentive. Charles was earnest and demonstrative. The reader
  will be pleased to accept as a reason why I do not relate this discussion,
  the one so often met with in newspaper reports of debates in Parliament,
  speeches at political meetings&mdash;the speakers&rsquo; voices, dear reader,
  if you please, were not audible to me&mdash;for I was not there at the time.
  Is this explanation unsatisfactory? Wait awhile, and the substance of the
  discussion, or the plan agreed upon, will all appear in this story.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday the party left London for Paris, and arrived in due course at
  the Hotel A&mdash; B&mdash; , a leading &ldquo;English house,&rdquo; in the
  Rue C&mdash; D&mdash; . (The reader must pardon my care to avoid disclosing
  anything which might fix the identity of innocent persons.)</p>
  <p>Ten days or so were passed in the gay capital, before the main incident
  I am about to describe occurred. Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, Robinson, and Nolan,
  were conspicuous in every place of public entertainment within certain grades.
  I do not learn that they obtained admission into the circles of <i>ton</i>,
  but I ascertained that they visited during the memorable ten days almost
  all the places described in guide books.</p>
  <p>My party were favourites. Edwards&rsquo; pleasant manners, Robinson&rsquo;s
  frolicksome talk, Nolan&rsquo;s sparkling wit, and Mrs. Edwards&rsquo; modesty&mdash;for
  she was, as she said, or tried to say in French, like a fish out of water&mdash;made
  them agreeable company at the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>; and as they
  lacked not money, host and servants were pleased with their guests. One spinster
  lady, an Englishwoman, about thirty-five years old, somewhat prone to be
  censorious, declared that Em&rsquo;s manners were too free. This person afterwards
  asserted that she had seen Robinson kiss her several times &ldquo;on the
  sly.&rdquo; Of course I don&rsquo;t believe there was a shadow of truth in
  this specific charge, although I am bound to admit that she did not exhibit
  as much circumspection as I think she ought to have done. On the other hand,
  it may be asked, was she not introduced to Robinson and Nolan by her husband&mdash;were
  they not his friends&mdash;had he not thrown her in their way, and almost
  instructed her to make free with them? The reader will accept for what it
  is worth my own solemn declaration, that neither in deed or thought was Emily
  unfaithful to her husband.</p>
  <p>An anonymous letter, delivered by post, was received by Edwards, charging
  his wife with this offence against the proprieties of married life. That
  letter, I am at liberty to say, was written by the spinster, then residing
  in the hotel A&mdash; B&mdash; . He read it unmoved; no change in his manner
  was visible. He put the letter carefully away in a coat-pocket.</p>
  <p>Somewhere about the ninth day of their residence in Paris, Em and Charley
  formed themselves into what is called in Parliament a committee of ways and
  means. Her purse was nearly empty, so was his. What should they do? Ask Robinson
  for a loan? No! Ask Nolan? No! That would be so humiliating. He must return
  to London, and get another bill done. She must remain in pledge at the hotel
  until he could redeem her. Three days at most would suffice. She cried or
  whimpered over her first separation from &ldquo;dear Charley.&rdquo; He comforted
  her by the assurance that he would not be absent from her side more than
  three or four days. So it was arranged that he should depart at once, that
  is, within a few hours, and make all possible haste back.</p>
  <p>At parting she asked, &ldquo;You will write to me every night, won&rsquo;t
  you, dear Charley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweet Em, that&rsquo;s hardly possible when I shall be in the railway
  or on the steam-boat all the time I am away, except a few hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An interview took place between the other gentlemen and Edwards, when he
  informed them of his intended departure for London upon urgent private business,
  which would detain him, however, only a few days. In the meantime, he left
  his charming little wife under their care. A similar announcement of the
  fact, and its cause, was made to the guests at the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>,
  and Mr. Edwards took a night train on the Chemin de Fer du Nord. He did not,
  however, travel so far as London. Did he, on the way, get his purse replenished?
  did he ascertain that he could do without money, like Becky Sharp of &ldquo;Vanity
  Fair?&rdquo; or did he discover a reserve of good bank-notes in his watch-fob
  or pocket-book? I lean to the last theory. At any rate, he went no farther
  than Boulogne, and remained there one entire day.</p>
  <p>Next evening, when the night train started from Boulogne to Paris, Mr. Charles
  Edwards took a ticket, and returned to the French capital. He arrived in
  Paris about midnight, and went straight to his hotel.</p>
  <p>During her husband&rsquo;s absence, poor Emily had been chaperoned by Robinson,
  and that evening he and Nolan had invited themselves to pass an hour or two
  in her sitting-room. She made no objection to the licence her husband&rsquo;s
  friends thus granted themselves. She did not see any impropriety in the reception
  of them, and did her best to make them as comfortable as she could. The evening
  passed much as other evenings did, when the friends remained in-doors, and
  before twelve o&rsquo;clock the little party broke up.</p>
  <p>The portress let Mr. Edwards into the hotel, without asking questions, and
  he went to his bedroom. Immediately afterwards, he closed the door violently,
  turning the key on the outside, and began shouting like a maniac. His place
  was filled by Robinson, whose name he shouted, while that villain and Emily
  slumbered side by side! This noise, at such a time, raised half the inmates,
  guests, and servants of the house; and when the key was again turned, more
  than a score of persons saw poor Mrs. Edwards, awakened by the noise, rubbing
  her eyes, half unconscious, and totally bewildered. Robinson was awakened
  by a strong punch administered by a bucolic gentleman, whose name will be
  found in Burke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Landed Gentry,&rdquo; but must not be inserted
  here. Here was a situation more distressing than that of Bellini&rsquo;s
  Amina&mdash;more horrible than anything the reader has, I hope, known in <i>his</i> experience.</p>
  <p>The patent evidences of Emily&rsquo;s guilt could be sworn to by a score
  of the most respectable witnesses who ever gave their testimony before any
  tribunal in the world. There appeared to the spectators no explanation at
  all consistent with her innocence. The spinster, who was a witness of this
  scene, said it was just as she expected things would turn out. She was not
  at all surprised. She only wondered how poor Mr. Edwards could have been
  blinded so long to what everybody else could see, and much more of the same
  kind. Everybody present did remember, now they came to think of it&mdash;or
  said so&mdash;that there had been many undue familiarities between Robinson
  and Emily. Yes! they now perfectly recollected furtive glances between the
  criminals at the <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i>. Hundreds of their illicit love
  stratagems were recounted across the table at the hotel A&mdash; &nbsp;B&mdash; during
  the next two or three weeks,</p>
  <p>Emily broke out in a violent paroxysm of grief. She was hysterical; but
  the one idea of her alleged crime haunted her. She talked of nothing else
  during the time she remained at the hotel The ladies staying there of course
  left her in disgust, and a kind-hearted Frenchwoman, obtained from somewhere
  by the host, had charge of her until the proud mother arrived from Kensington.
  She was then almost immediately removed to England by her mother. The old
  lady was as stubborn as the rest for a time. She read Emily a host of lectures,
  showing how one crime leads on to another, and tracing the connexion between
  the clandestine marriage and adultery like inevitable cause and effect; but
  so keen was the anguish of the unfortunate daughter, and so intense her protestations
  of innocence, that at last the mother&rsquo;s faith was stirred, and she
  arrived at a new twofold conclusion&mdash;Robinson was a villain, and Edwards
  was, after all, to be pitied, although he had not acted as a gentleman should
  when he ran away with her child.</p>
  <p>Robinson skulked off as well as he could after the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>,
  and I am told he was dexterous enough to escape that night to his own apartment,
  where nobody thought of following him, with only a braise and a scratch or
  two, as tokens of the genteel indignation at his crime. Next morning he paid
  his bill, and went off to Brussels. The landlord was glad to be rid of him
  without further uproar, so he got away quietly. Scandal would have injured
  the character of the hostelry, so that &ldquo;mine host&rdquo; would have
  been pleased if the guests had been silent in the public room about the affair.
  He had, however, at his service, a French proverb, which corresponds to the
  English saying, &ldquo;that what can&rsquo;t be cured must be endured.&rdquo; As
  he could not make them keep their mouths shut, and as they were his &ldquo;kind
  patrons,&rdquo; he put up with this unpleasant conversation while it lasted,
  and kept his own counsel on the subject. One notion consoled him for any
  actual loss or inconvenience; he knew the names and usual addresses of every
  guest in his house. The injured husband would want this information, would
  need a variety of services in getting up evidence against his wife and her
  paramour. This he should have, but he must pay for it, and liberally, too,
  like an English gentleman.</p>
  <p>Of Mr. Charley Edwards, for the present let me only say that he, too, left
  the hotel next day, apparently in dreadful grief. He took no leave of his
  wife. He told the hostess that such a meeting would be too much for him.
  He begged her to look kindly after Emily until her mother arrived. He wrote
  a letter, full of manly pathos, to Kensington. He arrived in London by a
  train from Folkestone on the evening of the day he left Paris.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Exceedingly soon after the last painful incidents had happened, I was sent
  for by the solicitor to whom I have referred. He was at his wits&rsquo; ends.
  That a monstrous and cruel hoax and fraud had been committed was, he thought,
  most probable, and yet the apparent want of motive for destroying the character
  of the young wife almost led him to conclude she must be guilty. It had been
  pretty distinctly stated to him by the solicitor for the husband that money
  would have to be secured to him, if he could be induced to abstain from bringing
  scandal upon her family and connexions. Yet, as my solicitor observed, the
  man would have had quite as much, or indeed much more money than he can now
  get, and a young, pretty, and eminently respectable wife to boot, if this
  affair had not happened or been brought about. I was also puzzled.</p>
  <p>My first difficulty was in getting a clue to Mr. Edwards&rsquo; position
  or antecedents. He was said to be then on the Continent, and a direct application
  to his solicitor was by me not thought prudent, for it might have put him
  on his guard. Mrs. H&mdash; , Emily&rsquo;s mother, knew nothing about him.
  His acquaintance had been made at a flower-show, and he gave his address
  at an hotel, alleging that he had not long returned from France, where he
  had resided several years. I could not identify him by a portrait or miniature.
  Inquiry at the hotel where he lived, while paying his addresses to his wife,
  could not trace him beyond the day he arrived there, but whence he came nobody
  knew.</p>
  <p>At length I got upon the track, and in a month had so baited my own trap
  that one of the real criminals, Nolan, walked in. When there, he began, as
  villains always do, to tremble for his own safety; and as he was the least
  guilty, I went so far as to promise him a reward if he could satisfy me that
  he had told everything about the case. If not, I said I should hand him over
  at once to the police, and gently hinted that I had reason to believe he
  was wanted for another affair. He told me what I believe was the whole story,
  I let him off with a note to the solicitor who employed me, in which I suggested
  that ten pounds should be given him at once, with a pledge to pay him forty
  pounds more, if his story could be verified in other particular?</p>
  <p>Without betraying Nolan, I learned all about Robinson and Mr. Charley Edwards,
  and the atrocious scheme from first to last.</p>
  <p>The conspiracy was briefly this. The arrival of the family at Kensington
  had been observed by Robinson. Stock had been taken of the mother and daughters.
  It was calculated that either of the girls, not knowing the upper ten thousand
  of the metropolis, would embrace the first offer of marriage by one who was
  thought to be &ldquo;a real gentleman.&rdquo; Edwards was selected by his
  companions to play the part of lover. He was the only one at all capable
  of sustaining it. What they desired was ready money. Neither of them would
  have felt happy as the husband of Emily. Each of them had his &ldquo;attachment,&rdquo; which
  he did not care to break, and neither of them could escape from the thraldom
  of the compact of crime into which he had entered.</p>
  <p>The will had been examined before the plot was matured, and after perusing
  it they came to the conclusion that more ready money could be obtained by
  the steps they took than in any other mode. If a disgrace could be attached
  to the family, all its members would concur in any monied arrangement for
  hushing up the scandal. From first to last everything described in this narrative
  happened as planned by Edwards, Robinson, and Nolan, except, perhaps, the
  spinster&rsquo;s letter, which formed a valuable link in the chain of evidence.</p>
  <p>Whether this amiable lady was a member of the confederacy, or an unconscious
  ally, I did not ascertain from Nolan. I also found out, by enquiry, that
  Edwards had cohabited with a female for many years, and that she was then
  the mother of several of his children. This woman had been a consenting party
  to the immolation of Emily H&mdash;. She knew and acted her negative part
  in the plot by resigning her lover to play his part&mdash;that of the bridegroom
  of a wife he intended to destroy.</p>
  <p>All this we could, if necessary, have proved by the oath of Nolan, which
  would have been confirmed in a variety of material points. How far it would
  have got over the strong <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case of the independent
  witnesses at Paris, it is not for me to say, nor do I care to offer an opinion
  upon the value of the other features of the case that weighed upon the minds
  and hearts of the unfortunate wife&rsquo;s family. If we succeeded in preventing
  the divorce for which it was intended to apply, the effect of our skill would
  be to invest the scoundrel who had so outraged her with a husband&rsquo;s
  rights over her income through her person as long as she lived, unless Providence
  should release her by first removing him from this world, and then she must
  drag this odious matrimonial chain until he died.</p>
  <p>If, in order to effect her release, we consented to his prayer for a divorce&mdash;supposing
  him willing, in that case, to prosecute it&mdash;we then allowed him to brand
  her, innocent as she was, with the odious title of adultress. This was felt
  to be an awkward dilemma. Or, supposing that the crime of the three villains
  were brought within the scope of the criminal law, the horrible scandal would
  be revealed. To avoid either unpleasantness it was, after many consultations
  between the solicitor and counsel of the H&mdash;family&mdash;conferences
  between Emily&rsquo;s mother, her trustees, and the solicitor&mdash;meetings
  between the two solicitors of the parties, and much anxious thought by the
  victim and her friends, that it would be sound policy to get the husband
  bound under a deed of separation and a bond, the penalties of which should
  overtake him if he ever broke his engagement, not to molest his deeply injured
  wife. To obtain the execution of these legal instruments, the trustees and
  family paid Mr. Charley Edwards the sum of &pound;3,000 sterling.</p>
  <p>It is consoling to know that the fiends did not long enjoy their ill-gotten
  money. All of them fell into the hands of justice at different times. Edwards
  was transported beyond the seas, and having broken his parole in Australia,
  turned bushman. While attacking, with some companions, a gold escort from
  the diggings at Ballarat to Melbourne, he was shot in the heart. Robinson
  and Nolan are, I believe, alive, and doing penance as convicts. Emily, who
  finds comfort in charitable deeds, is living under an assumed name in a continental
  city, where no person is acquainted with her melancholy story.</p>
