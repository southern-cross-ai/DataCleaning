  Across The Threshold</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane paused for an instant in the doorway of the room before him,
  as his dark, steady eyes travelled over the appointments in a sort of measured
  approval such as a connoisseur who knew his art might bestow upon a canvas
  in which he found no flaw. The apartment was quite in keeping with everything
  else that pertained to the palatial residence in that upper Fifth Avenue
  section of New York. The indirect lighting fell soft and mellow upon the
  priceless Oriental rug, the massive desk of dark, carved wood, the wide,
  inviting leather-upholstered chairs, the heavy porti&egrave;res that filled
  the window spaces and hung before the doors, the bookshelves that lined the
  walls almost ceiling high and that were of the same dark, polished wood as
  the desk and chairs. There was luxury here, and wealth; but it was luxury
  without ostentation, and wealth that typified only good taste and refinement.</p>
  <p>He closed the door behind him, and began to pace slowly up and down the
  room. And now he frowned a little. He had dined alone with his employer as
  usual, for Mrs. Ellsworth being an invalid was rarely in evidence, and David
  Ellsworth usually so genial an old gentleman, had not been entirely himself.
  From the pocket of his dinner jacket Billy Kane took out his cigarette case,
  selected a cigarette, and lighted it. Mr. Ellsworth had lingered in the dining
  room, and had said that he would come presently to the library&mdash;that
  there was a little matter he wished to attend to. There was nothing strange
  in that, for they often worked together here in this room in the evenings,
  and yet Billy Kane&rsquo;s puzzled frown deepened. There was something certainly
  amiss with the old multi-millionaire tonight, and that anything should disturb
  the old philanthropist&rsquo;s tranquillity, except when his sympathies had
  been aroused and the man&rsquo;s heart, that was softer than a woman&rsquo;s,
  had been touched by some pathetic appeal, was decidedly strange.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane continued his pacing up and down the room in long, athletic strides,
  the great, broad shoulders squared back as his hands were thrust into the
  pockets of his jacket. It was far more than a feeling of respect or mere
  liking that he held for his employer, for there had come esteem for the old
  gentleman&rsquo;s sterling qualities, and with the esteem a sincere affection,
  and out of it all, very curiously, a sort of fathering, or protecting interest
  for this man of millions.</p>
  <p>The frown passed away, and Billy Kane smiled a little whimsically at the
  somewhat quaint conceit. Fathering! Nevertheless, it was true! There was
  scarcely an hour of the day that some appeal for charity, ranging from a
  few cents to many thousands of dollars, was not made upon David Ellsworth&mdash;too
  many of them spurious, and it was his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, self-appointed
  task to stand between his employer and these fraudulent attempts. All the
  world, at least all the world within reach, seemed to be thoroughly conversant
  with the old gentleman&rsquo;s ask-no-questions liberality&mdash;and to lose
  no opportunity in taking advantage of that knowledge! For instance, though
  here he was forced to the belief that it was genuinely worthy, there was
  the case of the deformed beggar, one Antonio Laverto, who, during the last
  week, had taken up his station on the corner a block away from the house.
  The beggar had already secured the old gentleman&rsquo;s attention, and also
  a dollar or two every time David Ellsworth passed; in return for which David
  Ellsworth had become possessed of a very pitiful life history, and also possessed
  of a desire to set the man squarely on his feet again.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane paused abruptly in his stride, as his eyes rested on the porti&egrave;res
  that hung before one of the two doorways at the lower end of the room. Behind
  that door, which was one of wood matching the other doors of the room, was
  a door of solid steel, and behind the steel door was one of the strongest
  vaults in the city of New York, and in the vault, besides the magnificent
  collection of rubies that nestled in their plush-lined trays, a collection
  that, while but a hobby, had yet made their owner even more famous and widely
  known than had his millions, were thousands of dollars&mdash;<i>the money
  kept there for the sole purpose of being given away</i>! Eccentricity? Well,
  perhaps&mdash;but if so, it was a very fine eccentricity, the eccentricity
  of one of God&rsquo;s own noblemen.</p>
  <p>One of God&rsquo;s own noblemen! Yes, he had good reason to call David Ellsworth
  that! Billy Kane&rsquo;s strong face softened. As a boy is acquainted with
  his father&rsquo;s companions, he had been acquainted with David Ellsworth
  for many years, it was true; but he had never known the other for his real
  worth until the last three months, during which time he had been the retired
  magnate&rsquo;s confidential secretary. His father had been an old friend
  of David Ellsworth; and a little more than three months ago his father had
  died, just as he, Billy Kane, had graduated from Harvard. His father&rsquo;s
  estate, supposedly large, had turned out to amount to comparatively nothing;
  the net residue of the estate, which had just been wound up, being represented
  by the sum now at his credit in the bank, a matter of something less than
  five thousand dollars. Apart from that, there was nothing. His mother had
  been dead many years; and, with no ties to hamper him, he had been casting
  around for some opening where he could utilize his university degree in arts
  to the best advantage, when he had received the offer from David Ellsworth
  to act as the latter&rsquo;s confidential secretary. He had accepted at once,
  and since then he had led a rather singular existence.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane tamped out his cigarette on the edge of an ash receiver, and
  stood leaning with his back against the desk, facing the hall door. Yes,
  it was a very singular existence! His new home was veritably a palace, with
  servants at every beck and call. His work was not onerous; and his salary
  was over-generous. He, in turn, had a private secretary, or at least a most
  capable stenographer, who, having been long in David Ellsworth&rsquo;s employ,
  took care of the daily routine; and it was mostly routine as far as business
  went, for the millionaire had long since retired from any active participation
  in the various interests through which he had acquired his fortune. But the
  work, that is the bulk of it, had now taken on quite a different angle, due
  to his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s own initiative, than had been thought of when
  he had accepted the position. He had not been there a week before he had
  realized that the old philanthropist was being victimized right and left
  by fraudulent appeals for money. It had been sufficient simply to excite
  David Ellsworth&rsquo;s sympathy in order to open the ever-ready purse. David
  Ellsworth had inquired no further. He, Billy Kane, but not without protest
  from the old gentleman, to whom the loss of the money was nothing, but to
  whom the uncovering of some pitiful fraud was a cause of genuine distress,
  had instituted a new r&eacute;gime, and had undertaken to investigate every
  case on its merits.</p>
  <p>The whimsical smile came back to his lips. Born and brought up in the city,
  he had imagined that he knew his New York; but the last three months had
  opened his eyes to a new world around him&mdash;the world of the Bad Lands,
  with its own language, its own customs and its own haunts. He knew his New
  York a great deal better now! Those three months had brought him into intimate
  touch with the dens and dives, and many of the habitu&eacute;s of the underworld,
  since it was amongst those surroundings that his investigations had mainly
  led him. He had even been in the heart of that sordid world no later than
  that afternoon.</p>
  <p>Behind his back, Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers were drumming a meditative tattoo
  upon the desk. His train of thought had brought him back to the crippled
  Italian beggar, Antonio Laverto. The man was a pitiful looking object enough&mdash;one
  of those mendicants commonly designated in the vernacular as a &ldquo;flopper.&rdquo; His
  legs were twisted under him in contorted angles at the knees, and his means
  of locomotion consisted in lifting himself up on the palms of his hands and
  swaying himself painfully along a foot or so at a time. Laverto&rsquo;s story,
  told in halting and broken English, was equally pitiful. The man had been
  a photographer, an artist he had called himself, and he had come to America
  a few years before from some little town in Italy, lured by the high prices
  that he had heard the rich New World would pay him for his work. But within
  a few days of landing he had met with an accident in a tenement fire that
  had crippled and maimed him for life. He had been practically destitute,
  his sole possessions being the camera and a few of the cherished photographs
  he had brought with him. The camera had gone to pay for his support during
  convalescence; and subsequently, reduced to beggary, most of his pictures
  had gone the same way.</p>
  <p>That, in substance, was the Italian&rsquo;s story. Billy Kane shook his
  head impatiently. The man bothered him. He had been frankly skeptical and
  wholly suspicious at first; but investigation had only confirmed the man&rsquo;s
  story. Certainly, an Italian by that name, newly arrived in the country,
  had been badly hurt and crippled in a tenement fire a few years ago, and
  had been treated in one of the city hospitals. That much, at least, he had
  discovered! Also, no more than a few hours ago, he had gone to Laverto&rsquo;s
  home and found the man existing in a small, miserable room on the East Side,
  and surrounded by every evidence of squalor and abject poverty; and the man,
  he was obliged to confess, had got his sympathy too. There were two exquisite
  little photographs, landscapes, real gems of art, wrapped up in fold after
  fold of newspaper. Laverto had shown them to him, and had told his story
  again, begging him to buy one of the pictures&mdash;and when he had produced
  the money the cripple had drawn his treasures back, and had clutched them
  to his breast, and had cried over them, and finally had refused to sell at
  all.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers continued to drum on the desk. David Ellsworth
  would undoubtedly want to know about Laverto to-night&mdash;and the man bothered
  him. He had no grounds for further suspicion, fairness compelled him to the
  admission that the man&rsquo;s story seemed true; and yet, based on nothing
  more tangible than intuition, there still lingered a doubt about the whole
  matter in his mind.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane straightened up from the desk. Jackson, one of the footmen, had
  opened the door from the hall, and David Ellsworth, an immaculate little
  gray-haired old gentleman, in evening clothes, stepped into the library.</p>
  <p>The footman closed the door silently.</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth wore glasses. He took them off, polished them with nervous
  energy while his blue eyes swept around the room, fixed on Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  face, and swept around the room again. He cleared his throat once or twice
  before he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting, Billy,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;You
  must have noticed that I had finished dinner at the same time as yourself;
  but I have been very much disturbed and perplexed all day, and I have been
  trying to solve a problem before saying anything to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s nothing seriously wrong, sir,&rdquo; Billy
  Kane answered quickly. &ldquo;May I ask what&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David Ellsworth, a sort of curious reluctance in
  his voice. He took a letter from his pocket, and handed it to Billy Kane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane opened the letter&mdash;and, staring at the type-written words
  on the sheet in his hand, suddenly an angry red tinged his cheeks and mounted
  to his temples. His eyes mechanically travelled over the lines again:</p>
  <p class="note">Like father like son may be an old adage, but like a good many old adages
  its face value is not always to be relied upon. It might pay you to keep
  an eye on your confidential secretary&mdash;and on the contents of your vault.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A
  Friend.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane laid the letter down upon the desk without a word&mdash;but his
  lips were tight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You understand, Billy,&rdquo; said the old millionaire eagerly, &ldquo;that
  the only reason why I did not show this to you immediately when I received
  it this morning was because I wanted, if possible, to formulate a definite
  conclusion as to the motive that prompted the writing of the contemptible
  thing. You understand, my boy, don&rsquo;t you? I could talk to you then
  about it without hurting you. As for the actual letter itself, there is,
  of course, but one answer, and that is&mdash;this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth reached out for the letter&mdash;but Billy Kane had already
  picked it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were going to tear it up, sir,&rdquo; he said deliberately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  rather you wouldn&rsquo;t. There may be a chance some day of showing this
  to the cur who wrote it&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t like to lose that chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then keep it, by all means!&rdquo; agreed David Ellsworth. He nodded
  his head in vigorous assent, as Billy Kane restored the letter to its envelope,
  and placed the letter in the pocket of his dinner jacket. &ldquo;So much
  for that! But what do you make of it, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s object is obvious enough,&rdquo; Billy Kane replied savagely. &ldquo;Somebody
  appears to have it in for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth was polishing his glasses again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me that I was the most guileless man you ever knew,
  Billy,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head slowly; &ldquo;and perhaps I am,
  and then again perhaps I&rsquo;m not&mdash;and perhaps it isn&rsquo;t always
  because I&rsquo;m guileless that I close my eyes to many things. But I guess,
  after all, that I can peer as far through a stone wall as the next man. I&rsquo;ve
  had to do some pretty stiff peering in the days gone by to get the few millions
  together that I&rsquo;ve got now. I mention this, Billy, so that you may
  not confuse my idiosyncrasies with&mdash;well, whatever you like to call
  it. Those dollars, my boy, didn&rsquo;t just drop into my hands&mdash;they
  were <i>thought</i> there. And so you think that letter means someone has
  it in for you? Think a little deeper, Billy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, in a puzzled
  way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet it is quite simple&mdash;although I&rsquo;ve spent a day
  over it!&rdquo; returned the old millionaire, with a wry smile. &ldquo;I
  have known you from a child. Nothing has ever occurred to shake my confidence
  in you. The person who wrote that letter was obviously acquainted with my
  past friendship for your father and my long knowledge of yourself, and, with
  nothing to back it up, he would be a madman indeed who would expect a scurrilous
  missive such as that to have any weight with me. Am I right&mdash;or wrong,
  Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well; yes, sir&mdash;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Billy Kane
  answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure I am,&rdquo; declared the old gentleman decisively. &ldquo;Quite
  sure of it! But suppose, Billy, that to-morrow, or at any time <i>subsequent</i> to
  my having received that letter, something <i>did</i> occur here&mdash;what
  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old millionaire&rsquo;s face was grave. Billy Kane leaned sharply forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he questioned in a startled tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down there at the desk, Billy, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said
  David Ellsworth; and then, as Billy Kane obeyed, he stepped swiftly across
  the room, opened the hall door, looked out, closed the door softly again,
  and from there walked to one of the two doors at the lower end of the room,
  opened this, looked into the room beyond, and closed it again.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane watched the other in frank amazement. The door that David Ellsworth
  had just opened was the door of the &ldquo;office&rdquo;&mdash;the room that
  during working hours, which were from ten to five, was occupied by the stenographer.
  True, the room opened on the back hallway and had a separate entrance from
  the courtyard in the rear, an entrance always used by the stenographer, but
  it was always locked by Peters, the butler, at night, and he, Billy Kane,
  had the only other key.</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth returned, and halted before Billy Kane&rsquo;s chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I am not in my second childhood, Billy,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;That
  letter was certainly not written without a purpose; and yet from every angle
  that I have been able to view it, except one, it would have been exactly
  that&mdash;without purpose. I believe it is the first step in a carefully
  laid plan that will divert, or fix, suspicion upon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head in perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A plan?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth&rsquo;s only reply was to jerk his head significantly toward
  the other of the two doors at the end of the room.</p>
  <p>Mechanically Billy Kane followed the direction of the gesture with his eyes;
  and then he was on his feet, his face suddenly grim and set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he murmured under his breath. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said David Ellsworth evenly. &ldquo;Why not? I couldn&rsquo;t
  tell you myself exactly how much those stones in there are worth, but they
  are ranked as one of the most valuable single collections of rubies in existence,
  and certainly the figures would run somewhere between two and three hundred
  thousand dollars. Besides, there&rsquo;s always a little cash there&mdash;you
  know better than I do precisely how much at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fourteen thousand five hundred odd,&rdquo; Billy Kane answered automatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; nodded the old millionaire. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
  worth it, isn&rsquo;t it, Billy? I&rsquo;ve never been afraid of any ordinary
  cracksman&rsquo;s attempt against that vault; but, if I am right now, this
  wouldn&rsquo;t be any ordinary attempt. I believe we are dealing with&mdash;<i>brains</i>.
  I believe, further, that instead of you and I being the only ones who know
  the combinations, as we have imagined, they are known to someone else. Suppose,
  then, that the vault is found empty some morning? I immediately recall to
  mind that letter. I remember that you are the only one to whom I have confided
  the combinations. And suppose that some additional clue pointing to you is
  left on the scene of the robbery? It would look pretty black for you, Billy,
  would it not? Naturally the stolen stones and money would not be found in
  your possession; but the plain, logical supposition would be that, not being
  a fool, and believing that you were above suspicion, you had secreted the
  proceeds of the robbery, and were pursuing what you considered the safest
  course&mdash;that is, to brazen it out and indignantly proclaim your innocence.
  The object of all this, of course, being immunity for the real authors of
  the crime, for if you were accused and convicted it is obvious that the police
  would look no further and consider the case closed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not reply for a moment. He had been startled at first, but
  now he was conscious rather of a slight sense of inward amusement. The old
  millionaire&rsquo;s deductions were, of course, plausible and possible; but,
  also, they appeared to be a little labored, a little far-fetched, a little
  visionary. Apart from being based on a premise that entailed somewhat elaborate
  preparations, there was one very weak point in the old gentleman&rsquo;s
  argument. The combinations being known only to the two of them, David Ellsworth
  had failed to explain how, or where the combinations had been obtained by
  a third party; and Billy Kane was even more than ever confirmed in his mind
  that there was a very much simpler, and a very much more creditable motive
  for that letter&mdash;spite. Through his efforts there was more than one
  none too reputable a character who otherwise would have partaken liberally
  of the old philanthropist&rsquo;s bounty; and that was probably the secret
  of the letter. That the day&rsquo;s cogitations of David Ellsworth had resulted
  in the discovery of a mare&rsquo;s nest was the way it struck Billy Kane
  now; but if the old gentleman found satisfaction in his deductions, he, Billy
  Kane, was of no mind to dispute them. There was nothing to be gained by it,
  and on occasions he had known even David Ellsworth to grow stubborn and most
  unpleasantly irascible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may be right, sir,&rdquo; Billy Kane said deliberately.</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth&rsquo;s two hands fell on Billy Kane&rsquo;s shoulders,
  and pressed him back into his chair again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you think I may be right, do you?&rdquo; There was a twinkle in
  the blue eyes. &ldquo;Tut, tut! You can&rsquo;t fool the old man, Billy,
  my boy! What you really think is that I&rsquo;ve got a brain storm. But&rdquo;&mdash;his
  voice grew suddenly grave and agitated&mdash;&ldquo;I <i>know</i> I&rsquo;m
  right, Billy&mdash;I <i>feel</i> it. I&rsquo;m as sure now, as though it
  had already happened. But we&rsquo;ll beat them, my boy! Take your pen, and
  a blank card&mdash;there are some in the top drawer there. Being forewarned,
  all that&rsquo;s necessary is to change the combinations. And I guess that
  will be an answer to their letter that they didn&rsquo;t expect!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth was already across the room. Billy Kane took a small blank
  card from the drawer of the desk, picked up a pen, and, without comment,
  turned in his chair to watch the other. After all, little as he shared the
  old millionaire&rsquo;s alarm, the changing of the vault&rsquo;s combination
  was a precaution well worth while under any circumstances. If it even became
  a habit, so much the better!</p>
  <p>The porti&egrave;res were swung back now, the innocent looking door that
  matched the others in the room was opened, and the nickel-plated knobs and
  dials of the massive steel inner door glistened in the light. Came a faint
  musical tinkle, as the dial whirred under David Ellsworth&rsquo;s fingers;
  then, presently, a soft metallic thud, as the old millionaire swung the handle
  over and the bolts shot back. The heavy door moved slightly inward, there
  was the click of an electric-light switch, the vault was flooded with light,
  and from where he sat Billy Kane could see into the interior. It was as large
  as a small sized room, and built of the finest steel throughout. Steel shelves
  piled with document cases lined the vault, and at the far end was a huge
  safe of the most modern and perfected design. Billy Kane smiled a little
  to himself. In one thing, at least, that David Ellsworth had said, the old
  millionaire had indubitably been justified. The vault was as impregnable
  as human ingenuity and skill could make it, and there was very little indeed
  to be feared from any ordinary attempt upon it.</p>
  <p>A few minutes passed while David Ellsworth worked with the key used for
  changing the combination and with the mechanism on the inner side of the
  door, and then he began to call out a series of numbers. Billy Kane jotted
  them down on the card.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll test it now&mdash;call them back,&rdquo; said David Ellsworth;
  and then, as Billy Kane obeyed: &ldquo;All right, Billy. Now we&rsquo;ll
  do the same thing with the safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He moved down to the end of the vault, spent a moment or two over the safe&rsquo;s
  dial; and, as this door in turn was swung open, Billy Kane caught a glimpse
  of the tiers of plush-lined trays that held the famous ruby collection, and
  of the score of packages of banknotes that lay neatly piled in the compartments
  inside the safe.</p>
  <p>Again David Ellsworth called out a series of numbers, and as before tested
  the new combination; and then, from beside the open door of the safe, he
  spoke abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before I lock up again, Billy, what about our friend Laverto? You
  went down there this afternoon, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Billy Kane answered&mdash;and frowned. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
  no hurry about it, is there? I&rsquo;m bound to confess that his story seems
  to be straight enough, and that I can&rsquo;t find anything wrong, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth chuckled suddenly, as he reached inside the safe and took
  out a package of banknotes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been laughing at me up your sleeve for fussing around
  with those combinations, my boy&mdash;I know you have. But you&rsquo;re the
  old woman of the two, Billy. If you couldn&rsquo;t find anything wrong, I
  guess everything is all right. If it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;he chuckled
  again, as he closed and locked the safe&mdash;&ldquo;it would do my heart
  good to see someone put something over on you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The light in the vault went out. The vault door was closed and locked, the
  outer door shut, the porti&egrave;res drawn back into place, and David Ellsworth,
  coming back across the room, dropped the package of banknotes on the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;em to him, Billy,&rdquo; he smiled; &ldquo;and take &rsquo;em
  to him now. He&rsquo;ll have twelve hours more joy out of life than if you
  waited until to-morrow morning.&rdquo; He picked up the card upon which Billy
  Kane had written the combinations, and placed it in his pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got a better memory than I have, Billy,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;and I
  guess you&rsquo;ve got this down pat now; but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll
  have to study the memo over a few times before I take a chance on destroying
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was paying little attention to the other&rsquo;s words; he was
  riffling the banknotes through his fingers&mdash;they were of all denominations,
  from hundred-dollar bills down to fives. It was, in fact, a package of loose
  bills that he remembered having counted that morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know how much there is here, Mr. Ellsworth?&rdquo; he
  inquired abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not precisely&rdquo;&mdash;David Ellsworth peered over the rims of
  his glasses at the package&mdash;&ldquo;but I should say around a couple
  of thousand dollars. I&mdash;er&mdash;promised him that, if he turned out
  to be deserving, and I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are two thousand dollars here exactly,&rdquo; said Billy Kane
  a little curtly. &ldquo;What I understood that you promised him was that
  you would start him up in life again, but it doesn&rsquo;t require two thousand
  dollars to start a man of his type going as a photographer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Don&rsquo;t you think so, Billy?&rdquo; David Ellsworth&rsquo;s
  blue eyes were twinkling, and he was drawling his words. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
  see! Now, first of all, judging from the photographic landscape he showed
  me, the man&rsquo;s a real artist, and he ought to have the best of tools
  to work with. A good lens is a rather expensive commodity. I&rsquo;m not
  much up on photographic apparatus, but I&rsquo;ll bet you could pay as high
  as a thousand dollars for one outfit. And then there&rsquo;s all the paraphernalia,
  and a little place to furnish, and a little something to keep things going
  until returns come in. Two thousand dollars&mdash;shucks, my boy! Indeed
  as a matter of fact, now that you call my attention to it and I come to think
  it over, Billy, I&rsquo;m not sure that two thousand dollars is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane laughed, and picked up the money, and went to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, sir, I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;at once,&rdquo; he said, laughing
  again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Crime</h2>
  <p>Upstairs in his room Billy Kane changed from his dinner clothes into a dark
  tweed suit, a very less noticeable attire for that neighborhood where Antonio
  Laverto had his miserable home, and choosing a slouch hat, left the house.
  A bus took him down Fifth Avenue to Washington Square, and from there, crossing
  over Broadway, he continued on down the Bowery.</p>
  <p>It was still early; and it was as though the night world here had not yet
  awakened from its day&rsquo;s slumber. The &ldquo;gape wagons&rdquo; had
  not yet begun to bring their slumming parties to rub shoulders with the flotsam
  and jetsam of the underworld, and to shudder in pharisaical horror at &ldquo;planted&rdquo; fakes;
  true, the ubiquitous gasoline lamps glowed in useless yellow spots against
  the entirely adequate street lighting in front of many shops of all descriptions,
  and the pavements were alive with men, women and children of every conceivable
  nationality and station in life, but&mdash;Billy Kane smiled a little grimly,
  for he had learned a great deal, a very great deal in the last three months,
  about this section of his city&mdash;it was still early, and it was not yet
  the Bowery of the night.</p>
  <p>Some half dozen blocks along, Billy Kane turned into a cross street and
  headed deeper into the East Side.</p>
  <p>And now Billy Kane&rsquo;s forehead drew together in puckered furrows, as
  he approached the lodging of Antonio Laverto, the cripple. In the inside
  pocket of his vest were two thousand dollars in cash, for the outlay of which,
  in spite of the old millionaire&rsquo;s attitude in reference to it, he,
  Billy Kane, held himself morally responsible. The frown deepened. It was
  strange, very strange! He had logically convinced himself that Laverto&rsquo;s
  was a worthy case&mdash;but the intuition that something was wrong would
  not down, and the nearer he approached the miserable and squalid dwelling
  in which the Italian lived, the stronger that intuition grew.</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane shrugged his shoulders. He could at least put the case
  to one more test, and if Laverto came through that all right that was the
  end of it, and the man got the money. Laverto would certainly not anticipate
  another visit this evening, so soon after the one of the afternoon; and if
  he could come unawares upon the man, and observe the other unawares perhaps,
  the chances were decidedly in favor of Laverto being caught napping if he
  were sailing under false colors.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, reaching his destination, paused in front of a tumble-down and
  dilapidated frame house, and glanced around him. The little side street here
  was dirty and ill-lighted, but populous enough. Small shops, many of them
  basement shops with cavernous, cellar-like entrances opening from the sidewalk,
  lined both sides of the street; for the rest, it was simply a matter of two
  rows of flanking, dingy tenements and old houses&mdash;save for the usual
  saloon, whose window lights were bright enough on the corner ahead.</p>
  <p>The house door was wide open, and Billy Kane, pulling his slouch hat down
  over his eyes, stepped into the dark unlighted interior. The place was a
  hive of poverty, a miserable lodging house of the cheapest class; and the
  air was close, almost fetid, and redolent with the smell of garlic. How many
  humans eked out an existence here Billy Kane did not know; but, though he
  knew them to be woefully many, for he had seen a great number of them on
  his visit here that afternoon, the only evidence of occupancy now was the
  occasional petulant cry of a child from somewhere in the darkness, and a
  constant murmuring hum of voices from behind closed doors.</p>
  <p>Antonio Laverto&rsquo;s room was the second one on the right of the passage.
  Billy Kane moved quietly forward to the door, and stood there in the blackness
  for a moment listening. There was no sound from within; nor was there any
  light seeping through the keyhole or the door panels, which later, he remembered,
  were badly cracked. Satisfied that the cripple, unless he were asleep, was
  not inside, Billy Kane tried the door, and, finding it unlocked, opened it
  silently, and stepped into the room.</p>
  <p>He lighted a match, held it above his head, and glanced around him. It was
  a pitiful abode, pitiful enough to excite anyone&rsquo;s sympathy&mdash;as
  it had his own that afternoon. There was a cot in one corner with a thin,
  torn blanket for covering, a rickety chair, and an old deal table on which
  stood a cracked pitcher and wash basin, and the remains of a small loaf of
  bread.</p>
  <p>The match went out, and Billy Kane retreated to the door, and from the door,
  to the street again. It was pretty bad in there, and evidently just as genuinely
  on the ragged edge of existence as it had been that afternoon&mdash;but still
  the persistent doubt in his mind would not down. It was a sort of dog in
  the manger feeling, and he did not like it, and it irritated him&mdash;but
  it clung tenaciously.</p>
  <p>He lighted a cigarette, and, frowning, flipped the match stub away from
  him. In any case, he had to find the man before he went home, whether it
  resulted in his paying over the two thousand dollars or not. His eye caught
  the lighted window of the saloon, and he started abruptly forward in that
  direction. If there was anything at all in his suspicions, the saloon was
  the most likely place in the neighborhood where they would be verified; but
  in any event, the barkeeper, who probably knew everyone in the locality better
  than anyone else, could possibly supply at least a suggestion as to where
  the Italian spent his evenings and might be found.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane chose the side entrance to the saloon&mdash;it would probably
  afford him a preliminary inspection of the place without being observed himself&mdash;and
  entered. He found himself in a passageway that was meagerly lighted by a
  gas jet, and that turned sharply at right angles a few steps ahead. He reached
  the turn in the passage, and halted suddenly, as a voice, curiously muffled,
  reached him. The passage here ahead of him, some four or five yards in length,
  was lighted by another gas jet, and terminated in swinging doors leading
  to the barroom; but halfway down its length, in a little recess, most thoughtfully
  situated for the privacy and convenience of the saloon&rsquo;s perhaps none
  too reputable clientele, was a telephone booth.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew back, and protected from view by the angle of the passage
  while he could still see the telephone booth himself quite plainly, stood
  motionless. The booth, like a good many others, was by no means sound-proof,
  and the voice, though muffled seemed strangely familiar to him. Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  brows drew together sharply. Through the glass panel of the upper portion
  of the booth he could see the figure of a man of about his own height, and
  he could see, as the man stood a little sideways with his lips to the transmitter,
  the man&rsquo;s profile.</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane, with a grim smile, reached suddenly up to the gas jet
  over his head and turned it out. This left him in darkness and made no appreciable
  diminution in the lighting of the passage leading to the barroom. The man
  who stood upright in the booth at full height, and who was speaking most
  excellent English, was Antonio Laverto, the maimed and broken cripple whose
  pitiful and heart-rending story had been so laboriously told in the few halting
  and hardly understandable words at his command!</p>
  <p>And now, Billy Kane, listening, could make out snatches of what the man
  was saying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&hellip; That&rsquo;s none of your business, and I guess the less
  you know about it the better for yourself&hellip;. What?&hellip; Yes, Marco&rsquo;s&mdash;the
  second-hand clothes dealer&hellip;. What?&hellip; Yes, sure&mdash;by the
  lane&hellip;. The back door&rsquo;s got a broken lock&mdash;it&rsquo;s never
  been fixed since he moved in two weeks ago. All you got to do is walk in.
  It&rsquo;s a cinch&hellip;. Sure, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
  you got to do. Marco don&rsquo;t keep open in the evening and besides he&rsquo;s
  away, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that&hellip;. Eh?&hellip; No, there
  won&rsquo;t be no come-back&hellip;. You pull the break the way I tell you,
  and you get a hundred dollars in the morning&hellip;. What?&hellip; All right
  then, but don&rsquo;t make any mistake. You got to be out of there before
  a quarter of eleven! Get me? Before a quarter of eleven&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  all I care, and that&rsquo;s give you all the time you want&hellip;. Eh?&hellip; Yes&mdash;sure&hellip;.
  Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The grim smile was still on Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips, as he crouched back
  against the wall. The door of the telephone booth opened, and Laverto stuck
  his head out furtively. The little black eyes, staring out of the thin, swarthy
  face, glanced up and down the passageway, and then the head seemed to shrink
  into the shoulders, the body to collapse, and, with legs twisted and dragging
  under him, there came the <i>flop-flop</i> of the palms of the man&rsquo;s
  hands on the bare wooden flooring, as he started along the passageway.</p>
  <p>But Billy Kane was already at the side door of the saloon&mdash;and an instant
  later he had swung around the street corner, and was heading briskly back
  in the direction of the Bowery. He laughed shortly, as his hand automatically
  crept into his inside pocket. The two thousand dollars were still there&mdash;and
  they would stay there! His intuition, after all, had not been at fault. The
  man was a vicious and damnable fraud, and, as a logical corollary to that
  fact, was moreover a dangerous and clever criminal. What was this &ldquo;break&rdquo; that
  was to be &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; at Marco&rsquo;s before a quarter of eleven?</p>
  <p>Quite mechanically Billy Kane looked at his watch. He and David Ellsworth
  had dined early, and it was even now barely eight o&rsquo;clock. Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  face hardened, as he walked along, reached the Bowery, and, by the same route
  he had come, gained Washington Square, and swung onto a Fifth Avenue bus.
  Why Marco&rsquo;s? There was surely nothing worth while there! Marco&rsquo;s
  was little more than a rag shop. He happened to know Marco, because on the
  corner next to the tumble-down place that, as Laverto had said, Marco had
  rented a week or so ago, there was a small notion shop kept by an old Irish
  widow by the name of Clancy, where, more than once on his visits to the East
  Side, he had dropped in to buy a paper or a package of cigarettes. Why Marco&rsquo;s?
  It puzzled him. The old white-bearded, stoop-shouldered dealer did not seem
  to have much that was worth stealing!</p>
  <p>The bus jolted on up the Avenue. Billy Kane shifted his position uneasily
  on the somewhat uncomfortably hard seat on the top of the bus. His first
  impulse had been to confront Laverto on the spot, but quick on the heels
  of that impulse had come a better plan. With rope enough the man would hang
  himself. If there was anything in this Marco affair, a robbery as was indicated,
  Marco would obviously report it to the police as soon as it was discovered,
  and he, Billy Kane, being in possession of the evidence that would convict
  its author, would then be in a position to put an end, for a good many years
  at least, to Laverto&rsquo;s criminal career; and besides this, there was
  David Ellsworth&mdash;he did not want to wound or hurt the other&rsquo;s
  finer sensibilities, but that David Ellsworth should see Laverto for himself
  in the latter&rsquo;s true colors was essential, for it would and must make
  the old philanthropist in the future less the victim of that over-generous
  and spontaneous sympathy which was so easily excited by those who preyed
  upon him.</p>
  <p>The thought of David Ellsworth brought back again the thought of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s
  anonymous letter. Billy Kane lighted a cigarette, and smoked it savagely.
  It was someone of the same breed as Antonio Laverto, and for the same reason
  that Laverto would soon have for revenge, who had written that letter. He
  was quite sure of that in his own mind. What else, indeed, could it be? Not
  David Ellsworth&rsquo;s explanation! That was entirely too chimerical! One
  by one he reviewed the cases where he had uncovered fraudulent attempts upon
  the old millionaire&rsquo;s charity during the past three months; but, while
  more than one was concerned with characters vicious, dissolute and criminal
  enough, not one seemed to dovetail into the niche in which he sought to fit
  it.</p>
  <p>A second cigarette followed the first, and his mind was still busy with
  his problem, as he pressed the button at the side of his seat, clambered
  down the circular iron ladder at the rear of the bus, stepped to the sidewalk
  as the bus drew up to the curb, and stood waiting for the bus to pass on&mdash;David
  Ellsworth&rsquo;s residence was on the first corner down the cross street
  on the other side of the Avenue. The bus creaked protestingly into motion,
  and Billy Kane, in the act of stepping from the curb to cross the Avenue,
  paused suddenly, instead, as a voice spoke behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, Mr. Kane, sir, may I speak to you for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane turned around abruptly. He stared at the other in surprise. It
  was Jackson, the footman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why yes, of course. But what on earth are you doing out here, Jackson?&rdquo; he
  demanded a little sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was waiting for you, sir,&rdquo; the man answered hurriedly. &ldquo;I
  knew you&rsquo;d gone out, Mr. Kane; and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t miss you
  here, sir, when you came back, as you always come by the Avenue, sir. And,
  begging your pardon again, sir, would you mind if we didn&rsquo;t stand here?
  You wouldn&rsquo;t take offense, sir, if we went in by the garage driveway
  where we could be alone for a minute, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane eyed the man critically. Jackson, immaculate in his livery, appeared
  to be quite himself; but Jackson at times had been known to possess a greater
  fondness for a bottle than was good for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Jackson?&rdquo; he demanded still more sharply. &ldquo;Did
  Mr. Ellsworth send you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir; he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the man answered nervously. &ldquo;But,
  if you please, Mr. Kane, sir, that is, if you don&rsquo;t mind, sir, I&rsquo;d
  rather wait until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Jackson!&rdquo; Billy Kane interrupted curtly. &ldquo;I
  suppose you have a reason for your rather strange request. Come along, then,
  and I&rsquo;ll listen to what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the man earnestly.</p>
  <p>They crossed the Avenue, passed down the cross street, turned the corner,
  and a moment later, entering by the garage driveway, gained the courtyard
  in the rear of the house. It was dark here, there were no lights showing
  from the back of the house itself or from the garage; and here, close to
  the private entrance to the &ldquo;office&rdquo; and library, Billy Kane
  halted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jackson, what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; he inquired brusquely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you please, Mr. Kane, sir&rdquo;&mdash;the man&rsquo;s voice had
  taken on a curious, quavering note&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak so loud.
  We&mdash;you&mdash;you might be heard, sir, from the servants&rsquo; entrance
  over there. I&mdash;Mr. Kane, sir&mdash;Mr. Ellsworth has been murdered,
  and the money, sir, and the rubies are gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was conscious only that he had reached out and grasped the footman&rsquo;s
  arm. They were very black, the shadows of the house, and it was dark about
  him, but strange quick little red flashes seemed to dance and dart and shoot
  before his eyes; and in his brain the man&rsquo;s words kept repeating themselves
  over and over in an insistent sort of way, and the words seemed meaningless
  except that they were pregnant with an overwhelming and numbing horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, sir, let go my arm&mdash;you&rsquo;re breaking
  it!&rdquo; moaned the footman in a whisper.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s voice seemed to clear Billy Kane&rsquo;s brain. David Ellsworth&mdash;murdered!
  The horror was still there, but now there came a fury beyond control, and
  a bitter grief that racked him to the soul. David Ellsworth, his second father,
  the gentlest man and the kindest he had ever known&mdash;<i>murdered</i>!
  His hand dropped to his side, and, turning, he sprang up the few steps to
  the entrance just in front of him. He whipped out his key, opened the door,
  and stepped forward into the passageway. At his right was the door to the
  stenographer&rsquo;s room, and beyond, opening from that room, was the door
  to the library. He felt for the door handle, for there was no light in the
  passage, and, finding it, opened the door&mdash;and stood there rigid and
  motionless like a man turned to stone. Across the blackness of the intervening
  room the library door was partially open, and sprawled upon the floor lay
  the figure of a white-haired man, only the hair was blotched with a great
  crimson stain&mdash;and it was David Ellsworth. And something came choking
  into Billy Kane&rsquo;s throat, and a blinding mist before his eyes shut
  out the sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t go in there, sir!&rdquo; Jackson
  was beside him again, whispering in his ear, and pulling the door softly
  shut. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sir&mdash;don&rsquo;t go&mdash;they&rsquo;ll get
  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get&mdash;<i>me</i>! What do you mean?&rdquo; Billy Kane whirled
  on the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the love of God, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Jackson, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  speak so loud! I&rsquo;m risking my neck for you, as it is, sir. There&rsquo;s
  a couple of plain-clothesmen waiting up in your room, sir, hiding there,
  and there&rsquo;s another two hiding in the front hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad, Jackson!&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s voice was low enough
  now in its blank amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, sir,&rdquo; Jackson whispered tensely. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
  got you dead to rights, sir. There ain&rsquo;t a chance, except to run for
  it&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do, sir, if I were you, Mr. Kane.
  I didn&rsquo;t mean you to enter the house at all, but you acted so quick
  I couldn&rsquo;t stop you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s two hands fell in an iron grip on the other&rsquo;s shoulders,
  and in the darkness he bent his head forward to stare into the man&rsquo;s
  face and eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean, Jackson,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;that <i>you</i> believe
  I did that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man wriggled himself free from Billy Kane&rsquo;s grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to say sir,&rdquo; he answered uneasily. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
  can only tell you what they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, then!&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s voice, low as it was, was
  deadly in its even, monotonous tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Jackson. &ldquo;Keep your ear close to my lips,
  sir If anyone hears us, it&rsquo;s all up. They found him, Mr. Ellsworth,
  sir, lying there dead in the library with his head split open, about half
  an hour after you went out, sir. You were with him in the library after dinner
  alone, sir; and no one was with him after that, and&mdash;don&rsquo;t grip
  me again like that, sir, or I can&rsquo;t go on. You don&rsquo;t know your
  own strength, sir, Mr. Kane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Jackson!&rdquo; breathed Billy Kane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!
  Go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; thank you, sir. It was Peters, the butler, sir, who found
  the body, and he sent for the police. Mrs. Ellsworth doesn&rsquo;t know anything
  about it yet, sir. They&rsquo;re afraid to tell her, she&rsquo;s so delicate
  and sick, sir. It was about half an hour after you went out, sir, as I said,
  that Peters went to see Mr. Ellsworth about something, and found him there
  like you just saw, sir. And then the police came, sir, and they figured that
  you did it before you went out, and that you went out to dispose of the money
  and jewels, sir, in some safe place, and maybe also as a sort of alibi like,
  so that they&rsquo;d think it was done while you were away, sir, and that
  when you returned, if you did return, sir, you would profess horror and surprise,
  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad, Jackson!&rdquo; Billy Kane said again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see, sir&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got you dead
  to rights. Both the vault and safe doors were open, and the money and rubies
  gone, and on the floor of the vault, way in by the wall under the lower shelf,
  like it had fluttered in there without you noticing it, sir, was a card with
  the combinations on it, and it was in your handwriting, Mr. Kane, sir. And
  in Mr. Ellsworth&rsquo;s hand, clutched there tight, sir, was a little piece
  of black silk cord, and on the floor, under the table, sir, where it must
  have rolled without you knowing it, sir, was a black button.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, a little numbly
  now. There had been something grotesquely absurd, something in the nature
  of a ghastly, hideous and ill-timed joke, something that was literally the
  phantasm of a diseased brain in the murmur of this man&rsquo;s voice whispering
  out of the darkness; but there was creeping upon him now a prescience as
  of some deadly and remorseless thing that was closing down, around and upon
  him with inexorable and crushing force. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he
  said again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s low, guarded voice went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  not for me to say, sir. You&rsquo;ll remember, Mr. Kane, that you were wearing
  a dinner jacket, and that before going out you went up to your room and changed.
  I suppose it was excitement, sir, and you never noticed it, and it&rsquo;s
  not to be wondered at under the circumstances, sir. The button had been pulled
  off the jacket, sir, and had taken the black silk loop with it. And the button
  had rolled under the library-table, Mr. Kane, sir, and the loop was clutched
  in Mr. Ellsworth&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane said no word. There was a strange whirling in his brain. Some
  insidious and abhorrent thing was obsessing his consciousness, but in some
  way it was not fully born yet, nor concrete, nor tangible. He raised his
  hand and brushed it across his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not all, Mr. Kane, sir.&rdquo; The whispering voice
  was coming out of the darkness again, and it seemed curiously fraught with
  implacability, as though, not content with its unendurable torture, it must
  torment the more. &ldquo;They found a letter in the pocket of your dinner
  jacket, Mr. Kane. It was a letter addressed to Mr. Ellsworth, which the police
  figure you must have intercepted so that he wouldn&rsquo;t see it, you being
  the one who opens the mail, sir. It was a letter warning him to look out
  for you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And now it had come like a flash, the clearing of Billy Kane&rsquo;s brain,
  and now it was brutally clear, clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding;
  and, as a man walking in a fog that had suddenly lifted, he found himself
  reeling, in the full consciousness of its horror, on the brink of a yawning
  chasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried heavily. &ldquo;This is damnable! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep quiet, sir!&rdquo; implored Jackson frantically. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
  hear you! If you care anything about a chance for your life, don&rsquo;t
  make a sound. The police figured that you would do one of three things, sir.
  They figured that after you had hidden the loot somewhere, you would walk
  back here as though nothing had happened, and pretend innocence, not knowing
  about that button and the cord, sir; and so there&rsquo;s a couple of them
  waiting for you in the front hall, sir. Or they thought that you might discover
  you had lost the card with the combinations written on it and remember the
  letter in your dinner-jacket pocket, sir, and try to get back unobserved,
  just as you&rsquo;ve come in now, sir, and hoping that the murder hadn&rsquo;t
  been discovered in the meantime, try to recover the card and the letter before
  you played any other game; and they meant to let you, sir, only, as I told
  you, there&rsquo;s a couple more hiding up in your room, and you couldn&rsquo;t
  step into the library without the fellows in front seeing you. Or they thought
  you might just simply make a break for it, make your getaway, sir, and never
  come back at all; and so there&rsquo;s an alarm out, and your description,
  sir, in every precinct in the city, and all the railway stations are being
  watched. But that&rsquo;s your only chance, sir, to run for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was silent here in the great house, ominously, strangely silent; and
  the silence grew heavy, and grew <i>loud</i> with great palpitating throbs
  that hammered at the ear drums&mdash;and then, in the distance, from the
  other side of the door in the long passage leading to the front of the house,
  faint but nevertheless distinct, there came the sound of an approaching footstep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone coming!&rdquo; whispered Jackson wildly. &ldquo;Run
  for it, sir&mdash;while you&rsquo;ve got the chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips were thinned into a hard, straight line. Run for
  it! He had never run from anything in all his life! And now his brain was
  working in a sort of lightning debate, battling it out&mdash;logic that bade
  him go, against that finer sense that bids a brave man drop where he stands
  rather than turn his back.</p>
  <p>Still nearer came that footstep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; prompted Jackson again. &ldquo;In another minute it will
  be too late!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hands were clenched until the nails bit into the flesh.
  David Ellsworth had been right. That letter was but part of a deliberate
  plot; and the plot had been framed with hellish ingenuity, not only to secure
  the fortune in the vault, but, safeguarding its authors, to fix irrevocably
  the guilt upon someone else, upon <i>him</i>, Billy Kane. Not a loophole
  for escape had been left, every detail had been worked out with a devil&rsquo;s
  craft; the evidence was damning, incontrovertible, and if, in spite of all,
  there might still have lingered a doubt in any jury&rsquo;s mind, he, Billy
  Kane, by an ironic trick of fate had&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run, I tell you!&rdquo; came Jackson&rsquo;s voice again. &ldquo;Run,
  or&mdash;&rdquo; And then Jackson&rsquo;s voice lost its deference, and his
  whisper was like the snarl of a savage beast&mdash;the door along the passage
  was opening. &ldquo;You damn fool! I gave you your chance, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
  take it&mdash;now take this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane reeled suddenly back from the impact, as the man sprang viciously
  upon him&mdash;and for a moment again his brain groped blindly in confusion,
  even as he fought.</p>
  <p>Jackson was yelling wildly at the top of his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help! Here he is! Quick! Help! I&rsquo;ve caught him!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Into The Underworld</h2>
  <p>It had been dark before the opening of the door had thrown a dim glow along
  the rear of the passage, and Jackson, in his onslaught, had missed what was
  evidently intended for a throathold, and his hands, slipping down, had caught
  at and bunched the shoulders of Billy Kane&rsquo;s coat. But now Billy Kane
  was in action. His arms, straightened, shot back behind him&mdash;and the
  coat alone was in Jackson&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>With an oath, the man dropped the coat to the floor, and wrenched a revolver
  from his pocket. But there was light enough to see now&mdash;to see the murder
  in the other&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;and to see something there as well that brought
  a surging fury whipping through Billy Kane&rsquo;s veins.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You devil! I understand it now!&rdquo; he gritted, as he snatched
  and gripped at the other&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
  <p>Jackson was twisting, squirming, fighting like a maniac.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;Help! Here he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cries and shouts answered the man. There came the sound of racing feet.
  Then a blinding flash&mdash;a wild scream. And Jackson, the revolver going
  off in his hands as they struggled, sagged limply, and, with the revolver
  clattering against the wall, slid to the floor&mdash;and Billy Kane, with
  a bound, was through the back door, and leaping down the steps to the courtyard.</p>
  <p>There was no question in his mind now as to whether he should run for it,
  or not. Jackson was one of the murderers &hellip; there must &hellip; be
  others&hellip;. Jackson could hardly have staged it all alone &hellip; but
  to remain there and be caught was but to play into their hands! His brain
  was working in flashes swift beyond any measure of time. If there could still
  have remained a lingering doubt favorable to him in any jury&rsquo;s mind,
  fate had played him an ironic trick that would dispel any such doubt instantly. <i>He
  had two thousand dollars of the money from that vault in his vest pocket
  at that moment!</i> And to be caught there, having presumably gained entrance
  stealthily by the rear door, would condemn him out of hand. To run, too,
  was to condemn him, that was their hell&rsquo;s snare that they had laid
  for him &hellip; but there was a chance this way! A rage that was merciless
  was upon him now. There was a chance this way &hellip; one chance &hellip; the
  only chance, not alone of saving his own life and clearing his own name,
  but of bringing to justice the inhuman fiends who had taken David Ellsworth&rsquo;s
  life &hellip; there was a chance &hellip; one chance &hellip; this way &hellip; that
  someone would pay &hellip; if he, Billy Kane, lived, that someone <i>would</i> pay!</p>
  <p>There came a short, curt shout from behind him, an imperative order to halt.
  He had gained the courtyard now, and was running along the garage driveway,
  heading for the street. He glanced back over his shoulder. In the darkness
  he could just make out a number of shadowy forms rushing down the steps.</p>
  <p>The order came again. Then the tongue-flame of a revolver split through
  the black. And as though a red hot iron had been laid suddenly across his
  left shoulder, Billy Kane gritted his teeth together in pain&mdash;and stumbled&mdash;and
  recovered himself&mdash;and plunged out through the driveway gates to the
  street.</p>
  <p>Halfway down the block, he remembered, was an alleyway; and, running like
  a deer now, Billy Kane again glanced behind him. Forms, a great many of them,
  though perhaps his fancy exaggerated the number, were pouring out into the
  street in pursuit. The men servants had evidently joined forces with the
  detectives; and yelling hoarsely, a pack of human hounds in cry, with the
  blood-scent in their nostrils, were some twenty-five to thirty yards behind.</p>
  <p>How curiously warm his shoulder was! He clapped his right hand upon it,
  and drew his hand away, red and dripping wet. He began to feel strangely
  giddy. The shots were coming now in a fusillade&mdash;but they missed him.
  He was even gaining a little, and if it were not for that queer giddiness,
  that sense of nausea that seemed to be creeping steadily upon him, he could
  have outdistanced them all, and laughed at them&mdash;except that the entire
  district would soon be aroused, and speed and lightness of foot would therefore
  ultimately avail him little.</p>
  <p>He laughed out harshly in grim, mirthless facetiousness. Logically then,
  it made small difference whether he had been hit, or not! It was his head,
  and not his feet, that must be depended upon to save him! If he could only
  get out of the immediate neighborhood &hellip; yes, that was it &hellip; and
  his head must find the way &hellip; only, and he was not very logical after
  all, his head seemed possessed with that sick, swimming, impotent sensation.</p>
  <p>He reeled again. Then his teeth clamped hard, and the sheer nerve of the
  man asserted itself, and fought back the purely physical weakness. There
  was a way, at least a chance, perhaps a desperate chance, but still a chance&mdash;if
  the alleyway, that was just ahead now, was dark enough, and if&mdash;</p>
  <p>A yell, chorused wildly, went up from behind him, and a bullet struck the
  pavement with an angry <i>spat</i>, as Billy Kane swerved into the alleyway.
  And again he laughed, gasping out the laugh in a sort of desperate relief.
  Yes, the alleyway was black enough, he could not distinguish an object twenty
  yards ahead; and that other &ldquo;if,&rdquo; something that would furnish
  temporary sanctuary, was here, too, at his right&mdash;and five yards in
  from the street, he sprang for the top of a board fence, flung himself over,
  dropped down on the other side, and lay motionless upon the ground.</p>
  <p>It was a matter of seconds&mdash;no more. The pursuers swept into the alleyway,
  and tearing down its length, shouting as they went, rushed by that spot,
  so <i>innocently close</i> to the street, where their quarry lay.</p>
  <p>And now Billy Kane was on his feet again, and cautiously, silently, raised
  himself to the top of the fence once more. He had counted on just this exactly,
  it was simply what was naturally to be expected, and he knew no elation on
  that score. The chance, the one chance he had, still lay ahead of him, and
  was still to be taken&mdash;and to be taken without an instant&rsquo;s loss
  of time before the neighborhood became aroused to the extent of pouring curiously
  out-of-doors. Across the intervening street the alleyway extended in the
  opposite direction, and if he could gain the other side, double on his tracks,
  he would, for the time being at least, be safe.</p>
  <p>The sound of the pursuit came from well down the alleyway now, and the pursuers
  were lost to sight in the blackness. He swung himself over the fence, dropped
  without a sound into the alleyway, and keeping close against the fence, crept
  forward to the edge of the street.</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips moved in a silent prayer of fervent thankfulness
  for that quiet and sedate neighborhood that had not instantly responded to
  the disturbance. It had seemed hours, of course, since that shot had been
  fired at him in the courtyard of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s home, but in reality
  he knew that it could scarcely have been much more than a minute ago. The
  street, to all appearances, was deserted; and Billy Kane, quick now, running
  again, darted out from the lane; and, mindful that if he crossed the street
  in a direct line, he would be in the light, and that any one of those in
  the alleyway behind who might chance to look back would see him, made a slight
  detour, and a moment later gained the alleyway again where it continued on
  from the opposite side of the street.</p>
  <p>He ran on now breathlessly. It had been raining hard that morning, and the
  ground under foot was soft and slippery. He reeled once, and fell&mdash;and
  rose splattered with grime and mud. He laughed again, but his laugh was desperate
  now. It had been bad enough before&mdash;coatless, and with a blood-soaked
  shirt&mdash;but his appearance must be disreputable beyond description now,
  so disreputable that he would attract instant suspicion the moment he were
  seen by anyone, and this quite apart even from the fact that before very
  long the net spread for the &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; of David Ellsworth would
  widen, and every man and woman abroad in that great city to-night would automatically
  become allies of the police in apprehending him.</p>
  <p>He stopped. He was at the end of the alleyway, and it did not seem to extend
  again on the other side of the next street. But he must go on&mdash;somehow.
  He brushed his hand across his eyes. His shoulder pained him, and those dizzy
  flashes kept recurring, though perhaps not now with such great frequency.
  He must go on&mdash;somehow. That was essential. He must put as great an
  immediate distance between himself and the Ellsworth mansion as possible;
  later, if by some means he could get there, if luck broke for him just a
  little, his chances would be better, thanks to those three months of intimacy
  with the underworld, if he could get somewhere into the maze of the East
  Side.</p>
  <p>He peered out into the street, waited for some pedestrians who were near
  at hand to pass further on, and then, moving quickly forward, crouched down
  in the shadows made by the flight of front door steps of the nearest house.</p>
  <p>If he only had a coat! He could walk boldly then along the street without
  the blood showing on his white shirt, and it would cover up enough of the
  mud so that no one would pay any particular attention to him. If he only
  had a coat! He had two thousand dollars in his vest pocket&mdash;but it was
  not worth a coat. Anybody would sell him a coat for two thousand dollars,
  but&mdash; His hands went to his eyes, and then pressed against his throbbing
  temples. Yes, certainly, his brain was verging on delirium! Why should he
  think of Marco&rsquo;s? Yes, yes, he remembered now! Somebody was going to
  break into Marco&rsquo;s to-night &hellip; and Marco was a second-hand clothing
  dealer &hellip; and the back door had its lock broken &hellip; and the way
  was open. He could steal too &hellip; a coat &hellip; at Marco&rsquo;s &hellip; and
  that was the only way he could get a coat &hellip; to steal it &hellip; he
  dared not make any attempt to buy one &hellip; and he must have a coat.</p>
  <p>His brain cleared again, and he smiled a little ironically at himself. But
  the thought of Marco&rsquo;s now stuck persistently. It was possible, of
  course&mdash;if he could get to Marco&rsquo;s! But Marco&rsquo;s was a long
  way off. Marco&rsquo;s was a long way downtown on the East Side. He shook
  his head, smiling ironically again. Yes, he would very much like to be there
  now! That was where he wanted to be&mdash;in the East Side, instead of here!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane peered up and down the street again, and again moved stealthily
  forward. He repeated these tactics over and over, sometimes covering only
  a few yards at a time, sometimes making as much as half a block, and sometimes
  even more when a friendly lane or alleyway offered him the opportunity. And
  at the expiration of half an hour he had covered a distance that surprised
  even himself, for, though still uptown, he had succeeded in getting entirely
  away from the more wealthy neighborhood.</p>
  <p>Another ten minutes passed, and hidden again in the shadows of a porch,
  he was staring now with feverish eagerness at a great, covered motor truck,
  a furniture van, that was drawn up in front of what appeared to be a truck-man&rsquo;s
  office across the street. The driver had gone into the office, but there
  was the street to cross&mdash;and two men were coming leisurely in his direction
  along the sidewalk. He clenched his hands fiercely at his sides. Here was
  the chance flaunting him in the face and tantalizing him, the chance that
  was a far greater chance even than he had dared hope for, and he was powerless
  to avail himself of it unless those two men passed by before the driver came
  out again. He could read the name and address in the huge letters on the
  side of the van. It belonged down on the East Side. This was probably only
  a small uptown branch office, and the odds were a hundred to one that the
  van would be going home now. And if the driver took a direct route he was
  bound to use a cross street that would intersect that lane in the rear of
  Marco&rsquo;s, and intersect it within at least a few blocks of the second-hand
  dealer&rsquo;s shop. Billy Kane&rsquo;s hands clenched tighter, and his face
  was strained and drawn, as from his hiding place he alternately watched the
  van and the two men. Those few blocks through a lane would be nothing! God,
  if he could only reach Marco&rsquo;s&mdash;and a coat! A coat! It seemed
  an absurd thing to be of such moment&mdash;a coat! But it meant life or death.
  A coat would cover his blood-stained shirt, and he would be able to move
  with freedom enough to give him at least a fighting chance, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The two men had passed by; there was no one else in sight. He waited another
  moment until they were still further away&mdash;and then, in a flash, Billy
  Kane was across the road, and had swung himself over the tail-board into
  the van. It seemed like some vast cavernous place here inside, for the van
  was empty, save for what appeared to be, as nearly as he could make out in
  the gloom, some large pieces of crated furniture piled at the front end just
  behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes swept the interior
  anxiously&mdash;and the drawn, strained look in Billy Kane&rsquo;s face relaxed.
  By lying flat on the floor of the van the driver would hardly be likely to
  notice him in any case; but, to make assurance doubly sure, some bits of
  sacking, evidently used to wrap around and protect furniture from being scratched
  and marred, were strewn about on the floor. Billy Kane pulled off his slouch
  hat, that had been jammed down over his eyes, drew a piece of the sacking
  over him, and lay still.</p>
  <p>And then presently he heard the driver come out from the office. The man
  climbed to his seat. The van jolted forward. Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand, under
  the sacking, felt tentatively over his shoulder. It was paining him brutally,
  and was burning and hot, but it seemed to have stopped bleeding, and the
  sense of nausea and giddiness had passed away. It was a flesh wound only,
  probably; or, at least, the bullet had not fractured any bone, for he could
  move both shoulder and arm readily.</p>
  <p>And now, safe for the moment, Billy Kane&rsquo;s mind was back on the events
  of the evening; and for a time grief for the man he loved had its sway; and
  then came fury, pitiless and remorseless, and a cry in his soul for vengeance;
  and then a quiet, measured analysis of every detail, an analysis that was
  deadly in its cold, unnatural calm. Jackson&rsquo;s acts in that back passageway,
  Jackson&rsquo;s possession of a revolver, and Jackson&rsquo;s words at the
  end stamped the footman irrevocably as being one of the men in the murder
  plot. And with Jackson&rsquo;s guilt established as a premise, the rest unravelled
  itself step by step, clearly, logically, irrefutably.</p>
  <p>David Ellsworth&rsquo;s deductions had proved themselves in ghastly truth.
  The letter had been written as the initiatory step toward incriminating him,
  Billy Kane, in the robbery that was to follow; and this demanded, even as
  he had argued before, that the vault and safe combinations should be known
  to a third party. Who knew them? The answer came now quickly and emphatically
  enough&mdash;someone within the house&mdash;Jackson. He remembered now, though
  he had paid no attention to it before, that Jackson had been in the library
  on several occasions when he, Billy Kane, was opening the vault. It had probably
  taken the man a month or two, perhaps more, watching both David Ellsworth
  and himself at every opportunity and with infinite patience, to pick up little
  by little, possibly but a single number or turn at a time, the combinations&mdash;but
  he had undoubtedly accomplished it finally.</p>
  <p>The original plan had certainly not contemplated the murder of David Ellsworth,
  for the letter was primarily intended to make the old millionaire one of
  the first to accuse him, Billy Kane, of the crime&mdash;there having been
  left on the scene of the crime, of course, in that case, as David Ellsworth
  had also reasoned, some further damning evidence of his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s,
  supposed guilt. But the changing of the combinations had completely upset
  that original plan. Who was it, then, who knew that the combinations <i>had</i> been
  changed? Again the question answered itself almost automatically. It must
  have been someone in the house at the time, and someone who was both listening
  and watching&mdash;Jackson. True, David Ellsworth had looked out into the
  hall, and had opened the door and looked into the unlighted stenographer&rsquo;s
  room, but he had done it only cursorily, and Jackson all the time might well
  have been hiding in that room&mdash;in fact, must have been hiding there.</p>
  <p>The rest was self-evident. Without the combinations they were helpless,
  but the new combinations were on a card in David Ellsworth&rsquo;s pocket.
  It had been necessary, then, only to add <i>murder</i> to the theft, employing
  as accessories the card, the letter, the button and the black silk loop,
  in order to seize the opportunity of the moment; for, the card bearing the
  combinations once destroyed or out of reach, the months of work that had
  been put in to secure the old combinations would have to be repeated to obtain
  the new&mdash;and with very little likelihood of success, since Jackson would
  know that David Ellsworth&rsquo;s suspicions were thoroughly aroused.</p>
  <p>The van rolled rapidly downtown. Billy Kane, peering out from under the
  sacking, kept watch on the streets through which he passed. But his mind
  was still busy with its problem.</p>
  <p>Jackson&rsquo;s act in accosting him on the corner, and afterwards luring
  him by suggestion to the rear of the house, had puzzled him at first, but
  that, too, was clear enough now. There was a grain of truth in what the man
  had said about giving him a chance, though Jackson would care little enough
  whether he ultimately got away, or not. Jackson&rsquo;s idea, or perhaps
  the idea of a keener brain behind Jackson, was to prevent him, Billy Kane,
  from entering the house at all, and so, by inducing him to run for it, to
  corroborate the evidence of guilt against him, in which case, being a self-elected
  fugitive, he would be doubly condemned if eventually caught. On the other
  hand, if he refused to listen and insisted on entering the house, as they
  were afraid he might do, they meant to see to it that his entrance was made
  by apparent stealth, and here again he but added the final touch to the evidence
  against him, and discredited himself beyond any hope or possibility of recovery.
  Jackson had taken no personal risk or chance in doing this, as far as the
  police were concerned; and it was evident now that Jackson had meant to <i>kill</i> him
  there in that back passageway should he, Billy Kane, persist in refusing
  to run. The case and all investigation would have ended automatically if
  he, Billy Kane were killed under such circumstances. It was all simplicity
  itself! Jackson had only to call for help, as he had done when the issue
  was forced by that approaching footstep, pretend that he had discovered him,
  Billy Kane, creeping into the house, and had rushed upon him&mdash;that he,
  Billy Kane, had drawn the revolver, but that in the struggle had been shot
  himself. With the evidence as it stood, with his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s guilt
  so apparently obvious, Jackson would not only have been believed, but would
  have been rewarded and lauded as a hero.</p>
  <p>Still the van rolled on&mdash;mostly through deserted streets, for the traffic
  was light at that time of night. Perhaps another twenty minutes passed. Then
  Billy Kane began to edge toward the rear end of the truck. He was in the
  East Side now, and approaching the neighborhood of Marco&rsquo;s second-hand
  clothing store.</p>
  <p>Was Jackson dead? Billy Kane shook his head. He did not know. A grim smile
  twisted his lips. He hoped not&mdash;not from any sympathy for the man, for
  the man&rsquo;s punishment in that case had been almost too merciful a retribution,
  but because in Jackson was embodied the clue that would lead, if he, Billy
  Kane, escaped, to that day of reckoning that, cost what it might, he meant
  should come.</p>
  <p>The van was in a narrow and ill-lighted street now. Marco&rsquo;s was still
  two streets further downtown, but in the block ahead was the lane that, running
  north and south, passed the rear of Marco&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane sat suddenly upright on the tail-board of the van, the piece
  of sacking thrown now around his shoulders. If the driver happened to look
  around and see him, the supposition would be that he had hopped on to steal
  a ride; and if the driver ordered him off it mattered very little, since,
  in another yard or so anyhow, the van, as far as he was concerned, would
  have lost its usefulness. He leaned out, and glanced ahead of him up the
  street. There were a few people about, but not many, and none in the immediate
  vicinity of the lane that was now just at hand; but even if he were seen
  for an instant as he left the van, he would not be running any very great
  risk for he would be out of sight again before any particular attention could
  be riveted upon him; and, besides, in that miserable and sordid quarter a
  man might do many things out of the ordinary, for instance, dive suddenly
  into a lane and disappear, without exciting even passing curiosity or notice.</p>
  <p>He jerked his slouch hat over his eyes, flung off the sacking, dropped to
  the ground, and slipped across the sidewalk into the lane. And now he was
  running again. He reached the next intersecting street, and was forced to
  draw back under cover to wait for an opportunity to cross unnoticed. And
  then the chance came, and he continued on down the lane on the opposite side
  of the street again.</p>
  <p>Marco&rsquo;s was the second store in from the next corner on the street
  that paralleled the lane, and halfway down he stopped running and began to
  move forward cautiously. It was very black in here, and he wished now that
  he had looked at his watch when he had had the opportunity; but it must be
  somewhere around ten o&rsquo;clock. It was two hours, then, since he had
  overheard that telephone conversation in which Laverto had said that all
  he cared was that the man to whom he was telephoning should be away from
  Marco&rsquo;s before a quarter of eleven.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was crouched now in the darkness against the back door of the
  second-hand shop. The chances were that whoever Laverto had been telephoning
  to had already been here and gone. Certainly two hours would have given any
  one ample time, and as Laverto had said that Marco did not keep open in the
  evening there would have been no cause for delay on that score.</p>
  <p>He placed his ear to the panel of the door, and listened. There was no sound,
  and he tried the door. It stuck a little in spite of its broken lock, and
  gave with a slight squeak. Billy Kane drew in his breath sharply, and listened
  again. There was still no sound. He closed the door behind him, and crept
  forward, feeling his way with his hands along the wall in the pitch blackness.
  The flooring was old, and once it creaked under his foot, causing his lips
  to tighten rigidly, and his face to set in a hard, dogged way. He had no
  matches&mdash;they, in the match-safe that he usually carried in the ticket-pocket
  of his coat, were gone with the coat. A coat! All sense of absurdity in the
  length to which he was going to obtain so common-place an article as a coat
  had vanished. It was the one, final, ultimate, essential thing that he must
  and would have if he was to know a single chance for life. Without it he
  might as well throw up the sponge at once, but if his luck still held he
  would get one now. Marco&rsquo;s stock of clothing would naturally be in
  the shop in front, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>His hand dove suddenly forward into space, and he halted for an instant.
  He had come to an open doorway on his right. He felt around him in all directions.
  The passage seemed to end a foot or so ahead, and to lead nowhere but into
  what was probably the back room here at his side. The entrance, then, to
  the shop proper would be through the back room.</p>
  <p>Again he moved forward, crossed the threshold, and again halted. It was
  dark, intensely dark, and he could see nothing; and it was still and silent,
  and there was no sound. But suddenly he found himself standing in a tense,
  strained attitude, his head thrown a little forward, his eyes striving to
  pierce the darkness. He could hear nothing, see nothing&mdash;but the sense
  of <i>presence</i> was strong upon him.</p>
  <p>A minute passed, the seconds dragging out interminably&mdash;and he did
  not move. And then it seemed that close to him he caught a faint stirring
  sound. But he was not sure. It might have been his imagination. The silence,
  so heavy and prolonged, had taken on strange little noises of its own. Billy
  Kane&rsquo;s lips thinned. He was bare-handed, wounded and unarmed, but he
  had a stake that he would fight for with a beast&rsquo;s ferocity. And that
  stake was a coat! If there was anyone here, if it was more than his excited
  and wrought-up fancy playing tricks upon him, it was certain at least that
  it was not the police, for the police would have no incentive to play at
  cat-and-mouse, and therefore it was probably the man, not yet through with
  his work, to whom Laverto had telephoned; it was probably a <i>fellow</i> thief,
  fellow since he, Billy Kane, had also come to steal&mdash;a coat. Well, he
  would at least end the suspense! He turned in the direction from which he
  thought the sound, imaginary or real, had come, took a step forward&mdash;and
  stood still, hands clenched at his sides, as he blinked, through the ray
  of a flashlight that was suddenly thrown full in his face, at the round,
  ugly muzzle of a revolver that held a steady bead upon him on a level with
  his eyes.</p>
  <p>A voice came through the silence in a savage, guttural snarl:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw up yer mitts, youse&mdash;&rdquo; The words ended in an amazed
  and startled oath. The revolver muzzle sagged downward, as though the hand
  that held it had become suddenly powerless. &ldquo;Well, fer Gawd&rsquo;s
  sake, if it ain&rsquo;t de Rat!&rdquo; gasped the voice in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;When
  did youse get back? I thought youse was hobnobbin&rsquo; wid some of de swells
  youse used to know, an&rsquo; was givin&rsquo; Noo Yoik de icy paw until
  next month!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Alias The Rat</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face was impassive. The keen, alert brain was working
  with desperate speed. There had come in a flash with the other&rsquo;s words
  a vista, not quite clear, nor distinct, but a vista that seemed to promise
  the way and the chance, not only of immediate escape from this place here,
  but perhaps more than that&mdash;assistance, help, perhaps even refuge and
  temporary sanctuary from the police who, before morning, would be scouring
  every quarter of New York in an effort to capture him. This man, a thief,
  a criminal, one of the underworld himself, had obviously mistaken him, Billy
  Kane, for another of his own ilk&mdash;for one known as the Rat. His appearance,
  disreputable, blood-stained and mud-covered, had undoubtedly been a very
  large factor in bringing about the man&rsquo;s mistake, it was true; but
  that did not in any way apply to his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, <i>face</i>, and
  his face had been, and was still, full in the pitiless glare of the flashlight.
  Therefore he must to a very remarkable extent resemble this so-called Rat.
  And, moreover, this Rat must be a figure of some consequence in the underworld;
  for, even through the man&rsquo;s hoarse and amazed tones, Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  quick ear had caught a note of almost cringing deference. And then Billy
  Kane&rsquo;s under jaw crept out a little, and his eyes narrowed. Well, for
  the moment, at least, he would play the part&mdash;because he must.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who in hell are you?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  see you behind that light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Whitie Jack,&rdquo; the other answered mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whitie Jack, eh?&rdquo; snapped Billy Kane. &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;his
  hand shot out, and pushed the flashlight roughly away&mdash;&ldquo;take your
  cursed lamp out of my eyes? What are you playing at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; mumbled the man. &ldquo;Sure&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right!
  Only youse gave me de jumps sneakin&rsquo; in here. Bundy Morgan&mdash;de
  Rat! Wot&rsquo;s de idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing perhaps would confirm the man more in his mistake than an allusion
  to the common enemy&mdash;the police. Billy Kane dropped into the vernacular.
  But the man&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;de swells youse used to know&rdquo; had
  given him his cue. The Rat at one time had probably known quite a different
  station in life, and the Rat&rsquo;s speech therefore, even in the vernacular,
  would hardly be ungrammatical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A coat,&rdquo; said Billy Kane tersely. &ldquo;The bulls have got
  my costume spotted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swipe me!&rdquo; Whitie Jack drew in his breath in a low whistle. &ldquo;De
  bulls&mdash;eh? So dat&rsquo;s de lay! Well, youse wait a minute, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  get youse one. Youse look as though youse had blamed near cashed in! Youse
  have spilled a lot of red out of dat shoulder, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty bad,&rdquo; answered Billy Kane laconically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack again; and then, eagerly, the deference
  back in his voice: &ldquo;Well, youse wait a minute, Bundy, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
  get youse de best coat de old geezer&rsquo;s got&mdash;though dat&rsquo;s
  not sayin&rsquo; much, for dere&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; here but a bunch of
  rags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was gone. Billy Kane leaned back against the wall. His hand swept
  across his eyes. It seemed as though for hours he had been living through
  some horrible and ghastly nightmare from which he could not awake. He was
  Billy Kane, whom the world, in the morning, would proclaim the murderer of
  David Ellsworth; but he was also now Billy Kane, alias Bundy Morgan, alias
  the Rat! Again his hand swept across his eyes. And the Rat&mdash;who was
  the Rat? And what&mdash;</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack was back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack. &ldquo;Here youse are!&rdquo; He handed
  Billy Kane a coat, and his flashlight fell again on Billy Kane&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Say,
  dat&rsquo;s bad!&rdquo; he jerked out; and then, irrelevantly, &ldquo;Say,
  wouldn&rsquo;t it sting youse&mdash;youse showin&rsquo; up here! When did
  youse blow into town, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, youse didn&rsquo;t take long in startin&rsquo; something!&rdquo; said
  Whitie Jack admiringly. He helped Billy Kane on with the coat. &ldquo;Was
  it a big one, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. &ldquo;Only a fight, but someone got <i>hurt</i> in
  the fight&mdash;get me, Whitie? And the bulls are out for fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack drew in his breath in a low, comprehensive whistle again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sing Sing, an&rsquo; de juice route&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Did
  dey spot who youse were?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, well den, wot de hell!&rdquo; observed Whitie Jack, with a sudden
  grin. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s easy! Youse have got a coat now, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
  beat it over for yer dump, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s de end of it! You have got
  to get dat shoulder fixed, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m some guy wid de bandage stuff&mdash;-believe
  me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not answer for a moment. Well, why not? He had accepted the
  absent Rat&rsquo;s personality, why not the absent Rat&rsquo;s hospitality?
  It would afford him shelter for the moment, and he was living, feeling, groping
  his way now only from moment to moment. Also, and what was of even more urgent
  importance, he must somehow and in some way get his wound dressed.</p>
  <p>The flashlight in Whitie Jack&rsquo;s hand was sweeping in a circle around
  the room&mdash;in a sort of precautionary leave-taking survey of the place,
  as it were. The room was evidently the proprietor&rsquo;s office; but from
  what Billy Kane could see of it, it was bare and uninviting enough. He caught
  a glimpse of a rough table and a couple of chairs, and then the flashlight
  went out. But he was still staring, through the darkness now, toward the
  far end of the room&mdash;and it seemed that he could still see just as vividly
  as though the light still played upon the spot. There was an old safe there,
  a large and cumbrous thing, long out of date, and the door sagged on its
  hinges where it had been blown open, and the floor around it was littered
  with the books and papers it had evidently contained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bum job you made, Whitie!&rdquo; commented Billy Kane
  sarcastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist, you are! What did you expect
  to get out of a piker hang-out like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; returned Whitie Jack. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
  so bum! I&rsquo;d like to see youse crack a box in here wid soup, an&rsquo; not
  wake de whole town up. Dat&rsquo;s wot I get mine for&mdash;a century note&mdash;see?
  Dere wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in de safe! Not a nickel! It&rsquo;s a stall&mdash;savvy?
  But, come on, Bundy, we&rsquo;ll beat it out of here, an&rsquo; get youse
  fixed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A stall! What did Whitie Jack mean? Whitie Jack, at Antonio Laverto&rsquo;s
  instigation, had blown open the safe, knowing beforehand that there was nothing
  in it! What was Laverto&rsquo;s game? Billy Kane mechanically made his way
  out along the passage, the flashlight winking in Whitie Jack&rsquo;s hand
  behind him. What was the game? Laverto was no fool, and there seemed an ominous
  something back of it all, but he dared not press Whitie Jack, or appear too
  inquisitive. His own position now was precarious enough as it was, and needed
  all his wits to see him through. For instance, they were going now to the
  Rat&rsquo;s quarters, to what was supposedly <i>his</i>, Billy Kane&rsquo;s,
  quarters&mdash;and he had not the faintest idea where, or in what direction,
  those quarters might be! Billy Kane smiled grimly in the darkness. But Whitie
  Jack evidently knew. Therefore Whitie Jack, without knowing it, must be made
  to act as <i>guide</i>!</p>
  <p>They were outside now. Whitie Jack had closed the door. Billy Kane raised
  his hand to his head, smiled grimly again to himself in the darkness, and
  stumbled heavily against his companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; whispered Whitie Jack anxiously. &ldquo;Here,
  buck up, Bundy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m bad&mdash;worse than I thought I was&mdash;my head&rsquo;s
  going round,&rdquo; mumbled Billy Kane. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to help
  me, Whitie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I will!&rdquo; returned Whitie Jack encouragingly. He slipped
  his arm through Billy Kane&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Youse just buck up, Bundy! An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
  youse be afraid to throw yer weight on me. &rsquo;Taint far, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
  make it all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, his object accomplished, leaned not lightly on Whitie Jack.
  Occasionally, as he walked along, he staggered and lurched, playing up his
  r&ocirc;le&mdash;but only when the street in his immediate neighborhood was
  clear, and he ran no risk of attracting attention to himself and his companion!</p>
  <p>It was not far, a few blocks; and then Whitie Jack, still unsuspectingly
  acting as guide, was helping Billy Kane down the half dozen steps of one
  of those cellar-like entrances to the basement of a low building in the middle
  of a block.</p>
  <p>The building seemed to be a store of some kind, but it was closed, the dingy
  front window dark, and in the none too well lighted street Billy Kane could
  not make out exactly what it was. At the bottom of the steps they halted&mdash;before
  a locked door&mdash;and for an instant again that grim, desperate smile twisted
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. And then he laughed shortly, as his free hand fumbled
  in the pockets of the stolen coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kick it in, Whitie!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got
  the key. I lost my coat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack complacently. &ldquo;I
  got de goods, ain&rsquo;t I? Wot d&rsquo;youse think!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From his pocket Whitie Jack produced a bunch of what were evidently skeleton
  keys; and, trying first one and then another, finally opened the door. His
  flashlight played through into the interior, and indicated a chair that stood
  before a table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse go over dere an&rsquo; sit down, an&rsquo; get yer coat an&rsquo; shirt
  off, an&rsquo; leave de rest to me,&rdquo; he directed.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, lurching again, stumbled into the chair, as Whitie Jack, closing
  and locking the door, located an incandescent that hung from the ceiling,
  and switched on the light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, where do youse keep yer stuff?&rdquo; demanded Whitie Jack. &ldquo;A
  shirt&rsquo;ll do&mdash;anything to tear up an&rsquo; make a bandage wid,
  see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not answer. He did not know! Instead, he let his head sag
  limply forward, and fall on his crossed arms upon the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, buck up, Bundy!&rdquo; pleaded Whitie Jack anxiously. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;ll
  be all right in a minute. Dat&rsquo;s de boy! Buck up! It&rsquo;s all right!
  Leave it to me! I&rsquo;ll find something!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still Billy Kane did not answer. His face hidden in his arms, he was making
  a surreptitious, but none the less critical, survey of his surroundings.
  It was a large room, evidently comprising the entire basement of the building;
  and the single incandescent that it boasted seemed only to enhance, with
  its meager light, the sort of forbidding sordidness, as it were, that pervaded
  the place. There were no windows. The walls had been boarded in with cheap
  lumber that had warped and bulged in spots, and the walls had been painted
  once&mdash;but so long ago that they had lost any distinctive color, and
  had faded into a murky, streaky yellow. The room was dirty and ill-kempt.
  A few old pieces of carpet were strewn about the floor, and for decoration
  prints from various magazines and Sunday supplements were tacked here and
  there around the walls. There was a bed in one corner; a wardrobe made by
  hanging a piece of old cretonne diagonally across another corner; a sink
  at one side of the room; and, at the far end, a bureau, whose looking-glass
  seemed to be abnormally large. Billy Kane studied the looking-glass for a
  moment curiously. It seemed to reflect back some object that he could not
  quite identify, something that glittered a little in the light. And then
  Billy Kane smiled a sort of grim appreciation. Whitie Jack had left his keys
  hanging in the lock of the door&mdash;the mirror held in faithful focus the
  only entrance to the place that the Rat&rsquo;s lair apparently possessed!</p>
  <p>And now the reflection of the door in the mirror was blotted out, and the
  figure of Whitie Jack took its place. The man had crossed the room from an
  apparently abortive search behind the cretonne hanging, and was rummaging
  now in the drawers of the bureau. And then, with a grunt of satisfaction,
  and with what looked like a shirt and some underclothing flung over his arm,
  Whitie Jack made his way to the sink, filled a basin with water, and returned
  to the table.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane raised his head heavily&mdash;and with well-simulated painful
  effort aided in the removal of his coat, vest and shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de stuff, Bundy!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack approvingly.</p>
  <p>It was a flesh wound, angry and nasty enough in appearance when the clotted
  blood was washed away, but still only a flesh wound. Whitie Jack surveyed
  it judicially.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t so worse, Bundy!&rdquo; he announced reassuringly. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;ll
  be all to de good in a day or so.&rdquo; He began to rip and tear the underclothing
  into strips. &ldquo;Youse&rsquo;ll need de shirt to wear, an&rsquo; dis stuff&rsquo;ll
  do for de bandages,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>The man dressed the wound with amazing deftness, stepped back to observe
  his own work admiringly, and then, picking up the folded shirt, shook it
  out, and began to unbutton it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now den, Bundy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get dis on, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; He
  stopped. From where it had been hidden in the folds of the shirt, a little
  black object dropped to the floor. Whitie Jack stooped, picked it up, glanced
  at it, and tossed it on the table. &ldquo;An&rsquo; dat ain&rsquo;t so dusty
  a place to hide it, neither!&rdquo; grinned Whitie Jack. &ldquo;Now den,
  up wid yer arms, an&rsquo; on wid de shirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane made no comment. The object Whitie Jack had picked up was a black
  mask. He raised his arms, and with deliberate difficulty struggled into the
  shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;youse feel now?&rdquo; inquired Whitie Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artist with
  the swab rags, Whitie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack. &ldquo;Well, I guess dat&rsquo;s all.
  Youse go to bed now, an&rsquo; keep quiet. I&rsquo;ll tip de fleet off dat
  youse are back on de job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody butting in around here to-night!&rdquo; he
  said roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sure, youse don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; agreed Whitie Jack, with an oath
  for emphasis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t youse worry, I&rsquo;ll wise &rsquo;em up
  to dat. Dere won&rsquo;t be nobody around here till youse says so&mdash;youse
  know dat, don&rsquo;t youse? I ain&rsquo;t never heard of any guy huntin&rsquo; trouble
  wid de Rat yet&mdash;an&rsquo; I guess dat ain&rsquo;t no con steer!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was standing up now. It seemed strange, almost incredibly strange
  that this man, one who evidently knew the so-called Rat intimately and well,
  had accepted him, Billy Kane, without the slightest suspicion that there
  could exist any question regarding his identity. He had been watching and
  on his guard all the time that Whitie Jack had been dressing his wound, but
  though Whitie Jack had seen him under the full glare of a flashlight, and
  again in this lighted room here, their heads close together as the other
  had bent over him, Whitie Jack was obviously possessed of no doubts that
  he, Billy Kane, was anyone other than the Rat! Well, it might be strange,
  but at least it was undeniably true; so true that now that vista, which he
  had glimpsed with Whitie Jack&rsquo;s first words of mistaken recognition,
  was spreading out again before him, but more concretely now, opening a staggering
  possibility; so true that he dared not jeopardize anything by appearing too
  inquisitive about Marco&rsquo;s, for instance&mdash;much as Marco&rsquo;s
  was still in his mind! Marco&rsquo;s! No, he was not through with Marco&rsquo;s,
  for more reasons than one. There was some queer deviltry that Laverto was
  hatching there&mdash;at a quarter to eleven&mdash;and he meant to see it
  through. But, after all, even if he broached the subject again to Whitie
  Jack, who was patently only a tool in the affair, what more could Whitie
  Jack tell him, except the name of the man who had hired him to blow open
  an old safe whose contents were worthless&mdash;and that man&rsquo;s name
  he, Billy Kane, already knew. No, he was not through with Marco&rsquo;s!
  But he would gain nothing, save perhaps to excite suspicion, by speaking
  of it again to Whitie Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse get to bed, an&rsquo; get some sleep!&rdquo; prompted Whitie
  Jack. &ldquo;Youse can leave de mob to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Whitie,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. He moved across the room,
  and flung himself down on the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to forget this.
  You&rsquo;ve handed me the glad paw to-night&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not going
  to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, dat&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack earnestly. &ldquo;I
  knows youse ain&rsquo;t! An&rsquo;, say, youse can take it from me on de
  level dat I&rsquo;d rather have had dis chance dan have a thousand long green
  bucks in me mitt dis minute. Say, I knows it, don&rsquo;t I, dat de Rat never
  forgets; an&rsquo; I knows dere&rsquo;s about a million guys around here
  dat would give deir eye teeth for de chance dat came my way to-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was strange again&mdash;but the servility in the man&rsquo;s tones that
  was coupled with elation was genuine beyond doubt. The Rat was unquestionably
  a character of prominence and power in the sordid realm wherein he appeared,
  by some at least, by this Whitie Jack for example, to be held in awe. That
  being so, it was obviously the Rat&rsquo;s prerogative to command&mdash;Whitie
  Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Whitie&mdash;that goes!&rdquo; said Billy Kane tersely. &ldquo;And
  now, beat it! But before you go leave me your gun. I got cleaned out when
  I lost my coat, and if anything comes of that little game of mine to-night
  I might need your iron. Yes, and leave those keys, too&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no
  other way to lock the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack promptly. He took his revolver from
  his pocket, laid it on the table, and walked to the door. &ldquo;Are youse
  sure dere&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; else youse wants, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well den, so long, Bundy!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  see youse in de mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So long, Whitie!&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The Second-Hand Dealer</h2>
  <p>The door closed behind Whitie Jack, the man&rsquo;s footsteps echoed back
  as he climbed to the street, echoed faintly again from the pavement, and
  then died away.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane got up from the bed, went to the door, locked it, and then walked
  down the length of the room&mdash;and standing in front of the mirror stared
  into the glass in a grimly impersonal way. It was himself&mdash;Billy Kane.
  His face was in no whit changed, except perhaps that there was a slight pallor
  there due to loss of blood, and that the lines were sharper and harder, as
  though he were, as indeed he was, under a tense and heavy strain; but, with
  his collarless shirt, his trousers covered with mud and dirt, his whole appearance
  had taken on an aspect that was at once sinister and forbidding.</p>
  <p>He laughed shortly, and turning abruptly from the mirror, crossed the room
  again, and pushed aside the cretonne hanging. There were some clothes on
  the wall pegs here. He gathered them up, and took them nearer to the light
  for an inspection. They were old, somewhat greasy, and wholly disreputable.
  He laughed shortly again, as he changed into them. As the Rat, he might venture
  out, though he would do well to take care not to be recognized, since Whitie
  Jack would have spread the report that he was wounded and in bed; but he
  could at least go out without inviting instant pursuit as the &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; of
  David Ellsworth. He was safe now for the moment, safe until morning anyhow&mdash;and
  he could even use those hours, if he would, in an attempt to put as many
  miles as possible between himself and New York! His hands clenched, and into
  the pallor of his face the red came burning hot. But he wasn&rsquo;t going
  to do that! That &ldquo;staggering possibility&rdquo; was clear before his
  mind&rsquo;s eye now. He wasn&rsquo;t going to do that; he was going, instead&mdash;to
  play the Rat&mdash;to play the cards that fate, if one believed in fate,
  had thrust into his hands&mdash;to take the chance, the one chance, <i>if
  the Rat did not come back too soon</i>, of clearing his own name, and of
  bringing to justice the hell-hounds, who had struck down that gentle gray-haired
  man who had been his friend. His hands clenched harder, until, as they had
  done once before that night, the nails bit into the palms. He, Billy Kane&mdash;the
  murderer of his father&rsquo;s friend, the murderer of the man who had trusted
  him and loved him! It was getting him now with all its brutal and remorseless
  force! Broadcast over the country, by morning his name would have become
  the synonym of all that was vile and hideous, and Billy Kane would be known
  as one of the most revolting characters in the annals of crime&mdash;a foul
  and filthy thing who typified the dregs and lees of human degradation&mdash;a
  thing from whom the friends of old would turn in horror and in shame, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Slowly his hands unclenched. The surge of fury that had been almost ungovernable
  passed, and he knew again that cold, unnatural, deadly calm. If he lived,
  the guilty man, or men, would pay! If he were taking a chance now, a desperate
  chance, he was taking a chance that no <i>man</i> could do otherwise than
  take. It was the chance to live&mdash;for one might better otherwise be dead!
  A chance! He had picked up Whitie Jack&rsquo;s revolver, and was twisting
  it in his fingers, and now he thrust it suddenly into his pocket. A chance!
  He was taking no chance, indeed, save with the stake that was already flung
  upon the table&mdash;his life. It was the one way! As the Rat, doubtless
  well known to the authorities, he could move under the very noses of the
  police at will without suspicion arising that he was Billy Kane; and as the
  Rat, if Whitie Jack was to be relied upon as a criterion, he would have the
  run of the underworld, and in the underworld were many secrets, and amongst
  those secrets was perhaps the one he sought&mdash;the clue to Jackson&rsquo;s
  associates in the murder of David Ellsworth. He was not blinded to the difficulties
  of this picking up of the thread of another man&rsquo;s life; nor blinded
  to what was perhaps the greatest difficulty of all, the necessity of being
  able to recognize those with whom he <i>should be</i> acquainted, but even
  that was not insurmountable. He could see a way, he believed, to accomplish
  even that.</p>
  <p>But all this was for to-morrow&mdash;and the to-morrows after that! To-night
  he was going out again&mdash;to Marco&rsquo;s. That was why he had changed
  his clothes just now. A graver thing, the thought of merging his identity
  with the Rat&rsquo;s, had impinged, obtruded itself, as it were, upon his
  mind. But he had not forgotten Marco&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>He picked up his discarded vest, transferred the package of banknotes and
  his watch to the pockets of the one he now wore, and as he did so, he looked
  at the time. Laverto had said a quarter to eleven. It was almost that now.
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes strayed over the table, and fell upon the black mask.
  The mask, too, went into his pocket. It might prove a most valuable discovery,
  that mask&mdash;under certain circumstances even the <i>Rat&rsquo;s</i> identity
  was not lightly to be disclosed.</p>
  <p>He collected the muddy garments he had taken off, and tucked them under
  the mattress on the bed. It was not likely that anyone would come here, much
  less attempt to enter, in his absence; but he was fully aware that now, and
  from now on, his life depended upon his caution in every detail. He extinguished
  the light, put on his hat, walked to the door, unlocked it&mdash;and stood
  for a moment hesitant. Was he a fool to take this added risk, when already
  his own back was against the wall, when already he was in desperate case
  himself? He shook his head in a sort of exasperated remonstrance with himself
  for even his momentary hesitation, then opening the door, he locked it behind
  him, and crept cautiously up the stairs to the street.</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack had been only a tool used for the stage-setting of some deviltry
  that was to follow&mdash;at a quarter of eleven. That was obvious. He, Billy
  Kane, had intended that the police should be informed and should deal with
  Laverto, and that he in person should give evidence against Laverto; but
  he could no longer inform the police, no longer give evidence. He was wanted
  now himself for <i>murder</i>, and so upon him fell the moral obligation
  to prevent or render abortive, if he could, a crime that he knew was pending.
  And besides&mdash;his face hardened suddenly, as he moved swiftly along,
  evading the direct rays of the street lights, and keeping in the shadows&mdash;he
  had a personal account to settle with Antonio Laverto. If it had not been
  for the man&rsquo;s damnable imposition having succeeded to the extent that
  it had, he, Billy Kane, would not have left the Ellsworth house to-night,
  and David Ellsworth would not now&mdash;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand, in his pocket, tightened over the butt of Whitie
  Jack&rsquo;s revolver. Unconsciously he quickened his stride.</p>
  <p>Always hugging the shadows, his hat drawn far down over his face, giving
  the passers-by he met as wide a berth as possible, Billy Kane covered the
  short distance that separated the Rat&rsquo;s den from Marco&rsquo;s. He
  slipped into the lane unobserved, and for the second time that night crouched
  against the door with the broken lock. But now, mindful of the door&rsquo;s
  tendency to squeak, he pushed it open cautiously an inch at a time. And then,
  with the door slightly open, he stood motionless, a puzzled and amazed expression
  on his face. Just exactly what he had expected to find here, he was not prepared
  to say&mdash;but certainly not this! A faint light came through from the
  door of the back room into the hallway, and from the room there came a woman&rsquo;s
  voice that mingled a sort of pitiful defiance with a sob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true! I tell you it&rsquo;s not true! The boy never
  did it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; It was a man&rsquo;s voice now, caustic and unrelenting. &ldquo;Well,
  where is he now, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the woman replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
  seen him since supper. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with it. That doesn&rsquo;t
  prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; It was the man again. &ldquo;Well, maybe not! But I am
  not to be fooled! I am a poor man. I cannot afford to lose my money. So,
  it has nothing to do with it, eh? You say that because you are his mother,
  eh? But did he tell you at supper that I had discharged him this afternoon?
  Eh? Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; The answer seemed to come reluctantly.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane pushed the outer door a little wider open and slipped through.
  Keeping close to the wall, he edged forward until he could see into the back
  room through its open door. A frown came and knitted his brows in hard furrows.
  He was frankly puzzled now. The woman, a tall, powerful, muscular woman of
  middle age, but curiously frail now in obvious fear and emotion, was Mrs.
  Clancy, who kept the little notion shop next door on the corner; and the
  other, bent-shouldered, in long, greasy black coat, with long, untrimmed
  and dirty white beard, whose eyes were distorted behind the heavy lenses
  of his steel-bowed spectacles, was Marco, the proprietor of the second-hand
  store. Marco was apparently in a state of equal distress and excitement.
  He alternatively wrung his hands together and gesticulated furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight hundred dollars!&rdquo; he cried out wildly. &ldquo;Do you
  hear, you, the mother of that brat? Eight hundred dollars! All I have on
  earth! And it is gone! Stolen by that cursed young prison bird of yours!
  So he did not tell you, eh, that I discharged him this afternoon because
  I was sure he was making little stealings from me all the time? But you are
  not surprised, eh? Maybe he has stolen from you, too, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman did not answer. She seemed to shiver suddenly, and then sank down
  heavily in the chair before the table, near which she had been standing.</p>
  <p>Marco paced up and down the room, back and forth, from the table to where
  the floor was littered with the erstwhile contents of the rifled safe.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s puzzled frown grew deeper. Evidently there <i>had</i> been
  money in the safe, but in some way Laverto had got it before he had set Whitie
  Jack at work upon a stall, and it was obvious that Laverto had maneuvered
  to plant the crime on the shoulders of this woman&rsquo;s son. But what then
  had been Laverto&rsquo;s object in bringing Whitie Jack into it at all? It
  did not somehow seem to fit, or dovetail, or appear logical, or&mdash; And
  then, with a sudden start, Billy Kane leaned tensely forward, his eyes fixed
  narrowly on Marco. Yes, it <i>did</i> dovetail! He had it now&mdash;all of
  it&mdash;all of the damnable, unscrupulous ingenuity of the plot that had
  been hatched in Laverto&rsquo;s cunning brain. The frown was hidden now by
  the mask which Billy Kane slipped quickly over his face, but his lips just
  showing beneath the edge of the mask were tight and hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was a fool&mdash;a fool!&rdquo; Marco cried out sharply. &ldquo;A
  fool, ever to have taken him in here as my clerk! I might have known! He
  has already been in jail!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was only the reform school.&rdquo; Mrs. Clancy was wringing her
  hands piteously. &ldquo;He is only a boy&mdash;only seventeen now. And he
  did not mean any harm even then&mdash;and&mdash;and since then he has been
  a good boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; Marco flung out a clenched fist and shook it in the
  air. &ldquo;He has&mdash;eh? Well, then, where did he get this? Answer me
  that! Where did he get this?&rdquo; Marco&rsquo;s closed hand opened, and
  he threw what looked to Billy Kane like a little brooch, a miniature in a
  cheap setting, upon the table. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, ain&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s
  his mother&rsquo;s picture, ain&rsquo;t it? Do you think I do not recognize
  it? That&rsquo;s you twenty years ago&mdash;eh? Did you <i>give</i> it to
  him&mdash;eh? Answer me that&mdash;did you <i>give</i> it to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman had risen from her chair, and was swaying upon her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you think I did not have reason to be pretty sure when I asked
  if he had not stolen from you, too?&rdquo; Marco, apparently beside himself
  with rage, was gesticulating furiously again. &ldquo;And you said I had no
  proof of <i>this</i>&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He shook his fist in the direction
  of the safe. &ldquo;Well, I found that brooch there on the floor where he
  must have dropped it out of his pocket when he blew my safe open, and he
  didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d dropped it in the dark, and then some of the
  papers he pulled out covered it. That&rsquo;s where I found it&mdash;under
  the papers! That&rsquo;s proof enough, ain&rsquo;t it? I guess with his record
  it will satisfy the police&mdash;no matter what his mother thinks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A great sob came from the woman. The tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My boy!&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true&mdash;I&mdash;I
  am afraid it&rsquo;s true. Oh, my boy&mdash;my boy&mdash;my fatherless boy!&rdquo; She
  thrust out her hands in a sudden imploring gesture toward the other. &ldquo;Listen!
  I will tell you all I know. I will show you that I am honest with you, and
  you will have mercy on us. To-night, after supper, I found that the little
  chamois bag in which I keep the few little things I have like that brooch,
  and the money I take in from the store during the day, was gone. Yes, I was
  afraid then. I was afraid. But he is all I have, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my eight hundred dollars, that he came over here and stole afterwards,
  was all <i>I</i> had!&rdquo; screamed Marco. &ldquo;You tell me only what
  a blind man could see for himself! Did I not put two and two together myself?
  He has run away now&mdash;eh&mdash;with all he could get? That he stole from
  you does not give me back my money. But the police will find him! Ha, ha!
  The police will find him, and when they do they will remember the reform
  school and he will get ten years&mdash;yes, yes, ten years&mdash;for this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s voice choked. She brushed the
  tears from her cheeks with a trembling hand. &ldquo;If&mdash;if I give you
  back the money, will you let him go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Marco stood stock still, staring at her. &ldquo;What
  is that you say? You will give me back the money? You! Are you trying to
  make a fool of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that much&mdash;it
  is my savings&mdash;it is in the bank. Listen! Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake,
  be merciful! Give him a chance! You&rsquo;ll get your money back, you won&rsquo;t
  lose anything, and&mdash;and you would the other way, because&mdash;because
  before they caught him he would perhaps have spent a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true!&rdquo; said Marco, in a milder tone; and then, a hint
  of suspicion in his voice: &ldquo;What bank is it in? The bank down the street?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is my bank, too,&rdquo; said Marco. He stared at the woman for
  a moment speculatively, then his eyes circled the room, and he stared at
  the broken safe. &ldquo;Will you pay for my safe?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars,&rdquo; said Marco. &ldquo;It would be fifty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, thank God!&rdquo; She was crying again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; Marco shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Well, I will do it.&rdquo; He
  walked back toward the safe, picked up a check book from amongst the debris
  on the floor, tore out a blank check, dropped the book on the floor again,
  and returned to the table. He pushed the slip of paper toward Mrs. Clancy,
  and pulled out a fountain pen from his pocket. &ldquo;So! Well, make out
  a check for eight hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders
  again.</p>
  <p>It was slow work. Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s hand trembled, and she stopped at
  intervals to wipe her eyes. Billy Kane edged closer to the door. It was probably
  all she had, the savings of years from the little shop, but the fear and
  strain was gone from her face, and her lips were quivering in a smile, as
  she signed her name at last, and handed the check to Marco.</p>
  <p>But now Billy Kane&rsquo;s revolver was in his hand&mdash;and suddenly,
  as Marco held the check close to his eyes to peer at it through his thick
  lenses, Billy Kane stepped forward across the threshold. And then Billy Kane
  spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drop that, Marco!&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>There was a cry of terror from the woman, as she whirled around, white-faced,
  clutching at her breast; it was echoed by a frightened gasp from Marco, and
  as though the slip of paper in his fingers had suddenly turned to white hot
  iron, he snatched his hands back in a sort of grotesque jerk, and the check
  fluttered to the table.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane stepped toward the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a mistake, Marco, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
  inquired coolly. &ldquo;Instead of this woman&rsquo;s son being the robber,
  are you sure it isn&rsquo;t&mdash;yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man shrank back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;myself?&rdquo; he stammered hoarsely. And
  then, recovering a little of his self-control: &ldquo;Who are you? And what
  are you butting in here for? What&rsquo;s your game to say I did that?&rdquo; He
  jerked his hand toward the safe. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bluff old Marco,
  whatever you&rsquo;re up to! I was in Morgenfeldt&rsquo;s caf&eacute; all
  evening until half past ten, and I can prove it; and ten minutes after that
  I was pulling her&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked his hand toward Mrs. Clancy now&mdash;&ldquo;out
  of her shop next door to show her what I had found here. She&rsquo;ll tell
  you so, too! I couldn&rsquo;t have come all the way from Morgenfeldt&rsquo;s,
  and done all that, and blown that safe open in ten minutes, could I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile was unpleasant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to produce your alibi, Marco,&rdquo; he
  said evenly. &ldquo;It sounds suspicious&mdash;and it also accounts for a
  good deal. I think we&rsquo;ll take a look through your pockets, Marco&mdash;not
  for the eight hundred&rdquo;&mdash;Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile had grown still
  more uninviting&mdash;&ldquo;but on the chance that we may find something
  else. Put your hands up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man hesitated.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s revolver muzzle came to a level with the other&rsquo;s
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put them up!&rdquo; he ordered curtly; and, as the man obeyed now,
  he felt deftly over the other&rsquo;s clothing, located a revolver, whipped
  it out, and laid it on the table behind him. A moment later, also from the
  man&rsquo;s pocket, he took a chamois bag, which, too, he placed upon the
  table.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Clancy, with a startled cry, snatched at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, Mother of Mercy, what does this mean!&rdquo; she gasped out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  my bag!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means that our friend Marco here is a very versatile rogue,&rdquo; said
  Billy Kane grimly. &ldquo;You may put your hands down now, Marco, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
  was clipping off his words&mdash;&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t need that beard,
  or those glasses any more! Take them off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man had gone a sudden grayish white. Mechanically he obeyed&mdash;and
  cowered back, his eyes in terror fixed on Billy Kane&rsquo;s mask. <i>It
  was Antonio Laverto.</i></p>
  <p>With a scream of rage, Mrs. Clancy rushed at the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you devil!&rdquo; she shrilled. &ldquo;You made me believe
  my boy was a thief&mdash;God forgive me for it! And&mdash;ah, let me at him!
  I&rsquo;m only a woman, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane had stepped between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a better way, Mrs. Clancy.&rdquo; He
  swung on the Italian. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for your voice, Laverto&mdash;you
  see, I know you&mdash;you might have got away with it. I didn&rsquo;t recognize
  you at first. You&rsquo;re clever, damnably clever, I&rsquo;ll give you credit
  for that, if it&rsquo;s any satisfaction to you. You must be a busy man!
  Are there any more r&ocirc;les in your repertoire? Well, no matter! The Italian
  crippled beggar, and Marco the second-hand clothing dealer are enough for
  now&mdash;and enough to put you where you belong!&rdquo; His voice rasped
  suddenly. &ldquo;You blotch on God&rsquo;s earth!&rdquo; he said between
  his teeth. &ldquo;You knew Mrs. Clancy had a little money, and you knew that
  her son had a reform school record against him. And so, about two weeks ago,
  you rented this place next to hers that was then vacant, and you stocked
  it with a few old clothes, and you hired her son to act as clerk; and you
  hired him, not with an idea of doing any business, but as a necessary part
  of your plan to incriminate him in his mother&rsquo;s eyes, and also to enable
  you, without arousing suspicion by appearing to neglect business here, to
  attend to other irons equally as despicable that you had in the fire at the
  same time&mdash;playing the flopper, for instance, up on Fifth Avenue. The
  whole outlay probably cost you but a few dollars&mdash;and in return you
  meant to get all of this woman&rsquo;s life savings. I say all, because you
  probably found out how much she had, and if she had had much more than eight
  hundred dollars you would have set your fake loss higher. And to-night in
  some way&mdash;the details do not matter at this moment&mdash;you stole from
  her that chamois bag, both to impress her with the belief that the boy had
  stolen from her too, and also to secure spurious evidence to prove that he
  had been guilty of what you claimed had happened here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane paused. His eyes had travelled to the wrecked safe&mdash;and
  sharp and quick had come the thought of Whitie Jack. He smiled grimly. He
  did not want Whitie Jack to appear in this. He owed Whitie Jack a good deal
  to-night&mdash;and the &ldquo;Rat&rdquo; never forgot! His eyes came back
  to Marco. The man was circling his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going up for this, Marco,&rdquo; Billy Kane said in
  level tones. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll give you a friendly tip&mdash;for reasons
  of my own. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t pull this safe-cracking game yourself,
  maybe your alibi stands on that count; but, if it does, you got some tool
  to pull it off for you just for that reason, and possibly also because you
  didn&rsquo;t know how to handle the &lsquo;soup&rsquo; yourself&mdash;and
  if it&rsquo;s one of the boys it won&rsquo;t help your case any to snitch
  on him, for you&rsquo;re caught open and shut in this anyhow, and maybe,
  Laverto, some of his friends might remember it when you <i>got out</i> again!
  You get the idea, don&rsquo;t you? Yes, I see you do! Well, then, there&rsquo;s
  just one thing more. If this little game of yours had broken right for you,
  Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s son&mdash;to make it appear that he had run away&mdash;would
  have had to disappear for several days, until you could have pulled up stakes
  here without exciting suspicion, and have pretended to move away. Therefore,
  where is he now&mdash;Laverto?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were beads of sweat on the man&rsquo;s forehead. His lips moved mumblingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Where?</i>&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s revolver edged viciously
  forward. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wong Yen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the man whispered.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s jaws snapped together. He had heard of Wong Yen&rsquo;s!
  It was one of the most infamous Chinese underground dives in the Bad Lands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doped?&rdquo; He bit off the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man whispered again.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane turned to Mrs. Clancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s yours now, Mrs. Clancy. You know the story, and you know
  where to send them for your boy. I guess I can leave him to you. They say
  the female of the species is more deadly than the male! There&rsquo;s his
  revolver. Do you think you could march him out of the front door, and hand
  him over to the first officer you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a bitter, hard look on Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s face. Big and brawny,
  she towered over the cringing figure of the Italian&mdash;and the Italian
  shrank still farther away from her, as she snatched up the weapon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can!&rdquo; she said, and her short laugh was not a pleasant one. &ldquo;And
  I can shoot if I have to, and, faith, there&rsquo;d be joy in the doin&rsquo; of
  it; but you&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  know who you are, and I owe you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was backing toward the rear door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay it all, and more, Mrs. Clancy, when you hand him
  over to the police,&rdquo; he said quickly&mdash;and, stepping out into the
  passageway, he ran down its length, whipping the mask from his face as he
  went; and in another instant, from the lane, had gained the cross street.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  A Midnight Visitor</h2>
  <p>Keeping in the shadows and avoiding the passers-by as on his way to Marco&rsquo;s,
  Billy Kane hurried even more now on his return to the Rat&rsquo;s. In a moment
  or so, when Mrs. Clancy reached the front street with her prisoner, there
  was likely to be an uproar, and he wanted to be housed and under cover if
  possible before that broke loose. Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s story could hardly
  omit reference to the man in the mask, and the police, to say nothing of
  the on-lookers, might evince a most unpleasant degree of practical curiosity&mdash;and
  he, Billy Kane, was in no condition, either mental, or, above all, physical,
  to play hare to the hounds of the law again that night. He was conscious
  now, as he made his way swiftly along, that his shoulder was paining him
  intensely again, and that, though through nerve force, his feet moved quickly
  enough under him, his knees were wobbly and weak.</p>
  <p>He turned a corner, and still another&mdash;and drew a deep breath of relief.
  He was out of range of the second-hand shop now, and the Rat&rsquo;s den
  was just ahead up the street, and there was no one in sight.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane swept his hand heavily across his eyes. It was strange! There
  was not far from being a very close analogy between himself and Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s
  son to-night. Mrs. Clancy&rsquo;s son had been selected as the victim of
  a &ldquo;plant&rdquo; much like himself&mdash;only there had been no murder,
  and the &ldquo;plant&rdquo; had failed. It was curious, very curious, that
  the two should have been so much alike, and that though he had been able
  to save the other, he himself was being searched for at that moment in every
  corner of New York, and that the human drag-net was spread for him, and that
  the wires all over the country were hot with his description, and that into
  every newspaper office in every state was pouring the story that would make
  of him an abominable and an abandoned thing!</p>
  <p>His head was singing. He stumbled a little, as he made his way down the
  stairs, and fumbled with Whitie Jack&rsquo;s key in the lock of the Rat&rsquo;s
  door. Well, if the Rat, who was away, did not return too soon, and if&mdash;he
  shook his head, as he opened the door, and stepped inside, and locked it
  behind him&mdash;no, he was too tired, and too near the breaking point to
  think any more. He had a chance to rest now until morning. Whitie Jack had
  said that no one would dare disturb the Rat, and that was enough&mdash;he
  did not want to think any more&mdash;until morning.</p>
  <p>He groped his way forward to the electric light, reached up to turn it on&mdash;and,
  with his arm poised in mid-air, stood suddenly tense and rigid. He listened.
  It came again&mdash;as though some one were knocking cautiously on the wall&mdash;and
  it seemed to come from the far end of the room near the bureau.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand shot into his pocket and closed on his revolver;
  and, quick and silent in every movement now, he tiptoed across the room in
  the darkness, slipped in behind the cretonne hanging and waited, peering
  through a corner of the hanging.</p>
  <p>And now it was absolutely silent again. Perhaps a half minute passed, and
  then, grotesquely, as though it came through the wall itself, the white ray
  of a flashlight streamed into the room, and circled it slowly and deliberately.
  And then a form moved forward&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s form&mdash;and crossed
  the room to the table. There was a slight sound as of the rustling of paper,
  and, with the ray now flooding the top of the table, Billy Kane could see
  that she was writing; but her back was turned, and he could not see her face.
  For a moment more she stood there bending over the table, and then, turning,
  she retreated again to the rear of the room.</p>
  <p>The flashlight now was full on the rear wall&mdash;but there was no opening
  there. Billy Kane leaned tensely forward, watching through the corner of
  the hanging. This den of the Rat&rsquo;s that he, or fate for him, had appropriated,
  promised much more than appeared on the surface! It was obvious that there
  was another entrance than that from the street, and to obtain its secret
  now was a matter upon which his life, sooner or later, might very easily
  depend.</p>
  <p>She was stooping now slightly, and her hand in the glare of the flashlight
  was moving in a slow, tentative way up and down one of the wall boards&mdash;and
  then her hand for an instant remained motionless. Billy Kane drew in his
  breath softly. It was ingenious, clever, cunning&mdash;and a craftsman&rsquo;s
  work. A small door swung open into the room&mdash;a most curious door! Its
  top was of an absurd zigzag shape&mdash;due to the fact that it followed
  the natural joints of the wall boards. And the whole, three boards in width,
  in no part therefore, to casual or even critical examination, would show
  any signs of an opening, since it opened only where boards joined one another,
  and since everywhere in the room all the wall boards were more or less warped
  and ill-fitting!</p>
  <p>The light was suddenly shaded, obliterated almost, as she passed through
  the opening&mdash;and then was blotted out. The door had closed without a
  sound. She was gone.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not move. His eyes, as though fascinated, as though fearful
  that he might lose it, were fixed through the darkness on the particular
  spot on the wall where this strange midnight visitor had run her hand up
  and down. A minute, two, three, passed. Wherever that opening led to, she
  must be far enough away now to make it safe for him to act. But he dared
  not turn on the electric light. It might throw a glimmer to the street. He
  was none too sure of either the sill or panels of that front door! Whitie
  Jack had passed the word around of the Rat&rsquo;s return&mdash;was this
  woman one to whom that word had come? In any case, she had thought the room
  empty, the Rat away, and therefore he could not run the risk of exposing
  the fact that he had been <i>hidden</i> there&mdash;he knew too little&mdash;and
  perhaps already too much!</p>
  <p>He stepped silently over to the wall now. If he only had a match! But he
  had lost his match-safe with his coat&mdash;no, there were matches here,
  a box of them&mdash;his fingers had been mechanically searching his pockets&mdash;he
  had forgotten&mdash;it was not even the coat Whitie Jack had given him at
  the second-hand shop, it was the Rat&rsquo;s coat now he was wearing!</p>
  <p>He struck a match, located the board, pressed his hand up and down its length,
  and felt something give slightly. The door began to swing open. He blew out
  the match instantly, and, crouched there, listened. He could hear nothing.
  He lighted another match, and this time held it above his head. A short,
  tunnel-like passage through the ground, strongly braced and stayed, and trending
  gently upward, confronted him.</p>
  <p>He stepped forward into the opening, and, bending head and shoulders, for
  the roof was scarcely four feet in height, followed the passage for some
  five or six yards to where it ended abruptly in a blank wall of earth, but
  where, above his head, a third match disclosed a trap-door. Again Billy Kane
  listened, and then cautiously raised the door. It was pitch black now. He
  drew himself up, and once more listened. There was no sound. He lighted another
  match&mdash;the stub of the one before being carefully consigned to his pocket&mdash;and
  nodded his head in understanding. The passage had led him into a shed, evidently
  little used, for it was littered and stored with odds and ends that, judging
  from the accumulated dust and dirt, had been untouched for a long time; and
  the shed itself&mdash;yes, he was right&mdash;he had pushed the back door
  open a little&mdash;the shed gave directly on a lane.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane closed the shed door; and, noting with grim appreciation that
  the trap-door, as he closed it above his head, was an ingenious arrangement
  of the floor planking similar to the construction of the door within the
  Rat&rsquo;s quarters, and was moreover, as an added precaution, surrounded
  by an apparently careless stowage of the shed&rsquo;s litter, he made his
  way back along the passage again. The room door he examined as he passed
  through. It was manipulated from the <i>inside</i> of the passage by an ordinary
  and frankly obvious spring lock. He closed it, and stood for a moment staring
  at it speculatively. There seemed no way of locking it here in the room,
  of protecting himself from an intrusion through the night that might not
  be either as instructive or as harmless as this first one had been. There
  might be a way, and there probably was a way of fastening it, the Rat would
  surely have seen to that, but he, Billy Kane, was too far gone, too weak,
  too tired, too nearly all in to hunt or search for it now&mdash;and there <i>was</i> a
  way of obviating the possibility of the door being opened without first arousing
  him and putting him on his guard. He went to the table, picked up a chair,
  and, carrying it back, tilted it against the door in the wall.</p>
  <p>And now he swayed a little, and his hand sought his eyes. He was conscious
  again of his aching shoulder, and that his head was swimming dizzily&mdash;but
  he seemed to have forgotten something&mdash;yes, he remembered now&mdash;that
  paper&mdash;that paper on which she had written something. He laughed in
  a strained, almost delirious way. He must be worse than he imagined, if he
  had, even for an instant, forgotten that! Or was it just simply the reaction
  coming now?</p>
  <p>He stumbled toward the table, and, feeling with his hand, secured the paper&mdash;but
  there was no chair here now, and he stumbled across the room, and sat down
  on the edge of the bed. He lighted another match, held it close to the paper,
  and read the pencilled lines.</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">So you are back, are you?<br>
 Well, so am I!&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Remember!</i></p>
  <p>The match burned down to his fingers, and he dropped it on the floor. What
  did it mean? Who was she? He shook his head. And then, with a queer, twisted
  smile, he folded the paper, thrust it into his pocket&mdash;and, stretching
  himself out fully dressed upon the bed, lay there staring into the darkness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Whispering Shadows</h2>
  <p>It was the next evening&mdash;in the Rat&rsquo;s den. Through half closed
  eyes, as he lay stretched out on the bed, Billy Kane watched Whitie Jack
  across the room. The man was tilted back in his chair, his legs were sprawled
  across the table, and from his cigarette, which dangled from one corner of
  his lower lip, a thread of blue smoke spiraled lazily upward. Whitie Jack
  was not smoking; the cigarette simply hung forgotten on the man&rsquo;s lip.
  For the moment Whitie Jack with bated interest was poring over the evening
  paper.</p>
  <p>And then Whitie Jack looked up suddenly, and spoke&mdash;out of the unoccupied
  corner of his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, dat secretary guy dat croaked de old geezer last night was a
  sweet, downy bird&mdash;nit! But believe me, he made some haul&mdash;<i>some</i> haul!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane made no reply. Whitie Jack resumed his absorbing perusal of the
  newspaper. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes closed completely&mdash;but not in sleep.
  It had been a day that, viewed in retrospect, made the brain whirl. It had
  been a wild untrammelled phantasmagoria. That was it&mdash;phantasmagoria.
  There was no other word. The day was expressed in shadows, moving shadows,
  shadows that came and went, many of them, shadows that were paradoxically
  real and concrete, and shadows that were the reflection of things felt and
  sensed, but unseen. And these latter, the shadows of the mind, were weird,
  uncanny things like denizens out of some black world apart&mdash;ghoulish
  things. And the shadows that were real and concrete, that spoke and whispered,
  seemed to take it for granted that he was and always had been in their evil
  confidence, and so their words were not rounded out, and there was only the
  hint of dark and hideous things in which he was supposed to have his part.
  It had been a day of mutterings, of whisperings, of skulking things that
  had fled the sunlight. The brain and mind was in riot from it. It was evening
  now; it had been the strangest day through which any man had ever lived.</p>
  <p>He had held court that morning and through the day, here in the Rat&rsquo;s
  lair&mdash;a sort of grim, unholy court to which grim, unholy courtiers had
  flocked to pay him homage. And these courtiers had been admitted to the presence
  one by one, their names announced by Whitie Jack, who had acted&mdash;quite
  innocently, quite free from any thought of connivance&mdash;as the master
  of ceremonies. Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips twisted in a mirthless smile. It had
  been very simple, that part of it; much more simple than he had dared to
  hope it would be. Bundy Morgan, alias the Rat, was supposed to know all those
  who composed the &eacute;lite of the underworld intimately and well&mdash;but
  Billy Kane upon whom fate had thrust for the moment the personality and entity
  of Bundy Morgan, alias the Rat, knew none of them. And yet it had been simple&mdash;so
  simple that, against the peril, the certain death that would follow fast
  on the heels of even a misplaced word or an unguarded look, it had been even
  grotesquely absurd in its simplicity. Through the dens and dives of the Bad
  Lands, spread by Whitie Jack when he had gone away the night before, the
  whisper had passed that the Rat had returned; and so, throughout the day,
  stealthy footsteps had descended from the street to the basement door here,
  and in response to the knock Whitie Jack had opened the door a cautious inch,
  peering out; and then he, Billy Kane, from the bed, his voice querulous for
  the occasion, had demanded who it was, and Whitie Jack had answered&mdash;and
  the unsuspected introduction thus performed, he had bidden Whitie Jack admit
  the visitor.</p>
  <p>There had been many like that&mdash;very many. And he had learned many things.
  His hands clenched suddenly at his sides. The r&ocirc;le he played promised
  well! Innuendoes, words toying with the fringe of things, had made it only
  too glaringly clear that the Rat was enmeshed in devilishness that ran the
  gamut of every crime in the decalogue. And for the moment he was the Rat!
  There was some hell&rsquo;s syndicate, whose scope and power he could only
  dimly plumb though he was satisfied that its branches were rooted in every
  nook and corner of the underworld. And of this syndicate he was now, by proxy,
  a member; and he was not only a member, but he was one of those magnates
  of crime who composed its inner council, its unhallowed directorate.</p>
  <p>He twisted a little on the bed&mdash;more in mental than in physical unrest.
  His wounded shoulder was still far from healed of course, but it gave him
  very little discomfort, and in no way interfered with his freedom of action&mdash;but
  it had been the safer way, this accentuating of his hurt, this pretended
  state of semi-helplessness. It had brought those he must know <i>here</i> to
  him; it had brought about those unsuspected introductions without which,
  had he first left this lair of the Rat&rsquo;s and attempted, trusting to
  luck, to pick up the threads of the Rat&rsquo;s life, would inevitably have
  plunged him in his blind groping to certain destruction. Also it had brought
  him a quite thorough understanding of Whitie Jack&mdash;the man&rsquo;s deference
  that had been almost cringing at their first meeting, and then the man&rsquo;s
  subsequent eagerness to serve.</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack was one of the lesser breed that looked up to the heights the
  Rat had attained with both awe and unbounded admiration. The man had come
  like a dog to heel, but like a faithful dog. Whitie Jack was living in a
  sort of reflected glory&mdash;he would be the envy of the proletariat of
  the Bad Lands&mdash;he was associating now, was even on terms of certain
  intimacy, with one of those in high places in that inglorious commonwealth
  of crime to which, both by birth and inclination, he owed allegiance. It
  opened a new prospect to Whitie Jack, one that was full of dazzling possibilities&mdash;and
  it had made of the man an invaluable ally. Whitie Jack had been at once valet,
  nurse, surgeon and attendant all through the day. He had returned at daylight
  that morning, dressed the wound, and thereafter had not left the place except
  to go out and buy certain necessities, such as food&mdash;and a pocket flashlight,
  which Billy Kane, mindful of his previous night&rsquo;s experience in the
  underground passage to the shed and lane, had ranked amongst those necessities
  as the first on the list.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shifted his position restlessly on the bed again. His mind was
  in a turmoil of feverish activity. It seemed as though a thousand divergent
  thoughts fought with each other to obtain undivided attention and recognition
  each for itself, and the battle went on incessantly. Who was the woman who
  had crept in here in the darkness through that secret door last night? What
  did it mean, that message she had written and left on the table? &ldquo;So
  you are back, are you? Well, so am I! <i>Remember!</i>&rdquo; There was something
  malignant, something ominous in that word&mdash;&ldquo;remember.&rdquo; Remember
  what? Why? What sinister thing was it that lay between her and the Rat&mdash;that
  he, Billy Kane, must now accept and stand sponsor for&mdash;since he was
  now the Rat!</p>
  <p>The Rat! The Rat! The Rat! His brain was off again at another tangent. In
  Heaven&rsquo;s name, who was the Rat? Where was the Rat at this moment? When
  would the Rat return? Guarded questions all through the day helped him little.
  The Rat&rsquo;s absence had been accepted, that was all&mdash;none seemed
  to know, or have any interest in the cause of it. One ray of reassurance
  only had filtered through the murk. The Rat&rsquo;s return in his, Billy
  Kane&rsquo;s, person, had seemingly been premature, the Rat had seemingly
  not been expected; and he could argue from that, and with fair logic, that
  he might for a little while at least be left undisturbed in his possession
  of the Rat&rsquo;s personality, and the Rat&rsquo;s belongings&mdash;as far
  as the Rat was concerned. The Rat! Those innuendoes, those whispers, those
  shadows, that strange woman&rsquo;s stranger message were back again, seething
  and boiling in his brain. Naked ugliness! What mess of iniquity was the Rat
  not mixed up in! And what mess of iniquity might not he, Billy Kane, accepted
  without question as the Rat now, with the Rat&rsquo;s face and features,
  with the Rat&rsquo;s satanic partnerships, be forced to wallow in to save
  his life, and, more than life, to&mdash;</p>
  <p>The paper rustled in Whitie Jack&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some haul!&rdquo; Whitie Jack rolled the words on his tongue like
  some sweet morsel. &ldquo;S&rsquo;help me! Five hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth
  of rubies! Dat guy Kane is some slick gazabo! Say, d&rsquo;youse get it,
  Bundy? Five hundred thousand&mdash;an&rsquo; a bunch of de green stuff, too!&rdquo; He
  licked his lips. &ldquo;Some haul!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The paper had exaggerated. David Ellsworth&rsquo;s rubies at the outside
  would not exceed three hundred thousand dollars in value. Billy Kane found
  himself curiously and querulously irritated at the inaccuracy. He opened
  his eyes, nodded unconcernedly at Whitie Jack&mdash;and closed his eyes again.
  His mind was suddenly alert and concentrated. In a few minutes now some of
  those who composed that inner council of crime would be here. He had arranged
  that this morning&mdash;with Red Vallon. Red Vallon was the biggest gangster
  in New York. Whitie Jack had dropped that information in an enthusiastic
  eulogy of Red Vallon. And Vallon had bent over the bed that morning and whispered
  of a meeting to-night at the usual time and place. But he, Billy Kane, was
  not ready for that yet. He knew too little, it was too great a risk; and
  he knew too much&mdash;to escape alive, if a chance word or act betrayed
  him. But there had come a thought, swift, in a blinding flash, a staggering
  thing, a gambler&rsquo;s stake, and he had whispered back what was apparently
  the obvious reply&mdash;that he was too badly hurt to go. And then: &ldquo;One
  or two of you slip in here on your way over,&rdquo; he had said quickly. &ldquo;Get
  me? I&rsquo;ve got something!&rdquo; And Red Vallon had agreed&mdash;and
  with Red Vallon would come Karlin. Karlin! The name had somehow seemed familiar;
  but though Whitie Jack had subsequently furnished a partial clew by referring
  to Karlin as one of the high-brow lawyers of the city, he could not definitely
  place the man.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane turned on his side, with his face away from Whitie Jack. Red
  Vallon and Karlin would be here in a few moments&mdash;and he must make no
  mistake now. What he meant to do was an impudent thing&mdash;impudent with
  a Titanic impudence. He meant to pit the underworld in a fight on the side
  of justice against the police. He meant to use the craft, the cunning and
  the stealth of the Bad Lands to establish his innocence. He too had read
  the papers&mdash;the morning and the evening papers&mdash;and the headlines
  had shrieked out at him the infamy of which he was accused. His name was
  a by-word now from one end of the country to the other. A viper and a degraded
  wretch, a thing inhuman and apart, the papers had called him.</p>
  <p>He had read them all to the last word. Murderer of his benefactor! A thief&mdash;an
  assassin thief, who had fled for his life with those blood-red rubies! A
  bead of sweat came out on his forehead, and he raised his hand and brushed
  it away. Yes, he had fled&mdash;to fight&mdash;to take the only chance he
  had of bringing to justice the hell-hounds who had struck down his old friend,
  the only chance he had of clearing his own name.</p>
  <p>Well, he would fight! It was beginning now, that fight. But he was between
  two fires that threatened him at any instant with destruction. The police,
  not only in New York, but from the Atlantic to the Pacific, would search
  ceaselessly for him, and if he were caught it was death. Fate, that had made
  him the double of a character that ironically seemed to measure up to everything
  the papers had said about himself, had thrown in that way a temporary mantle
  of protection over him, but let that mantle slip but ever so slightly and
  he would better a thousand times hand himself over to the law and have done
  with it&mdash;the end would be more merciful!</p>
  <p>But fate, too, had given him a weapon with which to fight; and, two-edged
  though it was, with a chance always that it might turn upon himself, he meant
  to use it now&mdash;and that weapon was the underworld. He did not know yet,
  he was not sure yet just how high he stood in that unsavory command, but
  he had discounted rather than overrated his power, and he believed he had
  power enough for his purpose&mdash;those whispers and those shadows had seemed
  to assure him of that. The Rat seemed to be the driving strategical force
  in this crime syndicate that appeared to permeate the Bad Lands with its
  influence, and move and sway the underworld at its own imperious pleasure&mdash;and
  for the moment he was the Rat!</p>
  <p>There was Jackson&mdash;and Jackson was dead. His mind had flown off at
  another apparently irrelevant tangent. But it was not irrelevant. The papers
  had said that Jackson, the footman, had died that morning after lingering
  in a semi-conscious state through the night. Jackson was the single clue
  in his possession. Jackson, he knew, was one of the murderers, but Jackson
  was the <i>only</i> man he knew who was concerned in that devil&rsquo;s work
  last night&mdash;and Jackson was dead. And now he, Billy Kane, was &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; on
  a double charge of murder&mdash;for the murder of Jackson, who had probably
  himself struck old David Ellsworth down, as well as for the murderer of the
  old millionaire! Yet Jackson, even if dead, must still have left some clue
  behind him, if only that clue could be found. Who was Jackson? The man had
  already been in service at David Ellsworth&rsquo;s before he, Billy Kane,
  had gone there as the old philanthropist&rsquo;s secretary, and he had naturally
  had neither motive nor interest then in any of the footman&rsquo;s personal
  concerns. But those facts were vital now. Who was Jackson? Where had the
  man come from? Who were&mdash;</p>
  <p>Footsteps were descending from the street. There was a low knock, twice
  repeated on the door. Whitie Jack was on his feet, and looking inquiringly
  toward the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watch yourself!&rdquo; said Billy Kane gruffly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  not entertaining to-night, except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;I know!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack. He crossed the room,
  and, opening the door a crack, peered out. &ldquo;Red and Karlin,&rdquo; he
  informed Billy Kane in a whisper.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  A Leash Is Slipped</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane lighted a cigarette. Red Vallon he already knew&mdash;-Karlin
  he was <i>supposed</i> to know. &ldquo;Let them in,&rdquo; instructed Billy
  Kane.</p>
  <p>He raised himself on his elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Karlin!&rdquo; he greeted, as the two men stepped into the
  room. &ldquo;Red&rsquo;s told you I was laid up&mdash;-eh? Glad to see you!
  Shake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes, half closed, fixed on the other in scrutiny, as the man advanced
  toward the bed. Karlin was immaculately dressed&mdash;in sharp contrast to
  the untidy and careless attire of the stocky, brutal-faced gangster who followed
  close at his heels. The man was tall, slimly built, and, save that the black
  eyes were too close together and too small, had a pleasant and attractive
  face. It was a mask perhaps! The smile was too engaging; and it was rather
  curious how small the ears were, and how tightly they hugged the skull. He
  toyed with a little black Vandyke beard, as he shook hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same to you, Bundy!&rdquo; The voice was soft, silky, persuasive. &ldquo;Glad
  you&rsquo;re back, too!&rdquo; He made an almost imperceptible movement with
  his head toward Whitie Jack, who still remained near the door.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon was more blunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about <i>him</i>, Bundy?&rdquo; he growled, and jerked a thumb
  in Whitie Jack&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;We got to mosey along as soon as
  we can. Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Billy Kane. &ldquo;Whitie, you take a holiday for
  the night. Come back in the morning. Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cigarette hanging on Whitie Jack&rsquo;s lip drooped in sudden dejection;
  but if he swallowed hard to choke back what was evidently a very grievous
  disappointment, he made no demur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Bundy, if youse says so,&rdquo; he blurted out, and went
  from the room, closing the door behind him.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s footfalls mounting the cellar-like stairs to the street
  died away, and for a moment there was no sound except for a faint, irregular <i>tapping</i> from
  the floor above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Karlin sharply.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane blew a ring of smoke ceilingward, and lazily watched it dissolve
  into air. Whitie Jack, through judicious prodding, had served him well that
  day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Ignace&mdash;keeps the cobbler&rsquo;s shop above&mdash;half
  blind, and has to work overtime&mdash;wife&rsquo;s nearly seventy, and deaf.&rdquo; Billy
  Kane was explaining almost wearily. &ldquo;What do you think I hang onto
  this hole for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; grunted Red Vallon corroboratingly. &ldquo;But Karlin&rsquo;s
  never been here before.&rdquo; He pushed a chair with the toe of his boot
  across the floor toward Karlin, and appropriated one beside the table for
  himself. &ldquo;Well, spill it, Bundy!&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;We got to
  hurry! It&rsquo;s too bad you&rsquo;re laid up an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t sit
  in on the showdown, but Merxler&rsquo;s plum&rsquo;s got ripe, an&rsquo; we
  got to pick it to-night. Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane duplicated the first smoke ring. Merxler! He had identified Karlin
  now! Karlin and Merxler! That was where he had heard Karlin&rsquo;s name&mdash;in
  connection with Merxler&mdash;and it must, necessarily then be the same Merxler.
  Was young Merxler, whom he had heard of and had even met through David Ellsworth,
  more then than simply the notorious spendthrift that he was credited with
  being? Karlin, it was obvious, was leading a double life. Was Merxler another
  of the inner circle, another from the higher ranks of society&mdash;and the
  greater criminal therefor!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Piker stuff!&rdquo; commented Billy Kane complacently.</p>
  <p>Karlin leaned forward with a jerk in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Piker stuff!&rdquo; he ejaculated, and the little black eyes contracted
  and fixed on Billy Kane in a puzzled glitter. &ldquo;Piker stuff!&rdquo; he
  echoed challengingly.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded indifferently. He was skating on thin ice, on perilously
  thin ice. Whatever the &ldquo;Merxler plum&rdquo; might be, it was obviously
  far from the definition he had given it, and having apparently displayed
  an intimacy with the affair, an intimacy that he was evidently supposed to
  possess, it was decidedly best left alone!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; he drawled deliberately. &ldquo;Piker
  stuff&mdash;compared with what I&rsquo;ve got. I told you I had something,
  Red&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon hitched sideways in his chair, his head thrust forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to it, Bundy! Spill it!&rdquo; He circled his lips with his tongue. &ldquo;If
  you say so, that goes! What&rsquo;s the lay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five hundred thousand dollars&mdash;a half million&mdash;cold&rdquo;&mdash;Billy
  Kane had lowered his voice.</p>
  <p>He did not look at either of the men, but he was watching them both intently&mdash;his
  eyes were on the mirror, the mirror of the bureau at the far end of the room,
  that bore testimony to the cunning of his unwitting host. The mirror held
  the door and the upper part of the room in focus; and, lying there on the
  bed, he had the profiles of the two men in distinct outline. Karlin was fingering
  his Vandyke in a sort of hesitant incredulity. Vallon&rsquo;s face had suddenly
  blotched red with rapacious excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; Red Vallon spluttered out. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mean that,
  Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I mean it!&rdquo; Billy Kane answered a little curtly. &ldquo;What
  do you think I told you to come here for? Sure, I mean it! It&rsquo;s all
  there&mdash;right on the table, hitting you between the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon jerked himself around; and, as though he had taken the words
  literally, stared with a frown of bewilderment at the only thing in view
  upon the table&mdash;the newspaper that Whitie Jack had dropped there when
  he had answered the summons at the door.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane laughed quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get it, Red?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Five hundred thousand dollars&mdash;better
  than diamonds&mdash;blood-red rubies&mdash;red with blood, the paper says.
  Can&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Karlin had forgotten his beard. His hands clenched on his knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean the Ellsworth murder&mdash;the robbery?&rdquo; He was whispering
  hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You win!&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; whispered Karlin. &ldquo;Do you know where that stuff
  is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes had returned to the mirror, and now suddenly they
  shifted a little to the wall at the side of the bureau. Something cold and
  forbidding seemed to grip at him, numbing for an instant mental and physical
  action&mdash;and then left him in a state of grim, unnatural calmness. Was
  it imagination? He could have sworn that the wall <i>moved</i> slightly.
  He swung over on his left side, as though to face Karlin and Red Vallon more
  directly before he answered them&mdash;but his hand, slipping into his coat
  pocket, closed over his revolver. It <i>might</i> be imagination, but the
  possibility remained that someone was on the other side of that secret door,
  and, having pushed the door almost imperceptibly open, was listening there.
  If that were so, he must get rid of Red Vallon and Karlin before any d&eacute;nouement
  came if possible, get rid of them without an instant&rsquo;s loss of time;
  but equally vital was the necessity of setting in motion, and equally without
  loss of time, the machinery of the underworld upon which now he was practically
  staking his all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull your chair over here, closer to the bed, Red&mdash;and you,
  too, Karlin,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t likely to be heard
  from the street, but that&rsquo;s no reason for shouting. No; I don&rsquo;t
  know where they are, I haven&rsquo;t got the rubies in my pocket&mdash;but
  I know how to get them there. What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon&rsquo;s face was working in a sort of anticipatory and avaricious
  ugliness; Karlin&rsquo;s expression was scarcely less rapacious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Bundy!&rdquo; Karlin said under his breath. &ldquo;What do
  you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What you could have read for yourself in the paper,&rdquo; Billy
  Kane answered tersely. &ldquo;And it looks like a cinch. It&rsquo;s just
  a case of beating the police to it, and it sizes up as though we had the
  jump on them.&rdquo; He was speaking almost mechanically. His mind was on
  that section of the wall that <i>might</i> have moved; and through half-closed
  eyes, but as though deep in thought and as though concentrated on what he
  was saying, he was watching it narrowly. It had not moved a second time,
  of that he was sure; perhaps it had not moved at all, it might be only nerves
  on his part, nerves high strung, taut to the breaking point, but his fingers
  were still rigid around the stock of his revolver, and, in the pocket, the
  weapon, resting on his hip as he lay sideways, held a bead on the panels
  of the secret door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite get you,&rdquo; muttered Karlin, with a frown.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon swore roughly, intolerant in his eagerness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, give him a chance!&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;If he says
  so, that&rsquo;s good enough for me. Bundy never pulled a steer in his life,
  an&rsquo; if he says this is a cinch&mdash;that goes! Give him a chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
  thousand to one shot that this secretary chap who croaked the old millionaire
  and got away with the goods is still in New Work. Why? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell
  you why. After pulling the murder, according to the papers, he beat it out
  of the house with the loot, and evidently hid the stuff somewhere. Then he
  came back to the house again, and the footman, Jackson, grabbed him. But
  there was a good half hour between the time the police found out about the
  murder and before this guy Kane came back to the house. Get me? And during
  that time the police got busy and shot flycops around all the stations and
  ferries. It&rsquo;s a cinch, the way I look at it, that after he crawled
  into that lane and they lost him there, that he&rsquo;s been crawling ever
  since somewhere around New York. He never left the city&mdash;he never had
  a chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon whistled low and complacently under his breath; Karlin, fingering
  his Vandyke again, nodded sharply now in approval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Billy Kane, &ldquo;he had sort of queered his
  own game. He&rsquo;d hidden the loot somewhere, and he couldn&rsquo;t make
  a direct get-away then. He had to get hold of the goods again before he went.
  All right! What I want to know is who&rsquo;s got the better chance of grabbing
  him&mdash;us or the police? He isn&rsquo;t one of us. He&rsquo;s working
  on his own. Well, all right! If we nip him, and he&rsquo;s satisfied with
  a little rake-off, and is willing to cough up the rest, that&rsquo;ll be
  treating him fair. If he isn&rsquo;t strong on coughing up, we&rsquo;ll find
  another way of making him come across that he won&rsquo;t like so well, and
  we&rsquo;ll get the half million, and he&rsquo;ll get&mdash;&rdquo; Billy
  Kane completed his sentence with a significant shrug of his shoulder.</p>
  <p>An oath, the more callous and brutal for the soft purring way in which it
  fell from his lips, came from Red Vallon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want done, Bundy?&rdquo; Karlin was terse and to the
  point. &ldquo;It looks good to me, if you can pull it off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the biggest haul we&rsquo;ll ever get our mitts on if
  we live a hundred years!&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes shifted for an instant
  from the wall to fix themselves impressively on the two men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  been lying here all day thinking it out. What do I want done? Well, I&rsquo;ll
  tell you! I want every string and every wire we&rsquo;ve got pulled. Savvy?
  We&rsquo;ve got to beat the police to it. We&rsquo;ve got to get Kane&mdash;<i>first</i>.
  I want all the boys that the bulls think they&rsquo;ve got sewed up as stool
  pigeons to stool-pigeon the police and get all the inside dope. And then
  that fellow Jackson, the footman, looks like a bet we can&rsquo;t throw down.
  He&rsquo;s dead&mdash;but he looks like a good bet. He lived all through
  the night, but the papers don&rsquo;t say anything about the story he told.
  Perhaps he knew something that will help, perhaps he didn&rsquo;t; but he
  doesn&rsquo;t go into the discard yet. Find out who he was and all about
  him, and get next to his family if he&rsquo;s got one. If he told any story
  to the police, any of the family that were clustering around the bedside
  will be wise to it. Get the idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Birdie Rose is the boy for that!&rdquo; Red Vallon&rsquo;s bullet
  head was thrust forward in vicious earnestness, his red-rimmed black eyes
  were glittering with a feverish light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let Birdie go to it, then!&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Birdie was slated for the Merxler affair to-night.&rdquo; Karlin
  spoke a little dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shift him!&rdquo; snapped Billy Kane curtly. &ldquo;Red&rsquo;s right!
  Birdie&rsquo;s the boy for this job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; agreed Karlin, and shrugged his shoulders. He turned
  to Red Vallon. &ldquo;Put Bull McCann in Birdie&rsquo;s place, then. See
  that he gets to Jerry&rsquo;s back room before ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it!&rdquo; grunted Red Vallon. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  next, Bundy? This goes&mdash;all the boys&rsquo;ll fall for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing more&mdash;until something begins to
  crack open.&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips had tightened, his eyelids had
  drooped still lower. It was only a bare fraction of an inch at most&mdash;if
  at all&mdash;but it seemed that door had moved again. His words were coming
  barely above a whisper now. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one way he can get
  anything out of those rubies, and that&rsquo;s through a &lsquo;fence.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re
  no good to him unless he can cash in. He&rsquo;ll try to get rid of some
  of them as soon as he can. How soon depends on how well he knows his way
  about. But he&rsquo;s probably slick enough to have got a line on a blind
  uncle or two. All right! The police, of course, have passed the word down
  the line, but here&rsquo;s where we put one over on the police. There&rsquo;s
  some of the joints they don&rsquo;t know&mdash;we know them all. Kane might
  get away from the police there&mdash;but he can&rsquo;t get away from <i>us</i> on
  that deal. I want every &lsquo;fence&rsquo; in New York tipped off that he&rsquo;s
  to stall on the job the minute he gets his lamps on a ruby that&rsquo;s being
  shoved his way, and that instead of opening up to the police he&rsquo;s to
  wise us up on the hop. That&rsquo;s all for a starter&mdash;and now go to
  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon drew in his breath noisily, as though he were sucking at some
  luscious and juicy fruit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some head, Bundy!&rdquo; he applauded with undisguised admiration,
  as he pushed away his chair and stood up. &ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ll go to
  it! Karlin&rsquo;s running the Merxler game to-night; but I&rsquo;ll start
  this other thing bumping along on the high gear. What about the reports?
  Who&rsquo;ll the boys make &rsquo;em to? You? Here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a moment before Billy Kane answered. It was the one thing he must
  have, the one thing upon which he was staking everything&mdash;an intimate
  knowledge of the result of every move made in this game that he had initiated,
  and, beyond that again, it was vital that he, and no one else should control
  each successive move. But Whitie Jack was gone for the night. In one way
  he deplored that fact, in another way he was relieved. If it was only imagination,
  if there was no one crouching there now on the other side of that secret
  door, Whitie Jack&rsquo;s presence would not matter, but otherwise&mdash;his
  mind leaped to that other point&mdash;if Whitie Jack was not here to perform
  those very necessary introductions, and Red Vallon&rsquo;s messengers came,
  messengers that he would be supposed to know but would not be able to recognize,
  it would spell almost certain disaster, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything likely to break to-night, Red,&rdquo; he
  said deliberately. &ldquo;If there does you look after it; or if it&rsquo;s
  anything very important you come here yourself. I want to get a night&rsquo;s
  sleep if I can, I&rsquo;m feeling pretty rocky. But I ought to be on my feet
  to-morrow, and in the morning you can swing the whole business over to me,
  and I&rsquo;ll run it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Attaboy!&rdquo; said Red Vallon heartily. &ldquo;See you in the morning,
  then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Karlin too had risen from his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Bundy!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and grinned. &ldquo;I pay
  you the compliment of being the trickiest crook unhung!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Behind The Door</h2>
  <p>The door closed behind the two men. Billy Kane lay motionless, save that,
  as they climbed to the street and their footsteps echoed back from the stairs,
  his hand, gripping his revolver, stole silently from his pocket. There was
  a grim whiteness around his set lips. His ears strained to catch the slightest
  sound from within the room, and strained to catch the last echo of those
  retreating footfalls. He dared not make a move until they were well away&mdash;out
  of earshot, say, of a revolver report. If it were fancy, if the movement
  of that door were only his imagination unhealthily stimulated, and unhealthily
  preying upon his nerves, he would at least put an end to it in short order
  now! The steps rang faintly back from the pavement, still more faintly, and
  were lost. And then Billy Kane spoke&mdash;a cold deadly monotony in his
  voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those boards are thin! Come out into the room with your hands up
  before I count three, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet through. One&mdash;two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a laugh, undisguised in its mockery, but low and musical. The
  door, bizarre and grotesque in its zigzag projections, due to its ingenious
  adherence to the natural joints in the wall boards, swung open wide, and
  a woman stood in the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was only waiting for your friends to go, Bundy,&rdquo; she said
  coolly.</p>
  <p>The revolver sagged a little in Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand. He could not see
  her face very well, the single incandescent dangling from the ceiling was
  miserably inadequate, but dark eyes flashed at him out of an oval face, and
  the chin thrown up gave a glimpse of the contour of a full throat, ivory
  white&mdash;and all this was merged in the background of a slender figure
  clothed and cloaked in some dark material, unrelieved by a single vistage
  of color.</p>
  <p>She spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are quite as badly hurt as you pretend, Bundy,&rdquo; she
  said, with a sort of icy composure. &ldquo;You were out last night when I
  came here, and if you could prowl around the streets, I think perhaps you
  could manage now to get from the bed over to the door there and back again
  without doing yourself any serious injury. The door has been unlocked since
  Red Vallon went out, and it might be safer&mdash;locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not answer her. He got up, crossed to the door, locked it,
  and, returning, sat down on the edge of the bed. She had not moved from her
  position near the far end of the room. He became conscious that he was still
  holding his revolver in his hand, and he thrust the weapon quietly now into
  his pocket. A grim smile came and hovered on his lips. This complication,
  another of the ramifications of his stolen identity, he did not understand
  at all&mdash;except that it promised him no good. She was the author of last
  night&rsquo;s note&mdash;she had just said as much&mdash;and the wording
  of that note was not reassuring as to her attitude toward him, nor was the
  mockery in her laugh, nor was the self-contained, almost contemptuous note
  of command with which she had just spoken. Who was she? What was she to the
  Rat, that she knew the secret of that underground tunnel, and the secret
  of that door?</p>
  <p>He jerked his hand toward the chair Red Vallon had vacated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; There was a tingle of irony in
  his voice. His invitation was at least safe ground.</p>
  <p>She came forward toward the table, a subtle, supple grace in her movements.
  Subconsciously he noted that she made no sound as she crossed the room. She
  was like a cat&mdash;but a very beautiful cat. He could see her face better
  now. The eyes were hard and unfriendly, but they were great, brown, steady
  eyes of unfathomable depths.</p>
  <p>She leaned against the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I prefer to stand.&rdquo; There was a challenge in her tones. &ldquo;What
  I have to say will not take long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane waited. The initiative was with her. He meant it to remain so.
  Her small white hand, ungloved, clenched suddenly at her side until its knuckles
  stood out like little chalky knobs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You look sleeker about the face, clearer about the eyes&mdash;you
  beast!&rdquo; There was a studied deliberation in her voice that gave the
  words the sting of a curling whip lash. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were listening there at the door?&rdquo; suggested Billy Kane
  imperturbably, as he reached into his pocket for a cigarette.</p>
  <p>There was a mocking little lift to her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course! That is what I came for. I followed Red Vallon here. I
  supposed that you would meet at the old place, now that you are back; but
  since you are an invalid&mdash;&rdquo; Again the shoulders lifted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid it hardly paid you for the trouble&mdash;to listen,&rdquo; Billy
  Kane murmured caustically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry! I rather fancied I saw
  the door move, and you see, my illness has affected my voice, and at times
  I can scarcely speak above a whisper, otherwise you might have overheard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I overheard enough!&rdquo; She took a sudden step toward him. Her
  eyes were flashing now; there was a flush, angry red, mounting from the white
  throat, suffusing her cheeks. She raised her clenched hands. &ldquo;You will
  die with insolence and bravado on your lips, I believe!&rdquo; she cried
  out passionately. &ldquo;How I <i>hate</i> you! But I&rsquo;ve got you&mdash;like <i>that</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she
  flung out an arm toward him, and the small clenched hand opened and then
  closed again, slowly, as though in its grip it were remorselessly crushing
  and exterminating some abhorrent thing. And then her hand was raised again,
  and was brushed across her eyes, and a little quiver ran through her form,
  and she spoke more calmly. &ldquo;I overheard enough. I thought this Merxler
  affair would be worked to-night, and I came to tell you that you are to stop
  it. I came to tell you to&mdash;<i>remember</i>! I promise, before God, that
  if there is murder done to-night you will be in the hands of the police within
  an hour. And it&rsquo;s not very far from the Tombs to the death chair in
  Sing Sing&mdash;Bundy Morgan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes were hidden by drooped lids. His eyes were studying
  with curious abstraction the pattern of the faded, greasy, threadbare strip
  of carpet on the floor beside the bed. Murder! The word had come with a shock
  that for a moment unnerved him. He had not associated anything that Red Vallon
  or Karlin had said with murder. They had spoken so lightly, referred to it
  in so humdrum a way. Murder! There was something ghastly in that lightness
  now. A tightness came to his lips, a horror was creeping into his soul. He
  was only on the verge of things, of hidden and abominable things, here in
  this shadow land, this night land of skulking shapes, this sordid realm of
  the underworld. He pulled himself together. He was the Rat&mdash;he had a
  part to play. He was conscious that those brown, fearless eyes were fixed
  on him contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I to do with it?&rdquo; he muttered sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do with it! <i>You!</i>&rdquo; Her voice rose, as though suddenly
  out of control. &ldquo;You dare ask that! You, with your devil&rsquo;s brains&mdash;you,
  who planned it all before you went away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cigarette that he had lighted had gone out. He sucked at it, circling
  it around his lips. He was fencing now with unbuttoned foils.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve said it!&rdquo; There was a snarl creeping into
  his voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away. I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ve
  done since I&rsquo;ve been away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know about the will, and the sealed envelope in Merxler&rsquo;s
  safe, and you know the combination to the safe,&rdquo; she said levelly. &ldquo;And
  that&rsquo;s all you need to know to stop this from going any further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed out shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And suppose I don&rsquo;t know the combination! You don&rsquo;t think
  I can carry a thing like that in my head forever, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. She smiled curiously, and one hand slipped into
  the bodice of her dress. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever did memorize
  that combination. But perhaps you will recognize it again&mdash;the original
  in your own handwriting.&rdquo; She held up a crumpled piece of paper before
  him, then tossed it on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; he demanded roughly.</p>
  <p>Her shoulders lifted mockingly again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are other secrets in this room besides that door and the tunnel
  to the shed, aren&rsquo;t there&mdash;Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He eyed her now for a long minute, biting openly at his lip, his face twisted
  in a well-simulated ugly scowl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m to queer this game, am I?&rdquo; he snarled suddenly. &ldquo;And
  if I&rsquo;m caught&mdash;as a snitch&mdash;they&rsquo;ll tear me to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She leaned a little forward from the table, a tense, lithe thing, and her
  voice came low with passion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting time&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve none to lose. We&rsquo;ve
  gone over this ground before, haven&rsquo;t we? It&rsquo;s the one chance
  you have&mdash;to save yourself. Some day you won&rsquo;t be able to save
  yourself. Some day the reckoning will come; but you will always have the <i>hope</i> that
  it won&rsquo;t, and that you will always succeed in staving it off each time
  as you have in the past. But until that day does come the only chance you
  have for life is to pit your wits against the fiends like yourself that are
  around you. For what you have done there is no atonement&mdash;only punishment.
  I mean you to live in suspense, but even while that suspense lasts you will
  pull apart and unravel your devil&rsquo;s work as fast as you knit it together.
  You have a chance that way! When the end comes and they get you, you know
  how the underworld will pay&mdash;but there is the chance&mdash;that is what
  holds you&mdash;and with the alternative&mdash;the police&mdash;there is
  no chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was breathing hard. She leaned back against the table, her hands gripped
  tightly at its edge.</p>
  <p>For a moment there was silence in the room. Billy Kane&rsquo;s mind was
  groping blindly now, as in some utter darkness. In some way, for there was
  no question of the genuineness of her self-assurance, her very presence here
  in seemingly placing herself in the Rat&rsquo;s power proved that she held
  the Rat, and the Rat&rsquo;s life and liberty in the hollow of her hand,
  at her beck and call. How? What was the secret of the power she possessed
  over him? He lighted a match nonchalantly, and, as he applied the flame to
  the half-burned cigarette he lifted his eyes to her through the blue haze
  of smoke that he blew negligently in her direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said in a low, menacing tone, &ldquo;people,
  even women, who grow troublesome, have been known in this neighborhood&mdash;to
  disappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She laughed sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have no time to waste in foolish words!&rdquo; she warned him
  curtly. &ldquo;You know the consequences of my&mdash;disappearance. You are
  at liberty to take those consequences any time you choose. But you do not
  like them, do you&mdash;Bundy?&rdquo; She moved suddenly across the room,
  back to the secret door through which she had entered. &ldquo;I am going
  now,&rdquo; she said steadily. &ldquo;If there is murder to-night, or if
  any part of that plan goes through&mdash;<i>remember!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Pieces Of A Puzzle</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane made no effort to stop her, as she closed the door silently behind
  her. She was gone. The minutes passed, and he still sat there on the side
  of the bed, his eyes mechanically fixed on the spot, an innocent blank wall
  now, where she had disappeared. His face, hard and set at first, grew harder.
  What was he to do? There seemed to yawn before him, to have opened at his
  feet an abyss, bottomless, pitiless, and he tottered on the brink of it,
  and unseen hands reached up and snatched at him to drag him from the narrow
  ledge that was all that was left to him of safety. What was he to do? To
  go on? Every hour that he clung to this role of the Rat held a surer promise,
  not only of desperate peril to himself, but a promise that he would find
  himself launched in a sea of crime, of shuddering things, of murder, of blood,
  of sordid viciousness, of hate. In God&rsquo;s name, who was this Rat, who
  in this hole here with its secret opening and its gnawed tunnel to the daylight
  made the pseudonym so apt!</p>
  <p>He clenched his hands suddenly, and rising to his feet began to pace the
  room. He began to see now what, strangely enough, though it should have been
  plainly obvious all through that day, he had not seen until she, this unknown,
  mysterious woman, had, herself unconscious of it, made him see. Her power
  over the Rat to which he was subject in his assumed character, did not, in
  the final analysis, whatever the source of that power might be, materially
  affect the situation. It was not her threat that was the driving force that
  must actuate him. There was another and a far greater force which he could
  neither ignore nor escape. He saw that now. If the foreknowledge of proposed
  crime came to him, he was as guilty, if he stood idly by, as those who became
  the actual perpetrators of that crime. To-night, if there was to be murder
  done, and it was within his power to prevent that murder, or even if it were
  only within his power to attempt to prevent that murder&mdash;and he did
  nothing&mdash;he was a murderer himself. And so to-night he had no choice.
  He must act. It did not seem to him that there had been any question in his
  mind about this in a specific way at all from the moment she had spoken of
  murder. But afterwards&mdash;if he went on&mdash;the crimes that Red Vallon
  and Karlin and their confederates would plot, and that he would know of&mdash;what
  then?</p>
  <p>He halted by the table, and laughed in a short, harsh way, and in the dark
  eyes there burned a sudden fire. Was there really any question about that,
  either? Had there ever been! He asked only one thing in life now, and to
  that everything else was subordinate&mdash;to feel his hands upon the throat
  of the man who had murdered David Ellsworth, and who had fastened that guilt
  upon him&mdash;Billy Kane&mdash;to wring from that man a confession that
  would clear his name. Nothing else mattered. He could run for it, discard
  this r&ocirc;le of the Rat, and perhaps effect his escape, but he would thereby
  throw away almost every hope of bringing the guilty man to justice. The other
  way was to fight. Well, he would fight! It would be a good fight! And, as
  the Rat, he would not have to fight alone! If he accepted the chances as
  they stood, he must accept the risk involved in foiling the plots and crimes
  of those who thought him their confederate; but against this, the first step
  already inaugurated, he had the craft and cunning of the underworld at his
  back in the one purpose that meant anything to him now. It would be a good
  fight! If he failed, he might as well go out this way as any other&mdash;better
  this way, for then at least some of the projected deviltry would never know
  fruition. He drew in his breath sharply as in a sort of strange relief. It
  was settled now, once for all! He would go on&mdash;as the Rat&mdash;to the
  end. And to-night he would see this Merxler plot through to the end.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane picked up the crumpled piece of paper she had dropped on the
  table, studied it for an instant, then placed it in his pocket. It contained
  the scrawled figures of a safe&rsquo;s combination, nothing more. And now,
  glancing at his watch and finding that it was already a little after eight
  o&rsquo;clock, Billy Kane worked quickly. The mask that had served him the
  night before was already in his pocket, as was his revolver. To these he
  added the electric flashlight that Whitie Jack had procured for him that
  morning, and, from where they dangled in the lock of the door, Whitie Jack&rsquo;s
  bunch of skeleton keys. He extinguished the light; then passing out through
  the secret door, which he closed carefully behind him, he made his way quickly
  through the little underground passage, gained the shed through the trap-door,
  emerged on the lane, and from there, cautiously, he reached the street.</p>
  <p>He walked rapidly now, but keeping always in the shadows, shunning the direct
  rays of the street lamps. He cared nothing for the police; his danger did
  not lie in that direction. Seen anywhere in the city by either police or
  plain-clothes man he would be recognized, not as Billy Kane, but as the Rat&mdash;and
  the authorities, he was fairly well satisfied, had no particular or immediate
  interest in the Rat. His danger lay to-night in an unlucky recognition by
  some prowler of the underworld, the report of which might reach the ears
  of Red Vallon and his crowd. Supposed to be confined to bed, pleading physical
  inability to take his place at that unhallowed council board of which he
  was accepted as a member, it would be very awkward to explain his presence
  on the street within half an hour after Red Vallon and Karlin had left his
  room! To-morrow, the day after, it would be a different matter, he could
  go and come then as he pleased, but to-night it multiplied his difficulties
  and his dangers a thousandfold. And yet, after all, that was the most simple
  of the problems that confronted him&mdash;with luck, he could see his way
  out of that. But for the rest, he was almost like a blind man groping his
  way along in what was already near to an inextricable maze. He knew something
  of Merxler both by sight and hearsay, he knew where Merxler lived, that there
  was a will in the safe which he must secure, that he possessed the combination
  of the safe, and that afterwards there was &ldquo;the back door of Jerry&rsquo;s
  before ten,&rdquo; which referred undoubtedly to the notorious gambling hell
  of that name, and that in these fragments, once pieced together, there was
  murder&mdash;that was all he knew. And there was something grim, and horribly
  ironic, and mocking, and something forbidding, and ominous and premonitory
  in the fact that he was supposed to know <i>all</i>!</p>
  <p>The street for the moment in his immediate vicinity was deserted, and just
  well enough within the radius of a street lamp to enable him to see, he drew
  the package of money from his vest pocket that the old millionaire had confided
  to his keeping the night before. He selected several bills of the smaller
  denominations, placed them in his trousers&rsquo; pocket, and returned the
  package to the inside pocket of his vest. Thank God for the money! He had
  enough in the bank twice over to replace this two thousand that now belonged
  to the Ellsworth estate, but he could not get it! He was a fugitive from
  the law! But this should see him through&mdash;by the time two thousand was
  exhausted he must either have won or lost. He smiled a little bitterly. Win
  or lose, the estate at least would get its two thousand back! If he won,
  he would pay it back himself; if he lost&mdash;well, his money in the bank
  had probably already been attached!</p>
  <p>And now he retreated to the shadows of the buildings again as he went along.
  His surreptitious excursion from the Rat&rsquo;s den last night had, to one
  who knew the East Side as intimately as he knew it, supplied him with a mental
  map, as it were, of the neighborhood in which the Rat had chosen to reside.
  A block further on was The Purple Scarf, a so-called Bohemian restaurant
  and dance hall, as lurid as its name, that for the moment was the craze with
  the slummers and those of New York&rsquo;s upper strata who aped all things
  Bohemian&mdash;and from early evening until early morning a line of taxis
  waited to snatch their share of the spoils from the free-handed and, quite
  often, hilarious clientele. It was a taxi that he wanted&mdash;without attracting
  any unnecessary attention to himself&mdash;a taxi that he could not stand
  on a crowded thoroughfare and hail&mdash;and there was, as usual, a line
  of them there now in front of the restaurant.</p>
  <p>He reached the corner, drew his hat far down over his eyes, stepped out
  into the street, and approached the last taxi in the line from the side away
  from the curb. The chauffeur was nodding in his seat. Billy Kane touched
  the man on the arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to go up to the Nineties&mdash;Broadway&mdash;probably several
  places after that,&rdquo; said Billy Kane pleasantly.</p>
  <p>The chauffeur yawned, and shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; for a party in there.&rdquo; He jerked his
  hand toward the restaurant. &ldquo;I got a fare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you have,&rdquo; said Billy Kane coolly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got me.&rdquo; He extended a ten-dollar bill. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another
  one just like this, perhaps more than one, coming later&mdash;on top of the
  fare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chauffeur grinned, pocketed the banknote, and, leaning out, opened the
  door. His grin broadened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you say the address was?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one I gave you will do for the present,&rdquo; Billy Kane answered
  quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know where to stop. Get up there as fast
  as you can. I&rsquo;m paying for speed to-night. Get the idea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave it to me!&rdquo; said the chauffeur. &ldquo;Hop in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane settled back in the seat. The car swung out of the line, shot
  forward, and took the first corner on little better than two wheels. Billy
  Kane smiled grimly. Between here and that purposely vague address in the
  Nineties which he had given, the chauffeur could very obviously be depended
  upon to do his part! In the meanwhile, and for the first time, he, Billy
  Kane, had an opportunity to study those scattered pieces of the puzzle in
  detail.</p>
  <p>He lighted a cigarette. That there should be a will in Merxler&rsquo;s safe
  at all had a nasty look&mdash;unless it were Merxler&rsquo;s own will, which
  was altogether too highly improbable a supposition to be entertained seriously.
  And besides, in that case, what was Karlin&rsquo;s, and Red Vallon&rsquo;s,
  and the underworld&rsquo;s interest in the matter? He shook his head decisively.
  The existence of a will did not tend to place young Merxler in an enviable
  light.</p>
  <p>Merxler&rsquo;s uncle, a man by the name of Theodore Rodgers, who had died
  some few months before, had been quite an intimate friend of David Ellsworth&mdash;that
  was where his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, personal knowledge of Merxler came from.
  He had met Rodgers several times at the old millionaire&rsquo;s home; and
  once he had met the nephew there as well. The two did not get on very well
  together. Young Merxler was a notorious &ldquo;high-roller.&rdquo; Left a
  large fortune by his father two years ago, he had squandered it to the last
  copper. Theodore Rodgers, his uncle, had time and again, both privately and
  publicly, stated that he would have nothing more to do with the boy. That
  was the gist of it. It had occasioned some surprise then that, when Rodgers
  had died, it was found that he had taken no steps to keep his money, what
  he had of it, some sixty or seventy thousand dollars, out of the young spendthrift&rsquo;s
  hands. But no will had been found. Rodgers was a bachelor; young Clayton
  Merxler was a dead sister&rsquo;s only son&mdash;and Merxler had inherited
  as next of kin, and had promptly moved his family&mdash;he was married&mdash;into
  his late uncle&rsquo;s residence.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane finished his cigarette, and finished still another, as the taxi
  made its way uptown. There had never been anything criminal, so far as was
  known, about young Merxler, nothing wrong up to now, except that he had gone
  the pace, and that, perhaps more than anything else, he had been a foolish
  and unbalanced boy and had lost his head; but now there were two very unpleasant
  facts that loomed up insistently. First, it was common knowledge that at
  the time of his uncle&rsquo;s death young Merxler was having an exceedingly
  hard time of it to make both ends meet. And, second, was the fact that Karlin
  was in this too. Knowing Karlin now for what Karlin really was, it looked
  ugly enough for young Merxler. Karlin, accepted in the upper circles in which
  he moved, as a respected citizen and an excellent attorney, had always been
  trusted as a friend and the legal adviser of both young Merxler&rsquo;s father
  and uncle&mdash;which placed him now in a position where he could be a very
  useful, if not indispensable confederate in assisting Merxler to enter without
  obstacle into the possession of his uncle&rsquo;s estate.</p>
  <p>The minutes passed. Billy Kane, within a few blocks of his destination,
  noted the cross streets carefully now, as he shook his head again. The pieces
  did not fit so perfectly after all. Suppose that Rodgers <i>had</i> left
  a will disinheriting his nephew, and suppose that young Merxler had found
  that will and that it was in Merxler&rsquo;s safe now, and that Karlin was
  a party to it&mdash;why hadn&rsquo;t the will been <i>destroyed</i>? That
  would seem the obvious and safe thing to have done! And if Merxler and Karlin
  and Red Vallon were all hand in glove in the affair, where was the incentive
  for murder that she had spoken of? Whose murder? There was a snarl in the
  thing. He was conscious that he had not untangled it at all to his satisfaction.</p>
  <p>He tapped suddenly on the glass front, signalling the chauffeur; and, as
  the taxi drew up at the curb, he stepped quickly to the sidewalk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; he directed, and started at a brisk pace
  up the block.</p>
  <p>He turned at the first corner, heading east along the cross street. It was
  purely a residential neighborhood here. There was no other pedestrian in
  sight for the moment. Merxler&rsquo;s house was one of a row halfway up the
  block. Billy Kane&rsquo;s pace became a nonchalant stroll. He passed the
  row of houses slowly, though apparently indifferent to their existence, and
  then, retracing his steps quite as negligently, slipped suddenly into the
  shadows of a flight of high front steps, and the next instant was crouched
  against the basement door.</p>
  <p>A skeleton key from Whitie Jack&rsquo;s comprehensive assortment crept into
  the lock. It proved abortive. Billy Kane, as he made a second attempt with
  another key, was subconsciously rehearsing certain details in his mind. There
  was a light in the vestibule or front hallway above him, but the windows
  on that floor were dark. Above that again the windows were lighted, and it
  was a fair presumption that the family proper were all upstairs. There was
  probably a maid, but as there was no sign of life here in the basement it
  might well be her evening out.</p>
  <p>Again Billy Kane selected another key, still another&mdash;and then the
  door opened silently under his hand. He stepped inside, closed the door noiselessly
  behind him, and stood listening. There was no sound and no light. It was
  pitch black. He could not have seen his hand before his eyes. And then his
  flashlight winked through the black, went out, winked inquisitively again,
  and he moved forward. The stairs were just at his right, and made a right-angled
  turn halfway up. He gained the stairs and began to mount them, testing each
  separate tread cautiously before the next step was attempted. Stairs before
  now had been known to creak out discordantly! Billy Kane smiled in a grim,
  mirthless way. He was becoming an adept at this burglarious trade where silence
  was so prime a factor. Since last night he&mdash;</p>
  <p><i>What was that?</i> </p>
  <p>He felt his muscles, as though without volition of his, strain suddenly
  and grow rigid. He was halfway up the stairs now, and he drew back into the
  angle made by the turn, his body hugged tight against the wall. What was
  that! He thought he had heard a sound as of someone moving in the hall above,
  but it was gone now and there was only a stillness in the house, a stillness
  that, as he listened, became exaggerated until it seemed to possess noises
  of its own that began to throb, and pound, and palpitate, and make his eardrums
  ring, and&mdash;<i>no!</i>&mdash;there it was again&mdash;a light, quick
  step&mdash;and, unmistakably now, upon the topmost stair.</p>
  <p>It was inky black. He could not see. He pressed still closer, flattening
  himself against the wall. The step was very light, scarcely audible; a woman&rsquo;s
  step probably, and probably the maid&rsquo;s. Billy Kane held his breath.
  If he were found here, discovered, caught, the Rat would&mdash;He did not
  care to dwell upon the consequences.</p>
  <p>Something, a shapeless thing, a deeper, shadowy blackness passed by him.
  It seemed to escape contact with him by the barest fraction of an inch. He
  heard the sound of breathing&mdash;then a step along the passageway below&mdash;and
  the basement door closed quietly. There was silence again, save for that
  din infernal that beat at his eardrums. He lifted his hand to his forehead&mdash;it
  was moist as he brought it away again.</p>
  <p>A moment more, and he was grimly composed again. It was the maid probably.
  That seemed the natural conclusion. Who else would have gone out by the basement
  door? Well, if that were so, he was left now with almost unrestricted freedom
  of action; the family being all upstairs, he might reasonably expect to have
  the first floor quite to himself without very great fear of interruption.</p>
  <p>He crept on up the stairs, and reached the main hallway. Here the dim light
  in the vestibule sifting down the length of the hall metamorphosed the blackness
  into a murky gloom. He listened again. A murmur of voices came intermittently
  from above. There was no other sound.</p>
  <p>There was a door at his right. He opened it silently, and stepped through
  into the room beyond. He closed the door, and the flashlight winked out again.
  He was in luck now! This, at the first venture, was the room he was looking
  for. The round, white ray of the flashlight, cutting a filmy path through
  the darkness, fell upon the nickel dial of a small safe that stood against
  the opposite wall. He crossed to the safe, knelt before it, and took the
  crumpled piece of paper that bore the combination from his pocket. Thereafter
  for a moment, as his fingers moved swiftly, the silence was broken by the
  faint, musical whirling of the dial&mdash;and then a low, metallic thud,
  as he shot the lever over&mdash;and the safe door swung open.</p>
  <p>The ray from the flashlight flooded the interior of the safe. It was a small
  safe, but even so it was evidently more than large enough for its requirements.
  On the floor of the safe was a package of securities, held together by broad
  elastic bands, but the pigeon-holes were but sparsely filled, some being
  entirely empty. A few minutes&rsquo; examination disposed of the pigeon-holes&mdash;and
  the skeleton keys came into service again on a little locked drawer. The
  drawer contained a single envelope, sealed. He slit the envelope open. It
  contained two folded sheets of paper. He examined only one of them, and that
  only to the extent of glancing at the first few words: &ldquo;I, Theodore
  Rodgers, being of sane mind and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face darkened, as he thrust the envelope into his pocket
  and locked the drawer. It was true then! His lips pursed grimly, as his eyes
  fell upon the package of securities again. He took up the package and riffled
  it tentatively through his fingers. Theodore Rodgers had perhaps been a little
  eccentric&mdash;if eccentricity was defined by a divergence from the general
  habits and customs of others! He had made no secret that he kept his securities
  in his own safe, preferring that method to depositing them in a safe-deposit
  vault, and claiming that, as the securities were made out in his name and
  were therefore valueless to anyone else, they offered no temptation for robbery.
  Young Merxler had evidently followed in his uncle&rsquo;s footsteps in this
  particular! But Theodore Rodgers had been credited with being worth in the
  neighborhood of seventy thousand dollars! Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips pursed
  tighter, as he replaced the package of bonds and stock certificates in the
  safe, and closed and locked the safe door. At a generous estimate there remained
  no more than twelve or fifteen thousand dollars. Young Merxler, in the brief
  period following his uncle&rsquo;s death, had evidently done well!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane retreated from the room, descended the stairs, and let himself
  out through the basement door&mdash;and five minutes later, in his taxi,
  was being whirled downtown again. &ldquo;The back room at Jerry&rsquo;s before
  ten.&rdquo; He had directed the chauffeur to drive to a side street just
  off the Bowery near Chatham Square&mdash;that was close to Jerry&rsquo;s.
  He had looked at his watch, as he had entered the taxi. It was just nine
  o&rsquo;clock. He had therefore plenty of time now. He took the envelope
  from his pocket and extracted the two folded sheets. There was not light
  enough to read by, but that was quite easily rectified. He had his flashlight.</p>
  <p>He bent well down toward the floor of the cab so as not to attract the chauffeur&rsquo;s
  attention, read both of the papers, read them again&mdash;and a look of stunned
  surprise and bewilderment settled on his face. One was a will, evidently
  drawn and written by Rodgers himself, and duly witnessed, bequeathing practically
  everything to charity, and specifying four or five different organizations
  as the beneficiaries. It appointed Karlin, who was referred to as a &ldquo;trusted
  and lifelong friend,&rdquo; the sole executor; and, &ldquo;as a mark of personal
  esteem,&rdquo; and as a &ldquo;slight compensation&rdquo; for the administration
  of the estate, left Karlin a legacy of two thousand five hundred dollars.
  The other paper was a letter signed by young Merxler. Billy Kane read this
  again for the third time:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;If I die before Karlin does, this is a joke on Karlin; if Karlin
  dies before I do the will and this letter go into the fire. Damn him&mdash;I
  hate him! He&rsquo;s a smooth oily-tongued hypocrite! It was Karlin more
  than anybody else who backed my uncle up in the idea of cutting me off. Well,
  I guess this is where I get even! If there&rsquo;s two thousand five hundred
  dollars left when I get through, I hope Karlin will enjoy it&mdash;but there
  won&rsquo;t be! I just wanted him to know how thoughtful my uncle was, and
  it was worth the risk of keeping the cursed will for the sake of the jolt
  it will give Karlin&rsquo;s miserly, snivelling soul. If there&rsquo;s anything
  Karlin loves, it&rsquo;s money. If Karlin&rsquo;s got any God at all, it&rsquo;s
  money. He worships that, all right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the letter veered abruptly into direct address:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll break your heart, Karlin, won&rsquo;t it, to think I
  spent two thousand five hundred dollars of <i>your</i> money! That&rsquo;s
  the joke, Karlin! It&rsquo;s rich, isn&rsquo;t it? And I just want to tell
  you, too, that you had the will in your own hands once&mdash;and overlooked
  the bet! That&rsquo;s where you slipped up, Karlin. It was the day my uncle
  died, and we were going over the papers together. It was in a plain, unsealed
  envelope&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t look like anything. You tossed it on a heap
  of other stuff to be looked into later&mdash;all you could think of was counting
  stocks and bonds, getting your fingers into money&mdash;that you didn&rsquo;t
  know was yours&mdash;some of it, anyway! I was looking for something else&mdash;and
  found it. I only had to read about two words and see that it was in my uncle&rsquo;s
  handwriting, and&mdash;well, since you&rsquo;re the executor, you&rsquo;ll
  find it enclosed herewith!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Clayton Merxler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane refolded the papers, returned them to the envelope, restored
  the envelope and flashlight to his pockets, and leaned back in his seat.
  The taxi lurched and swayed along at a pace that gave small deference or
  heed to speed laws. Billy Kane stared out of the window.</p>
  <p>The letter was viciously facetious, callous and unscrupulous. The boy was
  a self-confessed and blatantly unrepentant thief. In that at least his first
  supposition had evidently been justified, and it was quite clear now why
  Merxler had not destroyed the will&mdash;but otherwise the whole affair had
  now assumed an entirely different aspect. Instead of Karlin being in league
  with Merxler, Karlin, unknown to Merxler, it now appeared, was aware of the
  existence of the will&mdash;and Karlin, if <i>she</i> had not exaggerated,
  meant murder. And, since no one else was involved, meant Merxler&rsquo;s
  murder.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face hardened in perplexity. But why? What could Karlin
  hope to gain thereby? Certainly it was not on account of the little legacy
  of two thousand five hundred dollars&mdash;Karlin had only to expose the
  fact that the will existed to obtain that. And that applied equally to the
  executorship. And what good could the executorship do Karlin? With the stocks
  and bonds there open to inspection and their value known, Karlin&rsquo;s
  executorship could afford no opportunity for crooked work&mdash;he could
  simply turn the securities into cash, turn the cash over to the various charities,
  and the cash must correspond with the valuation of the estate&rsquo;s schedule
  of assets. Why, then&mdash;murder? Personal enmity? No; Red Vallon and the
  underworld were interested in this, and the enmity that had caused Merxler
  to preserve the will, an enmity that no doubt was fully returned by Karlin,
  had nothing to do with Red Vallon and the rest.</p>
  <p>Five, ten, fifteen minutes went by. The taxi reached the lower section of
  the city. Billy Kane still stared from the window, his face still hard in
  perplexity. Murder! No, he did not understand. But there was still the &ldquo;back
  room at Jerry&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;where he was going now! Did the answer
  lie there? Jerry&rsquo;s, safely entrenched in one of the most abandoned
  neighborhoods of the city, was a gambling hell that yet boasted a certain
  exclusiveness&mdash;and its patrons quite made good the boast. It was an
  open secret that men whose names ranked high in the city&rsquo;s commercial
  and professional world went there for their fling. Jerry, it was said, was
  an ex-croupier from Monte Carlo, and had brought the spirit of Monte Carlo
  with him. He, Billy Kane, had heard of the place often enough&mdash;the entertainment
  was lavish, the play unlimited. Did the answer lie there&mdash;in the back
  room at Jerry&rsquo;s? He shrugged his shoulders philosophically now, and
  a grim little smile came and flickered across his lips. Well, if there were
  any means by which an uninvited guest could gain access to that back room,
  he would know within a very few minutes now!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  The Back Room At Jerry&rsquo;s</h2>
  <p>The taxi drew up to the curb. Billy Kane&rsquo;s hat was far over his eyes
  as he stepped out. He stood an instant debating with himself, then handed
  the chauffeur another bill. What might happen at Jerry&rsquo;s he did not
  know&mdash;he was going it blind again. But as a means of retreat, a taxi
  waiting around the corner would at least add to his chances, if necessity
  arose. And a chauffeur well paid was a guarantee of fidelity than which there
  was none better.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve struck a gold mine to-night,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;I
  may be gone half an hour, or I may be gone an hour&mdash;wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life, I&rsquo;ll wait!&rdquo; said the chauffeur fervently. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was hurrying down the street. He turned the first corner, and
  headed along the intersecting street, that was dark, narrow and deserted.
  He passed another cross street, and thereafter counted the houses as he went
  along. Here tenements and the old-fashioned dwellings of New York&rsquo;s
  early days incongruously rubbed shoulders with one another. Jerry&rsquo;s,
  he found, was the fifth house from the cross street. There was no mistaking
  Jerry&rsquo;s. It was one of the old private dwellings, and it had been pointed
  out to him more than once. He returned to the cross street, turned down it,
  slipped into the lane that passed in the rear of the houses he had just inspected
  from the front, and, guardedly now, making his way silently along, he again
  counted the buildings that here in the darkness loomed up like black, uncouth
  shapes against the sky line. He stopped in the rear of the fifth house. Here
  and there a thread of light showed from a window, but it was a stealthy light,
  a light that played truant through the interstices of closed shutters, or
  seeped perhaps through the folds of curtains hanging inadvertently awry.
  It was abnormally dark, and in the darkness there seemed to lurk a somber
  secrecy, like a pall, cloaking evil things.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane swung himself up and over a high fence, and dropped noiselessly
  to the ground on the other side. He found himself in a yard that, even in
  the darkness, he could make out was strangely restricted in area. A few feet
  in front of him was the wall of the building itself. He crept forward, skirting
  along this wall. There was no window, but opening almost on a level with
  the ground were shuttered French doors. He continued on, rounded the angle
  of the building, and suddenly stooped down in a crouching posture. There
  was a window here just above his head, and from it came a meager gleam of
  light. His eyes grown accustomed to the darkness, he could distinguish his
  surroundings a little more clearly now. The yard here, a narrow strip of
  it paralleling the side fence, seemed to run back quite a distance, taking
  up a jut in the building. They had puzzled him, those shuttered French doors
  where logically he had expected to find an ordinary back door and porch,
  but it was obvious now that the &ldquo;back room at Jerry&rsquo;s&rdquo; was
  an addition that had been built onto the house, extending almost to the fence
  in the rear.</p>
  <p>The window beneath which he crouched was shoulder high. He straightened
  up. The light came through slightly parted, heavy porti&egrave;res. He felt
  the blood quicken suddenly in his veins. He could see in quite well. There
  were two men in the room&mdash;Karlin, and another man whom he did not recognize.
  The room was luxuriously, if somewhat garishly furnished. A green baize card
  table, with several unopened packs of cards upon it, stood in the center;
  there was a blue-and-gold Chinese rug with a huge dragon pattern upon the
  floor; and at one side a large buffet groaned under a load of wine and whisky
  bottles, bowls of fruit, and refreshments of various descriptions. The two
  men were talking earnestly. Karlin pulled out his watch, and scowled.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips tightened. He could see, but he could not hear.
  He took his penknife from his pocket, and slipped the blade under the window
  sill. If he had luck, if the window was not locked, he&mdash;ah!&mdash;his
  breath came in a soft, long-drawn intake&mdash;the window gave slightly under
  a cautious pressure. An inch was all that was necessary, half an inch even.
  The window went up by infinitesimal fractions of that inch.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane returned the penknife to his pocket. He could hear them now.
  Karlin was speaking; and the other man, it appeared now, was the proprietor
  of the place, Jerry, the ex-croupier of Monte Carlo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Jerry&mdash;getting nervous waiting?&rdquo; said
  Karlin curtly. &ldquo;Well, forget it! This is the Rat&rsquo;s plan&mdash;and
  that ought to be good enough, what? Nothing is going wrong, nothing can go
  wrong. Certainly, the police will close you up for a month, but that&rsquo;s
  all there is to it, so far as you are concerned. They have nothing on you.
  That&rsquo;s the inside of the whole thing&mdash;that the killing is done
  in an unpremeditated, drunken brawl over cards&mdash;that it just happened&mdash;just
  an untimely end without any other strings to it! There&rsquo;s no reason
  why you should lose your nerve&mdash;your story is straight. Young Merxler
  came here often. He gives a little party here to-night. Neither you nor your
  doorkeeper knows a damned one of his guests. He vouched for them, and that&rsquo;s
  all you know. You heard a row in here, then a revolver shot, and when you
  got here the table was upset, wine, cards and glasses all over the place,
  the boys beating it out through the French doors there, and young Merxler
  dead on the floor. You just notify the police. Your loss through being closed
  for a month makes it a cinch your story&rsquo;s straight&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
  have to tell the police that your share of the split is the best bet you
  ever made in your life! Let <i>me</i> do the worrying! I&rsquo;m the one
  who&rsquo;s taking the risk. I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s been showing a
  seamy side to Merxler in confidence lately. I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s
  invited him to the party that the police will be told <i>he</i> was giving.
  You can leave it to me that nothing goes wrong. I&rsquo;ve got my own skin
  staked on this. There won&rsquo;t be any mistake made&mdash;dead men can&rsquo;t
  talk. The only thing I&rsquo;m bothering about is what is keeping Bull McCann.
  He might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew suddenly back from the window, and crouched down again against
  the wall of the building. Someone, unless he were curiously mistaken, was
  out there in the lane at the rear of the place. He was listening intently
  now&mdash;but there was a strange turmoil in his brain that seemed somehow
  to divide his attention, that had made his act of caution one that was almost
  purely automatic. Murder! That <i>casual</i> discussion of murder! There
  was something within him, soul deep, that he could not quite analyse&mdash;save
  that it seemed a lust for murder was upon him too, possessing him, engulfing
  him. Would <i>that</i> be murder? Was it murder to crush out the life of
  a poison-fanged snake! There was a fury upon him, but a most strange fury,
  a fury that was utterly cold&mdash;and utterly merciless. Murder! Yes, he
  knew now beyond question that there was to be murder, that the stage for
  it was set with a devil&rsquo;s craft, with the craft of the Rat whose identity <i>he</i> had
  assumed; that it would appear on the face of it nothing more than quite a
  logical outcome of the life led by young Merxler, that there would appear
  to be no connection whatever with young Merxler&rsquo;s death and what was
  to follow&mdash;but what was it that was to follow? How, in what way, was
  this murder, in dollars and cents, to show a profit at the next meeting of
  that unhallowed directorate of crime? How did Karlin&mdash;</p>
  <p>Strange how his mind should isolate itself from his immediate surroundings,
  and yet leave him fully conscious of those surroundings! He was still listening&mdash;listening
  intently. There was no mistake. A boot scraped against a board. Someone was
  climbing the fence. Came then the soft thud of feet dropping to the ground,
  and now a quick step across the yard.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s revolver was in his hand. If the newcomer came around
  the corner of the house, dark as it was, it was almost certain that&mdash;no!
  The other had halted evidently before those shuttered French doors, and was
  rapping softly&mdash;three raps, a single rap, two raps. The raps were repeated.
  Someone moved swiftly across the floor of the room. There was the faint clash
  of porti&egrave;re rings, and the sound of the French doors being opened.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was at the window again. A third man was in the room now. Karlin
  was speaking sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a long time coming, Bull!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The newcomer, his back turned to Billy Kane, shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to wait until Merxler went out,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t lose no time after that, an&rsquo; I came downtown as fast as
  I could. I ain&rsquo;t been much more&rsquo;n half an hour from Merxler&rsquo;s
  to here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all right!&rdquo; grunted Karlin. &ldquo;Have any trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I slipped the envelope into the
  drawer of the safe, all right. It was a cinch! The family was all upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Karlin nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are the securities?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>The man took what Billy Kane could see were a number of stock and bond certificates
  from his pocket, and handed them to Karlin.</p>
  <p>Karlin nodded again, as he ran through the papers rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much did you leave in the safe?&rdquo; he inquired crisply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What Red told me&mdash;about ten or twelve thousand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Karlin. &ldquo;Good work, Bull! Beat it, now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man turned, and left the room. Billy Kane heard him step across the
  yard, heard him climb the fence, heard Karlin within the room close the shuttered
  French doors&mdash;but this time Billy Kane made no movement, save that there
  was a curious twitching of his face muscles as his jaws locked together.
  All the bald, hellish brutality of the scheme was beginning to take form
  now in his mind. It was a plant, all of it, the letter, the will; a plant
  with the devil&rsquo;s stamp of ingenuity upon it&mdash;and it was the man
  who had just gone from the room, Bull McCann, who had passed him on that
  black stairway from the basement in Merxler&rsquo;s home!</p>
  <p>Karlin was laughing in a viciously jubilant way, as he came back to the
  ex-croupier&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand dollars!&rdquo; said Karlin, as he thrust the securities
  into the inside pocket of his coat, and patted the pocket complacently. &ldquo;Fifty
  thousand, Jerry, and all of it in Theodore Rodger&rsquo;s name&mdash;I kept
  stalling the kid on the idea of transferring the securities into his own
  name&mdash;told him there was no hurry&mdash;that he could clip the coupons
  and get the dividend checks through all right, just the same. I was his attorney
  too&mdash;see? Works pretty smooth, eh, Jerry? Too bad you didn&rsquo;t get
  a chance to have a look at that letter and the will! The Chipper did the
  job, and they&rsquo;re the best pieces of forged penwork that were ever pulled
  in America! Some head the Rat&rsquo;s got, I&rsquo;ll give him credit for
  that&mdash;he worded the letter. It&rsquo;s <i>prima facie</i> evidence that
  the kid was blowing the coin just as fast as he did when he came into his
  father&rsquo;s money&mdash;and nobody&rsquo;s surprised that most of it has
  gone up in smoke. And, besides that, it&rsquo;s a confession. Well, what
  happens? Merxler is killed in a gambling brawl&mdash;at which nobody is surprised,
  either!&mdash;his safe is opened, the will is found, and with it that little
  hymn of hate against me, which accounts for what would otherwise have been
  a fool play in having kept the will. I am found to be the executor, empowered
  to transfer and sell, and administer the estate&mdash;and we find that all
  that&rsquo;s left is about ten thousand&mdash;which is <i>all</i> I have
  to account for. I enter that as the value of the estate, split it up among
  the beneficiaries, and&rdquo;&mdash;he chuckled softly&mdash;&ldquo;I generously
  waive my claim to any share in the legacy on the score that the estate has
  been so hard hit. Neat little play, eh, Jerry? Well, after that, there&rsquo;s
  nothing to it! My signature is legally good on any document, and little by
  little, here and there, we turn the fifty thousand into the long green&mdash;and
  pocket it. If it&rsquo;s done quietly, a security or so at a time, no one
  would ever think of digging around to find out if it was one of those on
  the schedule filed by the estate. Feeling better, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ex-croupier walked over to the buffet, poured out for himself a stiff
  four fingers of whisky, and tossed off the neat spirit at a gulp. He forced
  an uneasy grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t often drink in business hours,&rdquo; he said nervously. &ldquo;But
  I&rsquo;m not used to playing this high&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;m a little shaky.
  Are you sure-fire on the witnesses to that will? Their signatures would have
  to be proved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the only things that are genuine,&rdquo; said Karlin,
  with a malicious laugh. &ldquo;We had two of our boys working around the
  hotel down on Long Island where Rodgers spent a month this spring, and where
  he is supposed to have written the will. They identify their signatures,
  and their story&rsquo;s straight. Rodgers asked them to witness his signature
  to a paper, that&rsquo;s all. He didn&rsquo;t tell them what the paper was,
  and they didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;see? If there&rsquo;s any question crops
  up, the hotel proves that the two men were its employees at the time Rodgers
  was staying there.&rdquo; He pulled out his watch again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  ten o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; he said brusquely. &ldquo;Merxler ought to be showing
  up. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ex-croupier had suddenly laid a finger to his lips in caution. A knock
  was sounding on the hall door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here he is now,&rdquo; said the ex-croupier, in a lowered voice. &ldquo;I
  told them to send him here as soon as he came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, let him in,&rdquo; instructed Karlin. &ldquo;And tell
  the boys to drift along as soon as they like. <i>It&rsquo;s the man who cuts
  the first jack.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ex-croupier opened the door, and was instantly continental in both manner
  and speech. He bowed profoundly, as a young man entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Merxler&mdash;a great pleasure! I was telling Monsieur
  Karlin that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane had drawn slightly back from the window. His lips were thinned,
  compressed. The fiendishness of it all had got him now&mdash;-Karlin with
  his suave, oily, Judas smile, preening at his Vandyke beard&mdash;and Merxler,
  for all that he had played the fool for several years now, still with a frank
  and boyish face, his broad shoulders squared back as he laughed a pleasant
  greeting. There was a whiteness in Billy Kane&rsquo;s face, a whiteness that
  was like to the fury, no longer cold, that was white-hot in his soul. Murder!
  Well, perhaps&mdash;but it would not be Merxler&rsquo;s murder! He whipped
  his mask from his pocket, and adjusted it swiftly over his face. His fingers
  automatically tested the mechanism of his revolver, as he again looked in
  through the window. The ex-croupier was bowing himself out of the room, closing
  the door behind him.</p>
  <p>Quick and silent now in every movement, Billy Kane crept around the corner
  of the house, and crouched before the shuttered French doors. He had a minute,
  perhaps two at the outside, in which to act before Karlin&rsquo;s confederates
  entered the room. He tapped softly with his revolver on the shutters&mdash;three
  raps, a single rap, two raps; he repeated it&mdash;three raps, a single rap,
  two raps.</p>
  <p>From within a step came hurriedly across the floor, there was the faint
  clashing of the curtain rings again as the porti&egrave;res were drawn aside,
  and through the interstices of the shutters came little gleams of light.
  Billy Kane shifted his grip upon his revolver&mdash;to the muzzle end. The
  doors opened a few inches cautiously. And then Karlin&rsquo;s voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? What&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Billy Kane was in action now, and the words ended in a wild shout of
  alarm. His left hand shot forward like a flash into the opening, wrenching
  the doors wide apart; and, lithe as a panther in its spring, he launched
  himself forward, and struck with the butt of his revolver, struck as he would
  have struck at a mad dog, full on Karlin&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>There was a crash as the man went limply, senseless, to the floor, and another
  cry, from Merxler now, and then, dazing Billy Kane for an instant by the
  sudden and unexpected onslaught, Merxler had sprung and locked his arms around
  him in a grip of steel. They crashed against the table, upsetting it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; Billy Kane panted frantically. &ldquo;The hall door&mdash;lock
  it! You don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer from Merxler, save another hoarse shout for help. The
  boy was fighting like a demon. Here and there about the room they lurched,
  staggered, reeled, but Billy Kane was the stronger. It seemed only by inches,
  but still by inches they were nearing the hall door. There was something
  of ghastly irony in this frenzied effort of the boy to bar his own road to
  safety; but there was something fine in it too, something that, even as he
  fought, found recognition in Billy Kane&rsquo;s mind. The boy, spendthrift
  though he might be, a fool with his money though he might be, was game to
  the core in standing by a man whom he believed to be his friend.</p>
  <p>There was an uproar now from the interior of the house. There came the rush
  of feet along the hall. Another instant and they would be at the door. Massing
  his strength for the effort, Billy Kane tore himself free, flung Merxler
  back, and plunged forward. The door was being opened now. He hurled his weight
  against it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Merxler! Quick! The inside pocket of Karlin&rsquo;s coat!&rdquo; he
  gasped out. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a yell of fury from the hall, as the door slammed shut, and Billy
  Kane turned the key&mdash;and then a crash upon it, and another, as human
  battering rams launched themselves madly against the panels. Over his shoulder
  Billy Kane saw Merxler standing hesitant, glancing in stupefaction alternately
  from the door to Karlin on the floor.</p>
  <p>A panel cracked and splintered. Billy Kane&rsquo;s revolver roared like
  a cannon shot through the room. The bullet, aimed low, ripped along the threshold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Merxler, the inside pocket of Karlin&rsquo;s coat!&rdquo; he said
  in deadly quiet. &ldquo;Man, are you mad! Hurry! They&rsquo;ll have us both
  in another minute!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The revolver shot had checked the rush against the door for an instant,
  though only for an instant, but that instant was enough. Merxler, stung into
  action, had leapt to Karlin&rsquo;s side, and was bending over the man. And
  then he was on his feet, staring wildly at the papers in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God, what&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The French doors&mdash;the fence&mdash;run for it!&rdquo; said Billy
  Kane tensely, and fired again. And the next instant the room was in darkness,
  as he switched off the light; and in another, with Merxler running now beside
  him, he had crossed the few feet of yard and was swinging himself over the
  fence.</p>
  <p>From behind came the rip and tear and smash of the yielding door, shouts,
  yells, oaths, a confusion of noises; but Billy Kane had reached the cross
  street now, and, pulling the mask from his face, jerking his hat brim far
  over his eyes, turned in the opposite direction from that in which he had
  entered the lane, and, urging Merxler on, was running at top speed. At the
  next block they swerved again&mdash;and Billy Kane, with a restraining pressure
  on Merxler&rsquo;s arm, here dropped into a slower and less noticeable pace.
  There was little or no chance of pursuit now; no one, it seemed, had taken
  the immediate initiative of following them into the lane, yet Billy Kane
  made a wide detour before he finally reached his waiting taxi cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; he said to Merxler; and, crisply, to the chauffeur: &ldquo;Drive
  as fast as you know how! Go up the street at the rear of The Purple Scarf!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He followed Merxler into the cab.</p>
  <p>Merxler drew his hand across his eyes in a dazed way, and laughed nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see your face now, and you had a mask on before,&rdquo; he
  said jerkily. &ldquo;This is a queer business! Who are you? What&rsquo;s
  it mean? Those securities were in my safe an hour ago&mdash;how did they
  get into Karlin&rsquo;s pocket? What was he doing with them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stoop over!&rdquo; said Billy Kane quietly. He handed Merxler the
  forged letter, and flashed the ray of his lamp upon the paper.</p>
  <p>His head bent forward, Merxler read the letter, and his face, already white
  under the ray, gradually took on a drawn, grayish pallor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I never wrote this,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  my handwriting, but I&mdash;I never wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor your uncle this,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, the same grim, quiet
  intonation in his voice, as he placed the will in turn in Merxler&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>
  <p>The light played on the paper, and over Merxler&rsquo;s face. Billy Kane
  sat drawn back in the shadows.</p>
  <p>There was moisture on Merxler&rsquo;s forehead, as he looked up after a
  moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;what does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The flashlight was out. It was dark in the cab now, and the taxi rattled
  on traversing block after block. Billy Kane spoke swiftly, sketching the
  events of the night. Merxler did not move, save that at the end his hand
  sought and found and closed tight upon Billy Kane&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>It was Merxler in a new light who spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve saved my life&mdash;and you haven&rsquo;t preached,&rdquo; he
  said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool! I&rsquo;ve played the fool&mdash;they
  never would have tried to get away with it if I hadn&rsquo;t played the fool
  all my life. I guess perhaps I&rsquo;ve had my lesson tonight. But fool,
  or not&rdquo;&mdash;his voice rasped suddenly, bitter hard&mdash;&ldquo;Karlin
  will pay for this, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will&mdash;yet!&rdquo; Billy Kane cut in grimly. &ldquo;You know
  too much, and you haven&rsquo;t a minute to lose. They lost their heads for
  a moment in the confusion and the darkness when we got away, but their one
  hope now will be to get you before you tell your story. They may figure that
  you will hesitate about telling it, as you would have to admit your presence
  at Jerry&rsquo;s gambling hell&mdash;and they may figure that you wouldn&rsquo;t
  act anyway before morning. Do you understand? That&rsquo;s <i>their</i> chance.
  Your chance is the police without a second&rsquo;s delay&mdash;you may even
  get Karlin before he regains consciousness, or before they try to move him,
  if you&rsquo;re quick enough. I know your story will sound strange with an
  unknown man in a mask running through it, but you have only to tell the truth.
  You have all the evidence you need. The police will know the Chipper, who
  forged the papers; and the police will know how to make those fake witnesses
  to the will squeal&mdash;it&rsquo;s a different proposition now with them
  than simply appearing before Karlin and a notary public and swearing to the
  signatures. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Merxler tersely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;ll see it through. But you&mdash;you saved my life, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get out here,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, and leaning forward suddenly,
  tapped sharply on the glass front. They had turned into the street that was
  not only in the rear of The Purple Scarf, but was equally in the rear of
  that secret entrance into the Rat&rsquo;s lair. He held out his hand to Merxler. &ldquo;Good-night,
  Merxler&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Merxler cried, as the taxi stopped, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  let you go like this! I owe you too much. Who are you? What is your name?
  Where can I find you to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find&mdash;myself,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, with
  grim whimsicality. &ldquo;Let it go at that!&rdquo; He caught Merxler&rsquo;s
  hand in a hard grip. &ldquo;Good-night, Merxler&mdash;and good luck!&rdquo; he
  said, and stepping quickly from the taxi, closed the door. He handed the
  chauffeur another bill. &ldquo;Drive this gentleman to police headquarters&mdash;fast!&rdquo; he
  ordered, and, turning, moved swiftly away down the street, hugging the shadows
  again, avoiding the rays of the street lamps.</p>
  <p>He slipped into the lane, gained the shed, and from the shed made his way
  through the underground passage to the secret door, listened here intently
  for a moment, then stepped through into the Rat&rsquo;s room, and groped
  forward toward the electric light that hung over the table.</p>
  <p>It was strange! There was something almost mockingly ironic in it all! It
  was like the night before again. In peril himself as grave as Merxler&rsquo;s,
  he had saved Merxler&mdash;and his own peril remained, was increased even,
  for the inner circle of this crime world that ranked him as a trusted confederate
  would be aroused now to an unbridled pitch of fury and excitement, seeking
  the unknown man in the mask who had foiled them to-night. Suspicious as they
  would be of every one, he now had that suspicion to combat, and he could
  ill afford that a breath of it should touch him. His all was at stake&mdash;Red
  Vallon, with the underworld at his heels, was enlisted now in a hunt for
  those rubies, which, if successful, must inevitably discover too the identity
  of the man, or men, who had murdered David Ellsworth, and who had driven
  him, Billy Kane, into this damnable exile! It was paramount, vital, that
  he should preserve his authority to keep the underworld at that work, the
  power to command, the&mdash;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane switched on the electric light, and stood staring at the table,
  grim faced, his jaws locked tight together, his hand like a flash seeking
  his revolver in his pocket. His eyes lifted, and swept around the room. The
  swift, quick glance went unrewarded. The room was apparently as he had left
  it. He crossed quickly to the street door. It was still locked.</p>
  <p>Again his eyes searched the room. He remembered that she had spoken of other
  secrets that the room possessed. What were they? Still another entrance?
  There was no sign of it! He knew only that someone had been here in his absence&mdash;and
  was now flaunting that visit in his face. Was it mockery? A warning? What?</p>
  <p>It could not have been Red Vallon, or any of his pack. It was almost certain
  that Red Vallon had no knowledge of any secret entrance, and besides it was
  too soon for Red Vallon. Was it the woman? He shook his head. It was hardly
  likely, and his reason told him no&mdash;she had been outspoken enough that
  evening, and she had given no hint of <i>this</i>. Who then? And what was
  its meaning? Was it grim mockery? A grimmer warning? What?</p>
  <p>On the table, ostentatiously placed in full view, and identified beyond
  possibility of mistake by a piece cut from the corner of the original plush
  tray on which it and many of its fellows had rested, was one of the rubies
  stolen from David Ellsworth&rsquo;s vault!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  A Clue</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes lifted from his plate, and fixed in a curiously
  introspective way on Whitie Jack&rsquo;s unhandsome and unshaven face across
  the little table. Twenty-four hours! He was out in the open now&mdash;&ldquo;convalescent.&rdquo; Twenty-four
  hours&mdash;and as far as Red Vallon and Birdie Rose were concerned specifically,
  and the underworld generally, there had been not a shred of success. He had
  unleashed the underworld, but the underworld had picked up neither thread
  nor clue; the underground clearing houses for stolen goods, the &ldquo;fences,&rdquo; had
  yielded up no single one of the rubies belonging to the Ellsworth collection;
  the lead that he had given Birdie Rose in respect of Jackson, the dead footman,
  had, up to the present at least, proved abortive.</p>
  <p>Well, perhaps he, Billy Kane, would be more successful! The twenty-four
  hours had not been wholly fruitless. Perhaps before the night was out there
  would be a different story to tell&mdash;perhaps a grim and ugly story. There
  was one clue which had developed, but a clue that was to be entrusted to
  neither Red Vallon, nor Birdie Rose, nor any of the pack. Even they, case-hardened,
  steeped in crime though they were, might balk at pushing that clue to its
  ultimate conclusion. They might weaken at the limit! He, Billy Kane, would
  not weaken, because, as between his own life and the life of one who he was
  already satisfied was a murderer, he would not fling his own life away! His
  life was at stake. Red Vallon&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t. Birdie Rose&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t.
  It made a difference in&mdash;the limit!</p>
  <p>An attendant, in a dirty, beer-stained apron, sidled to the edge of the
  table. The man had been eager in his attentions, deferential, almost obsequious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;re youse for now, Bundy?&rdquo; he inquired solicitously.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane smiled, as he shook his head and jerked his hand by way of invitation
  toward Whitie Jack. He, Billy Kane, was the Rat, alias Bundy Morgan! He had
  never in his life before been in this none-too-reputable place run by one
  Two-finger Tasker, that combined at one and the same time a restaurant and
  dance hall of the lowest type, yet he found himself not only well known but
  an honored guest! He had known of the place by name and reputation; it was
  the sort of place that seemed naturally one the Rat would frequent, and he
  had told Red Vallon that he would &ldquo;eat&rdquo; here this evening. Red
  Vallon would have to make a report somewhere, and he, Billy Kane, had become
  none too sure of his own temporary quarters&mdash;that secret door, that
  underground passage into the Rat&rsquo;s lair had not proved an altogether
  unmixed blessing! There was the Woman in Black, who had been an uninvited,
  unwelcome, and almost sinister visitor on two occasions already; and there
  was, far more disturbing still, the matter of that ruby from the Ellsworth
  collection which had found its way mysteriously to the table in that room&mdash;the
  single stone from the collection that had come to light since the murder
  two nights ago.</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack accepted the unspoken invitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gimme another mug of suds,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The glass was replenished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have pulled a good job, Whitie,&rdquo; said Billy Kane
  approvingly. &ldquo;The tenement is next to the caf&eacute; on the corner,
  eh? All right, I know the place. What next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack gulped down half the contents of his glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I did,&rdquo; he said complacently. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t
  pipin&rsquo; de lay all day for nothin&rsquo;&mdash;wot? De place has three
  floors, an&rsquo; two flats on each floor, savvy? It ain&rsquo;t much of
  a place, neither. Peters&rsquo; flat is on de second floor, on de right as
  youse go up. Dere&rsquo;s nobody at home, but he comes down dere himself
  to give de place de once-over one night a week. De family&rsquo;s away somewhere
  for a vacation, sniffin&rsquo; in de ocean breezes at some boardin&rsquo; house.
  Gee, say, de guy must have money to pull de high brow, out-of-town-in-de-summer
  stuff for de family!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded.</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack finished his glass, and drew his sleeve across his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two of de flats is vacant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One on de second
  floor, an&rsquo; one on de top. De other one on de top over Peters&rsquo; flat
  is where dat crazy old fiddler guy, Savnak, hangs out all by his lonesome.
  But Savnak won&rsquo;t bother youse none. He&rsquo;s out every night. He
  goes down to Dutchy Vetter&rsquo;s jewelry shop, an&rsquo; him an&rsquo; Dutchy,
  bein&rsquo; nuts on music an&rsquo; pinochle, dey goes to it for half de
  night. Old Savnak&rsquo;s got bats in his belfry, I guess; but I guess he
  can fiddle all right. I heard he used to be a big bug leadin&rsquo; some
  foreign or-kestra, an&rsquo; was a count or dook or something, an&rsquo; den
  de dope got him, an&rsquo; den he came out here. He ain&rsquo;t livin&rsquo; like
  a dook now, an&rsquo; I guess it takes him all his time to scratch up his
  rent. Bats, dat&rsquo;s wot he&rsquo;s got&mdash;bats an&rsquo; dope. Dey
  got him to play one night down to Heeney&rsquo;s music hall, an&rsquo; he
  went up in de air an&rsquo; quit flat &rsquo;cause de waiters kept circulatin&rsquo; around
  an&rsquo; dishin&rsquo; out de suds while he was playin&rsquo;! Say, wot
  do youse know about dat! An&rsquo; den&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stick to cases, Whitie,&rdquo; interrupted Billy Kane patiently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  expecting company in a few minutes. What about the ground floor? Who lives
  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dere!&rdquo; said Whitie Jack somewhat contemptuously. &ldquo;I
  dunno wot yer lay is, but dere&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; dere to bother youse
  neither. Dere&rsquo;s a couple of sisters about sixty years old apiece on
  one side, an&rsquo; a young guy dat&rsquo;s just got married on de other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Back entrance?&rdquo; inquired Billy Kane casually.</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;! Dere&rsquo;s
  a back yard about four inches square, but the buildin&rsquo; behind butts
  right up against it, an&rsquo; dere ain&rsquo;t no lane. But youse can get
  in de front door to-night whether it&rsquo;s locked or not, for dere ain&rsquo;t
  any street lamp near enough to do youse any harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; said Billy Kane. He pushed his plate away from
  in front of him. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better beat it now, Whitie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack, of the lesser breed of criminal, self-attached familiar to
  the man he believed to be the Rat and an aristocrat of Crimeland, rose from
  his seat with evident reluctance. There was a sort of dog-like faithfulness
  and admiration in his eyes, the same deference in his manner that seemed
  to mark the dealings of everyone in the underworld with the Rat; but the
  look on Whitie Jack&rsquo;s face was nevertheless one of undisguised disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I in on dis any more?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
  I got anything more to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. He lowered his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got more to do, and what will count for a lot more than you&rsquo;ve already
  done&mdash;keep your mouth shut tight.&rdquo; He leaned across the table,
  and his hand closed in a friendly pressure on the other&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Take
  the night off. Show up in the morning. Beat it now, Whitie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whitie Jack left the place. The waiter removed the dishes from the table.
  Billy Kane leaned back in his chair, and his eyes, the introspective stare
  back in their depths, travelled slowly over his surroundings. The tables,
  ranged around the sides of the room, were but sparsely occupied; the polished
  section of the floor in the center was deserted&mdash;it was too early for
  the votaries of the bunny-hug and the turkey-trot to start in on their nightly
  gyrations. Two-finger Tasker&rsquo;s was in a state of lethargy, as it were;
  a few hours later it would awake to a riot of hilarity, and come into its
  own with a surging crowd and packed tables, but it was too early for that
  yet.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers slipped mechanically into his vest pocket, and,
  hidden there, mechanically began to twirl a small, hard object, irregular
  in its shape, between their tips. His face hardened suddenly. The touch of
  that little object stirred up in an instant a grim flood of speculation.
  It was the ruby from the Ellsworth collection that he had found on his return
  to the Rat&rsquo;s den last night. It worried him. How had it got there?
  Who had put it there? And why? Above all&mdash;why?</p>
  <p>Only a few hours before, turning his purloined authority to account, he
  had set the underworld the task of tracing the Ellsworth collection&mdash;and
  mysteriously there had appeared upon his table this single stone, ostentatiously
  identified by a piece cut from one of the original plush trays in which the
  stones had been kept. The bare possibility that it had been Red Vallon, or
  some of his breed, who had stumbled upon the stone in their search through
  the underground exchanges, and had left it there as evidence of a partial
  success for him to find on his return, had occurred to him; but a cautious
  probing of Red Vallon that morning had put a final and emphatic negative
  on that theory.</p>
  <p>Who, then? And why? It had seemed like a ghastly jeer when he had seen that
  stone there on the table, and the prelude to some sinister act that he could
  not foresee, and against which therefore he could not prepare any defense.
  Did someone know that he was not the Rat, that, desperate, with no other
  thing to do, he had snatched at the r&ocirc;le fate had thrust out to him,
  and was playing it now?</p>
  <p>Who, then? Not the Woman in Black&mdash;her acceptance of him as the Rat
  had been altogether too genuine! Not the underworld&mdash;even a suspicion
  there would have been followed by a knife thrust long before this. Not the
  actual perpetrators of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murder, if they knew him to
  be Billy Kane&mdash;for their one aim had been to fasten the crime irrevocably
  upon him, all their hellish ingenuity had been centered on that one object,
  and they would certainly, therefore, have lost no time in giving the police,
  in some roundabout, guarded way, a tip as to his identity.</p>
  <p>His brain whirled with the problem, and ached in an actual physical sense.
  It had been aching all day. He could minimize his peril, if he cared to make
  the wish father to the thought; he could not exaggerate it. It seemed impossible
  that his identity was known, but, even so, the question as to where that
  stone had come from, and why, still remained unanswered. Was it, then&mdash;another
  possibility&mdash;the murderers of David Ellsworth, who, while still believing
  him to be the Rat, and having discovered in some way that, as the Rat, he
  was working against them, had given him this ugly and significant warning
  to keep his hands off? Well, if that were so, he was still in no less danger,
  for he must go on. To turn aside was to fail, and to fail, quite equally,
  meant death.</p>
  <p>The hard pressure of his lips curved the corners of his mouth downward in
  sharp lines. Nor was the question of that stone all! Since last night when
  the cloak of respectability had been stripped from Karlin, and the &ldquo;man
  in the mask&rdquo; had turned the tables on the crime coterie in the gambling
  hell run by Jerry, the ex-croupier of Monte Carlo, the underworld had been
  in a nasty mood, ugly, suspicious, in a ferment of unrest. It was another
  alias added to his r&ocirc;le, another alias to safeguard even more zealously,
  if possible, than his unsought r&ocirc;le of the Rat. He was the man in the
  mask. He shrugged his shoulders suddenly. Quite so! The mask was even at
  that moment in his inside coat pocket. If it were found there! He laughed
  harshly. It seemed as though he were being sucked in nearer and nearer to
  the center of some seething vortex that hungrily sought to engulf him. It
  seemed as though his brain ground and mulled around in a sort of ghastly
  cycle. When he tried to bring one thing into individual outline some other
  thing impinged, and all became a jumbled medley, like pieces of a puzzle,
  no one of which would fit into another.</p>
  <p>The underworld looked askance and whispered through the corners of its mouth
  as it asked the question: Who was the man in the mask? And he, Billy Kane,
  who could answer that question, sitting here in Two-finger Tasker&rsquo;s
  in the heart of that underworld, was asking himself another, a dozen others,
  whose answers were vital, life and death to him in the most literal sense.
  Who was the Woman in Black, who, like a Nemesis, hovered over the Rat? Where
  was the man whose personality had been so strangely thrust upon him, Billy
  Kane? When would the Rat return? Had he, Billy Kane, even the few hours at
  his disposal this evening that were necessary to enable him to run down the
  clue which he had discovered, and upon which he was banking his all now to
  clear himself, to bring to justice the murderers who had so craftily saddled
  their guilt upon him&mdash;had he even that much time before the inevitable
  crash came?</p>
  <p>This evening! Yes, this evening! His fingers came from his vest pocket,
  and his hand clenched fiercely at his side. He would go the limit. His mind
  was made up to that. He had never thought that he would consider, calculate
  and weigh the pros and cons of taking another&rsquo;s life, much less come
  to a deliberate decision to do so! But he had made that decision now; and,
  if it were necessary, he would carry it through. It seemed to affect him
  with an unnatural, cold indifference that surprised himself&mdash;that decision.
  It seemed to be only the result, the outcome that continued to concern him.
  If he had luck with him to-night he would win through. Red Vallon, Birdie
  Rose and the underworld had so far failed. He had kept prodding them on,
  and would continue to prod them on even now on the basis that he could not
  afford to let go of a single chance; but his hopes, that amounted now to
  a practical certainty of success, were almost wholly centered on his own
  efforts in the next few hours.</p>
  <p>He stirred impulsively in his chair. The murderers of David Ellsworth had
  been <i>too</i> cunning, it seemed, had overstepped themselves at last in
  their anxiety to weave their net of evidence still more irrevocably around
  him. The affair of last night, the capture of Karlin by the police, and the
  social prominence of both Karlin and Merxler, had furnished the morning papers
  with material for glaring headlines and columns of sensational &ldquo;story&rdquo;;
  but, even so, all this had not by any means overshadowed the Ellsworth murder
  and robbery. The press was still alive with it, New York was still agog with
  the old millionaire-philanthropist&rsquo;s assassination, and with what it
  believed to be the traitorous and abandoned act of, not only a trusted and
  confidential secretary, but of one who at the same time was the son of a
  lifelong friend.</p>
  <p>The blood surged burning hot into Billy Kane&rsquo;s face. From coast to
  coast they had heralded him as the vilest of his kind&mdash;he was a pariah,
  an outcast, a thing of loathing! Yes, the papers were still giving him and
  the Ellsworth murder prominence enough! But that prominence was not without
  its compensation, since it had furnished him with the clue now in his possession.</p>
  <p>The inquest had been held late yesterday afternoon, too late for more than
  brief mention in the evening papers, but this morning the papers had carried
  a full and practically verbatim report of the proceedings. He had read the
  report, not daring at first to believe what he wanted to believe, afraid
  that his eyes were playing a mocking trick upon him&mdash;and then he had
  read it again in a sort of grim, unholy joy.</p>
  <p>Jackson, the footman, who he knew was one of the murderers, was dead, and
  so far Birdie Rose had been unable to trace the man&rsquo;s family or connections;
  but Peters, the butler, was not dead, and out of Peters&rsquo; own mouth,
  in his effort apparently to seal for all time his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, guilt,
  Peters had convicted himself!</p>
  <p>True, before a jury, Peters had done himself no harm&mdash;that was the
  hellish ingenuity of the scheme that fitted in with all the rest of the devil&rsquo;s
  craft with which the affair had been planned. Peters, in the public&rsquo;s
  eyes, or before any court, was treading on safe and solid ground, for his,
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s, simple denial was worth nothing in any man&rsquo;s opinion
  to-day; but he, Billy Kane, <i>knew</i> that Peters&rsquo; testimony was
  not fact. Peters had testified that he had seen him, Billy Kane, leave the
  house about seven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;which was true. Peters had then deliberately
  testified that half an hour later, though he had not seen Mr. Kane return,
  he had seen Mr. Kane come quietly down the back stairs, and enter the library&mdash;which,
  besides being untrue, since he, Billy Kane, was not even in the house at
  that time, was also equivalent to swearing away his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s,
  life. Peters, continuing his evidence, had stated that he was quite sure
  he had not been seen by Mr. Kane, as he, Peters, at that moment was standing
  just inside the cloakroom off the hall. He did not see Mr. Kane emerge again
  from the library, but some fifteen minutes later a telephone call came in
  for Mr. Ellsworth, and, knowing Mr. Ellsworth to be in the library, he connected
  with that room. He tried several times, but could get no reply. Finally he
  went to the library door and opened it, and found Mr. Ellsworth with his
  skull crushed in, dead upon the floor, the private vault and safe open and
  looted. He at once called the police. He stated that it was obvious Mr. Kane
  had made his escape from the library through the stenographer&rsquo;s room
  at the rear, and from there to the back entrance, where, later on again,
  as the police already knew, returning once more in the hope presumably of
  recovering the card with the combinations of the safe and vault on it in
  his handwriting, he had been discovered by Jackson, the footman, and had
  killed Jackson, who had tried to capture him.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hands were shoved in an apparently nonchalant manner
  into the side pockets of his coat&mdash;to hide them from view now. The nails
  were biting into the palms of his hands. &ldquo;<i>Killed</i>&rdquo; that
  was the word Peters had used&mdash;&ldquo;killed.&rdquo; It was very subtle
  of Peters to have used that word&mdash;it just clinched the whole story with
  the seemingly obvious. Everybody believed that he, Billy Kane, had killed
  Jackson, as well as David Ellsworth. Yes, Peters had put the finishing touch
  on the evidence that was meant to free the actual perpetrators, himself quite
  evidently amongst them, from punishment, and to send him, Billy Kane, if
  caught, as their proxy to the death chair in Sing Sing.</p>
  <p>Quite so! And Peters thought himself quite safe. What had Peters to fear
  from a hunted wretch who he undoubtedly believed was miles away, fleeing
  for his life, cowering from the sight of his fellow humans, afraid to show
  his face? But Peters and his accomplices had overshot the mark! The evidence
  was final, incontrovertible, damning&mdash;only it was not <i>true</i>. He,
  Billy Kane, would not dispute it with a jury&mdash;he would put Peters on
  a witness stand of a grimmer nature than that! He had known on the night
  of the crime that Jackson, the footman, was one of the guilty men; but he
  had not suspected that the dignified, perfectly trained Peters, the butler,
  with his fastidiously trimmed, gray, mutton-chop side-whiskers, was likewise
  one of the band. And now he wondered why he had not thought of it.</p>
  <p>He saw Peters in quite a different light now! A hundred little incidents
  metamorphosed the man&rsquo;s excessive efficiency and attentiveness into
  a smug mask of hypocrisy. And, corroborative from this new viewpoint, where,
  for instance, had Peters, as it now appeared, got the money to send his family
  away even to a boarding house? Butlers were not in the habit of sending their
  families away to the seaside for the summer! Even Whitie Jack had not failed
  to comment on that fact. Well, he was satisfied that he knew the real Peters
  now, and it was not too late. It was Peters, or himself now. It was his life,
  or Peters&rsquo; life&mdash;unless Peters laid bare to the last shred the
  whole plot, and the name of every man connected with it.</p>
  <p>And the stage was set. From the moment he had read the papers that morning,
  he had put Whitie Jack at work&mdash;and Whitie Jack had done well, exceedingly
  well. He, Billy Kane, knew that Peters was married and had a family, but
  he had not known Peters&rsquo; home address. Whitie Jack had proved a most
  praiseworthy ferret. He, Billy Kane, knew that Thursday was always Peters&rsquo; night
  off. This was Thursday night. Peters, then, if he followed his usual custom,
  would visit his flat to-night; and, since the man&rsquo;s family was away,
  Peters and he would be <i>alone</i>. It was fortunate that the family was
  away, luck seemed to be turning; it precluded the necessity of getting Peters
  somewhere else&mdash;alone. It simplified matters. Peters&rsquo; flat would
  serve most excellently for that interview!</p>
  <p>He laughed a little now. He was strangely cool, strangely composed. He was
  in a mood in which he found difficulty in recognizing himself. He was going
  to-night to wring from a man either that man&rsquo;s life, or that man&rsquo;s
  confession. He was absolutely merciless in that resolve; he would not turn
  back, nothing would make him swerve one iota from that determination, he
  would go the limit&mdash;and yet he sat here entirely unmoved, callous.</p>
  <p>Well, after all, why not? If the man was already a murderer, his life was
  already forfeit. If he, Billy Kane, must choose between losing his own life
  and permitting one of the murderers of David Ellsworth to profit further
  thereby, would one hesitate long over that choice, or hesitate to go&mdash;the
  limit?</p>

  The Cipher Message</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hands came from his pockets again, and he leisurely lighted
  a cigarette. Though sitting sideways to the door, he nevertheless unostentatiously
  commanded a full view of the entrance. Red Vallon had just entered, and,
  after a moment&rsquo;s pause in which the man&rsquo;s eyes searched around
  the dance hall, was coming forward, threading his way through the intervening
  tables. Billy Kane flung a short nod of recognition in the direction of the
  approaching gangster; and then his eyes fastened in a sort of hard, curious
  expectancy on the street door again. Whether or not it was intuition or premonition,
  induced by what had happened the previous night when Red Vallon had been
  followed, he did not know, but he was somehow prepared now, a little more
  than prepared, almost sure, in fact, that there would be a repetition of
  last night&rsquo;s occurrence.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon dropped into the seat vacated by Whitie Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Bundy!&rdquo; he greeted affably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Red!&rdquo; The response was purely mechanical. Billy Kane
  shifted his cigarette from one corner of his mouth to the other&mdash;to
  hide a smile in which there was no humor. His intuition, if it were intuition,
  had not been at fault. A woman had just entered the dance hall. He was not
  likely to mistake that slim, graceful figure, nor those dark, steady eyes&mdash;that
  were spanning the room and resting upon him. He could not see the lurking
  mockery in those eyes, the distance was a little too great for that, but
  his imagination could depict it readily enough. Nor did it require much imagination!
  It was the Woman in Black. He glanced at Red Vallon. Red Vallon&rsquo;s back
  was turned to the door, and he had quite evidently not observed her.</p>
  <p>The beer-stained attendant hurried to the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you have, Red?&rdquo; inquired Billy Kane pleasantly.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon waved the man away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; he said in a lowered voice. &ldquo;I got to beat it&mdash;I
  got to meet Birdie Rose. There&rsquo;s something doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, even as he watched that trim figure make its way to a table
  near the wall on a line with his own, leaned abruptly, eagerly forward, toward
  Red Vallon. He felt his pulse throb and quicken. Luck seemed to be breaking
  wide open at last. If, coupled with his own clue, Red Vallon and Birdie Rose
  had unearthed another, this infernal masquerade that threatened his life
  at every turn was as good as ended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded sharply. &ldquo;Have you spotted the
  stones?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not them stones,&rdquo; he said a little uneasily. &ldquo;Some others.
  I got orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face hardened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orders!&rdquo; he echoed shortly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you
  last night that everything else was piker stuff? A half million in rubies,
  that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after&mdash;to the limit! Understand? To the
  limit! Orders! Who gave you any orders except to stick to the game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Red Vallon, and pushed a sheet of paper across
  the table. &ldquo;Tear it up when you&rsquo;re through. It&rsquo;s no good
  to me any more. I just wanted to show it to you, so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d know
  I wasn&rsquo;t side-stepping on my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not tear it up. His face, still set hard, showed no other
  signs of emotion, as his eyes studied the paper, but inwardly there came
  a sort of numbed dismay. It was a code message. It meant nothing to him in
  one sense, in another it meant a very great deal. He was <i>supposed</i> to
  know what this jumble of letters signified. Red Vallon expected him to know.
  To arouse Red Vallon&rsquo;s suspicion for an instant was simply and literally
  equivalent to bringing down the underworld upon him&mdash;and the underworld
  would be as gentle and merciful as a pack of starving wolves! The jumble
  of letters seemed to possess a diabolical leer all their own, as he stared
  at them.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000111h-images/page137.png" width="850" height="338"></p>
  <p>Was it a code that, with the key in one&rsquo;s possession, one could read
  at a glance? He did not know. Was it a code that required elaborate and painstaking
  effort to decipher? He did not know. Did Red Vallon, sitting there across
  the table watching him, expect him to give instant indication that the code
  message was plain and intelligible to him? He did not know. There was only
  one course to take&mdash;the middle course. He laid the paper on the table,
  and laid his clenched fist over the paper, as he leaned farther over, truculently,
  toward Red Vallon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you again that everything else is piker stuff,&rdquo; he said
  angrily. &ldquo;Do you get me? What have you done, you and Birdie, and the
  rest? Have you got anywhere to-day? Do you know where that secretary guy,
  Billy Kane, is? Do you know where those rubies are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Red Vallon hurriedly, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t turned
  anything up yet, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going to&mdash;by nosing around after something
  else!&rdquo; snapped Billy Kane. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to see
  the biggest thing that was ever pulled slip through my fingers? If you do,
  you&rsquo;ve got another think coming! Things have changed since I&rsquo;ve
  been away&mdash;eh? How long since there&rsquo;s been any monkeying with
  what I dope out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get sore, Bundy,&rdquo; said Red Vallon appeasingly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  nothing like that. You know how it was. Karlin&rsquo;s arrest last night
  queered everything. That cursed snitch with the mask on put everything on
  the rough. There wasn&rsquo;t any meeting. You know who sent that code there;
  well, <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t know about the other job, or that he was butting
  in on you. Tumble? There ain&rsquo;t nothing to be sore about, Bundy. Say,
  me and Birdie ain&rsquo;t going to be more&rsquo;n an hour or two doing this
  trick, anyhow. Someone of the Mole&rsquo;s gang must have leaked; or maybe
  one of our boys piped him off. I dunno. But we got him cold this trip. He&rsquo;s
  a slick one all right, and he&rsquo;s been getting away with the goods quite
  a lot lately, and giving us the laugh. You know all about that. Well, this
  is where he doesn&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;see? He&rsquo;s pulling a nice one
  to-night. Got it all fixed up to make it look like somebody else did it.
  Sure! Well, we&rsquo;re not kicking at that&mdash;so long as <i>we</i> get
  the loot. Sure! We&rsquo;ll let him pull it, all right, all right, believe
  me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane appeared to be unmoved. He studied the gangster coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how does it happen that you and Birdie, out of all the rest,
  are picked for this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon indulged in an ugly grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause we know the Mole down to the ground,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
  principally because the Mole knows <i>us</i>! There won&rsquo;t be any fooling
  when we spring a show-down, he&rsquo;s wise to that, and he&rsquo;ll come
  across. And, besides, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t only Birdie and me, I&rsquo;m taking
  some of my own gang along as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane scowled. It probably mattered very little indeed that Red Vallon&rsquo;s
  efforts were to be sidetracked for the next few hours, and should he, Billy
  Kane, during that time, be successful, it mattered not at all; but his play
  for the moment was to preserve his r&ocirc;le in Red Vallon&rsquo;s eyes,
  to keep away from anything intimate concerning the purport of this cipher
  message that still lay beneath his clenched hand, and that might so easily
  betray his ignorance, and above all now to get rid of Red Vallon before any
  such awkward and dangerous <i>impasse</i> could arise. He shrugged his shoulders,
  but his voice was still sullen as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, go to it!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Go and pick up your chicken
  feed! But you get this into your nut, Red, and let it soak there. After this&rdquo;&mdash;he
  leaned far over the table, his face thrust almost into Red Vallon&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;you
  stay with the game every minute, or quit! It&rsquo;s the limit, or quit!
  There&rsquo;s just one thing that counts&mdash;those rubies, or the man who
  pinched them. If we get the man, he&rsquo;ll cough&mdash;red&mdash;the stones,
  or blood. Do you think I&rsquo;m going to let anything queer me on my share
  of half a million? You don&rsquo;t seem to get what I mean when I say the
  limit. Look out I don&rsquo;t give you an object lesson!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon licked his lips, and drew back a little. There was something
  in Red Vallon&rsquo;s eyes that was not often there&mdash;fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Bundy,&rdquo; he said with nervous eagerness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  with you. Sure, I am! This thing must have broke loose quick, and there wasn&rsquo;t
  no idea of crabbing anything you&rsquo;d started. I got ten of the best of &rsquo;em
  combing out the &lsquo;fences&rsquo; for you right now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded Billy Kane gruffly. &ldquo;Make a report
  to me on that before morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll you be?&rdquo; Red Vallon was apparently relieved,
  for his voice had recovered its buoyancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At my place&mdash;some time,&rdquo; said Billy Kane curtly. &ldquo;You
  can wait for me there.&rdquo; He smiled suddenly with grim facetiousness. &ldquo;My
  shoulder&rsquo;s a lot better&mdash;enough so that maybe I can sit in for
  a hand myself to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you do,&rdquo; said Red Vallon fervently. &ldquo;You always
  had the knock-out punch, Bundy, and it&rsquo;ll seem like old times.&rdquo; He
  half rose from his chair; then, looking furtively about him, bent forward
  over the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else, Bundy, before I go&mdash;that
  snitch last night at Jerry&rsquo;s, the man in the mask. He&rsquo;s played
  hell with the crowd. There&rsquo;s no telling what&rsquo;ll tumble down behind
  Karlin. And it don&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s just stumbled on that deal
  by <i>accident</i>. It don&rsquo;t look good, Bundy. We got to get him, and
  get him quick, before he pulls anything more. The word&rsquo;s out to bump
  him off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t lose your nerve over it, Red,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;If
  it was by accident, he won&rsquo;t do us any more damage, and we&rsquo;ve
  only got to settle with him for what he&rsquo;s done, providing we can ever
  find him; if it wasn&rsquo;t accident he&rsquo;ll show his hand again&mdash;won&rsquo;t
  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Red Vallon.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile was unpleasant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll know what to do with him then, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
  inquired softly.</p>
  <p>The gangster&rsquo;s red-rimmed eyes narrowed to slits.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll know!&rdquo; said Red Vallon coarsely. He made an
  ugly motion toward his throat. &ldquo;Well, so long, Bundy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded again by way of answer. He watched Red Vallon thread his
  way back among the tables, and pass out through the front door. With the
  gangster out of the way, he picked up the sheet of paper upon which the code
  message was written, studied it for a moment, then thrust it into his pocket&mdash;and
  his glance travelled to the table opposite to him and against the wall, where
  that slim little figure in black was seated. She appeared to be quite indifferent
  to his presence, and quite intent upon the consumption of a glass of milk
  and the sandwich on the plate before her.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane smiled with grim comprehension. The frugality of the meal was
  not without its object. It was fairly obvious that she could dispose of what
  was before her in short order, and leave the place at an instant&rsquo;s
  notice without inviting undesirable attention to an unfinished meal&mdash;if
  she so desired! It was his move. She had followed Red Vallon in, but she
  had not followed Red Vallon out&mdash;she was waiting for him, Billy Kane.
  The seat she had chosen had been in plain view of Red Vallon, therefore she
  was evidently free from any fear of recognition on the part of the gangster,
  and, as a logical corollary, from probably anybody else in the room. That
  she gave no sign now therefore could mean but one thing. It was his move.
  If he cared to cross swords with her here, he was at liberty to do so; if
  he had reasons of his own for preferring a less public meeting, he had only
  to leave the place&mdash;and she would undoubtedly follow.</p>
  <p>In one sense she was most solicitous of his welfare! She would do nothing
  to hamper or hinder him in protecting himself, as long as he continued to
  double-cross and render abortive the crimes of that inner circle of the underworld
  in which she believed him to be a leader; failing that, as she had already
  made it quite clear, she proposed, as near as he could solve the riddle,
  to expose some past crime of the Rat&rsquo;s to the police, and end his career
  via the death chair in Sing Sing. Also she had made her personal feelings
  toward him equally clear&mdash;she held for him a hatred that was as deep-seated
  as it was merciless and deadly.</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. He, by proxy, stood in the shoes of one who,
  seemingly, had done her some irreparable wrong, and since she would dog him
  all night until she had had the interview that she evidently proposed to
  have, it might as well be here as anywhere. It mattered very little to him,
  as the Rat, that he should be observed by those in the room to get up from
  his table and walk over to hers. He was not being watched in the sense that
  anyone held surveillance over him, and, in any case, the conventions here
  in the heart of the underworld were of too elastic a character to have it
  cause even comment; and, besides, in a few hours from now, if luck were with
  him, he would be through with all this, done with this miserable r&ocirc;le
  of super-crook, which, though it brought a new and greater peril at every
  move he made, was the one thing that, for the present, he was dependent upon
  for his life.</p>
  <p>He rose, crossed the room nonchalantly, and dropped as nonchalantly into
  the chair at the end of her table, his back to the door.</p>
  <p>She greeted him with a smile&mdash;but it was a smile of the lips only.
  The dark eyes, under the long lashes, studied him in a cold, uncompromising
  stare; and there was mockery in their depths, but deeper than the mockery
  there was contempt and disdain.</p>
  <p>A cigarette, pulled lazily from his pocket and lighted, preserved his appearance
  of unconcern. In spite of himself, in spite of the fact that that contemptuous
  stare was his only through a damnable and abhorrent proxy, he felt suddenly
  ill at ease. He had never seen her as closely as this before. He had only
  seen her twice before&mdash;once in the dark; and once with the width of
  the Rat&rsquo;s den separating them. He had been conscious then that she
  was attractive, beautiful, with her clustering masses of brown hair, and
  the dainty poise of her head, and the pure whiteness of her full throat;
  but he was conscious now that beyond the mere beauty of features lay steadfastness
  and strength, that in the sweetness of the face there was, too, a wistfulness,
  do what she would to hide it, and that there was strain there, and weariness.
  And he was suddenly conscious, too, that he disliked the r&ocirc;le of the
  Rat more than he had ever disliked it, and that the loathing in those eyes,
  which never left his face, was responsible for this added distaste of the
  fact that nature had, through some cursed and perverted sense of humor or
  malevolence, seen fit to make him the counterpart of a wanton rogue, and,
  worse still, seen fit to force upon him the enactment of that r&ocirc;le.</p>
  <p>He could not tell her that he was not the Rat, could he?&mdash;that he was
  Billy Kane! Would the loathing in those eyes have grown the less at that?
  Billy Kane&mdash;the thief, the Judas assassin, whose name was a byword throughout
  the length and breadth of the land at that moment, whose name was a synonym
  for everything that was vile and hideous and depraved! He was the Rat&mdash;until
  to-night was over! After that&mdash;well, after that, who knew? Now, he was
  the Rat, and he must play the Rat&rsquo;s part.</p>
  <p>She broke the silence, her voice cool and even:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left it entirely to you as to whether you would come over to this
  table here or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I quite understood!&rdquo; Billy Kane forced a sarcastic smile. &ldquo;You
  are almost too considerate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; she said. Her eyes flashed suddenly. &ldquo;Well, perhaps
  you are right! I have thought sometimes that even the chance I give you is
  more than you deserve. I feel so strongly about it, in fact, that the only
  thing which prevents me from putting an end to it&mdash;and you&mdash;is
  that by using you to defeat the ends of your own criminal associates a great
  deal of good is being done. They will trap you sometime, of course, and,
  knowing them, you know what will happen, and I am satisfied then that, as
  an alternative, you would prefer Sing Sing and the chair; but you are clever&mdash;that
  is why you grasp at the chance I give you. You are extremely clever&mdash;and
  you believe you can continue to outwit them indefinitely. I don&rsquo;t think
  you can, though I admit your cleverness, cunning and craft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You flatter me!&rdquo; said Billy Kane ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, her voice suddenly lowered, passionate, tense; &ldquo;I
  hate you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You told me that last night.&rdquo; Billy Kane indolently blew a
  ring of cigarette smoke ceilingwards. &ldquo;I am beginning to believe you.
  Did you follow Red Vallon in here to tell me the same thing again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not answer for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes you make me lose my faith in God,&rdquo; she said, in a
  slow, restrained way. &ldquo;It is hard to believe that a God, a just God,
  could have created such men as you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane removed his cigarette from his lips, and flicked the ash away
  with a tap of his forefinger. He felt the color mount and tinge his cheeks.
  There was something, not alone in her words, but in her tone, that struck
  at him and <i>hurt</i>. The brown eyes, deep, full of implacable condemnation,
  burned into his. What was it that the Rat had done to her, or hers? He turned
  slightly away. An anger, smoldering in his soul, burst into flame. He was
  the Rat by proxy&mdash;and the proxy was damnable. He could not tell her
  he was not the Rat. He could not tell her he was&mdash;Billy Kane. He must
  play on with his detestable r&ocirc;le! He must play the Rat. What answer
  would the Rat have made to her?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut that out!&rdquo; rasped Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I spoke impulsively. There are
  only two things in life that affect you&mdash;your own safety, and to be
  quite sure that you get all of your share out of your crimes, and, if possible,
  somebody else&rsquo;s share as well. But the latter consideration is at an
  end now, isn&rsquo;t it, Bundy? I think I have taken care of that. It&rsquo;s
  just a question of whether you can save yourself or not with those clever
  wits of yours. Well&rdquo;&mdash;she shrugged her shoulders suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;you
  did very well last night. His life would not be worth very much if the underworld
  should ever lay hands on the man in the mask. Would it, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not answer her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you did very well, indeed,&rdquo; she went on calmly. &ldquo;You
  will meet somewhere else, of course, as soon as you can find a suitable place,
  but you will hold no more of your secret council meetings at Jerry&rsquo;s
  for some time to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face was impassive now. He was apparently intent only
  on the thin blue spiral of smoke that curled upward from the tip of his cigarette.
  So those meetings of that cursed directorate of crime had been held at Jerry&rsquo;s,
  had they? He had not known that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; suggested Billy Kane, curtly, &ldquo;that we come
  to the point. What is it that you want to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am coming to the point,&rdquo; she answered levelly. &ldquo;Owing
  to the events of last night your organization is in confusion, some of the
  more faint-hearted of your partners have temporarily even taken to their
  heels; but, even so, the organization&rsquo;s activities can hardly come
  to an abrupt standstill. You will perhaps remember a somewhat similar occasion
  once before? There are perhaps certain matters that are imperative, that
  cannot wait. Is it not so, Bundy? And in such an emergency it is left to&mdash;shall
  we call him the organization&rsquo;s secretary?&mdash;to keep things going.
  Personal touch is lost with one another, but there is still a way. I know,
  it does not matter how, that Red Vallon received a written order a little
  while ago. I followed Red Vallon here. I <i>think</i> he gave that order
  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane looked at her for a moment, a quizzical, whimsical expression
  creeping into his face. She was in deadly earnest, he knew that well. And
  yet there was a certain sense of humor here too&mdash;a grim humor with something
  of the sardonic in it, and nothing of mirth. Red Vallon&rsquo;s code order
  was quite as meaningless to him as it would be to her!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Billy Kane, alias the Rat&mdash;and chuckled. &ldquo;Sure,
  he gave it to me! You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d hold anything out on <i>you</i>,
  do you? Sure, he gave it to me!&rdquo; He tossed the paper across the table
  toward her. &ldquo;Help yourself! All you&rsquo;ve got to do is ask for anything <i>I&rsquo;ve</i> got,
  and it&rsquo;s yours. You&rsquo;re as welcome as the sunshine to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She studied it for an instant calmly. Billy Kane, watching her narrowly,
  frowned slightly in a puzzled way. She appeared to be neither agitated nor
  confused. She raised her eyes to his, a glint half of mockery, half of menace,
  in their brown depths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you think I did not know it was in cipher?&rdquo; she inquired
  coldly. &ldquo;You would hardly have been so obliging otherwise, would you?
  It is always in cipher under these circumstances, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, what
  is the translation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Red Vallon didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; said Billy Kane complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite probably not!&rdquo; she countered sharply. &ldquo;It was hardly
  necessary, was it? But since you have decoded it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been away so long,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve
  forgotten the key.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; She was smiling at him in derision now. &ldquo;In
  other words, you refuse to tell me what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you expect a little too much from me?&rdquo; He
  forced a sudden roughness into his tones. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decoded
  it yet, as a matter of fact; but if I had, do you think I&rsquo;m looking
  for trouble&mdash;to give you the chance to force me into another mess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head in a sort of mocking tolerance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does it really matter, Bundy?&rdquo; she asked softly. &ldquo;You
  are not as bright this evening as usual. I know that some crime is planned
  and set forth here on this paper. It really makes no vital difference to
  me to know beforehand specifically just what that crime is, for if it succeeds
  I shall know about it, and, in that case, I shall equally know that you did
  not prevent it. I think you quite understand what that means, don&rsquo;t
  you, Bundy? However&rdquo;&mdash;she smiled again, as she opened her purse
  and took out a pencil&mdash;&ldquo;let us put it down to a woman&rsquo;s
  insatiable curiosity, if you like, and decode it together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Decode it! The twisted smile that came to his lips was genuine enough. He
  couldn&rsquo;t decode it. He had only one card to play&mdash;a flat and unequivocal
  refusal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I think there is,&rdquo; she said softly again.</p>
  <p>He stared at her. Her pencil was flying across the paper. Who was this woman?
  She knew the key! Was there anything that she did not know? He watched her
  in a stunned way, his mind in confusion. And then he leaned forward to observe
  her work more closely. Beneath the original cipher she had written this:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000111h-images/page146a.png" width="850" height="355"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is so simple, Bundy,&rdquo; she murmured caustically. &ldquo;The
  numerals to designate the number of letters in the words, the transposition
  of &lsquo;a&rsquo; for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and so on, and the words spelled
  backwards. It is so simple, Bundy, that it is strange you should have forgotten&mdash;and
  forgotten that there are other secrets I have found in that den of yours,
  apart from that very convenient and ingenious door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was working as she spoke, paying no attention to him. He made no reply,
  only watched her as she set down a second series of letters:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000111h-images/page146b.png" width="850" height="293"></p>
  <p>A moment more, and she had written out the message in plain English:</p>
  <p class="note">Dutchy Vetter received consignment diamonds ten thousand dollars to-day
  from Amsterdam. Have information the Mole is laying a plant to get them to-night
  between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, and divert suspicion to some one else.
  Run the Mole to earth and make him cough up.</p>
  <p>She was studying the paper in her hand. Billy Kane lighted another cigarette.
  He was still watching her, but it was in a detached sort of way. Between
  eight and nine o&rsquo;clock! Peters was rarely able to leave the Ellsworth
  home on his evenings off until well after eight o&rsquo;clock; Peters, therefore,
  would not reach his flat much before nine, and certainly was not likely to
  leave there again immediately.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s mind was working in quick, and seemingly unrelated snatches
  of thought. There was time enough to see this Vetter game through without
  interfering with that interview he meant to hold with Peters&hellip;. It
  was strange that it should be Vetter &hellip; Whitie Jack had spoken of Vetter &hellip; Savnak,
  the violin player, and Vetter &hellip; Whitie Jack said that Savnak and Vetter
  spent most of their evenings together at Vetter&rsquo;s playing pinochle
  and the violin&hellip;. Savnak would likely be there then between eight and
  nine&hellip;. Upon whom was it that the so-called Mole intended to point
  suspicion?&hellip; Here was the moral obligation again&hellip;. He had fought
  that out last night&hellip;. She, this woman here, was not the driving force&hellip;.
  She only represented disaster from an entirely different source if he failed&hellip;.
  If he stood aside with the foreknowledge of crime in his possession he was
  as guilty as this Mole&hellip;. Perhaps he had been trying to trick his own
  conscience in not pressing Red Vallon for explanations&hellip;. Perhaps,
  in a measure, he had allowed the argument that he might invite Red Vallon&rsquo;s
  suspicions to act as an excuse for evading the responsibility that this foreknowledge
  of crime entailed&hellip;. Well, that responsibility was his now, thanks
  to her&hellip;. He had no choice&hellip;. It was likely to be the man in
  the mask again, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>She pushed the paper toward him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to destroy this&mdash;for safety&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she
  observed complacently.</p>
  <p>He took the paper mechanically, and mechanically tore it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know the Mole personally&rdquo;&mdash;she was speaking almost
  more to herself than to him, as though feeling her way cautiously along a
  tortuous mental path&mdash;&ldquo;I only know him as an exceedingly clever
  scoundrel, and as the head of a small, but very select, band of criminals.
  He is a sort of competitor of yours, I believe, and more than once has had
  the temerity to act as a thorn in the side of your own rapacious and diabolical
  crime trust. But I do know that this Vetter is an honest old man. It would
  be too bad&rdquo;&mdash;her voice, still low, was suddenly vibrant with a
  significance that there was no mistaking&mdash;&ldquo;if Vetter should lose
  his diamonds, wouldn&rsquo;t it, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The spiral of cigarette smoke again occupied Billy Kane. It was quite true
  that his mind was already made up; but for the moment he was the Rat, and
  the Rat would not be likely to accede to her suggestion with any overwhelming
  degree of complacency.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a little inconsistent, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he inquired
  sarcastically. &ldquo;If you are so anxious to prevent this crime, why don&rsquo;t
  you warn the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can put down my inconsistency to the frailty of my sex again,
  if you like,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;But you know quite well
  why. And, besides, one Bundy Morgan, having more at stake than the police,
  is more likely to accomplish the task successfully. Yes&mdash;Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t my hunt!&rdquo; he protested, with a snarl. &ldquo;I
  can&rsquo;t stop all the crimes in the world! This isn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> crowd!
  I&rsquo;m not responsible for the Mole. I don&rsquo;t know <i>his</i> plans.
  How can I put the crimp in them? The game is to let the Mole go ahead, isn&rsquo;t
  it, and then Red Vallon is to grab the chestnuts out of the Mole&rsquo;s
  pocket? Well, that&rsquo;s all right! But suppose I butt in, and, knowing
  nothing about the Mole&rsquo;s plans, fall down, and he gets away with the
  goods, and is too sharp for Red Vallon so that I can&rsquo;t even get the
  loot away from Red&mdash;am I responsible?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not unreasonable,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and smiled. &ldquo;There
  is a good deal of truth in what you say. But there is a way to provide against
  both contingencies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The snarl was still in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Steal the diamonds yourself before the Mole gets to work,&rdquo; she
  proposed calmly.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s gasp was wholly genuine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve plenty of time,&rdquo; she said sweetly. &ldquo;Vetter&rsquo;s
  isn&rsquo;t far from here, and it&rsquo;s not much more than half past seven
  now. The diamonds can be returned to Vetter tomorrow. After having had them
  stolen once, I think Vetter could be trusted to put them somewhere where
  neither the Mole nor anyone else would be likely to succeed a second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know where the diamonds are now!&rdquo; His voice
  was helpless in spite of himself.</p>
  <p>She lifted her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; she said imperturbably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got your nerve!&rdquo; he burst out&mdash;and
  it was Billy Kane, not the Rat, who spoke.</p>
  <p>The interview, as far as she was concerned, was evidently at an end. She
  had resumed her frugal meal, and was picking daintily at the sandwich on
  her plate. Her eyebrows arched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve got yours,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>He stood up. He could have laughed ironically, and likewise he could have
  sworn. She was distractingly pretty, as she sat there quite the mistress
  of herself; but her profound and utter disregard as to how the perilous project
  might result for him personally brought suddenly a vicious sweep of anger
  upon him&mdash;and abruptly, without a word, he swung from the table, and
  made his way toward the door. But the few steps cleared his brain a little,
  brought things into sharper focus. After all, he had forgotten! To her, he
  was the Rat. And the Rat&mdash;he did not question it&mdash;merited little
  of either mercy or consideration at her hands. At the door he looked back.
  She nodded to him pleasantly, and smiled&mdash;not in the manner of one who
  might very well be sending another to his death!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; muttered Billy Kane, and, opening
  the door, stepped out to the street.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  The Robbery</h2>
  <p>It was not far to Vetter&rsquo;s place, but&mdash;Billy Kane looked at his
  watch under a street lamp&mdash;it was later than she had said. It was ten
  minutes of eight. He knew where Vetter&rsquo;s was. That point presented
  no difficulties; he could hardly have spent the months he had amongst the
  queer, heterogeneous lives of the East Side without knowing at least that
  much about so outstanding a character as the old Holland diamond merchant&mdash;but
  that was quite another matter from knowing where the old Hollander domiciled
  his diamonds!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane frowned, as he went along. Well, was it necessary to steal the
  diamonds? That task, on the face of it, was so almost practically impossible
  as to render it bizarre. He had nothing to work on, no information, just
  the cool suggestion that he should steal the diamonds <i>first</i>; and,
  under ordinary circumstances, he might well be filled with dismay at the
  prospect of failure in view of the threat which she held over his head, though
  that side of it need not, and did not, concern him to-night. In a few hours
  from now he no longer expected to be the Rat; in a few hours Peters would
  have had his choice between losing his life and telling the truth, and under
  those conditions there was very little room for doubt but that Peters would
  have told&mdash;the truth. If, however, he could meanwhile save the old Hollander
  from loss, he, Billy Kane, was quite ready to go to almost any length to
  do so.</p>
  <p>He went on at a quick pace, traversing block after block. He smiled ironically
  to himself, as he finally turned a corner, and with more caution now, approached
  a low frame building that was bordered by a dark and narrow lane. Yes, it
  was bizarre enough! He could not very well inform the police himself! The
  Rat&mdash;and particularly Billy Kane&mdash;was not at the moment on speaking
  terms with the police! But was it necessary to steal the diamonds?</p>
  <p>Her idea, of course, was that then they would be absolutely safe from any
  attempt, or, perhaps what she feared most, physical coercion on the part
  of the Mole&mdash;even if Vetter were given a warning.</p>
  <p>But surely Vetter could take care of himself if he were warned! He, Billy
  Kane, certainly preferred that method! But, even that, as an alternative,
  was not quite so simple as it appeared. He was still the Rat. He did not
  know the plan this so-called Mole had evolved, and, more vital still, he
  did not know how closely Red Vallon was, in turn, watching the Mole. It was
  eight o&rsquo;clock now, and any or all of them might already be here. If
  he, Billy Kane, were discovered there would never be that little interview
  with Peters! The corollary was self-evident. Even for the purpose of warning
  the man, to reach Vetter inside this house here, that he was just passing,
  demanded the same degree of caution and secrecy on his part as though he
  entered for the purpose of stealing the stones himself. Also the little shop
  that made the front of the building was closed and dark. Vetter&rsquo;s living
  quarters, he had heard, which was one of the eccentricities that had made
  the man a talked-of character on the East Side, consisted of no more than
  a single room, serving for every purpose, at the rear of the shop itself.
  He did not dare take the risk of inviting attention by rapping and bringing
  the old Hollander to the door.</p>
  <p>He turned, and retracing his steps, sauntered nonchalantly along, passed
  by the house again&mdash;and slipped into the lane. Circumstances, as he
  found them, alone could govern his actions.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane took stock now of the surroundings. The frame building was an
  old affair, and the floors therefore would be outrageously creaky. Billy
  Kane scowled. The prospect of creaky floors and protesting boards was not
  a pleasant one. And then the scowl vanished, and a smile flickered across
  his lips. From somewhere at the back of the house there came suddenly the
  throbbing notes of a violin. The smile broadened. That was Savnak, doubtless,
  and, for the moment at least, it was the violin, rather than pinochle, that
  was engaging the two men. Personally, under the circumstances, he, Billy
  Kane, was very much in favor of the violin. The violin would help a good
  deal&mdash;if it became a question of creaky floors!</p>
  <p>He moved silently forward now farther into the lane, keeping close to the
  wall in the darker shadows of the house. The old Hollander and his crony
  were obviously in the back room. He glanced sharply up and down the length
  of the building. He could see nothing. It was intensely dark. The wall of
  the house was blank. There were no windows opening on the lane.</p>
  <p>An expression, grimly quizzical, settled on his face. It was a queer setting
  for a robbery, this unpretentious, even tumble-down, little shop, with its
  back-room living quarters! But the unpretentiousness of the old Hollander&rsquo;s
  surroundings in no way argued poverty! He had known of Vetter by reputation,
  quite apart even from any connection with the East Side. The man had a clientele
  among the best in the city. He was an authority on diamonds. He dealt only
  in the choicest stones, and he was absolutely reliable and honest. The world
  of fashion had made a path to Vetter&rsquo;s door, not he to theirs. In this
  ten-thousand-dollar consignment, for instance, there would probably not be
  more than fifty or sixty stones, not enough to make a small handful, but
  not one of them, probably, would be worth less than a hundred dollars, and
  most of them would be worth a great deal more.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane reached the end of the building, and found that a board fence,
  some seven or eight feet high, continued on down the lane, obviously enclosing
  the back yard of the place. The violin throbbed on. The notes came clear
  and sweet, entirely unmuffled now, as though from an open window. He stood
  there for a moment listening. The playing was exquisite. It was some plaintive,
  haunting melody given life by a master touch. He remembered Whitie Jack&rsquo;s
  description of the expatriated musician. Without question Savnak could &ldquo;fiddle&rdquo;;
  the man, in spite of having come a moral cropper, was, if he, Billy Kane,
  were any judge, little short of a genius.</p>
  <p>Glancing sharply about him once more, Billy Kane, with a lithe spring, caught
  the top of the fence, and drew himself cautiously up until he could peer
  over. He hung there motionless for a moment. A few yards away from him, in
  a slightly diagonal direction, and between himself and the back door, was
  the window of the rear room; and, as he had suspected, the window was open.
  He could see inside; that is, in a restricted sense. A man, it was Savnak
  of course, chin on his violin, standing, was swaying gently to and fro on
  his feet to the tempo of the music, his back to the window; and at the table,
  side face to the window, but with his back toward Billy Kane, Vetter, the
  old Hollander, white-haired, sat rapt in attention, staring at the violinist.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew himself further up, and straddled the fence. The position
  of the two men rendered him safe from observation. The notes of the violin,
  in a tremolo, died softly away. The old Hollander dug his knuckles across
  his eyes; and his words, spoken in perfect English, evidently the language
  common to the two men of diverse nationalities, reached Billy Kane distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are wonderful, my old friend Savnak. It is divine. My friend,
  you are wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The violinist shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could really play. Yes, I tell you,
  you who will believe me, that I could sway the people, that I could do with
  them as I would, that I&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly, and shrugged his
  shoulders again. &ldquo;But what is the use of memories? Memories! They are
  bad! They leave a bad taste! Let us forget them! You were to show me the
  great purchase that arrived to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These!&rdquo; The old Hollander took from his pocket what looked
  like a soft, pliable, chamois-skin pocketbook, which he opened and laid on
  the table, disclosing a cluster of gems that, nesting on a snowy bed of wadding,
  sparkled and scintillated as the rays of the gas jet above the table fell
  upon them; and then, impulsively closing the pocketbook again, he pushed
  it a little away from him. &ldquo;They can wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By
  and by, we will look at them one by one. But they do not feed the soul, my
  Savnak, like your music. Play some more. They are not worth one of your notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are they not?&rdquo; Savnak&rsquo;s voice seemed tinged with bitterness. &ldquo;The
  soul may be well fed, Vetter, but that does not keep one often enough from
  tightening the belt! I think I would be fortunate to make the exchange&mdash;my
  gift, such as it is, for your diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not mean what you say!&rdquo; the old Hollander replied, shaking
  his head reprovingly. &ldquo;I know better! But I do not like to hear you
  talk like that. Things are not so bad with you now. You are moody. Play some
  more, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will!&rdquo; Again Savnak shrugged his shoulders. He nestled
  his chin on the violin. &ldquo;It will be something gay, then, and lively&mdash;eh,
  Vetter?&mdash;to chase the blue devils away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The notes of the violin rose again. Billy Kane began to lower himself from
  the fence into the backyard. His mind was made up now. Since there were two
  of them there, a warning surely was all that was necessary. The window was
  not much more than shoulder high from the ground, and he had, then, only
  to cross the yard and call to Vetter through the window. His appearance there
  would no doubt startle and alarm the old Hollander half out of his wits,
  but that was exactly what would cause the man to guard his diamonds all the
  more zealously for the rest of the night. Once warned, the two men in there
  between them ought certainly to be able to take care of themselves and that
  chamois pocketbook.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane dropped softly to the ground, straightened up, took a step forward&mdash;and
  stopped as though rooted to the spot. There had come a cry from Vetter. The
  violin broke off with a jerky, high-pitched, screaming note. Then silence.
  Billy Kane raised himself on tiptoes. He could just see in through the window;
  no more. It seemed like some picture flashed on a cinema screen, quick, instantaneous.
  A third man, hat drawn far over his face, was standing by the table, covering
  Vetter and Savnak with a revolver. The man snatched up the chamois pocketbook,
  reached above his head, turned out the gas&mdash;and the room and window
  were in blackness.</p>
  <p>It had happened with the suddenness and swiftness of a lightning flash,
  so quick that the brain stumbled a little in a dazed way in an effort to
  grasp its significance. And then Billy Kane wrenched his automatic from his
  pocket. The thief, when or in whatever way he had got into the house, must
  necessarily make his escape either by the front door, or by the back door
  and through the yard here. If it were the latter, which seemed the more likely,
  he, Billy Kane, had the man at his mercy; if it were the former, the man
  would probably reach the street, in any case, before he, Billy Kane, could
  get over the fence and rush down the lane.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was moving swiftly in the direction of the back door. He had
  to choose one way or the other. He could not attempt to guard both exits
  at the same time! If the man&mdash;</p>
  <p>Vetter&rsquo;s voice rose in a furious cry from the room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is by the front, Savnak, he has gone! Quick! I hear him going
  out! Quick! The street!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! Quick! The street!&rdquo; Savnak, like a parrot, in a shrill,
  hysterical voice, was echoing the other&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Quick! Chase
  him! And shout for the police!&rdquo; A chair fell over. The two men were
  evidently floundering their way to the door. &ldquo;Curse him for turning
  out the light!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane whirled, and dashed for the fence. As he straddled the top, he
  saw a figure, thrown into relief on the lighted street, speed past the head
  of the lane&mdash;and then, with a wry smile at a sudden realization of his
  own impotence, he dropped to the lane, and, instead of running now, made
  his way slowly and cautiously forward, hugged close against the wall. If
  he ran out of the lane into the arms of Vetter and Savnak, besides hampering
  the pursuit by distracting their attention from the fugitive, he invited
  the decidedly awkward and very natural suspicion of being connected with
  the thief himself; and the police would be very apt to listen with their
  tongues in their cheeks to any explanation that the Rat might offer to account
  for his presence in the lane at that particular moment! And if there was
  any one thing that he wished to avoid to-night, it was a complication with
  the police that would inevitably interfere with his freedom of action during
  the next few hours.</p>
  <p>Came a wild cry now from both Vetter and Savnak from the front of the house;
  and then the two men, yelling at the top of their voices, both hatless, Savnak,
  apparently unconscious in his excitement that he was brandishing his violin
  frantically in one hand and his bow in the other, tore madly down the street
  in pursuit of their quarry.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane slipped out to the street. Doors of tenements and houses were
  beginning to open; heads were beginning to be thrust out through upper windows;
  the street was beginning to assume a state of pandemonium. A block down,
  the quarry, well in the lead of the old Hollander and the violinist, leaped
  suddenly into a waiting automobile, and vanished around the corner.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane turned away. He felt a curiously chagrined resentment against
  this so-called Mole, that was quite apart from his angry resentment of the
  fact that the old Hollander had been victimized. He had expected something
  quite different from the Mole! Red Vallon&mdash;and she, too&mdash;had given
  the Mole a reputation for cleverness, craft and cunning; but, instead of
  having shown any cleverness, or even a shred of originality, the Mole, or
  his minion, had perpetrated nothing more than a bald, crude theft that any
  house-breaker, or broken-down old &ldquo;lag&rdquo; could have pulled off
  with equal lack of finesse! Well, anyway, for the moment so far as he was
  concerned, the affair was at an end, and he could only await developments.
  It all hinged on Red Vallon now&mdash;on Red Vallon, who proposed in turn
  to rob the robber&mdash;on Red Vallon, who, later on, would keep an appointment
  with him, Billy Kane, in the Rat&rsquo;s den!</p>
  <p>As he turned a corner, Billy Kane consulted his watch. It was still early,
  just a trifle after eight&mdash;too early for that interview with Peters
  yet. He might as well go back to Two-finger Tasker&rsquo;s then. It was scarcely
  likely that <i>she</i> was still there, but, if she were, so much the better!
  She could hardly hold him responsible for failure; and, in any case, she
  would realize that there was still the chance of recovering the stones by,
  in turn again, outwitting Red Vallon, if the gangster had been successful.
  If she were not there, Two-finger Tasker&rsquo;s was as good a place as any
  in which to put in the time.</p>
  <p>He reached the dance hall, and found, as he had half expected, that she
  had already gone. He sat down at a table, ordered something from the waiter,
  and, apparently absorbed in the dancers, who had now begun to gather, he
  made a sort of grimly-reassuring inventory of his equipment for the night&rsquo;s
  work that still lay ahead of him&mdash;his mask, his automatic, Whitie Jack&rsquo;s
  skeleton keys, were in his pockets. His lips twisted in a curious smile.
  The Mole, Vetter, the diamonds, the old violinist&mdash;all these seemed
  suddenly extraneous, incidents thrust upon him, dragged irrelevantly into
  his existence. They sank into inconsequential obtrusions in the face of the
  stake for which he was now about to play: his freedom, a clean name again,
  the end of this devil&rsquo;s tormenting masquerade, his life or, perhaps,
  another man&rsquo;s life&mdash;Peters&rsquo;?</p>
  <p>Half an hour passed. Once more he looked at his watch. A few minutes later
  he consulted it again. And then at a quarter to nine he rose from the table,
  and left Two-finger Tasker&rsquo;s resort.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  The Alibi</h2>
  <p>Twenty minutes later, having satisfied himself that the immediate neighborhood
  was free of passers-by for the moment, and that he had not been observed,
  he tried the street door of the tenement that had been the subject of Whitie
  Jack&rsquo;s earlier investigations. The door was unlocked, and he stepped
  silently into the vestibule, and closed the door softly behind him.</p>
  <p>He stood for a moment listening, and taking critical note of his surroundings.
  A single incandescent burning here in the lower hall supplied ample illumination.
  The stairs were directly in front of him, and on the right of the hallway.
  There was a closed door, also on the right and just at the foot of the stairs,
  and from behind this there came the murmur of voices. There was no other
  sound.</p>
  <p>He moved quietly forward, mounted the stairs, gained the landing, and, with
  more caution now, turned back along the hall, making for the door on the
  right&mdash;Peters&rsquo; door, according to Whitie Jack&mdash;that, if in
  the same relative location as the one below, would be at the foot of the
  next flight of stairs. A faint light came up through the stair well, but
  the end of the hall itself beyond the second flight of stairs was in blackness.
  He nodded grimly in satisfaction. He would not need any light to find Peters&rsquo; door!</p>
  <p>His lips pressed hard together. He had reached the door now, and now he
  crouched against it, his ear to the panel. He listened intently. A sudden
  doubt came and tormented him and obsessed him. What, if by any chance Peters
  had someone with him! A bead of moisture oozed out on his forehead, and he
  brushed it hurriedly away. He was not so callous now! Behind that door lay,
  literally, life and death; behind that door, if it proved necessary, he meant
  to take a man&rsquo;s life, a miserable life, it was true, a murderer&rsquo;s
  life, a life that had no claim to mercy, but still a man&rsquo;s life. Had
  he ever laid claim to being callous? But that did not mean that his resolution
  was being undermined. The issue to-night was clearly defined, ultimate, final,
  and he had accepted that issue, and he would see it through. His lips relaxed
  a little in a smile of self-mockery. Well, suppose Peters were <i>not</i> alone
  he, Billy Kane, had only to wait until the visitor conjured up by his doubts
  had gone.</p>
  <p>He steadied himself with a mental effort. His nerves were getting a little
  too high strung. To begin with, there wasn&rsquo;t anybody in there with
  Peters. He would have heard voices if there had been, and he had heard none.
  He glanced around him now, but the act was wholly one of exaggerated caution.
  Here at the end of the hall he could see nothing. Opposite him was probably
  the door of the other apartment on this floor that Whitie Jack had said was
  unoccupied. There was no fear of interruption. He took his automatic from
  his pocket, tried the door cautiously, and finding it locked, knocked softly
  with his knuckles on the panel.</p>
  <p>There was no response. He knocked again, a little louder, more insistently.
  There was still no response. Billy Kane was gnawing at his under lip now.
  Not only had Peters no visitor, but even Peters himself was not there! Out
  of the darkness it seemed as though a horde of mocking devils were suddenly
  jeering at him in unholy glee. He had somehow been very sure that everything
  to-night would go as he had planned, and, instead, there had been nothing
  so far but stark futility.</p>
  <p>But the night was not ended yet! He thrust the automatic abruptly back into
  his pocket. There was still time for Peters to come. It was only a little
  after nine. And Peters would have a visitor after all&mdash;a visitor waiting
  there inside that room for him!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew Whitie Jack&rsquo;s bunch of skeleton keys from his pocket,
  and, crouching now low down in front of the door, inserted one of the keys
  in the lock. It would not work. He tried another with the same result. He
  was not an adept at lock-picking as yet! He grinned without mirth at the
  mental reservation&mdash;and suddenly drew back from the door, retreating
  into the deeper blackness at the end of the hall. Here was Peters now, and
  Peters would have much less trouble in opening the door!</p>
  <p>Footsteps were ascending the stairs. A figure, in the murky light from the
  stair well, gained the landing, and came forward along the hall. Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  sudden smile held little of humor. It was not Peters. It was Whitie Jack&rsquo;s
  tenant of the third floor, Savnak, the old violin player, hugging his violin
  case under his arm, and as he came into the shadows, feeling out with his
  other hand for the banisters of the second flight of stairs. Fifteen feet
  away, flattened against the wall, himself secure from observation, in the
  darkness, Billy Kane, in a sort of grim philosophical resignation, watched
  what was now little more than a shadowy outline, as the other went on up
  the stairs to the third floor.</p>
  <p>A door above slammed shut. Billy Kane returned to Peters&rsquo; door. Again
  he tried a key, and still another, until, with a low-breathed ejaculation
  of satisfaction, he finally unlocked the door. He exchanged the keys for
  his automatic once more; and once more his hand on the doorknob, he held
  tense and motionless, listening. From below there came again the sound of
  footsteps on the stairs. It was Peters at last, probably; but, if it was
  Peters, Peters was <i>not</i> alone. The footsteps of two men were on the
  stairs.</p>
  <p>Futility again! The door was unlocked, but it availed him nothing at all
  now. He had meant to go in and wait for Peters, but it would be a fool play
  from any angle to go in there now if Peters had anybody with him. Nor was
  there time to lock the door again. He had returned the bunch of keys to his
  pocket, and it would take a moment to sort out the right one, and there was
  not that moment to spare. The footsteps were already on the landing. Billy
  Kane drew back once more silently and swiftly to the front of the hall. He
  was tight-lipped now. It seemed as though every turn of the luck had gone
  against him. Peters was certain to notice that the door was unlocked. What
  effect would that have on Peters? What would the man do, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was staring down the hall in a numbed, dazed way. Two men had
  come into the radius of light from the stair well, and were moving quickly
  along the hall in his direction. He brushed his hand across his eyes. That
  little horde of devils were at their jeers of unholy mirth again. Peters!
  There was no such man as Peters! Peters was a myth! The whole cursed night
  was a series of damnable hallucinations. This wasn&rsquo;t Peters&mdash;it
  was Red Vallon, and Birdie Rose.</p>
  <p>Out of the darkness he watched them, his mind fogged. What were they doing
  here? Why had they become suddenly so quiet and stealthy as they went up
  that second flight of stairs&mdash;where Savnak had gone! Savnak&mdash;Vetter&mdash;the
  diamonds&mdash;Red Vallon! He remembered the tribute paid to the Mole&rsquo;s
  cleverness, a tribute that, in his estimation as an eyewitness to the theft,
  had come far from being borne out in practice. Was there something that he
  had not seen, something behind that bald, crude scene which he had witnessed?
  His brain was stumbling on, groping, striving for understanding. He remembered
  the code message&mdash;the Mole was to divert suspicion to someone else.
  Had the Mole in some way outwitted Red Vallon? Birdie Rose and Red Vallon
  obviously believed that the old violinist had the diamonds&mdash;there was
  no other possible explanation to account for their presence here hard on
  Savnak&rsquo;s trail. And if that were so, it would go hard with Savnak,
  very hard, indeed, when, believing Savnak was lying, Red Vallon failed to
  secure the stones. Red Vallon was not a man to trifle with; Red Vallon was
  perhaps the most dangerous and unscrupulous gangster in New York, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was creeping forward, and mounting the stairs step by step with
  infinite caution. They had disappeared now into Savnak&rsquo;s room, presumably.</p>
  <p>He had no choice, had he? The man-handling they would give Savnak would
  be little short of murder. Murder! His lips tightened. There was to have
  been murder in that room below there&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t there? But that was
  different&mdash;one man was guilty, the other innocent. Much as it meant
  to him to settle with Peters, he had no choice but to let that go to-night
  now, if necessary&mdash;to let it go, if necessary, until to-morrow, or until
  he could formulate some other plan, for it was not likely that he could frustrate
  Red Vallon now, and still be left quietly to return to a reckoning with Peters.</p>
  <p>His fingers closed in a sudden spasmodic clutch over the stock of his automatic.
  He had passed Peters&rsquo; door, and left it unlocked, and Peters might
  come in the meantime. Well, it didn&rsquo;t matter now! His own luck was
  out! The night had done nothing but toss him hither and thither like a shuttlecock
  in mockery and sport. And at the last fate had played him this most scurvy
  trick of all. He could not stand aside and see an innocent man left to the
  mercy of a devil like Red Vallon, and so, instead of playing Billy Kane to
  Peters, he was playing the man in the mask to Red Vallon and Birdie Rose!
  And that jeering horde of imps out of the darkness were shrieking in his
  ears again!</p>
  <p>He slid his mask over his face. He had reached the door over Peters&rsquo; flat,
  which Whitie Jack had described as Savnak&rsquo;s. Red Vallon had failed
  to close it tightly behind him&mdash;perhaps unwilling to risk the chance
  of any additional sound. It was slightly ajar. A dull glow of light, as though
  from an inner room, seeped through the aperture. Came a sharp, startled exclamation,
  and then Red Vallon&rsquo;s voice, snarling viciously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on! Come across! And come&mdash;<i>quick</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane pushed the door open inch by inch, and suddenly slipped into
  the room. He was quite safe, providing he made no noise that would betray
  his presence. Across from him, at an angle that kept him out of the line
  of light, was the open door of what was obviously the front room of the apartment.
  Savnak had evidently been flung violently down into a chair; Birdie Rose&rsquo;s
  fingers were crooked, claw-like, within an inch of the violinist&rsquo;s
  throat; and Red Vallon, leaning on a table in front of the two, was leering
  at Savnak in ugly menace. Savnak was speaking, low and earnestly, but Billy
  Kane could not catch the man&rsquo;s words. Red Vallon interrupted the other
  with scant ceremony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can that!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t go! That stagehand
  of yours ain&rsquo;t got the goods&mdash;<i>you</i> got &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;re
  wise to your game. We know you, Birdie and me, and you know we know it. How
  long you been cultivating the old Dutchman, and waiting for something worth
  while like to-night to break loose? Pinochle and a violin! Pretty nifty,
  that violin stunt! It helped a lot&mdash;we got in the same as that boob
  of yours did&mdash;while you was making enough noise fiddling to let an army
  in without being heard. Sure, you got a tricky nut on your shoulders, all
  right! It&rsquo;s too bad, though, you don&rsquo;t know enough not to stack
  up against a better crowd! And the guy turned out the gas to help him in
  his get-away, did he? Yes, he did&mdash;like hell! That&rsquo;s where he
  slipped you the sparklers, old bucko! Well, we&rsquo;ve got your number,
  ain&rsquo;t we? We hung around after that to give you a chance to finish
  out the play. We&rsquo;re with you there! Nothing suits us better than to
  have the police chasing some guy they don&rsquo;t know, and that ain&rsquo;t
  got the white ones anyhow! Come on now, come across!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, like a man bewildered, mentally stunned, stood there motionless.
  A singsong refrain repeated itself crazily over and over again in his brain: &ldquo;Savnak
  was the Mole! Savnak was the Mole!&rdquo; He lifted his hand and swept it
  across his eyes. Savnak&rsquo;s face in there in that room was working in
  a sort of livid fury. Yes, of course&mdash;Savnak was the Mole. It was quite
  clear now, quite plain&mdash;and the Mole was not lacking quite so much after
  all in craft and cunning! So Red Vallon had been in Vetter&rsquo;s, too,
  had he? There came a sudden, grim set to Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. Well, at
  least, the diamonds were <i>here</i> now!</p>
  <p>Savnak was speaking again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who put you wise to this?&rdquo; he demanded sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno!&rdquo; said the gangster indifferently. &ldquo;I got orders,
  that&rsquo;s all. Mabbe some of our crowd piped you off making your play
  with Dutchy during the last month, and figured two and two made twenty-three&mdash;for
  you; or mabbe one of your own bunch whispered out loud. I dunno! Are you
  coming across without getting hurt, or aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was moving softly toward the inner door. Savnak had apparently
  regained his composure. He looked from one to another of his captors, and
  forced a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said ingratiatingly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all
  in this. Suppose we play fair. I&rsquo;m willing to split.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear that, Birdie?&rdquo; jeered Red Vallon, with a nasty
  laugh. &ldquo;He wants a split! Well, give him one&mdash;mabbe it&rsquo;ll
  help him to get a move on! Twist his pipes a little more&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  the sort of split he won&rsquo;t argue over!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Birdie Rose&rsquo;s two hands closed with a quick, ugly jerk on Savnak&rsquo;s
  throat. There was a gurgling cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Savnak choked out. &ldquo;Wait! It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  all right, boys.&rdquo; He rubbed his throat, as Birdie Rose released him. &ldquo;I
  know when I&rsquo;m beaten.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders in a sort of
  philosophically fatalistic way, and, reaching into his inside coat pocket,
  threw Vetter&rsquo;s chamois pocketbook down on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; grunted Red Vallon maliciously. &ldquo;But
  seeing it&rsquo;s you, we&rsquo;ll just take a look at it to make sure you&rsquo;re <i>honest</i>!&rdquo; He
  picked up the pocketbook, opened it, nodded and chuckled over the gleaming
  array of diamonds, and closed the pocketbook again. &ldquo;Well, I guess
  that&rsquo;ll be all for to-night, <i>Mister</i> Savnak, and&mdash;&rdquo; His
  words ended in a sudden gasp.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was standing in the doorway, his automatic covering the men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, please, any of you!&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s voice,
  gruffly unrecognizable, was facetiously debonair.</p>
  <p>Birdie Rose&rsquo;s face had gone a pasty white; Savnak, hunched in his
  chair, stared helplessly; Red Vallon, his jaw dropped, still holding the
  pocketbook, found his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man in the mask!&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was a little late for the tombola myself at Vetter&rsquo;s to-night,&rdquo; said
  Billy Kane coolly. &ldquo;I understand you were all there. I only got as
  far as the back yard when the gathering broke up, and I was a little disappointed
  because I had a hunch that I held the winning number. However, if you, there,
  with the pocketbook, whatever your name is, will just toss the prize over
  here, I&rsquo;m willing to overlook any slight irregularity there might have
  been in the drawing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon did not answer.</p>
  <p>The muzzle of Billy Kane&rsquo;s automatic lifted to a level with the gangster&rsquo;s
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; The facetiousness was gone from Billy Kane
  now. His voice rasped suddenly. &ldquo;<i>Toss it over!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With an oath, Red Vallon flung the pocketbook over the table.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane caught it deftly with his left hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Billy Kane politely. He tucked the chamois
  case into his pocket, and reached out for the doorknob. &ldquo;I think that
  is all&mdash;gentlemen,&rdquo; he said softly; &ldquo;except to wish you&mdash;good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a flash he had shut the door upon them, and, turning, was running across
  the outer room. But Red Vallon, too, was quick. Before Billy Kane reached
  the door leading into the hall, he heard the window of the front room flung
  up&mdash;and Red Vallon&rsquo;s voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, boys, come in! The man in the mask! Head him off! Jump for
  it! He&rsquo;s going downstairs!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s jaws clamped hard, as he swung through the door to the
  head of the stairs. It was true! He remembered that Red Vallon had said he
  had some of his gang with him. He could hear them now. They were running
  into the lower hall; and, though he was taking the stairs three and four
  at a time, they would meet on the lower staircase, if he kept on. His escape
  was cut off. There was only one chance&mdash;Peters&rsquo; door&mdash;it
  was unlocked&mdash;Peters&rsquo; door, before Red Vallon above opened the
  door of Savnak&rsquo;s flat and saw him.</p>
  <p>It had been a matter of seconds, no more; but seconds that had seemed of
  interminable duration. He was at the foot of the stairs now. Came the pound
  of approaching feet from below. Red Vallon, whether because he had not had
  time, or because he was wary of a trap, had not opened the door into the
  hall above yet. Billy Kane, cautious of any sound, slipped through the door
  into Peters&rsquo; flat, half drew back in sudden dismay&mdash;then grimly
  closed the door behind him softly, and, working with desperate haste now,
  and still silently, took out his skeleton keys and locked it. He turned,
  then, with his automatic flung out in front of him&mdash;and faced toward
  the door that opened on his left. He knew it, of course! But it had been
  too late to turn back. He was doubly trapped! His lips, thinned, curved in
  a bitter smile. If there was any murder to be done here in this flat to-night,
  it was likely now to be his own&mdash;not Peters&rsquo;! <i>There was a light
  in that room!</i> Peters must have come in while he, Billy Kane, was upstairs.
  He was between two fires. A cry, any alarm given by Peters, would bring Red
  Vallon and his blood-fanged pack bursting through that door behind him. Was
  Peters deaf? True, he, Billy Kane, had slipped as silently through the door
  as he could, and had locked it as silently as he could, but he must have
  made some noise!</p>
  <p>Feet raced by in the hall, and went thumping up the stairs. It was strange
  that Peters had not heard him! It was stranger still that Peters did not
  hear the commotion now that Red Vallon&rsquo;s pack was making!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane moved forward stealthily until he could see into the lighted
  room&mdash;and stood suddenly still. He felt the blood leave his face. He
  lifted his hand to his eyes in a queer, jerky, horrified motion; and then,
  with a low cry, he ran forward into the other room. The place was in confusion.
  It was a bedroom, and bureau drawers had been wrenched out and thrown around;
  every possible receptacle that might have concealed the smallest object had
  been ransacked and looted, and the contents strewn in wild disorder everywhere
  about&mdash;and on the floor a man lay sprawled, dead, murdered, a brutal
  wound in the side of his head from a blow that had apparently fractured the
  skull.</p>
  <p>He knelt for a moment over the man. It was Peters. He rose, then, and stood
  there, fighting to rouse his brain from blunted torpor, to force it to resume
  its normal functions. Peters had been lying here dead, all the time that
  he, Billy Kane, had been waiting outside there in the hall! It must have
  taken quite a little while to have accomplished this murder and ransack the
  room. Peters, therefore, must have left the Ellsworth house earlier than
  usual, since the murderer, allowing for the length of time he would have
  required for his work, must have completed it and made his escape before
  he, Billy Kane, had arrived here at nine o&rsquo;clock. It was very strange,
  horribly strange&mdash;to <i>find</i> Peters murdered! Who was it, who had
  done it? Who was it, other than himself, who could have had any motive? What
  did it mean? What was it that Peters had had here, that had been the object
  of such a frantic search? Billy Kane drew his breath in suddenly, sharply.
  What could it be save <i>one</i> thing! The Ellsworth rubies! That was it,
  wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;<i>rubies</i>!</p>
  <p>A sound from somewhere out in the hall brought surging back upon him a realization
  of his own imminent peril. There must be some way out, he must find a way.
  If he knew Red Vallon at all, he knew that he, Billy Kane, would never leave
  by the door! Well, a fire escape then, perhaps!</p>
  <p>Quick now, every faculty alert, he ran noiselessly from room to room, and
  from window to window. He returned a moment later to the hall door, his face
  a little harder set and strained. There was no escape by the windows. There
  was nothing, except an increasing sound of disturbance that seemed to be
  affecting all parts of the house. Nothing, save Red Vallon&rsquo;s voice
  just outside the door, talking, evidently, to some of his men:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> got out&mdash;and he ain&rsquo;t going to get
  out till we&rsquo;ve searched every flat in the place! He&rsquo;s most likely
  on this floor, and Birdie and me&rsquo;ll tackle this door here first; but
  you go down there and tell those people below to shut up their row, and some
  of you look through their rooms. Beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Footsteps scurried away. The doorknob was tried. Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips
  were a thin line. There was no physical way of escape. Was there a way of
  wits? His wits against Red Vallon&rsquo;s! He stood there motionless, a queer,
  grim look creeping into his face, as the door now was shaken violently. And
  then, suddenly, he jerked his mask from his face, and thrust it into his
  pocket. Yes, there was a way, but a way that held a something of ghastly,
  abysmal irony in it. He could prove an alibi&mdash;he had a witness to it.</p>
  <p>The door quivered, but held, under a crashing blow. Then Red Vallon&rsquo;s
  growling voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get out of the road, Birdie, and let me at it! I&rsquo;ll bust it
  in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Red?&rdquo; he demanded harshly.</p>
  <p>There was a surprised gasp from the hall without, a second&rsquo;s tense
  silence, and then Red Vallon&rsquo;s voice again, heavy with perplexity and
  amazement:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who in hell are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane unlocked the door, flung it open, and stepped back. The hall
  had been lighted now, evidently to facilitate Red Vallon&rsquo;s search,
  and the light fell full upon Billy Kane through the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Rat!&rdquo; The gangster&rsquo;s little red-rimmed eyes blinked
  helplessly&mdash;then suddenly narrowed. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; snarled Billy Kane angrily. &ldquo;I thought I recognized
  your voice! You gave me a scare! What are you doing here? What&rsquo;s all
  this cursed noise about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; repeated Red Vallon mechanically. He
  spoke automatically, as though through force of habit at the Rat&rsquo;s
  command. &ldquo;The Mole lives upstairs. He got those diamonds from Vetter;
  then Birdie and me took &rsquo;em from him, and not five minutes ago that
  blasted man in the mask turned the trick on us, and&rdquo;&mdash;his voice
  changed with a jerk, and became suddenly truculent&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s <i>damned</i> funny
  where he got to!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in here, both of you!&rdquo; ordered Billy Kane peremptorily. &ldquo;Come
  in here, and shut that door! Now&rdquo;&mdash;as they obeyed him&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  the story, is it, Red? Well, listen to mine!&rdquo; His voice grew raucous,
  menacing, unpleasant. &ldquo;This is the second time to-night you&rsquo;ve
  run foul of my plans with your infernal diamonds and your piker hunts, and
  if trouble comes from this, look out for yourself! Five minutes ago, you
  said. Well, I wish he&rsquo;d beaned you while he was at it! You&rsquo;ve
  put an <i>hour&rsquo;s</i> work of mine to the bad! How long do you think
  this disturbance is going on, before the police butt in? Take a look in that
  room, there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men took a step forward, and shrank suddenly back. Birdie Rose&rsquo;s
  face had gone gray. He looked wildly at Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; whispered Red Vallon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said something to you to-night about needing an object lesson,
  so that it would sink into you that when I said the limit I meant it,&rdquo; said
  Billy Kane evenly. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got it now! Do you know who
  that man is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon shook his head. Birdie Rose was nervously plucking at a package
  of cigarette papers that he had drawn from his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His name is Peters,&rdquo; said Billy Kane curtly. &ldquo;Peters
  was the butler at Ellsworth&rsquo;s. Jackson&rsquo;s pal. Get me? I found
  this&rdquo;&mdash;the ruby, from his vest pocket, was lying now in the open
  palm of Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Do you understand what &lsquo;limit&rsquo; means
  now, Red? I found this. He wouldn&rsquo;t talk, and so&mdash;&rdquo; Billy
  Kane shrugged his shoulders coolly, and his hand jerked forward, pointing
  to the disordered room. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t found any more of them when
  you messed it up with your noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon circled his lips with his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to now, thanks to you!&rdquo; snapped Billy Kane
  shortly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only room that&rsquo;s been searched, and
  you&rsquo;ve queered any chance of doing anything more now.&rdquo; He whirled
  impetuously on Red Vallon, and shook his fist in the gangster&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You
  see what you&rsquo;ve done! Even if the police haven&rsquo;t got wise to
  the row, those people in the apartments downstairs will call them in the
  minute they get a chance. Yes, we&rsquo;ve got to beat it! You and your diamonds
  are likely to give us a ride by the juice route up in that little armchair
  in Sing Sing. If your man gets away it&rsquo;s a small matter now. Anybody
  that&rsquo;s caught here will have to stand for&mdash;<i>this</i>. You go
  first, Birdie, and call the crowd off, and <i>scatter</i> the minute you&rsquo;re
  outside the house. I don&rsquo;t want it published in the papers that I was
  with Peters in his expiring moments! Tumble? I can trust you two, because&rdquo;&mdash;Billy
  Kane&rsquo;s smile was unhappy&mdash;&ldquo;if anything leaks, I&rsquo;ll
  know <i>where</i> it leaked from! Get the idea? Now, beat it, Birdie! We&rsquo;ll
  give you a couple of minutes ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man went out. Billy Kane walked coolly to the door, took the skeleton
  key from the inside of the lock, and fitted it again to the outside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Red!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He locked the door, and put the bunch of keys in his pocket. It was comparatively
  quiet in the house now. A door of one of the lower apartments opened cautiously,
  but closed instantly again, as Billy Kane, with the gangster beside him,
  went down the stairs. In another moment they were out on the street, and
  had turned the first corner.</p>
  <p>The gangster was muttering to himself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Birdie and me. But Savnak won&rsquo;t dare let a peep
  out of him, &rsquo;cause he was in on the diamond pinch himself. I&rsquo;ll
  get that guy with the mask yet, if I swing for it. Spilled every blasted
  bean in the bag&mdash;that&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; His voice took on a sudden,
  half cringing, half deferential note. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my fault, Bundy&mdash;honest!
  You know that! You ain&rsquo;t sore, are you, Bundy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane pushed his hat to the back of his head. The night air was cool,
  even crisp, but his hatband was wringing wet. He brushed his damp hair back
  from his forehead. It was strange that he should have murdered Peters, after
  all!</p>
  <p>He answered gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; said Billy Kane, alias the Rat.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Twenty-Four Hours Later</h2>
  <p>From above, faintly, through the flooring, came the tap-tap, tap-tap of
  the old Italian cobbler&rsquo;s hammer. Billy Kane, from his hands and knees,
  straightened up, easing his body from the discomfort of his cramped position;
  and, as he listened, he toyed now with the steel jimmy, commandeered from
  Whitie Jack, that was in his hand. He had been even more assiduous in his
  own tapping, at least for the last hour or more, than was the old fellow
  above there. The old fellow seemed to work all day&mdash;and all night. It
  was night now&mdash;or, rather, evening. If there was any sound heard from
  the street it would be attributed to the old cobbler, of course, which was
  just as well.</p>
  <p>The murky light from the single incandescent across the room threw the sparse
  furnishings of the Rat&rsquo;s den into uncouth shadows on the walls, and
  threw his own shadow into a grotesque, shapeless blotch upon the floor. From
  the street level, down through the cellar-like stairway to this underground
  abode, seeping in through the closed door, came the muffled roll of traffic,
  and a footstep now and then on the pavement like the echo of some sound that
  was detached, far distant.</p>
  <p>He resumed his work, tapping with infinite pains with the butt of his steel
  jimmy on board after board of the flooring. And now this board or that seemed
  to give back a more resonant sound than its fellows, and he tapped it again,
  and still again, only to shake his head finally, and pass on to the next
  board.</p>
  <p>There were other secrets in this crime hole besides that ingenious door
  and its tunnel to the shed and lane behind; secrets that <i>she</i> had plainly
  stated existed, and had as plainly stated were no secrets to her; secrets
  that she wielded in such a manner as to complicate a situation that was already
  one of extreme peril and desperate enough. They were the Rat&rsquo;s secrets;
  and for the moment he was the Rat, and self-preservation made the possession
  of those secrets vitally essential to him.</p>
  <p>The net seemed to be drawing closer around him; at moments it seemed to
  be strangling him. He had built so heavily on Peters. And Peters was dead.
  And he, Billy Kane, was still the Rat. It was difficult enough to carry out
  the r&ocirc;le, as it was&mdash;but if the Rat should unexpectedly return!
  Where was the Rat? If he could glean a hint of when the Rat might probably
  return, or of the Rat&rsquo;s whereabouts! Surely those secrets hidden here
  somewhere would answer, in a measure at least, those questions. Or, if not,
  then the fuller and more intimate knowledge they must give him of the Rat
  would make his assumed r&ocirc;le more secure, safer as long as he was forced
  to play it, since they would place in his hands the trumps that would enable
  him to preserve this character he had usurped as he came more and more into
  direct contact with that malignant Crime Trust of which the legitimate Rat
  was obviously one of the leading spirits. And she, that strange, mysterious
  being, whom he had come to call the Woman in Black, whose hatred, a hatred
  that was boundless, more bitter, more deliberate, more merciless than, it
  seemed, any human could hold for another, he had acquired through this abhorrent
  proxy that fate had thrust upon him&mdash;surely these things hidden here,
  if he could but find them, must too, in a measure at least, explain what
  lay between her and the devil in human guise whose part he, Billy Kane, was
  compelled to play.</p>
  <p>He worked on, his ear attuned to the sound as the steel jimmy tapped the
  flooring, his mind feverishly, insistently active. He had counted on forcing
  the truth from Peters last night. Instead, he had found the old butler murdered,
  and had only managed to escape destruction himself at the hands of Red Vallon
  and the underworld through a spurious alibi that was in itself a ghastly
  thing. He, as the Rat, stood now the self-confessed murderer of Peters! Yes,
  the net seemed to be drawing its strands so tightly about him sometimes that
  they strangled him, and strangled his soul, and made his courage falter.</p>
  <p>Peters was dead, murdered&mdash;and to have made the man talk he would have
  gone the limit himself. He had meant to wring the truth from Peters&rsquo; lips
  at any cost. But a dead man couldn&rsquo;t talk!</p>
  <p>It was not warm in the room, nor was he overheated by his exertions, but
  Billy Kane, with the back of his hand, swept away a bead of moisture that
  had oozed out upon his forehead. Who was it who had murdered Peters? And
  why? His brain had wrestled with that problem since last night. There seemed
  to be but one answer, one solution. Peters&rsquo; connection with the Ellsworth
  murder, the search that had been made in Peters&rsquo; bedroom, and carried
  no further than that single room, indicating that what had been sought had
  been found, seemed to be proof positive that the author of the crime was
  at least conversant with the details of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murder, if
  he were not, indeed, as seemed even more likely, one of those who had actually
  participated in that murder himself. And with this as a premise the motive
  behind Peters&rsquo; murder was apparently clear enough. Nearly fifteen thousand
  dollars and a fortune in rubies had been taken from the steel vault in the
  Ellsworth home. Peters might have been the temporary custodian, in whole
  or in part, of the proceeds of the robbery, or he might only have been in
  possession of his share. In either case it was enough to account for his
  having been double-crossed and murdered by one of his own accomplices, or
  else by some one sufficiently well informed about the Ellsworth murder to
  know that Peters had at least a tempting enough portion of the &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in
  his flat to make a visit there very much worth while.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane smiled a little grimly now, as, moving forward, he pushed the
  bed to one side in order to continue his examination of the flooring. That
  had been his solution; but, strangely enough, the newspapers for once had
  had no solution to offer. The known presence of so many men&mdash;when Red
  Vallon&rsquo;s gang had invaded the house&mdash;indicated quite clearly,
  the papers said, that it was the work of an organized band; but, apart from
  that, they were frankly mystified. But because Peters had been the butler
  of David Ellsworth, and had been murdered just three nights after his master
  had been murdered, the morning papers had flung clamorous headlines across
  their front pages, and had filled their columns with every detail that had
  even the remotest bearing upon the affair. They, however, scarcely hinted
  at even a possible connection between the two crimes, for the very simple
  reason that Peters had obviously been attacked by a gang, whereas, in the
  case of David Ellsworth, they <i>knew</i> that the old millionaire had been
  done to death by his private secretary, Billy Kane!</p>
  <p>He had read the papers, all of them. But out of the welter of words there
  had been only one thing that had possessed any value for him in the shape
  of information, and even that had been of a negative character. Some reporter
  had unearthed the fact that a stranger, whose description answered in a general
  way to Whitie Jack, had been seen loitering around the neighborhood of Peters&rsquo; apartment
  during a good part of the previous day. The description was not accurate
  enough to identify Whitie Jack positively; but as Whitie Jack <i>had</i> been
  there, and there on his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s instructions, he had immediately
  sent the man away that morning, and had told him to keep under cover until
  further orders.</p>
  <p>The steel jimmy tapped with persistent inquisitiveness along another board.
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips were tight now. Peters&rsquo; death had seemed at
  first to have robbed him of all he had been building upon; and during the
  hours alone here in this den last night, facing what looked like the ruin
  of the final chance and hope of establishing his own innocence, of clearing
  his own name, of bringing to justice the wantons who had struck down old
  David Ellsworth, he had known those bitterest of hours where the will weakens,
  and courage seems a useless thing and a mockery. But he had fought through
  those hours, and the morning had brought its reward. Peters&rsquo; murder
  had broken the thread of evidence, but equally, it seemed, after all, it
  had knitted it together again&mdash;there was the Man with the Crutch.</p>
  <p>His lips relaxed a little in an ironical smile. The papers had overlooked
  the Man with the Crutch! It was Red Vallon who, all unconsciously, had joined
  together the broken thread. The gangster had come here to the den that noon.
  There had been a marked increase of deference in the man&rsquo;s attitude
  and manner, a sort of unholy admiration, awe, respect and fear. The man,
  hardened though he was himself, was still visibly affected by the fact that
  he stood in the presence of the Rat, alias Bundy Morgan, who, as he believed,
  had coolly and imperturbably given gruesome evidence that, to gain his ends,
  he would neither hesitate nor stop at murder. Red Vallon had not forgotten,
  and was not likely to forget, his &ldquo;object lesson!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Red Vallon had told his story furtively, leaning across the table, talking
  in a guarded whisper. He had got it straight enough from one of his own men,
  who the police in turn believed was one of their own stool pigeons. Shortly
  before the confusion incident to the exit of Red Vallon&rsquo;s men on the
  previous night, the exact hour not positively established, a man with a crutch,
  and carrying a small hand bag, was known to have crept cautiously out of
  the apartment house where Peters had his flat. After that the man had disappeared. &ldquo;The
  police have elected the cripple as the guy that waltzed off with the swag
  while the rest of the bunch made a noise to smear up his tracks,&rdquo; Red
  Vallon had said, with a malicious grin. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
  pushing a good thing along, Bundy? What&rsquo;s the matter with pushing out
  a few feelers, and trying to spot this crutch gazabo? The Pippin&rsquo;s
  the one that put me wise, and the Pippin can make good nosing him out if
  any one can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There had come upon Billy Kane an overwhelming surge of relief. More than
  anything else on earth that he had suddenly wanted at that moment was&mdash;the
  Man with the Crutch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he had answered gruffly, afraid almost to trust his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Red Vallon had responded. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d
  be strong for it! Mabbe it won&rsquo;t last long, &rsquo;cause the guy ought
  to be able to clear himself unless we can hitch it onto him for keeps, but
  there&rsquo;s nothing like heaving a little dirt in the eyes of the bulls,
  and shooting &rsquo;em off on the wrong lay. It&rsquo;ll keep &rsquo;em guessing
  for a while anyhow. You leave it to me, Bundy. I owe you something for queering
  your game last night, though I guess there wasn&rsquo;t any more of them
  rubies there besides the one you found, for the Pippin says the bulls didn&rsquo;t
  get anything, and I owe you something for the lemon I&rsquo;ve handed you
  so far in falling down on spotting the ruby collection in any of the speak-easy
  joints; but I won&rsquo;t fall down here. You leave it to me! I&rsquo;ll
  pull some slick stuff this time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steel jimmy tapped on. Billy Kane&rsquo;s face was set. The Man with
  the Crutch! Was there any doubt but that the Man with the Crutch was not
  only Peters&rsquo; murderer, but, more vital still, one who, in Peters&rsquo; stead
  now, embodied the clue to the hell-hatched plot that had cost David Ellsworth
  his life, and had craftily woven the evidence of murder around him, Billy
  Kane? The Man with the Crutch! If only Red Vallon and the Pippin did not
  fail, then&mdash; The steel jimmy, almost perfunctorily, tapped over the
  same board again; and then Billy Kane suddenly bent lower, his ear close
  to the floor. He tapped once more. There was no doubt of it! The sound was
  unquestionably and distinctly <i>hollow</i>. He felt his pulse quicken. Off
  and on during the day he had covered almost the entire flooring of the room.
  He had started with the flooring. Only the flooring and the walls could contain
  any hidden recess. He had not touched the walls yet, and it might not be
  necessary now!</p>
  <p>He was examining the board critically. It was a short board, rough and uneven,
  about ten inches wide, that ran to the edge of the wall. There seemed to
  be no sign of any secret spring, either on the adjacent flooring or on the
  wall, nor did the board itself appear to be in any way loose or show any
  evidence of ever having been removed before. He frowned as he tapped it again
  and found that, quite as unmistakably as before, the hollow sound came back
  to him; and then, inserting the point of the jimmy in the joint at the end
  of the board, he gave the board a sharp wrench. It came away readily, but
  with it came a weary smile to Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. Nothing! The under
  flooring had rotted away, which accounted for the hollow sound, and he was
  rewarded with nothing more than a hole bounded both in depth and width by
  the floor joists which rested on the ground. Half angry, half ironically
  amused, he reached forward to replace the board&mdash;and, straightening
  up suddenly, listened.</p>
  <p>Someone was coming down the steps from the street.</p>
  <p>In an instant he had the board and bed back in place, and the steel jimmy
  in his pocket. And now a cigarette was drooping languidly from his lips,
  as, in answer to a low knock, he crossed the room, and halted in front of
  the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s de Cadger,&rdquo; a voice answered.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane opened the door. The Cadger, unknown to him personally, was known
  to him by reputation. As one of those details vital to the preservation of
  the r&ocirc;le he played, he had stored up in his memory during the past
  few days the name of every one connected with the Crime Trust that he had
  heard mentioned either by Red Vallon or others. The Cadger was one of the
  lesser breed; a stage hand, in the expressive vernacular of the underworld.</p>
  <p>The Cadger, a shrivelled, unkempt figure, his coat collar turned up over
  a collarless shirt, an aggressively checkered peak cap pulled far down over
  his eyes, thrust an envelope unceremoniously into Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dis is fer youse, Bundy,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, already turning
  and making his way up the steps to the street again. &ldquo;See youse later!
  I gotta go to Gannet&rsquo;s joint fer his kit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane closed the door, and locked it. He had not heard from Red Vallon
  since noon, nothing in reference to the Pippin&rsquo;s quest for the Man
  with the Crutch. He tore the envelope open eagerly, the thought uppermost
  in his mind that this was a message from Red Vallon now; and then, staring
  at the sheet of paper which he had extracted from the envelope, he dropped,
  suddenly tight-lipped, into the chair by the table under the light.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t from Red Vallon. It was a message like the one Red Vallon
  had showed him the night before, a message in the Crime Trust&rsquo;s cipher.
  He turned instinctively in his chair, glancing toward the secret door at
  the rear of the room, as though he half expected to see it open, and see
  that slim little figure in black enter, as though he half expected to hear
  her cool, softly modulated voice that veiled, even as did the clear ripple
  in her laugh, menace and contempt. And then he laughed aloud in a short,
  hard way. A fool! Was he? Well, she had come in through that door before,
  hadn&rsquo;t she, when something was in the wind?</p>
  <p>His eyes reverted to the sheet of paper. He knew what it was! The headquarters
  of the Crime Trust had been broken up, and some of the leaders had even taken
  to cover since the night Karlin had been arrested by the police; but all
  the cogs in that Machiavellian machinery had not stopped, and plans formulated
  and set in motion in the past were still to be carried to their ultimate
  conclusions as they matured day by day. There was not the slightest doubt
  but that this was one of their devil&rsquo;s schemes. Red Vallon&mdash;or
  was it the owner of those great, dark, steady eyes?&mdash;had said enough
  to make him understand that, when temporarily scattered, temporarily wary
  of the police, some unhallowed &ldquo;managing director&rdquo; carried on
  their work, and communicated with the different members of the gang by means
  of these cipher messages.</p>
  <p>And now as he stared at the missive in his hand, angry flush rose slowly
  to his cheeks, and he half made as though to tear the paper into shreds.
  God knew, he had enough to do to keep his own life in his own body without
  this; there was scarcely a moment of the day or night when he was not battling
  with all the wits he possessed to save himself from discovery&mdash;from
  the police as Billy Kane, from the underworld as the spurious Rat&mdash;and
  his brain was already sick and tormented beyond endurance with the struggle.
  Why, then, should he decipher this? If he did, he could not sit idly by and,
  in the possession of the details of some purposed crime, permit that crime
  to be enacted! It was the moral obligation flung in his face again, just
  as it had been on the night he had trapped Karlin, just as it had been last
  night when he had snatched Vetter&rsquo;s diamonds from Red Vallon&rsquo;s
  maw, and not through any threat of <i>hers</i> held over his head, as she
  so thoroughly believed! She wasn&rsquo;t here now&mdash;was she?</p>
  <p>He laid the paper down upon the table, and smoothed it out. Tear it up!
  His short laugh was a jeer flung at himself. Certainly, he could tear it
  up, and he would know nothing about it, except that he had shirked and turned
  his back like a coward upon the responsibility that was already his! He <i>could</i> read
  the cipher, if he wanted to; he had seen her work one out the night before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d settled this sort of thing with myself before!&rdquo; he
  muttered grimly, and taking a pencil from his pocket he began to work out
  the cipher.</p>
  <p>It took some time, perhaps twenty minutes; and then he was studying a second
  sheet of paper upon which he had written the decoded message:</p>
  <p class="note">The Cadger and Gannet will report to you at nine o&rsquo;clock. The Ninth
  Street house will be empty. Dayler and servants out this evening. Secure
  sealed manila envelope in wall safe, left of mantel, in library. Combination:
  Two right, eighteen; one left, eight; one right, twenty-eight. Police on
  trail to-morrow.</p>
  <p>The Cadger&rsquo;s &ldquo;see youse later,&rdquo; then, was to be taken
  literally, and not, as he had supposed, as simply a common and slang expression
  of adieu! Billy Kane looked at his watch. It was not quite eight o&rsquo;clock.
  There was an hour, then, before the Cadger and this Gannet, another of the
  Cadger&rsquo;s ilk, would report here ready to follow his leadership in a
  burglarious raid. Billy Kane stood up; and, in a sort of mechanical and reassuring
  inventory, his hands felt over the outside of his pockets, over the skeleton
  keys they contained, the steel jimmy, the flashlight, the automatic, and
  the soft, slight bulge made by the neatly folded mask&mdash;and, too, over
  another bulge that was made by a certain chamois pocketbook. This latter
  brought a frown. He had not found a way yet to return Vetter&rsquo;s diamonds.
  It wasn&rsquo;t so easy a thing to do when, if the Rat&rsquo;s hand showed
  in the matter, it was certain destruction for the Rat, alias Bundy Morgan,
  and, for the moment, alias Billy Kane! But Vetter and Vetter&rsquo;s diamonds
  were extraneous things just now, weren&rsquo;t they?</p>
  <p>He extinguished the light, crossed to the door, unlocked it, stepped out,
  locked the door behind him, made his way up the steps, and started briskly
  off along the street. He did not know what the contents of that &ldquo;manila
  envelope&rdquo; were, nor who Dayler was, nor the Crime Trust&rsquo;s motive&mdash;he
  was <i>supposed</i> to know all that&mdash;he knew only that there was some
  devil&rsquo;s scheme on foot that would be worthy of the Crime Trust in its
  scope and proportions. And the Crime Trust did not interest itself in <i>little</i> things!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  The Man With The Crutch</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane smiled with grim irony, as he walked rapidly down the block.
  She was not here to-night with her cool, contemptuous voice bidding him to
  do this thing. It was evident, therefore, that she was not quite as infallible
  as she apparently believed herself to be! For once, she was not acquainted
  beforehand with the Crime Trust&rsquo;s movements, it seemed! Perhaps it
  was because, for once, the Rat might not have had anything to do with originating
  the plan that was afoot to-night, for she had certainly always appeared to
  be thoroughly informed where the Rat was concerned!</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders suddenly, dismissing her from his thoughts. He
  would better concentrate his mind on the work in hand! The secret lay in
  the manila envelope. That the envelope contained something of great value,
  or was of great value to someone, was obvious; to Dayler, probably, since
  it was in Dayler&rsquo;s carefully guarded possession. He shrugged his shoulders
  again. He could tell better about that in the course of another hour&mdash;when
  the envelope was in his pocket instead of Dayler&rsquo;s safe! To balk this
  organized gang of super-criminals was sufficient for the moment! Once more
  his shoulders lifted. He perhaps was not even entitled to any great credit
  to-night in fulfilling his &ldquo;moral obligations!&rdquo; For once, there
  appeared to be neither any great danger, nor any great difficulty. The house
  was empty; it was not very far away; he had an hour in which to work undisturbed;
  and at the expiration of that time he should be back in his room, and ready
  to set out with the Cadger and Gannet to rob an <i>empty</i> safe. If he
  with the two men then entered the house, and, for their pains, found the
  manila envelope already gone, certainly there could be no suspicion to rest
  upon him!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane had reached the Bowery now. He went in through the side entrance
  of a corner saloon. Here, a minute&rsquo;s search in the telephone directory
  supplied him with the number of Dayler&rsquo;s house on Ninth Street. After
  that, he made his way over to Washington Square, crossed the Square, gained
  the lower end of Fifth Avenue, practically deserted now at this hour, and,
  a moment later, turning into Ninth Street, headed down the block in the direction
  of Sixth Avenue.</p>
  <p>It was one of the old aristocratic neighborhoods of New York, but changed
  now a great deal with the changing years. What had once been classed as mansions
  had in many cases been metamorphosed into lodging and boarding houses; but
  the &ldquo;mansions&rdquo; were still here, big, substantial, commodious
  stone dwellings. Nor had the boarding houses entirely ousted a certain unobtrusive
  type of wealth and means from their midst, and it argued not at all that
  this Dayler, for instance, because he had his residence here, was not well
  to do, even exceedingly well to do.</p>
  <p>The street was quiet. Billy Kane located the house he sought. He passed
  by it, noting that it had a basement entrance, a flight of stone steps to
  the front door, that it was entirely in darkness, and, returning, he mounted
  the steps quietly and without any attempt at concealment, found the outer
  vestibule door unlocked, opened it&mdash;after making pretense of ringing
  the doorbell for the benefit of anyone on the street who might have paid
  him any notice&mdash;stepped inside, and closed the door behind him. The
  inner door was locked. His skeleton keys came into play. Still far from an
  adept in their use, he was several minutes at this work. Then he stepped
  forward into the hall of the house itself.</p>
  <p>His flashlight stabbed a lane of light through the darkness. The stairs
  leading to the upper floors of the house were ahead of him and on his right;
  on his left, opening off the hall, which seemed to run almost the depth of
  the house, were several doors, all of which were closed. The house was empty,
  the cipher message had assured him of that, but nevertheless he moved now
  with extreme caution to the first door on his left. He knew nothing of the
  plan of the house, but it was at least logical to assume that the library
  was on this floor, and the library was the objective of his search.</p>
  <p>He opened the door slightly, quietly, then drew sharply back, and stood
  tense and motionless, listening. There was a dull, faint glow of light in
  there, not as though the room itself were illuminated, but as though the
  light came from, perhaps, another room beyond. But there was no sound. A
  minute passed, and still he stood there, alert, his ears strained to catch
  the slightest noise. And then, reassured, he pushed the door wider open,
  and stepped over the threshold. That a light might have been left burning,
  either intentionally or inadvertently, presented in itself nothing of the
  unusual, or&mdash;</p>
  <p>He was drawing his hand across his eyes like a man dazed from a blow. The
  light had gone in the winking of an eye. It was pitch black. He was still
  involuntarily staring, through darkness now, toward the front end of the
  room. The light had not come from that direction, it had come through a porti&egrave;red
  archway in quite the opposite direction, but for the moment his mind was
  chaotic, out of control. The room was a drawing-room, a large, stately sort
  of a drawing-room, and there had been a huge pier glass, gilt-framed, between
  the heavily curtained front windows. What he had seen could not have been
  a fantasy, nor due to disordered imagination. His eyes, the instant he had
  entered the room, had gone straight to that glass because it reflected the
  light from the other room. The surface of the glass had been blank as his
  eyes had first fallen upon it, and then, like a flash, enduring for but the
  minutest fraction of a second, the reflection of a figure, a man&rsquo;s
  figure, a man&rsquo;s figure <i>with a crutch</i>, had swept across it&mdash;and
  the light in the other room had gone out.</p>
  <p>And now Billy Kane acted quickly. The time that he had stood there, inert,
  mentally stunned, had been but a matter of seconds exaggerated into seemingly
  interminable, measureless hours. Swiftly, silently, he reached the archway,
  and, sheltering himself behind the folds of the porti&egrave;res, but in
  a position to command the other room with his automatic, which he had whipped
  from his pocket, he stood still and listened. There was only the quick, fierce
  pounding in his own eardrums, in tempo with the mad race of blood through
  his veins. The Man with the Crutch!</p>
  <p>How or why the man came to be here, or what the other had to do with what
  was afoot to-night, scarcely entered his mind. It did not matter! Nothing
  mattered&mdash;save to get the Man with the Crutch. Everything else paled
  into insignificance. It was the <i>same</i> man that had murdered Peters;
  there would not be <i>two</i> men with crutches who prowled stealthily at
  night in other people&rsquo;s houses! But that it was Peters&rsquo; murderer
  was significant now only because it identified the man as one who held the
  secret of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murder; the man who, if he, Billy Kane,
  could but get to grips with him, would tell what he knew to the last word,
  or one or the other of them would never leave this house alive. It was the
  man who could end this hideous masquerade that he, Billy Kane, was forced
  to assume; the man who could clear his name of the foul blot that had cost
  him friends, the companionship of honest men, and that was like at any instant
  to cost him his life.</p>
  <p>There was no sound.</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane&rsquo;s voice rang suddenly, imperatively through the
  silence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His flashlight bored through the darkness, circling the room in front of
  him. The room&mdash;it was the library beyond doubt&mdash;was empty. His
  jaws locked. He had taken a chance. It had failed. But now his glance fell
  upon the door, diagonally across the library from him, that, from its position,
  obviously opened on the hall. He could have sworn that the doors opening
  on the hall were all closed when he had entered the house. This one was ajar
  now!</p>
  <p>He crossed the library with a bound, swung the door wide, and peered out
  into the hall. He could see nothing; but now, from somewhere below, he caught
  a sound as of a boot heel thudding on a bare floor&mdash;or, perhaps, the
  tap of a crutch!</p>
  <p>Along at the rear of the hall his flashlight focused on the head of a basement
  stairway. He ran for this now; and then, with more caution, wary of offering
  himself as a target for a shot that would put an end to any hope of getting
  within reach of the other, his flashlight out, he began to pick his way downstairs.
  Halfway down, he caught another sound. From the front of the house, softly
  and cautiously though it was done, there came the unmistakable opening and
  closing of the basement door.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane took the remaining stairs in a leap, and, his flashlight pointing
  the way, dashed along the hallway below. He reached the door, and pulled
  at it. Then, with an angry, muttered exclamation, he stood there for an instant
  hesitant. The man had managed to lock the door behind him! Mechanically his
  hand went toward his pocket for his skeleton keys, but stopped halfway as,
  turning suddenly, he raced back upstairs. It would take too long to try out
  key after key. There was a better way. There was the front door. He had left
  that unlocked when he came in. He gained this now, jerked it open, lunged
  through the little vestibule, snatched at the knob of the outer door&mdash;and
  wrenched at it viciously like a madman in mingled rage and chagrin. It was
  locked! It had not been locked even when he had come in!</p>
  <p>Calmer in an instant, he took his keys from his pocket and worked with feverish
  haste at the lock. It would possibly take less time to run into the drawing-room,
  get a window open, and jump to the ground, but he did not dare do that. He
  had to come back here with the Cadger and Gannet in a little while, and he
  dared not risk anything that would imperil his r&ocirc;le in the eyes of
  the underworld. Even a number of people coming and going from the house,
  if they acted naturally, entering by the door as though they had a right
  to enter, would never attract the slightest notice from either neighbors
  or passers-by. That was what doors were for! But a man leaping out through
  one of the front windows would invite certain attention, suspicion, and instant
  investigation.</p>
  <p>Another key! Would he never get one that would fit! This wasn&rsquo;t the
  door he had opened before. A minute, perhaps two, perhaps even three, must
  have gone by! God, how clumsy his fingers were! The man must have had amazing
  agility for a cripple, and the craft and cunning of a devil to come up here
  instantly on leaving the basement and lock this door! Would he never get
  the&mdash;yes, he had it now! He swung the door open, and from the top step
  his glance swept the street in both directions. And then there came a sort
  of bitter philosophical acceptance of a situation that he had already more
  than half expected. The Man with the Crutch had had too much time. There
  was no sign of him now.</p>
  <p>But there was still a chance! Billy Kane closed the door behind him, went
  quietly down the steps to the pavement&mdash;there was still the inviolability
  of the house to be preserved&mdash;walked along without undue haste until
  far enough away to preclude the chance of any connection being established
  between himself and the house he had just left, and then broke into a run.
  There was still a chance. But it was a slim one. He knew that. The man must
  have gone toward either Sixth Avenue or Fifth Avenue. It was more likely
  Sixth Avenue; there would be more people there, more traffic, more opportunity
  to &ldquo;lose himself.&rdquo; It was the logical thing to do. Lower Fifth
  Avenue at night was almost as deserted as a tomb; the man could have been
  seen there blocks away.</p>
  <p>Perhaps fifteen minutes passed. At the expiration of that period Billy Kane
  returned to the Dayler residence, and for the second time that night coolly
  and quite casually mounted the steps, and again entered the house. His search
  had been futile. He had circuited the blocks in the neighborhood, and hunted
  up and down the adjacent section of Sixth Avenue; and the more he had hunted
  the more he had realized the futility of what he was doing, though, at that,
  he had even, as a last hope, returned by Fifth Avenue. And now he was back
  in the house again, and quite conscious that this, too, was likely now to
  prove as barren of results as his search had been. The man had got away,
  and with the man in all likelihood had gone, too, the manila envelope from
  the wall safe in the library! What else had the other been in the library
  for?</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shrugged his shoulders, as, using his flashlight again, he stepped
  from the hall into the drawing-room, and from there through the archway into
  the library. There was the one possibility that he had come upon the Man
  with the Crutch and interrupted the other in his work <i>before</i> the envelope
  had been secured. That was the one possibility that remained, and that was
  the one possibility that had prompted him to come back.</p>
  <p>He stood for a moment now beside the table that occupied the center of the
  room, his flashlight creeping in a slow, inquisitive circle around the walls.
  And now the round white ray, arrested, held on the mantel opposite the archway.
  On either side of the mantel, shoulder high, and projecting out a little
  from the wall, were what appeared to be bric-a-brac, or, perhaps, liqueur
  cupboards, with leaded glass doors. &ldquo;Wall safe, left of mantel,&rdquo; the
  message had said. He smiled a little grimly in appreciation and understanding,
  as he moved over and halted before the left-hand cupboard. It was a rather
  neat ambush for a wall safe, this idea of Dayler&rsquo;s&mdash;whoever Dayler
  might be!</p>
  <p>The leaded glass door opened readily. The ray of the flashlight flooded
  the interior. Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile was gone. He was quite sure now that
  he was too late. The cupboard was used for liqueurs, but the liqueurs in
  turn were evidently used for the purpose of veiling the little nickel dial
  of a safe that protruded from the wall at the rear of the cupboard, for the
  bottles were all pushed now to one side, and the dial, with a sort of diabolical
  mockery, it seemed, winked back reflected rays from the glare of the flashlight.
  It was blatantly apparent now that this had been the object of the other&rsquo;s
  visit to the house, and it was almost as equally apparent that the man had
  got what he had come for. And yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two right, eighteen; one left&rdquo;&mdash;almost perfunctorily,
  muttering the combination, Billy Kane had reached in and was twirling the
  knob of the dial&mdash;&ldquo;eight; one right, twenty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little steel door swung noiselessly open. Billy Kane stared into the
  miniature safe, bewildered. And then he laughed a little. A minute before
  and he would not have given a penny for his chances! The other had got only
  so far as to move the bottles to one side. He had beaten the Man with the
  Crutch by the very narrow margin of time it would have taken to manipulate
  the combination! Perhaps, though, the other hadn&rsquo;t known the combination,
  and was just about to set to work to force the safe! Well, it didn&rsquo;t
  matter! The manila envelope lay there, sealed, intact.</p>
  <p>He took the envelope from the safe, closed the door, and locked it&mdash;and
  whirled suddenly around from his position in front of the mantel. His flashlight,
  jerked upward, played full upon the archway. A cool, disdainful laugh rippled
  low through the room&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s laugh. Billy Kane did not move.
  The chill that had clutched at his heart, the fear of discovery, was gone
  almost as quickly as it had come. He had nothing to dread on that score from&mdash;the
  Woman in Black! And it was not the first time she had come upon him unexpectedly!
  And it was she who stood there now; and she still stood full in the glare
  of his flashlight, a bewitching, entrancing, mysterious little figure, whose
  great dark eyes were fixed on him, half in a deliberate, speculative way,
  and half in a sort of contemptuous mockery.</p>
  <p>It was she who broke the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s true, Bundy?&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
  <p>He felt the blood surge hot into his cheeks. He knew a sudden bitter rebellion
  at the contempt in those steady eyes, the same bitter rebellion he had known
  last night in her presence, a rebellion against the fate that caused him,
  through reason of being the counterpart of some incarnate fiend, to stand
  in her eyes as that actual fiend himself, as the one who in some way had
  done her, or hers, irreparable wrong, as the embodiment of all that was loathsome
  and hideous to her. He was the Rat to her, as to everybody else. The envelope
  crackled in his fingers, as he clenched his hand. Would he always have to
  play the Rat&mdash;to her! What would that perfect oval face, beautiful even
  now in its fearless contempt, look like in softer mood?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is what true?&rdquo; he demanded gruffly.</p>
  <p>She came toward him across the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you are really playing the game,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  not much credit to you, of course, since you are doing it through fear, but
  still&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders daintily, as she stood beside
  him. &ldquo;Do you know, Bundy, that lately you seem to have changed somehow.
  I do not know just how, and I cannot account for it. It puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; growled Billy Kane, alias the Rat. &ldquo;And
  I don&rsquo;t know what game you&rsquo;re talking about, either!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I told you that I would
  hold you responsible for any crime committed by your accomplices that it
  lay within your power to circumvent. That was the chance I gave you, and
  you seem to be taking it. I thought I would test you out to-night when you
  might imagine that I was ignorant of what was going on, and that you might,
  therefore, count on escaping the consequences as far as I was concerned.
  You were to come here with the Cadger and Gannet at nine o&rsquo;clock to
  rob that safe. You are here alone long before that hour, and you have robbed
  the safe. I presume, at least I am going to give you credit for it, that
  it is because you are playing the game I referred to, and are checkmating
  your partners, and preventing the crime from being carried any further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think you had better put out that flashlight,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>He must play the Rat. His soul jeered at him ironically. He snapped off
  the light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you get wise to this?&rdquo; he flung out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About to-night? Why, it was one of your own pet schemes, wasn&rsquo;t
  it, Bundy&mdash;all worked out quite a while ago? That&rsquo;s how I knew!
  Well, am I right about the reason for you being here alone? And, if so, how
  did you propose to square yourself with your cronies of the underworld?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By coming back here with the Cadger and Gannet, of course,&rdquo; he
  replied curtly, &ldquo;and letting them fall for the idea that someone had
  beaten us all to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;Well, I quite approve, Bundy.
  And I&rsquo;ll take that envelope now, please! You won&rsquo;t have any further
  use for it, and I&rsquo;ll attend to the rest of this affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He handed her the envelope. He asked nothing better than that she should
  assume any further responsibility that might be connected with its contents.
  As far as he was concerned there were matters of far greater moment now.
  There was the Man with the Crutch! And that was a matter in which he had
  very cogent reasons for desiring to play a lone hand. His lips tightened.
  It was fairly evident that she had not been in the house the first time he
  had entered but he wanted to be sure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you get in here?&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Followed me,
  I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About five minutes ago,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;And you left
  the door unlocked&mdash;though I had a key. No, I didn&rsquo;t follow you!
  Why should I? I knew that you would be here at nine o&rsquo;clock anyway,
  and I simply came a little ahead of time. I really hoped, you see, that you
  would do the same&mdash;and for more reasons than the one I have just mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he grunted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you since last night, you know,&rdquo; she
  said deliberately. &ldquo;What about the diamonds that were stolen from Vetter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got them,&rdquo; he answered shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Vetter</i> hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; There was a cold, unpleasant inflection
  in her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you expect!&rdquo; He forced a raucous note into his
  voice. He was not sure that it sounded genuine. It was not easy to play the
  Rat with her! &ldquo;Think it over! It&rsquo;s not so soft a job to get them
  back to him without leaving a trail behind that might trip me up! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She appeared to consider this for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Well, have you got
  them here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He reached into his pocket and took out the chamois pocketbook.
  He laughed brusquely, as he held it out to her. &ldquo;If you can handle
  that envelope, maybe you can handle the sparklers, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&mdash;and I will,&rdquo; she said simply, as she took the pocketbook
  from him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only fair. I told you once that I would put
  no difficulties in the way of your keeping yourself solid&mdash;if you could!&mdash;with
  your fellow yeggs. And that applies equally to to-night. You may bring the
  Cadger back here. You will find the house empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll move along then;
  I&rsquo;ve got just about enough time left. And would you mind <i>locking</i> the
  front door when you go out? I&rsquo;d like the Cadger to get all the run
  that&rsquo;s coming to him for his money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stepped forward to pass her, but she laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said tersely. &ldquo;I agreed to look after this
  envelope, but even so you are not through yet to-night, Bundy. I know where
  Mr. Dayler is this evening, and I am going to bring him back here to his
  own house myself. But I will give you time first to play out your little
  farce with your two thugs, and send them about their business. Say, ten o&rsquo;clock.
  Mr. Dayler and myself will be here at that time&mdash;and so will you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; inquired Billy Kane insolently. &ldquo;Whats the lay?
  A trap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;an experiment,&rdquo; she said evenly. &ldquo;I would like
  to find out if there is really anything <i>human</i>, if there is a shred
  of decency left in you. I want you to see your crime for once from your victim&rsquo;s
  standpoint. It may help you, if you <i>are</i> human, to keep on &lsquo;playing
  the game&rsquo;; and that will help you, if you can keep out of the clutches
  of the underworld, to keep out of the electric chair at Sing Sing. You quite
  understand, Bundy? At ten o&rsquo;clock! And I should not even mind if you
  are found here in this room&mdash;in the dark&mdash;when Mr. Dayler and myself
  enter the house&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock. And now I think you had better
  hurry, Bundy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a twisted smile on Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. He was the Rat, and
  the Rat would be here, or anywhere else at ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;if she
  said so. There was no comment to make. The Rat had no choice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said gruffly, and moved past her to the door,
  and out to the hall; and a moment later, reaching the street, he swung into
  a hurried stride, heading back for the Rat&rsquo;s den.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Mirrored Years</h2>
  <p>It was quite dark here in Dayler&rsquo;s library, yet he had sat so long
  in this chair that his eyes seemed to have accommodated themselves to the
  darkness, and it seemed as though he could distinguish every object in the
  room. Surely, interminably as the minutes dragged themselves out, the quarter-hour
  that had stood between ten o&rsquo;clock and the time he had sent the Cadger
  and Gannet away was up now! His flashlight winked through the blackness,
  played on the dial of his watch, and the blackness fell again. It still lacked
  five minutes of the hour.</p>
  <p>Strange how his mind worked! There was no speculation as to precisely why
  she had demanded his presence here, there was only intolerant, angry impatience
  because she had done so. If it had not been for her, he could have been making
  vital use of every one of these minutes! There was nothing else to have hindered
  him! It had been almost childishly easy to pull the wool over Gannet&rsquo;s
  and the Cadger&rsquo;s eyes. He had let the Cadger and Gannet take all the
  initiative&mdash;apparently. The two men had forced the basement door, and
  then, going upstairs, had opened the front door for him, which he, strolling
  down the street a few minutes later, had entered as casually as he had already
  done before on two occasions that night. After that, the three of them, clustered
  around the mantel, the Cadger manipulating the dial of the safe while Gannet
  held the flashlight, had made the discovery in <i>common</i> that the safe
  had been already looted. He had joined in the dismay, chagrin and fury of
  his companions; he had joined in the frantic search of desks and drawers,
  which he had inaugurated, and which he had permitted to endure for a full
  half hour. At the expiration of that time he had coded a terse cipher report,
  and had handed it to the Cadger and Gannet for delivery. They were to leave
  the house, himself last, a few minutes apart in order to avoid arousing any
  attention; and the Cadger and Gannet, obediently and unsuspiciously, had
  gone. And he had remained!</p>
  <p>It had been very simple. And there remained no trace of the search that
  had been made. His eyes now, so strangely accustomed to the darkness, reassured
  him on that score. He had warned the men not to leave any traces behind them!</p>
  <p>He stirred uneasily in his chair. All this had been essential, necessary,
  vital, in order to preserve his r&ocirc;le of the Rat from suspicion, and
  himself from subsequent and quick disaster at the hands of the underworld;
  but the minutes that were slipping away from him now, as he sat here impotent,
  were priceless. Red Vallon and the Pippin at any moment might run the Man
  with the Crutch to earth, and his hands were tied. He had no concern with
  the effect that the loss of the envelope might have had on this Dayler; he
  was utterly indifferent to either the contents of that envelope, or Dayler&rsquo;s
  connection with it. It seemed to plumb the very depths of irony that she
  appeared to labor under the impression she might somehow, in this way, arouse
  his better nature and touch some softer human chord within him! He was concerned
  more with the connection between that envelope and the Man with the Crutch;
  and very much more with the contents of that handbag the Man with the Crutch
  had carried away from Peters&rsquo; flat the night before; and still more
  again with the Man with the Crutch himself! The man had tricked him here
  tonight, slipped through his fingers this time, but&mdash;</p>
  <p>The front door was being opened. Billy Kane stood up, shrugging his shoulders.
  He was in a truculent mood now, impatient to be gone, prompted even now to
  go, restrained only by the cooler counsel of common sense. She had the whip-hand
  over him. A word from her, and he would be in exactly the same case as if
  he had failed in the play he had just made with the Cadger and Gannet. Voices
  reached him; hers, quiet and controlled; a man&rsquo;s, gruff, irritated,
  sharply antagonistic.</p>
  <p>And then the door from the hall opened, and the lights in the library went
  on. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes, passing swiftly over the trim little figure
  in black across the room, met and held those of a man who, startled now,
  stepped hastily back, only to discover that his companion had quietly and
  swiftly closed the door behind them.</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s lips were suddenly compressed and hard, though the color
  had ebbed a little from his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please sit down over there at the table, Mr. Dayler,&rdquo; she requested
  softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the man angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing
  of the kind! What&rsquo;s the meaning of this? You inveigled me back here
  by hinting at some kind of story, and you run me, in my own house, into the
  presence of a thug!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true that I asked this&mdash;gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated
  over the choice of the word, while her eyes in a sort of mocking humor inventoried
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s none too reputable appearance and attire&mdash;&ldquo;to
  come here; but it is equally true that I have &lsquo;some kind of a story&rsquo; that
  I think will interest you. Bundy, you might try and <i>persuade</i> Mr. Dayler
  to sit down!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A grim smile came to Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. He was a pawn too, like this
  Dayler; a pawn to be moved about at will by this outrageously courageous,
  imperturbable, and, yes, in spite of his own irritation, adorable little
  personage. He turned his attention now to Dayler. The other could have been
  no more than forty-five, yet his hair was not merely prematurely gray, it
  was white, as a very old man&rsquo;s is white; his face, clean shaven, was
  kindly, though drawn now in tense lines about the lips and forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; Billy Kane ordered curtly. He was fingering his
  automatic, playing up to the cue she had given him.</p>
  <p>Dayler hesitated; and then abruptly stepped forward and flung himself into
  a chair at the table, his back to the mantel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he challenged. &ldquo;You got me out of my club on the
  pretext of having something to say about a man named Keats whom I once knew;
  but from the look of things it appears to be much more likely that, with
  my own house affording you protection, I am to be coolly robbed of my watch,
  money, and such other valuables as you may be able to lay your hands on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The slim little figure had slipped gracefully into a chair, facing Dayler
  on the opposite side of the table. She smiled curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, at least, I will keep my promise first, and tell you about this
  Keats,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Buck Keats, wasn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Dayler? And,
  as your servants may be back in another half hour or so, we won&rsquo;t waste
  any time in getting to the story. It goes back about twenty years. At that
  time you were in the Yukon, and pretty well away from civilization, and you
  had been prospecting all summer with your partner, a man quite a little older
  than you were, a man named Laynton, Joe Laynton&mdash;Square Joe, they called
  him in that country, and you ought to know why. He was a big man&mdash;in
  his body and in his soul&mdash;a God&rsquo;s nobleman, wasn&rsquo;t he, Mr.
  Dayler?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dayler was leaning forward, staring at her in a strange, puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>She shook her head again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may not be quite accurate in the little details,&rdquo; she went
  on. &ldquo;You will overlook that. You and Laynton delayed your return to
  Dawson too long that fall. You were caught in bad weather. Your provisions
  ran low. Laynton met with a nasty accident with an axe. In reaching up above
  his head to cut some branches for fuel, the axe in some way glanced off and
  inflicted a very serious and a very ugly wound in his shoulder and chest.
  Things went from bad to worse. For days Laynton could do nothing but lie
  in his blood-soaked bunk. Provisions ran still lower. The winter was settling
  down hard. You had already delayed too long, and now Laynton couldn&rsquo;t
  go. And yet you woke up one morning to find his bunk empty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes, as he stood beside the table, passed
  from one to the other. Her small gloved hand, resting on the arm of her chair,
  had closed tightly; and into Dayler&rsquo;s face, grown haggard now, had
  come the look of a dumb beast in hurt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On a sheet of paper on the table&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was lower
  now&mdash;&ldquo;Laynton had left a message for you, the kind a brave man
  would leave, explaining it all, and bidding you take the one chance you had
  and go without him. And piled on the table beside the sheet of paper was
  his money, quite a few hundred dollars. You went to the door of the shack,
  and you followed the tracks in the snow. And you found him, and you found
  his revolver beside him. You were already weak and half delirious yourself
  for lack of food, and I think this crazed you and unhinged your mind. You
  buried him in the snow, and picked up the revolver and put it in your pocket.
  You took the paper and the money and what food there was, and you ran, like
  the madman you then were, away from the shack. I do not know how long you
  wandered, nor how you existed, nor the number of miles you put between yourself
  and the man who had given his life for you; but eventually you were found
  by a trapper, and the trapper&rsquo;s name was Keats, Buck Keats, a man with
  a very unsavory record. You spent some time with Keats. You recovered your
  physical health, but your mind remained affected. What had taken place was
  temporarily a blank to you. Keats robbed you of Laynton&rsquo;s money and
  most of your own, and he stole that paper which later on was to mean so much
  to you. He preferred, if anything were ever known, that you, and not he,
  should be credited with having stolen Laynton&rsquo;s money, and he further
  helped out that suggestion by getting you, after some months, out of the
  country, by having you, in a word, disappear. I imagine you were like a child
  in his hands. I am sure you do not even know how you got there, but the spring
  found you, quite normal in all respects save a broken memory, working at
  anything you could get to do in Mexico, and living there under the name of
  Dayler. Your proper name is Forbes, John Forbes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dayler&rsquo;s head was forward on the table, and buried in his hands. And
  Billy Kane, meeting her glance, read through a sudden mist in the brown eyes,
  a bitter condemnation of himself that he did not quite fully understand.
  He was not the Rat, was he? He was only playing the Rat in a fight for his
  life, and to win back a name of his own! How should he understand!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am taking too long,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;Your awakening
  came then. You read in a paper of the discovery of a brutal and revolting
  crime in the Yukon&mdash;the murder of Joe Laynton. The snow had melted,
  and a trooper of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police had found the body. If
  ever there was a <i>prima facie</i> case of murder it was there: The axe
  wound, presupposing a quarrel, the blood-soaked bunk, the final wound from
  a revolver shot, the absence of any weapon left in the possession of the
  dead man, the fact that he had apparently been stripped of his money, and,
  most damning of all, that <i>you</i> had disappeared. It all came back to
  you in a flash then; and, like the last straw, adding to this array of evidence
  already against you, you realized that you were now living under an <i>assumed</i> name.
  The letter, written and signed by Laynton, that would have saved you, was
  gone. You naturally did not know that it had been stolen from you; you believed
  that you had lost it. It would take a very brave man, and a man that was
  very sure of himself indeed, to judge you for what you did then. Without
  that paper, you, an innocent man, were already as good as hanged if you gave
  yourself up. You continued to live on as Dayler. Twenty years went by. You
  prospered. You lived in all quarters of the globe. No breath of suspicion
  ever associated John Dayler with John Forbes. But you knew, because you knew
  the record of the Royal Northwest Mounted, that the Men Who Never Sleep had
  not forgotten the case, nor given over the search&mdash;and that they never
  would. But at last, with the long lapse of years, you felt yourself secure;
  and finally, a few years ago, you came here and settled in New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dayler&rsquo;s head came up. He passed his hand across his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know all these things?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They are true, aren&rsquo;t
  they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they are true.&rdquo; His voice was scarcely audible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Keats who found you, not the Royal Northwest Mounted,&rdquo; she
  continued. &ldquo;Keats had long ago left the Yukon, and had settled in Chicago&mdash;a
  drunkard. He was an old man now, and down and out, living from hand to mouth.
  I do not know how he found you; I only know that after all these years he
  decided to make restitution, though counting no doubt on you giving him some
  money in return for the letter. However, be that as it may, two days ago
  a man brought you a sealed envelope, which he said a man named Keats, who
  had just died in Chicago, had confessed, as he was dying, to have stolen
  from you, and that Keats, as a last request, had asked that it be given back
  to you. You opened the envelope, and found that it contained Laynton&rsquo;s
  letter. With this in your possession at last you were absolutely secure,
  even in the very improbable event of anything ever being done by the police.
  Why then, after twenty years, should you voluntarily open the case and disrupt
  the associations you had formed, and your life as you had molded it in all
  that time? In any event, you would consider long and carefully before taking
  so vital and momentous a step. I do not know what your final decision was,
  or even if you have come to one yet; but, pending such a decision, you&mdash;&rdquo; She
  motioned suddenly across the table. &ldquo;But first, will you please open
  the table drawer in front of you, Mr. Dayler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He obeyed her, a sort of slow wonder in his movements. The drawer, open,
  disclosed, among other supplies of stationery, a pile of long, manila envelopes.</p>
  <p>She motioned again&mdash;this time to the envelopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sealed the letter up again, in one of those envelopes and put
  it away. And that brings us to to-night. I would like to have you show that
  letter to&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated Billy Kane with a curt nod of her head&mdash;&ldquo;this
  man here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For an instant Dayler did not move, then he stiffened back in his chair,
  his eyes narrowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I begin to see!&rdquo; His jaws snapped hard together. &ldquo;So
  that&rsquo;s what you are after! You propose to steal that paper from me,
  and then blackmail me with it afterwards. It is the letter that you want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And perhaps you will get it for us?&rdquo; she suggested softly.</p>
  <p>There was a grim sort of finality in Dayler&rsquo;s short, unpleasant laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then&rdquo;&mdash;she still spoke softly&mdash;&ldquo;suppose
  I were to tell you that the Men Who Never Sleep have been advised that Dayler
  and John Forbes are one, and that they are travelling down from the Canadian
  West now, and that to-morrow you will be arrested&mdash;<i>and that the letter
  is already gone.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; It came in a startled cry. Dayler half rose from his
  chair, but dropped back again quite coolly, a sarcastic smile suddenly on
  his lips. &ldquo;Clever!&rdquo; he said ironically. &ldquo;Quite a pretty
  little ruse to get me to indicate the whereabouts of that paper! Perhaps
  you will try something else now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bundy&rdquo;&mdash;she turned calmly to Billy Kane&mdash;&ldquo;open
  the door of that little cupboard on the left of the mantel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane stepped across the room in a sort of mechanical obedience, and
  opened the leaded glass door&mdash;just as Dayler, his self-assurance shaken
  now, jumped from his chair, and rushed to the mantel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;her voice came calmly again from the table&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
  Dayler prefers to look for himself, after all, Bundy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man seemed to be fighting desperately for a grip upon himself, and again
  his jaws snapped hard together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another trick to get the combination
  of that safe, to get me to open it! Do you think I&rsquo;m a fool to let
  that paper go now, even at the cost of my life, after you have so kindly
  warned me that I am to be arrested to-morrow? You would have done better
  not to have talked quite so much!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open the safe, Bundy!&rdquo; she instructed evenly. &ldquo;Watch
  him, Mr. Dayler, and satisfy yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dial whirled deftly, swiftly, under Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers. The
  steel door swung open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Gone!</i> My God, it is gone!&rdquo; Dayler&rsquo;s cry now was
  broken, almost inarticulate. His head half buried in the cupboard, he was
  staring into the empty safe. And then he reeled back to the table, and stood
  there clawing at its edge, gray to the lips, looking from one to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not quite finished my story,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;It
  is quite true that Keats is dead; but he did not die two or three days ago,
  he has been dead well over a month. Nor did he die from natural causes. He
  was murdered. There is a gigantic Crime Ring in this country, whose headquarters
  are here in New York, that is as implacable and heinous as it is far-spread
  and powerful. Keats, far under the influence of liquor in a low dive one
  night and in maudlin self-admiration at the idea of making restitution to
  you, became drunkenly confidential, and his &lsquo;confidant,&rsquo; as it
  happened, was an old broken-down yegg of about his own age, too old for active
  work at his sordid trade, a pensioner, a hanger-on, as it were, of this Crime
  Ring, who made himself as valuable as he could in any way that he could.
  He reported the story. Keats was promptly murdered&mdash;not so much for
  the sake of the paper, for that could easily have been taken from him without
  resorting to murder, but that there should be no Keats, with his change of
  heart, ready to take the witness stand in your behalf, and therefore render
  the paper of no value to them at all. The Crime Ring did not, however, act
  with the same haste as far as you were concerned. That is not their way!
  They watched you, they became thoroughly conversant, intimately acquainted
  with you, and your house, and your mode of living. It was necessary that
  they should do so before the next move could be decided upon. It was essential
  that you should know that the document was still in existence, and it was
  equally essential that you should know Keats was dead and would therefore
  never be able to help you with his testimony. The actual delivery of the
  document into your hands was the really clever and finished play to make,
  for it not only accomplished those ends naturally, simply, and without possibility
  of alarming you, but your temporary possession of the letter would also psychologically
  enhance its value in your eyes and make the shock of its subsequent loss
  all the greater&mdash;and you all the more <i>generous</i>! But unless they
  could be sure of recovering it&mdash;if for instance you had a safe-deposit
  vault where you would likely place it&mdash;that plan would not do at all,
  and some other must be devised. They satisfied themselves on that score,
  however; and the discovery of that wall safe, and, incidentally, its combination,
  made it as certain as anything is humanly certain that they would know where
  to find the letter again when they wanted it. And, finally, there was the
  police, the men of the Royal Northwest Mounted, to be put upon your trail.
  It was only when you stood facing arrest for murder, and only when that paper
  was all that stood between you and the hangman&rsquo;s noose, that it was
  worth&mdash;well, perhaps you will say what it is worth? That is the situation
  to-night, Mr. Dayler.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was rocking on his feet, still clawing at the edge of the table
  for support. He seemed to have lost all self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blackmail!&rdquo; he said, through dry, twitching lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And without any come-back!&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;You
  are rated at a quarter of a million. What will you give for that paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dayler did not answer at once. He reached out behind him, felt for the arm
  of his chair, and sat down heavily. He spoke at last, brushing his hand nervously
  across his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give&mdash;ten thousand dollars,&rdquo; he said
  hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not place a very complimentary value on your life,&rdquo; she
  said evenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo; His hand still nervously brushed at his forehead. &ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her laugh rippled through the room. It was low and coolly disdainful, but
  it seemed to Billy Kane, standing by the mantel, tight-lipped, watching the
  scene, that it held, too, a queer, underlying, tremulous note.</p>
  <p>Dayler wet his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That paper is the only thing that will save you,&rdquo; she explained
  monotonously. &ldquo;Is money any good to you&mdash;unless you live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Dayler who laughed now, but it was hysterically. His hands would
  not remain still. He had let his head alone now, and, instead, kept laying
  his hands on the table in front of him, by turns opening and clenching them,
  and they left damp prints on the top of the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make it fifty thousand dollars,&rdquo; he
  whispered.</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; It was a helpless cry. Dayler stretched out his arms
  imploringly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand! It&rsquo;s not easy for me
  to get even that amount. I&rsquo;m not worth what you think I am. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
  gone the limit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice was still monotonous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you <i>sure</i>?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me&mdash;give me time, and&mdash;and I might make it a little
  more.&rdquo; There was no doubt of the agonized sincerity in the man&rsquo;s
  voice. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;sixty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said. She was on her feet now, her voice breaking
  a little. &ldquo;I want more than that&mdash;what it will perhaps be harder
  for you to give than sixty thousand dollars. I want your forgiveness for
  what I have just made you suffer&mdash;for this scene here. I had reasons,
  reasons that I believed justified me.&rdquo; She glanced at Billy Kane. &ldquo;I
  do not think you would understand, and I am afraid you would not see the
  justification in them even if I tried to explain, and so&rdquo;&mdash;she
  had drawn the manila envelope from the bodice of her dress, and was holding
  it out to him&mdash;&ldquo;I can only ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took the envelope wonderingly, rising slowly to his feet. He was like
  a man dazed. Stupefaction, incredulity, a mighty relief, mingled their expressions
  in his face. He turned the envelope over and over; and then, opening it,
  extracted a folded piece of paper from within. And then for the second time
  his laugh rang through the room, but now it was a laugh like the laugh of
  a man that was insane, high-pitched, sustained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he cried wildly. &ldquo;Go on with your hellish tricks!
  What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane had involuntarily stepped closer to the table. He drew in his
  breath sharply now, in an amazed, startled way. Dayler was holding a <i>blank</i> piece
  of paper in his hands!</p>
  <p>And she, too, was leaning tensely forward. He glanced at her. She turned
  her head toward him; and out of a face that was as white as death, her dark
  eyes burned full of fury and bitter condemnation, as they fixed upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see it now!&rdquo; Her lips were quivering with passion. She steadied
  her voice with an obvious effort. &ldquo;I gave you credit for too much!
  I caught you at your work just a second too late. I thought you were taking
  an envelope out of the safe, whereas you were attempting to put one <i>in</i>!
  The one you took out was already in your pocket. You were checkmating your
  miserable accomplices unquestionably&mdash;but it was for your own ends!
  You were playing the traitor to them and to me at the same time. You meant,
  with your cold-blooded cunning, to use that paper against Mr. Dayler for
  your own private gain. You lied to me! It wasn&rsquo;t an empty safe to which
  you meant to introduce the Cadger and Gannet; there was a little more finesse,
  it clouded the issue a little more to put a dummy envelope there. And it
  was so easy! Just one of those envelopes taken from the drawer there, and
  a piece of paper slipped inside!&rdquo; She paused an instant, surveying
  him with merciless eyes. &ldquo;I hardly suppose that you would be fool enough
  not to have already put it in a safer place than your pocket, but if you
  still have it there&mdash;<i>hand it over!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not move. Somehow he was not paying undivided attention to
  her. It was the Man with the Crutch who seemed to be standing there in her
  place, grinning at him&mdash;only he could not see the man&rsquo;s face.
  And then, with a mental jerk, he pulled himself together. He could not tell
  her that he had almost caught someone else in the act of stealing the paper,
  but that the &ldquo;some one else&rdquo; had got away. It would sound ridiculous!
  She would laugh in his face! He could not tell her that, like a thunderbolt
  falling upon him, there had just come the realization that the Man with the
  Crutch had stolen the paper after all. He could not explain the Man with
  the Crutch, Peters&rsquo; murder, a hundred other things, so that she would
  believe him, without telling her that he was Billy Kane. And he could not
  tell her that he was Billy Kane! The old, hard, ironical, mirthless smile
  came to his lips. He was&mdash;the Rat!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d like to search me!&rdquo; he snarled insolently.</p>
  <p>She turned to Dayler. The man had sunk into his chair again and was smiling
  now, but in a horribly apathetic sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Dayler,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;it does not matter in
  the least if he has got rid of it for the moment. I promise you that paper
  will be in your possession again by to-morrow morning.&rdquo; She swung on
  Billy Kane, and pointed to the door. &ldquo;I think you heard what I said,
  Bundy&rdquo;&mdash;her voice was ominously low now, strained with menace&mdash;&ldquo;I
  will give you until to-morrow morning to produce that paper. The alternative
  is the electric chair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was still pointing to the door.</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. What was the use! The net was closing tighter
  about him, tighter than ever before, and the strands now were like some devil&rsquo;s
  tentacles that would not let go. He swung on his heel abruptly, and without
  a word left the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  A Hole In The Wall</h2>
  <p>Once in the street, Billy Kane started hurriedly in the direction of the
  Bowery. He hastened on, his mind in a state of chaotic turmoil. Presently
  he turned into the cross street, a block away from the Rat&rsquo;s den. He
  had until morning. It was thoughtful of her to have given him that much time!
  The Man with the Crutch had the paper, of course. Red Vallon and the Pippin
  had had since noon to find the man. If the man were not found by morning
  the r&ocirc;le of the Rat would be at an end. There was something damnably
  ironical in that! He had wanted the r&ocirc;le of the Rat to end. And now
  he didn&rsquo;t want it to end on account of this Man with the Crutch, who
  was disastrously likely to bring that end about! He needed the r&ocirc;le
  now more than ever in order to use it against this Man with the Crutch, because
  the other held the knowledge that would enable him, Billy Kane, to cast off
  the r&ocirc;le forever; yet if he didn&rsquo;t find the man, and even before
  morning, the r&ocirc;le, and quite as certainly forever, would be cast off
  for him!</p>
  <p>He swept his hand across his eyes. His brain seemed to be working in some
  silly, sing-song cycle, and yet it was quite logical. And then his shoulders
  squared. For the night at least he was still the Rat, and the underworld
  was at the Rat&rsquo;s beck and call. If Red Vallon and the Pippin could
  not find the Man with the Crutch, he would unleash the underworld to help
  them pick up the scent. First, however, he must get in touch with Red Vallon.
  But that should not be difficult, for Red Vallon, whether he had had any
  success or not, was certain to make a report before the night was very much
  older, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane halted suddenly, and turned around, as a low voice hailed him.
  A man was hurrying along behind him. He smiled grimly. A little luck, at
  least, seemed to be breaking for him at the start. Here was Red Vallon now.
  Billy Kane, in apparent indifference, started on again in the direction of
  the den.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said gruffly, as the gangster caught up with him
  and fell into step alongside.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon chuckled low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We got him!&rdquo; he said. There was hoarse elation in the gangster&rsquo;s
  voice.</p>
  <p>A fierce uplift swept in an almost overmastering surge upon Billy Kane.
  His answer, however, was little more than a grunt of approval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life!&rdquo; exclaimed the gangster jubilantly. &ldquo;You
  know Marlot&rsquo;s saloon? Well, the guy lives next door in that old motheaten
  shack. Some place! The police have been leery of it for a long while. There&rsquo;s
  mostly a bunch of slick-fingers hang out there. Get me? He&rsquo;s got the
  back room&mdash;used to be the kitchen, I guess. He&rsquo;s a smooth one,
  all right! He&rsquo;s got a private entrance of his own when he doesn&rsquo;t
  want to go in or out by the front; the old back door opens right into his
  room from the yard. Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded his head shortly in affirmation. He took a cigarette from
  his pocket, and lighted it nonchalantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, say&rdquo;&mdash;the elation in the gangster&rsquo;s voice was
  growing still more pronounced&mdash;&ldquo;that ain&rsquo;t all! The Pippin
  spotted his nibs through the window from the yard a few minutes ago. Say,
  what do you think, Bundy! The cripple hobbles across the room, and pulls
  the old washstand away from the wall, and lifts up an innocent-looking piece
  of the wall paper that you&rsquo;d think was stuck down for fair. The Pippin
  had only a rip in the window shade to see through, and he couldn&rsquo;t
  see very well, but he could see a dinky little hole there in the wall, and
  a satchel inside, and the cripple takes something out of his pocket and slips
  it into the hole, and smooths the wall paper back again. The Pippin beat
  it out of there then, and found me, and he&rsquo;s just wised me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was quite dark here on the street, but even so Billy Kane kept his face
  turned slightly away from the gangster. The blood was racing in one mad,
  ungovernable flood of feverish excitement through his veins. It seemed somehow
  as though a weight that had been unendurable, an actual physical burden beyond
  his strength to bear, had suddenly been lifted from his shoulders. The Man
  with the Crutch! From the prior events of the evening, from what Red Vallon
  had just said, there was no possibility that the Pippin had stumbled upon <i>another</i> man
  with a crutch. This was the one, without question, without room for a single
  shadow of a doubt. And he as good as had the man now! He flicked the ash
  from his cigarette with his forefinger, and nodded curtly again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Figure it out for yourself,&rdquo; said Red Vallon, a sort of eager
  self-complacency in his voice. &ldquo;Of course, the man had nothing to do
  with that murder last night, but the police know he was around there lugging
  a satchel, and you add to that the crook dump where he lives, and a guy that
  has a nifty little hiding place in the wall with a satchel in it&mdash;and
  where does he get off? I ain&rsquo;t throwing any bouquets at myself, Bundy,
  but I told you I&rsquo;d pull something good this trip, and I guess you got
  to hand it to me for delivering the goods. Pipe this, Bundy! The police think
  the Pippin&rsquo;s a stool-pigeon anyhow. Well, five minutes ago I sent the
  Pippin to tip off the police, while I beat it up here to put you wise. Get
  me? With all that stuff against the guy, he ain&rsquo;t got a hope. He goes
  up for that murder, and that lets you out, Bundy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane stood still. They had reached the cellarlike entrance to the
  Rat&rsquo;s den, but he made no move to descend the short, cavernous stairway.
  A little way up the block the street lamp seemed suddenly to be swirling
  around and around in swift, lightning-like irregular flashes. The blood that
  had rushed hotly, madly through his veins but an instant before was cold
  and sluggish now, as though some icy tourniquet were at work upon his heart,
  stilling its action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That lets you out, Bundy.&rdquo; The words mocked and jeered at him.
  Let him out! It was ruin, disaster, death&mdash;unless in some way he could
  forestall this move of Red Vallon. He fought desperately for control of himself.
  That envelope, her threat, his own desire to get at the man, were like issues
  fading into the background. He knew that the man <i>was</i> the murderer
  of Peters, and if the police, whether they caught the man or not, found what
  he believed they would find in that satchel&mdash;some at least of those
  rubies from the Ellsworth vault&mdash;then Red Vallon, this man standing
  here, who with horrible callousness, but equally with the genuine motive
  of protecting the Rat, was ironically planning, while believing him innocent,
  to send the guilty man to his death, would know absolutely beyond question
  that the Rat had <i>not</i> killed Peters last night, that last night&rsquo;s
  alibi was a lie, and that he, Billy Kane, was the man in the mask, at whose
  throat Red Vallon and his gang asked nothing better than to hurl themselves
  like a pack of starving wolves!</p>
  <p>To get rid of Red Vallon! Any excuse&mdash;anything! To get rid of the man&mdash;without
  an instant&rsquo;s delay!</p>
  <p>He shoved out his hand to the gangster.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget this, Red!&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Take
  it from me, I won&rsquo;t forget it! But you beat it now, Red. That Dayler
  game went wrong to-night&mdash;the Cadger&rsquo;ll tell you about it, if
  you see him&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t got a minute. See&mdash;Red?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure! All right!&rdquo; agreed the gangster heartily. &ldquo;Well,
  so long, Bundy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook hands again&mdash;with a grip that was hard and eloquent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So long, Red!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The gangster turned away. Billy Kane dove down the stairs, opened the door
  of the den, locked it behind him, darted across the room in the darkness,
  and in another minute, crawling through the tunnel from the secret door,
  gained the shed and the street at the rear. He ran breathlessly now. What
  did it matter if any one saw him! Time alone was all that counted! If he
  could not beat the police in the race to that room he was as good as dead
  already!</p>
  <p>His mind worked swiftly, incisively, as he ran. The Pippin had had, say,
  ten minutes&rsquo; start, but it was only a few blocks to that house next
  door to Marlot&rsquo;s saloon, and it would take a little while at least
  for the police to make their preparations before acting on the Pippin&rsquo;s
  information. The chances lay with him, Billy Kane. The man might, or might
  not, be there. It did not matter in so far as the main issue was concerned.
  It was that handbag and its contents that were the vital factor now&mdash;and,
  yes, if he got that, the envelope too&mdash;they would both almost certainly
  be in the same hiding place&mdash;inasmuch as that hiding place was a crafty
  one. If the man <i>were</i> there, then it seemed as though irony would have
  piled itself on irony to-night, for he would automatically for the time being
  become the <i>ally</i> of the man with whom he asked only a deadly reckoning!
  He did not want the police to get the Man with the Crutch. Whatever the story
  the man might tell to account for his connection with Peters, it was certain
  that he would not be fool enough to tell the truth about the murder of David
  Ellsworth! And if the police had the Man with the Crutch in custody, then
  he, Billy Kane, was irrevocably barred from that reckoning which he meant
  to have.</p>
  <p>He had been perhaps five minutes. He was trying the door now of a wretched,
  two-story frame building, that hugged, as its right-hand neighbor, a saloon
  that was almost as disreputable in appearance as itself. The door was unlocked.
  He stepped inside, and, feeling his way in the darkness, but still moving
  rapidly, passed down a narrow hall. By the sense of touch he was aware that
  there were rooms on only one side, the left-hand side, and that there were
  two of them. He brought up abruptly against a door now that made the end
  of the passage; the door of the rear room of the house obviously, and obviously,
  therefore, the &ldquo;home&rdquo; of the Man with the Crutch. It was silent
  everywhere in the house. He smiled a little grimly. He knew the place well
  enough by reputation to account for that silence. It was a crooks&rsquo; nest,
  a crooks&rsquo; lodging house, and, being night, the tenants had gone to
  work!</p>
  <p>He slipped his mask over his face, and rapped on the door. There was no
  answer. He rapped again; and then his skeleton keys came into play. The man
  had obviously returned here from Dayler&rsquo;s to get rid of that envelope,
  though probably not at once, for it must have been then that the Pippin had
  seen him; but now apparently he had gone out again.</p>
  <p>The door yielded upon the trial of the third key. Billy Kane flung it open,
  stepped inside, and his flashlight played through the blackness. As he had
  expected, the room was empty. He locked the door again, and crossed quickly
  to the rear door. This he found opened inward. He looked out. This took a
  few seconds, but an accurate knowledge of his surroundings was worth even
  more than that should he be caught here. The door opened on practically a
  level with the ground; and it had an old-fashioned latch, with heavy iron
  handles, loop-shaped, below the thumb-pieces. He closed the door, and bolted
  it, smiling appreciatively as he noted that the bolt moved both readily and
  silently, as though in carefully oiled grooves.</p>
  <p>His flashlight played around the room again now. The window shade was drawn.
  He located the washstand&mdash;and frowned suddenly in perplexity. A crutch
  leaned against the washstand. His face cleared the next instant. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
  the man have an extra one? Perhaps he had to buy them in pairs, though he
  used only one at a time.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane stepped swiftly to the washstand, and, preparatory to pulling
  it away from the wall, lifted up the crutch&mdash;and the next instant was
  examining the latter critically. It was extremely heavy. He whistled low
  under his breath. It was not only a crutch, it was a murderous weapon! The
  shaft of the thing, though painted a wood color, was solid iron! He set it
  down and pulled out the washstand; then, picking up the crutch again, he
  slashed it along the line of the wall where the washstand had been. A large
  piece of the wall paper came away, disclosing a neatly constructed little
  hiding place, some two feet long by a foot in depth. A queer, twisted smile
  was on Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips. In there lay only two articles&mdash;but
  they were a manila envelope, and a small handbag.</p>
  <p>He snatched up the envelope, and tore it open. A glance at the faded writing
  was enough; it was Joe Laynton&rsquo;s letter of twenty years ago. He stuffed
  it into his pocket; and, almost more eagerly than before, reached into the
  aperture again, and took out the handbag. But now his fingers seemed to have
  gone clumsy with excitement as he fumbled with the catches. No, it was locked.
  Well, his steel jimmy would soon settle that! He pried the bag open, and
  stood staring at its contents. And the contents were not rubies! And then
  he laughed a little, as he lifted out and examined a package of banknotes.
  It did not matter, did it&mdash;the rubies or the money! It linked the Man
  with the Crutch with the Ellsworth murder just the same. This was the money,
  and apparently intact, that had been in the Ellsworth vault; the paper bands
  pinned around the packages, and marked in red ink with the amount in each
  package, had been pinned there and marked by himself!</p>
  <p>It was strange, very strange! He restored the steel jimmy to his pocket,
  and attempted to fasten the bag with its end catches, but the frame had been
  bent in prying the bag open, and the catches would not work easily. It was
  very strange! How had this Man with the Crutch, so intimately connected with
  Peters&rsquo; and David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murders, come also to be so intimately
  conversant with the Crime Trust&rsquo;s game with Dayler?</p>
  <p>His mind kept striking off at tangents, as he struggled with the bag. He
  could not carry a bag that would gape open! Once he got it to the den, that
  hole in the flooring, that he had thought so futile a reward for his search,
  would not be so futile after all. The bag would fit very nicely, and very
  securely, in there! Iron crutches weren&rsquo;t usually made in <i>pairs</i>.
  That was queer, too! Was it an iron crutch that was the blunt instrument
  that had caused Peters&rsquo; death&mdash;and David Ellsworth&rsquo;s? Why
  had the man used that dummy envelope to-night, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>His flashlight was out. Footsteps were creeping cautiously along the hall
  outside. The police! The bag would have to do as it was now; but at least
  one catch was partially fastened. He tucked it under his arm, and for the
  fraction of a second, while he thrust the flashlight back into his pocket,
  he stood still; and then, a sudden, curious smile on his lips, he reached
  out and picked up the crutch again, and stole silently over to the rear door.
  The smile was lost as his lips thinned into a straight line. Yes, they were
  already here too! Well, the crutch might perhaps still serve the same purpose!</p>
  <p>His ear to the panel, a whisper reached him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put your shoulder to it, Jerry, and push with me, when I get the
  bar in the crack of the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; another voice whispered. &ldquo;The others will
  have been around at the front long ago. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door creaked under a sudden pressure; and as suddenly from the wall
  at the edge of the door, Billy Kane reached out and released the bolt. The
  door swung violently open, and two figures, their balance lost, sprawled
  and staggered into the room. And in a flash Billy Kane, as he leaped through
  the doorway, snatched at the door, slammed it shut, jabbed the crutch, as
  a lock-bar, through the iron loop of the door handle, its end extending well
  over the frame of the doorway&mdash;and sprinted across the yard.</p>
  <p>There was a yell, and a battering thud on the door behind him, as he reached
  a fence at the end of the yard, swung himself to the top and dropped to the
  lane beyond. And then, as he ran, there came a crash of broken glass. They
  had evidently forsaken the door for the window!</p>
  <p>For a hundred yards Billy Kane ran at top speed along the lane; and then,
  removing his mask, the bag concealed under his coat, he emerged into the
  intersecting street, and dropped into a casual and quiet stride.</p>
  <p>He smiled queerly.</p>
  <p>They would be looking for a cripple who, having sacrificed his crutch to
  save his life, could at best but limp and hobble painfully along!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  The Cat&rsquo;s-Paw</h2>
  <p>It was black with a blackness that seemed to possess tangible substance,
  as though it wrapped itself around and enveloped the body with a pall whose
  very texture could be felt. It was unknown ground, and the foot reached out
  uncertainly, wary of where next it might find lodgment, and the hands stretched
  out, as a blind man&rsquo;s hands stretch out, feeling for hidden things
  through space. It was dank and musty, and in the nostrils was an earthy,
  cavernous smell; and there was a silence that seemed guarded by the very
  bowels of the earth itself. And in the silence and the darkness peril lurked&mdash;a
  peril that merged courage into foolhardiness for one who would invite it,
  and set the nerves on edge, and kept the muscles taut like tight-strung bow
  strings, and stimulated the senses into abnormal activity until the eyes
  peopled the darkness with phantoms that were not there, and the ears created
  sounds that did not exist.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s face, under the mask, was drawn in hard, strained lines;
  he raised his right hand, that gripped his automatic, and drew the back of
  his hand across his forehead. Foolhardiness! Yes, that was it! He was a fool
  to come here, to take the risk! He knew Wong Yen&rsquo;s by reputation as
  one of the most infamous Chinese underground dives in the Bad Lands; he remembered
  it concretely from that incident of a few nights ago when Laverto had had
  young Clancy drugged here. Was that only a few nights ago? He shook his head.
  Since those few nights ago he no longer measured the passing of time by normal
  standards; he had lived all his life since those few nights ago!</p>
  <p>He moved forward through the blackness, cautiously, silently. Where was
  the next wall? Or was there any wall at all? His hands, reaching out as far
  as they could stretch, touched nothing. This was below the ordinary cellar
  level; it was a sub-cellar, a chain of sub-cellars. How many men had entered
  here, yes, and women too&mdash;and disappeared? A murder hole! And up above
  him somewhere was New York&mdash;millions of people, taxicabs, crowded sidewalks,
  theatres, and, yes, churches, places where people worshipped. Incredible!</p>
  <p>He had heard of places like this, and so had the public; and the public
  smiled in self-sufficient tolerant amusement. Well, why not, where even the
  police were ignorant! Everybody admitted that the Chinese quarter was full
  of ridiculously imitated catacombs perhaps; but what did it matter if in
  a block of houses the inmates burrowed from cellar to cellar like rats, and
  built mysterious doors and passageways, and threw about everything the disguise
  of wicked and shuddering things&mdash;when it was only disguise! It was good
  for business. The gape-wagons and the slumming conductors profited and so
  did the Celestials; and the slummers, satiated with thrills, the women drawing
  their skirts closely around their silk-clad ankles, the men surreptitiously
  feeling in their pockets to assure themselves that their watches and valuables
  were still in their possession, got their money&rsquo;s worth. Everybody
  was satisfied, and the public smiled.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers tightened on the butt of his automatic. Back
  somewhere behind him in the darkness a Chinaman still guarded a door that
  neither slummer nor police had ever entered; but the guard was a gagged and
  huddled thing on the floor now, still senseless probably from the blow on
  the head from this same pistol butt. There had been no other way. The man
  was not far behind&mdash;just at the entrance so skilfully disguised by an
  ordinary coal bin. Was there still another guard in front of him? More than
  one? If he only dared to use his flashlight for a second! A fool to come
  here where, if caught, he would not have a chance of escape, was he? Well,
  perhaps&mdash;only there was a man&rsquo;s life at stake.</p>
  <p>Perhaps he was already too late! Red Vallon had said, though, that there
  wasn&rsquo;t any hurry about &ldquo;bumping off&rdquo; the Wop, that they
  had him safe in here &ldquo;with his bean tapped to keep him quiet until
  they finished the rest of the game.&rdquo; It was less than an hour ago that
  Red Vallon had said that, and it was only eight o&rsquo;clock now, and the &ldquo;rest
  of the game,&rdquo; to give it every chance of success, would not be played
  out for still another hour yet, not before old Barloff had closed up for
  the night. He wasn&rsquo;t too late, he couldn&rsquo;t be too late&mdash;there
  was a man&rsquo;s life at stake: only an ex-convict&rsquo;s, a man out from
  Sing Sing but a few hours ago. Just a prison bird! But the Wop was innocent
  this time and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Was that a sound there from somewhere in front of him? Billy Kane stood
  still. Nothing! No; a dozen sounds that were not really sounds at all. His
  ears were full of uncanny noises.</p>
  <p>The back cellar entrance beneath a Chinese tea-shop, and after that the
  rear of the coal bin! Billy Kane was laughing to himself, but the laugh was
  void of mirth. There was a grim, horrible sort of irony about it all. Believing
  him, Billy Kane, to be the Rat, Red Vallon had <i>reported</i> the accomplishment
  of the first stage in the execution of the plan with gusto. After that, deft
  questioning had elicited from the gangster the secret of this entrance to
  Wong Yen&rsquo;s, and then luck, and then the guard taken unawares. The guard
  could hardly be blamed. The guard naturally enough, had little reason to
  suspect the approach to that coal bin of any one who had not the &ldquo;open
  sesame&rdquo; to what was beyond, and he had been lurking there where the
  boards of the bin ingeniously slid apart, and had shown not the slightest
  uneasiness at his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, presence until it was too late. Then
  there had been a steep, narrow passage downward, and then&mdash;<i>this</i>.
  Beyond, near or far, he did not know which, these sub-cellars hid the real
  thing that the so-called underground Chinatown above counterfeited, hid debauchery
  and vice, and cradled crime, and here the poppy reigned, and the dregs of
  humanity skulked fearful of the sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had flung the Wop into a corner and left him until they got
  around to finishing the job,&rdquo; Red Vallon had explained callously. The
  Wop, therefore, must be somewhere near at hand. But he, Billy Kane, could
  see nothing, hear nothing, feel nothing.</p>
  <p>His physical faculties strained and alert, subconsciously Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  mind was milling over that conversation with the gangster of an hour ago,
  and upon him, in spite of his own present peril, there came a cold and merciless
  fury. It was more to-night than the ordinary moral obligation, more than
  the mere responsibility to render abortive the crimes that came to his knowledge
  through his tenure of this r&ocirc;le of the Rat, that was actuating him
  now; it was the callous, damnable brutality of the scheme that, linked with
  its hellish ingenuity, seemed to outrage every instinct of manhood he possessed,
  and fired him with an overmastering desire, not only to frustrate the crime
  itself, but to take toll in a personal, physical way, if he could, from those
  who were enacting it.</p>
  <p>It was one of those plans, conceived by the Rat, that waited patiently for
  its hour of maturity to arrive, and then was executed and carried through
  to its fulfilment by the minions of that Directorate of crime of which the
  Rat appeared to be the most versatile and vicious member, but without the
  Rat, necessarily, taking any further active part in it. And he, Billy Kane,
  who fate had seen fit to mold with features that were evidently a counterpart
  of that master rogue&rsquo;s, who was for the moment accepted and obeyed
  as the Rat, and was supposed to be the originator of the plan itself, could
  not very well ask Red Vallon, for instance, for details! Therefore he did
  not know all the details, but he knew enough!</p>
  <p>He had wormed quite a little out of Red Vallon without the gangster suspecting
  anything more than that he, Billy Kane as the Rat, was taking particular
  pains to see that the stage was properly set, and that the possibility of
  failure was reduced to its absolute minimum. It was very simple. It required
  simply a man&rsquo;s life&mdash;the murder of the Wop.</p>
  <p>He knew something of the Wop, for the Wop&rsquo;s story was common property.
  The Wop, in the old days, five years ago, before he had gone &ldquo;up the
  river&rdquo; for a &ldquo;job&rdquo; in the line which was his particular
  specialty, was known both as a tough customer and as one of the cleverest &ldquo;box-workers&rdquo; in
  the safe-cracking profession. The testimony of one Ivan Barloff had been
  mainly responsible for the Wop&rsquo;s capture and conviction, and the Wop
  had travelled to Sing Sing with a thirst for vengeance gnawing at his soul,
  and with the threat quivering on his twisted lips that he would get even
  with the other when he got out again. Nor had the five years of prison hell
  seemed to assuage any of the Wop&rsquo;s desire to square accounts! He had
  repeated his threat many times in prison, and he had been indifferent as
  to who heard him. The feud was no secret to the police. That was the gist
  of it.</p>
  <p>As for Ivan Barloff, Billy Kane was somewhat more precisely informed, both
  because the time he, Billy Kane, had spent on the East Side in carrying out
  David Ellsworth&rsquo;s philanthropies could hardly have been passed without
  at least a hearsay acquaintanceship with so well-known a character in that
  quarter as Ivan Barloff, and because, too, Red Vallon, in that last interview,
  had seemed to take a malicious delight in exploiting his own vastly more
  intimate knowledge of the little old Russian of many parts. On his own account
  he knew, naturally, only what the public knew and believed about the man:
  Barloff was a sort of father to the flock, a very numerous flock, of Poles
  and Russians of the uneducated and illiterate class. He was all things to
  them. He was counselor and confidant, he was money lender, he was entrusted
  with what money they had as savings for investment, he wrote their letters,
  he collected their rents, being a kind of owners&rsquo; sub-agent, and he
  lived amongst them, alone, in a little old frame house that was sandwiched
  in among the ramshackle tenements that housed so many of his compatriots
  in that section. In appearance he was a very dirty and unkempt old man, and
  ostensibly he was as honest as he was dirty&mdash;and he was accepted as
  such by public, police and compatriots alike.</p>
  <p>Red Vallon, however, had thrown quite a different light on the other&rsquo;s
  character. The man possessed the craft and cunning of a devil, and a devil&rsquo;s
  inhumanity. He had fed like a leech on the guileless trust of his ignorant
  clientele. He had made money&mdash;a great deal of money. Thousands were
  stored away in his rickety old safe, that was so rickety it disarmed suspicion;
  and, preserving his secret, he patronized no bank, but covered his constantly
  increasing fortune with the guise of squalor and poverty, which he kept on
  a level scarcely, if any, above that of those he filched.</p>
  <p>The man was a miser of the most sordid and cold-blooded sort. A nickel was
  not too mean a thing to scheme for, if by any means he could lay his hands
  upon it. Also, the man had other remunerative relationships, very carefully
  selected relationships, with others than those with whom he openly associated.
  To a select few of the underworld he acted at times as &ldquo;fence,&rdquo; receiving
  such stolen goods as he could readily dispose of among his compatriots, who,
  innocent of any guilty knowledge, bought the articles eagerly at a greatly
  reduced figure, imagining, if they stopped to imagine at all, that the articles
  represented unredeemed pledges on money loaned here and there by Barloff.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips twisted in a thin smile there in the darkness. It
  was a deal such as that, so he had gleaned from Red Vallon, that had originated
  the feud between Ivan Barloff and the Wop. The Wop had brought some of the
  proceeds of one of his predatory safe-breaking raids to Barloff, and a bargain
  was concluded between them; but in some way that night Barloff became aware
  that the police had followed the Wop to his, Barloff&rsquo;s, house. Barloff
  was taking no chances. He promptly cleared his own skirts at the expense
  of five years in Sing Sing for the Wop. He scurried to the nearest police
  station with the stolen articles, and with unctuous righteousness explained
  that he was suspicious as to how the Wop had come by them, but had bought
  them to pull the wool over the Wop&rsquo;s eyes so as to enable him, Barloff,
  to communicate with the police, and give the police a chance to make an investigation.
  Barloff got away with it, and the Wop got his ride &ldquo;up the river.&rdquo; It
  was perhaps not unnatural that the Wop had sworn revenge, and had made no
  secret of it!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s twisted smile deepened. It was all very simple. It involved
  simply the taking of a man&rsquo;s life&mdash;the Wop&rsquo;s&mdash;which
  was a very small matter in the eyes of that Crime Trust which was running
  rampant now through the underworld. Also, the Rat was a man of large vision.
  He builded ahead and waited patiently. Barloff was known by the Rat to have
  a great deal of money in ready cash. It would not have been a very difficult
  matter perhaps to have robbed the old Russian at any time, but there was
  always the certainty of an investigation as an aftermath, and investigations
  sometimes had a tendency to lead in awkward directions. Much better, therefore,
  and much safer, that the trend of the investigation, and its limits, should
  be fixed in advance&mdash;by the Rat. And so they had waited for the Wop
  to regain his freedom.</p>
  <p>They had not waited five years, however, for the scheme probably had not
  occurred to the Rat until perhaps a few months ago. But now the Wop being
  free at last, the Wop&rsquo;s first act of freedom was to be made to appear
  that of putting his oft-repeated threat into execution. Barloff was to be
  lured out of his house on some specious pretext, the house would then be
  entered, and a forged note in the Wop&rsquo;s scrawl, carefully prepared
  beforehand, jeering in its tone and to the effect that the Wop would have
  got Barloff as well as Barloff&rsquo;s cash if the latter had not been fortunate
  enough to have been out of the house at the time, would be left pinned, say,
  to the wall. There would not be much room for investigation! The Wop, being
  dead, would not make any defense. The Wop would never be found; and as the
  natural thing for the Wop to do was to disappear after leaving his defiant
  message behind him, who was to imagine that such disappearance was not of
  the Wop&rsquo;s own free will and design? The Wop was the cat&rsquo;s-paw!</p>
  <p>The blackness was absolute. Billy Kane was feeling out again with both hands.
  He seemed to have lost in a measure even his sense of direction. He was either
  in a very much wider passage than that through which he had entered, or else
  the excavation around him was actually itself one of the sub-cellars. If
  he could but get the touch of a wall again to guide him! Yes, here it was!
  It swerved sharply, almost at right angles, to the left. He followed it,
  moving slowly, scarcely more than a few inches at a time.</p>
  <p>It was strange how his brain worked on ceaselessly, seemingly oblivious
  to his immediate surroundings, seemingly concerned with things extraneous
  to his present danger! And yet that was not altogether true. One thing had
  a bearing on another; and one thing led to another. It was like the cogs
  of wheels fitting into each other as they turned around and around. This
  tenure of the Rat&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le, that was no less dangerous, was apposite.
  Where was the Rat? While he, Billy Kane, fought to free himself from the
  stigma of David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murder, while he fought for his own good
  name and his own life on that score, this r&ocirc;le of the Rat, while it
  afforded temporary sanctuary from the police, forced him into perils that&mdash;</p>
  <p>His lips compressed tightly. He had stumbled over something soft and yielding.
  His outstretched hand, though it saved him, slipped along the wall and came
  up against another wall, again at right angles, but this time where, obviously,
  the walls made a corner. He stooped down, and felt over the obstruction that
  his foot had encountered. It was a man&rsquo;s body. It moved now, and writhed
  a little at his touch. It was the Wop almost certainly, the Wop &ldquo;flung
  into a corner&rdquo; out of the way like a sack of meal. But the man was
  still alive. Thank God for that! He had been afraid that the initiatory stage
  of the work might have been only too well accomplished.</p>
  <p>His hands felt upward along the bound body, and touched the other&rsquo;s
  face, and felt the cloth gag twisted and knotted around the man&rsquo;s mouth.
  His hands felt still a little higher up&mdash;to the close-cropped prison
  hair. It was the Wop beyond question. He took a knife from his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a sound!&rdquo; he breathed, as he removed the gag,
  and cut away the cords from around the other&rsquo;s feet and hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  the Wop, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s affirmation was almost inarticulate. Billy Kane slipped
  his arm around the other&rsquo;s shoulders and lifted the man into a sitting
  posture. He had a flask of brandy in his pocket, brought purposely for the
  Wop&rsquo;s benefit, and he held the flask now to the other&rsquo;s lips.
  The stimulant seemed to inject new life and strength into the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; the Wop asked weakly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; Billy Kane cautioned. &ldquo;The one thing
  to do is to get out of here now. Do you think you can walk at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man answered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not as bad
  as all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try, then,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>The progress was slow, pitifully slow. The Wop, despite his own assertion,
  was both weak and cramped, and at first he was almost a dead weight, as he
  clung with an arm flung around Billy Kane&rsquo;s shoulders; but gradually
  he appeared to get back his strength. They stopped every two or three yards
  both to rest and listen. Again Billy Kane held the flask to the other&rsquo;s
  lips. Again they went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s black in here!&rdquo; the Wop
  mumbled, and shivered a little.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane made no answer. He was taking care now not to lose touch with
  the walls. The ground under foot was beginning to rise steeply. He caught
  his foot and almost fell over a huddled thing on the earth&mdash;the Chinese
  guard. A certain murk seemed to be penetrating the blackness. He stopped
  again, felt out in front of him, and listened intently for a moment, and
  then he placed his lips to the Wop&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an opening here into a coal bin,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Get
  down on your hands and knees and crawl through. Straight across from the
  coal bin there&rsquo;s a short flight of steps up to a door that opens on
  the alley. We&rsquo;ll make a break for it now. Keep close to me. And don&rsquo;t
  make a noise. There&rsquo;s a cellar stairway to the room above, and the
  room above isn&rsquo;t likely to be empty! Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Wop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>He crawled through the opening with the Wop at his heels, and rose to his
  feet, then gripping at the Wop&rsquo;s arm, he stole across the cellar, gained
  the steps and, an instant later, stepped out into a dark and narrow alleyway.
  He did not pause here; he hurried the Wop down the alleyway, and halted only
  when within a few yards of the first intersecting street: just far enough
  back in the alleyway to keep well beyond the radius of light from the adjoining
  thoroughfare.</p>
  <p>Neither man spoke for a moment. After the silence of that death trap behind
  them, the roar of an elevated train from Chatham Square near by seemed to
  Billy Kane a din infernal, and greater only by a little than the rattle of
  wheels, the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs, and the multitudinous noises
  of ordinary traffic. He could just make out the Wop&rsquo;s features. One
  side of the man&rsquo;s face was streaked with clotted blood stains; but
  apart from that the Wop now showed little outward evidence of the attack
  that had been made upon him. He stood there now, quite steady on his feet,
  his eyes studying Billy Kane&rsquo;s mask in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the Wop, a sudden huskiness in his voice. &ldquo;I
  owe you something. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  something else that&rsquo;s of vastly greater importance so far as you are
  concerned. Do you know why they got after you to-night, or who it was that
  got you in that trap?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Wop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, then,&rdquo; said Billy Kane. &ldquo;It was
  because you threatened to get even with Ivan Barloff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barloff!&rdquo; The Wop&rsquo;s fists clenched, and he stepped closer
  to Billy Kane. &ldquo;So it was Barloff, was it? He must have had the fear
  of God in him, then, to make him spend any money&mdash;even to hire thugs!
  Barloff, eh? Well, I&rsquo;m going to see Barloff pretty soon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; said Billy Kane crisply. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  exactly why I am telling you this. It isn&rsquo;t Barloff. It&rsquo;s a crowd
  that knew of your threat, and <i>they&rsquo;re</i> getting after Barloff,
  and framing you up for the job. They&rsquo;re planting a little evidence
  against you in Barloff&rsquo;s place in exchange for Barloff&rsquo;s cash,
  and with you finished off via the murder route, they expect the police to
  throw up their hands after a while and admit you&rsquo;ve made a clean get-away&mdash;with
  the swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop&rsquo;s face was close to Billy Kane&rsquo;s, and the Wop&rsquo;s
  face was suddenly pinched and white. He touched his lips with his tongue.
  And then, as suddenly, the blood flushed back, and he thrust out his under
  jaw truculently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They would, eh&mdash;the dirty swabs!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Who
  are they? I&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em crawl for this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane smiled grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I guess not!&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
  much better out of it. But I promise you they&rsquo;ll not get away with
  it if you&rsquo;ll do what you are told now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop knuckled his forehead in a perplexed way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; There was a lingering sullen note
  in the Wop&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; said Billy Kane quietly. &ldquo;I want you to get
  out from under. You&rsquo;re not looking for another five years in Sing Sing,
  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop flinched. He drew his knuckles again across his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;Well, then, it is simply
  a question of establishing an alibi for you that will be absolutely hole-proof
  from now until, say, midnight. Where can you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Gus Moray, that runs the Silver King saloon,&rdquo; said the
  Wop. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d swear to it, all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; whether you were there or not!&rdquo; said Billy Kane dryly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  not good enough! If anything breaks wrong to-night you&rsquo;ve got to have
  something better than an alibi in a dive like that to stack up against what
  will look like open-and-shut evidence against you. You&rsquo;ve got to get
  on a higher plane than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t been a very regular church attendant,&rdquo; he said,
  with a sickly grin, &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short, and suddenly
  leaned toward Billy Kane. &ldquo;Say, would a minister do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be an improvement,&rdquo; admitted Billy Kane, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I got it, then!&rdquo; announced the Wop. His hesitancy had
  vanished. He seemed eager, almost anxious now. The iron of five years of
  prison was evidently far too poignant a memory to risk it being turned into
  reality again. &ldquo;I got it! There&rsquo;s a guy named Mister Claflin
  that ran one of them mission joints down around where I uster hang out before
  I went up. He&rsquo;s all right! He&rsquo;s the only soul on God&rsquo;s
  earth came near me when I was doing my spaces. Twice he came up to Sing Sing
  to see me. He didn&rsquo;t hold no prayer meeting with me neither, but he&rsquo;s
  got a grip in his hand that makes a fellow feel he ain&rsquo;t all dirt.
  He&rsquo;s white, he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know where he lives?&rdquo; inquired Billy Kane crisply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Wop, and was suddenly downcast. &ldquo;And he
  ain&rsquo;t at the mission any more, &rsquo;cause he told me he&rsquo;d got
  a regular layout uptown somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No matter!&rdquo; said Billy Kane cheerfully. &ldquo;Any drug store
  has a directory. You can find the address there. Got any money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop felt through his pockets, and the red flared into his face again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frisked!&rdquo; he flung out savagely.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane handed the other a banknote.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spend this on the first taxi you can grab,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got to get there as soon as you can, and you&rsquo;ve got to keep under cover
  getting there. If Mr. Claflin is not at home, wait in his house for him.
  Don&rsquo;t let them sidetrack you. And make it a point of establishing the
  hour you get there, either with the minister himself, or whoever happens
  to be at home. And stay there until midnight anyhow. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Wop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Billy Kane, &ldquo;beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Wop hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t I going to know who you are?&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;Say,
  I ain&rsquo;t anything but a crook, just a damned crook with a prison record,
  but&mdash;but I&rsquo;d like to pay what I owe. Ain&rsquo;t you going to
  give me the chance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it now.&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s hand went to the
  other&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten road to Sing Sing. You&rsquo;re
  out of it now&mdash;stay out of it.&rdquo; He gave the Wop a friendly push
  toward the street. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve no more time to lose. Beat it!&rdquo; he
  said, and without giving the Wop time to reply, he turned abruptly, and ran
  back along the alleyway.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Without Mercy</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane went on to the intersecting street at the other end of the alleyway,
  removed his mask, and stepped out on the sidewalk. He looked at his watch
  under a street lamp, and smiled whimsically in surprise. It was still only
  half-past eight. All told, he could not have been in Wong Yen&rsquo;s more
  than fifteen minutes, hardly that, in fact, and it seemed as though he had
  been there half the night!</p>
  <p>Well, it was Barloff&rsquo;s now! Barloff&rsquo;s was a little farther uptown,
  a little deeper over in the East Side. Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile, from whimsical,
  became tinged a little with weariness, became a little wan, as he walked
  along. He was the victim of a plot himself, that was aimed at his life, that
  sought to throw the guilt of a crime upon his shoulders, just as the Wop
  was. And circumstances not only permitted, but seemed to force him constantly
  into these byways to save others, while he himself stood condemned in the
  eyes of the public as a murderer and a thief; and there was bitter irony
  in the thought that he could not clear his own name, that he seemed powerless
  to help himself, while the mantle of one of the underworld&rsquo;s archcriminals,
  which temporarily afforded him sanctuary from the police, supplied him with
  almost unlimited information and the means of helping others!</p>
  <p>His brows knitted suddenly into a puzzled frown. Was that altogether true?</p>
  <p>There seemed to be a most strange coincidence in these excursions, forced
  or voluntary, of his into the byways of criminal things, a coincidence that
  always seemed in some way to link up his own plight with these other criminal
  schemes in which he became involved. There was the night that Peters had
  been murdered, for instance, which had led him to the knowledge that the
  Man With The Crutch was at least a co-murderer of David Ellsworth. And then
  the attempt at blackmail of two nights ago had again disclosed the hand of
  the Man With The Crutch, and, more significant still, had enabled him, Billy
  Kane, to recover the cash stolen from the library vault on the night of the
  Ellsworth murder. Who was this Man With The Crutch&mdash;this man with a
  crutch whose shaft was stained to resemble grained wood and so disguise the
  murderous iron of which it actually consisted, and which, he was sure now,
  was the weapon that had brought both David Ellsworth and Peters to their
  deaths?</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head. It was a curious chain of coincidence, but it
  could be only coincidence. And there was a limit to that. To-night, for instance,
  it would put a pretty severe strain upon the imagination to conceive of any
  connection between the Wop and the Man With The Crutch! And yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. He would have said the same thing two nights
  ago, wouldn&rsquo;t he? It was very strange! It was all strange! He seemed
  to be existing in a sphere of unreality. There was the Man With The Crutch,
  whom neither police nor underworld could find since that raid on the man&rsquo;s
  room; there was the constant, ominous swirl and eddy of hidden and unseen
  things on every hand; there was the Rat&mdash;and there was the Woman in
  Black!</p>
  <p>His face softened suddenly. He had not seen <i>her</i> since yesterday morning
  when she had entered the Rat&rsquo;s den through the secret door, and he
  had returned to her Dayler&rsquo;s letter. She had not been in a pleasant
  mood at what she believed had been his trickery; and, failing to have restored
  that letter to her, she would have turned him, whom she, like every one else,
  believed to be the Rat, incontinently over to the police. What was the hold
  she had upon the Rat? Where was she to-night? How was it that her hand had
  not already showed in this attempt upon the Wop, since she seemed to have
  always in her possession the details of the Rat&rsquo;s schemes?</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders again. What was the use! To-night, at least, she
  could harbor no delusion that he was acting under any spur of hers! No, that
  wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t what was troubling him. What troubled
  him was that she should think him what he was, or, rather, all that he was
  not! Strange that her opinion of him, even when his back was against the
  wall and his life was literally in jeopardy at every turn, should make any
  difference! Strange that the loathing and contempt in those brown eyes, that
  were fearless and deep and steady, should haunt him, and add to his own abhorrence
  of the r&ocirc;le he played because he must let her think him the Rat! Well,
  what did it matter? What was she to him? What was she becoming to him? He
  laughed a little uncertainly. There was no need to answer that question,
  was there&mdash;even if he could? What did anything matter unless he could
  clear his own name, which was now mired deeper than the Rat&rsquo;s!</p>
  <p>He turned a corner, walked on the length of a block, and on the next corner,
  drawing back into a doorway out of the radius of the street lamp, paused
  a moment to get his bearings. He smiled a little grimly. If the affair ever
  came to her knowledge, would she give the Rat credit this time for a spontaneous
  change of heart in saving the Wop&rsquo;s life, and saving Ivan Barloff&rsquo;s
  cash? He scowled suddenly. The latter proposition did not altogether please
  him. Barloff was not far removed in guilt from those who proposed to victimize
  Barloff! There would be a certain ironical justice in robbing from Barloff
  the cash that Barloff had all too patiently, a great portion of it at least,
  robbed from others! But Red Vallon and his pack were not to get it, were
  they? It was the lesser evil to warn Barloff, that was all. In the main,
  therefore, the night&rsquo;s work was over, since the Wop was safe, for five
  minutes&rsquo; conversation with Barloff would end the whole affair now,
  so far as he, Billy Kane, was concerned.</p>
  <p>He glanced down the street. Just a little ahead, on the opposite side, huddled
  in between two six-story tenements, was Barloff&rsquo;s squat, dingy, little
  house. There was a faint glow of light, as though it came from somewhere
  far in the interior, showing through the single front window on the ground
  floor. Billy Kane considered this thoughtfully for a few seconds. Barloff
  was at home evidently, but the probability was that one, at least, of Red
  Vallon&rsquo;s men was on watch in front of the house. In fact, it wasn&rsquo;t
  probability; it was a certainty. Barloff, according to Red Vallon, was to
  receive a fake telephone message that would lure him out of the house, and
  someone undoubtedly would be waiting to report the old Russian&rsquo;s exit.
  It therefore, to say the least of it, would be&mdash;Billy Kane&rsquo;s smile
  was mirthless&mdash;unwise for the Rat to walk up to Barloff&rsquo;s front
  door under the existing conditions!</p>
  <p>He might have telephoned. He shook his head, as he crossed the road, and,
  keeping in the shadows, stepped into the cross street. He preferred to interview
  Barloff via Barloff&rsquo;s back yard. He was still obsessed with the desire
  to take personal toll from all concerned in the miserable night&rsquo;s work,
  but he realized that impulse and sane action did not always go hand in glove.
  He could not afford to play fast and loose with this r&ocirc;le of the Rat,
  or take any unnecessary risks, but he could satisfy himself to the extent,
  at least, of a personal interview with Barloff, who was perhaps after all
  the most despicable of the lot, and put into the puny, shrivelled soul of
  the man a fear that would make for some degree of future righteousness!</p>
  <p>A lane, as he had expected, ran in the rear of the tenements and Barloff&rsquo;s
  house. Billy Kane slipped into this, located Barloff&rsquo;s house, low-lying
  against the sky line between the taller buildings, swung himself over the
  fence, dropped noiselessly to the ground, and for a moment stood there motionless.</p>
  <p>The yard was very small, and, but a few feet in front of him, a light from
  the open and uncurtained window of Barloff&rsquo;s rear room streamed out
  across the intervening space. Voices reached him, but he could not distinguish
  the words; neither, from where he stood, could he see anyone in the room,
  though the window was quite low, little more than breast high from the ground.</p>
  <p>And then a form inside the room passed across the window space, a woman&rsquo;s
  form; and again a voice reached him, a woman&rsquo;s voice, and Billy Kane
  drew in his breath sharply. He still could not distinguish the words, but
  he had recognized the voice.</p>
  <p>Once again he had jumped too hastily to conclusions in so far as she was
  concerned&mdash;it was the Woman in Black. There was no question as to why
  she was there; it was obvious that she had simply forestalled him in warning
  the old Russian; but&mdash;a perplexed frown furrowed Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  forehead&mdash;her hand would have showed a little late in the game to have
  saved the Wop!</p>
  <p>He stole forward, keeping in the shadows of the side fence, reached the
  rear wall of the house, edged across to the side of the window where he could
  both see and hear, and crouched there. His eyes swept the interior in a swift,
  comprehensive survey. It was a sordid, ill-furnished, bare-floored room,
  and very dirty. A seedy old morris chair in the center of the room supplied
  the only suggestion of comfort or luxury, and that an incongruous one, that
  the place possessed. Apart from that, there was a huge and aged safe, a relic
  of the days when such things were locked with keys, which was backed up against
  one wall; and near an open door, which apparently led into the front room,
  there was a battered desk with an equally battered swivel chair&mdash;and
  that was all, unless the telephone that stood upon the desk might be included
  in the furnishings. There was, however, another door, also open, which faced
  the safe, and which apparently gave on a passageway that in turn opened on
  the back yard. Billy Kane glanced around him. Yes, there was a rear door
  here, just a little to his right.</p>
  <p>His eyes reverted to the interior of the room. <i>She</i> was still pacing
  up and down its length from the desk to the window and back again. Perhaps
  it was the effect of the green-shaded incandescent bulb that dangled over
  the desk, but, as she turned facing the window, he saw that her face, drawn
  in sharp, pinched lines, was very white, and that in the dark brown eyes,
  all softness gone from them now, there was a hard and bitter light. And at
  the desk, the old Russian, a gray-bearded and threadbare figure in dirty
  and grease-spotted clothes, huddled deep down in his chair, and wrung his
  hands together, and with little, black, shifty eyes, that peered over the
  rims of steel-bowed spectacles, followed her about in a fascinated sort of
  way, and the while he kept circling his lips with his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Wop! The Wop!&rdquo; he shrilled out suddenly, and seemed to
  cower lower in his chair. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I am afraid! My God, I am afraid!
  He is strong. He would have no pity on an old man. He has sworn it. I know!
  I have been afraid of this day. Why did they let him out? They know, too!
  And I was only honest&mdash;everybody knows that. He was a thief. What else
  could an honest man do except what I did? He&mdash;he will kill me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Wop is dead.&rdquo; Her voice was low, bitter, hard, and yet,
  too, it seemed to hold impatience and irritation directed against the Russian. &ldquo;I
  have told you that. It is not the Wop you have to fear now. The Wop is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you are not sure, not positive, not absolutely positive of it!&rdquo; Barloff
  was wringing his hands the harder; and his tones, rather than being assertive,
  seemed to be pleading for a denial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am positive enough of it,&rdquo; she answered evenly, &ldquo;to
  see that the one who is responsible pays for it to-night! It is my fault&rdquo;&mdash;her
  voice caught a little, but hardened instantly&mdash;&ldquo;I trusted where
  I was a fool to trust, and I have paid for it with another&rsquo;s life.
  But that has nothing to do with you. You know now that the telephone message
  you received a little while ago was simply to lure you out of the house at
  half past nine in order that they might have a clear field in which, without
  contradiction, to make it appear that the robbery they are planning was the
  Wop&rsquo;s work. It is scarcely nine o&rsquo;clock yet. You have plenty
  of time in which to act. You can appeal to the police, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was no longer paying any attention to her words. Tense, strained,
  he stood there. He seemed to be trying to lash his brain into virility, into
  activity. He seemed to be groping out in an ineffectual mental way for some
  means to avert a disaster that he realized was closing down upon him. She
  believed the Wop was dead. She naturally held the Rat responsible&mdash;and
  he was the Rat, so far as she was concerned. She had warned him, without
  mincing words, that if any crime in which the Rat was involved was carried
  through to its fulfilment she would hold him responsible and hand him over
  to the police. She had reason to believe that he had already tried to double
  cross her once; she now believed that to-night he had tried to do it again.
  She would leave here, and go straight to the police. The police, then, would
  not only be looking for Billy Kane, they would be looking for the Rat&mdash;and
  they would get Billy Kane! And that would be the end of it all!</p>
  <p>The end of it&mdash;when he already knew who the murderer of David Ellsworth
  was; when, apart from the collection of rubies, he had already recovered
  the proceeds of the Ellsworth vault robbery; when, if he could only cling
  for a few days more to this r&ocirc;le he played, he might hope to clear
  his own name, to stand foursquare with the world again, and to bring to justice
  those who had taken old David Ellsworth&rsquo;s life. Somehow, in some way,
  he must prevent her from carrying out what was now her obvious intention
  of unmasking the Rat. But he dared not show himself in front of the house
  to intercept her when she went out&mdash;he dared not show himself as the
  Rat out there. To bring the underworld down upon him was only to invite a
  swifter destruction from another source.</p>
  <p>He gnawed in perplexity at his lips, staring into the room. She kept pacing
  up and down. Barloff had risen from his seat, and in a curious, cringing
  way, standing now by the rickety old safe, was fondling it and patting it
  with his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Barloff was crooning. &ldquo;I thank you&mdash;I
  thank you! I do not know who you are, but I thank you! I have not much, very
  little, very, very little, but I am an old man, and what would become of
  me if I lost my little? The police, yes, the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old Russian, his back now to the window, was still talking, more to
  himself than to her. She came close to the window this time and Billy Kane
  suddenly showed himself. She was very clever, very self-centered, very sure
  of herself. If she was startled, she gave no sign of it. She came still closer
  until she leaned for a moment against the sill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out here&mdash;the lane&mdash;when you leave!&rdquo; he whispered
  quickly.</p>
  <p>She nodded her head, but her lips had tightened in a forbidding little smile
  as she turned away again,</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew back from the window. There was a sense of relief upon him;
  but also a vague, disquieting, and very much stronger sense of something
  else that he could not quite define; only that between them there always
  seemed to stand that barrier of a forbidding smile, and that cool, contemptuous
  light in the brown eyes that very often changed from contempt to loathing
  and abhorrence. He shrugged his shoulders suddenly. He was a fool&mdash;that
  was all!</p>
  <p>Her voice drifted out to him, dying away as he neared the fence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going now, Mr. Barloff, and I should advise you not to waste
  any time in taking whatever precautions you intend to take. You had better
  communicate at once with the police, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane swung himself over the fence, and stood there waiting in the
  lane. A minute, two, three passed, and then he caught the sound of a light
  step, and she stood before him in the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;I am here, Bundy. What do you
  want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was the Rat, alias Bundy Morgan, in her eyes, and it was the Rat who
  spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you in there,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  going to beat it for the police, and wise them up about me. Well, you want
  to can that stunt, because I&rsquo;ve got a little explanation to make. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not need to make any explanation,&rdquo; she answered evenly. &ldquo;My
  stupidity is at an end! That enigmatic little memo of yours was a better
  safeguard in itself than the hiding place in which you had secreted it, for
  I did not understand it until I saw a few lines in the paper this evening
  giving a short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the Wop&rsquo;s somewhat unedifying
  career, and stating that he had been released from prison. I was too late
  to save the Wop himself, but was not too late to prevent you from climbing
  in through that window, and carrying out the rest of your abominable scheme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went there to warn Barloff myself,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>She laughed icily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you expect me to believe that, after you have murdered a man so
  that you could put the onus of another crime upon him! This is the end to-night!
  I was mad to trust you at all. I was madder still to give you another chance,
  when I caught you playing a double game both with your own criminal associates
  and with me when you stole that letter from Dayler two nights ago!&rdquo; She
  came a little closer to him. Both hands were tightly clenched. Her lips quivered
  a little; her voice choked. &ldquo;I did not know what it was like to feel
  guilty of murder, to feel that one had taken another&rsquo;s life. I know
  now. My folly in giving you a moment&rsquo;s freedom has made me as guilty
  as you. But the end has come. Do you understand? You might put me out of
  the road, too, here in this lane, but that would not change the result any.
  You know that. You know in that case that the police would be after you anyway&mdash;that
  I have taken care of that. On the other hand, you may run for it now, and
  you may make it a question of hours, or a question of days, but as soon as
  the police lay hands on you your career is finished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a strange stirring within Billy Kane&rsquo;s soul. She was very
  close to him, so close that he could see the pinched, haggard look in her
  face, and see the lips quiver again, and see the clenched hands rise to her
  eyes as though to shut out the abhorrent sight of him from her, and to shut
  out perhaps, too, the pictured sight of a man murdered, and for whose life
  she not illogically held herself accountable.</p>
  <p>His hands gripped hard&mdash;hard as the mental grip in which he held himself.
  A sudden yearning, an almost uncontrollable impulse was upon him to reach
  out and sweep this lithe, fearless little figure that had become so mysteriously
  a part of his life, a greater part than he had ever realized before, into
  his arms. She would struggle like a wild cat, and fight with every ounce
  of strength, yes, and hatred, that was in her, but he could hold her because
  he was the stronger, and tell her that he was not the Rat, and&mdash; He
  swallowed hard. And then what? Tell her that he was Billy Kane? A wan smile
  came to his lips. She would perhaps prefer the Rat! The Rat, publicly at
  least, was known as the less infamous of the two! He laughed a little harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; he said roughly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played straight
  with you, and before you go spilling any beans to the police you&rsquo;d
  better get onto yourself. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
  about!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that the Wop was murdered to-night in Wong Yen&rsquo;s by
  you, or your orders,&rdquo; she said passionately. &ldquo;I know that the
  Wop is dead&mdash;that is enough!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nix!&rdquo; said Billy Kane, alias Bundy Morgan, alias the Rat. &ldquo;The
  Wop isn&rsquo;t dead, and he isn&rsquo;t in Wong Yen&rsquo;s either. I pulled
  him out of there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stared at him, coming still closer in the darkness until he could feel
  her breath upon his face. It was a long minute before she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not believe you!&rdquo; she said in a dead voice.</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not expect you to!&rdquo; The Rat&rsquo;s tones were insolent
  now. &ldquo;But you can prove it, can&rsquo;t you? The Wop&rsquo;s safe.
  He&rsquo;s at a minister&rsquo;s house. The minister&rsquo;s name is Claflin.
  I don&rsquo;t know the address, but you can easily find it. It wouldn&rsquo;t
  do me any good to lie to you, would it? You can&rsquo;t drag me to the police
  by force, and whether you squealed to them in the next ten minutes, or half
  an hour later after finding out I was lying, I&rsquo;d be just as bad off,
  wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back&mdash;but her eyes were still fixed steadily upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can find this minister&rsquo;s house in that half hour, I think,&rdquo; she
  said in a low voice. &ldquo;And the Wop&mdash;if he is there.&rdquo; Her
  voice hardened. &ldquo;You are quite right, Bundy, it will have done you
  no good to have lied. I promise you that! If I do not find the Wop, the police
  will find&mdash;<i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was gone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  The Fight</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane stood in the lane for a moment, staring after her through the
  darkness and his lips puckered in a sort of impotent little smile. She would
  find the Wop, of course, and thereafter the old relationship between them
  would be re&euml;stablished, and&mdash;.</p>
  <p>He whirled suddenly, and in an instant was astride the top of the fence,
  his face set and hard, as there came, low but unmistakably from the interior
  of Barloff&rsquo;s house, the sound of blows and the rending of wood, as
  though a door were being violently forced. A glance showed him that the window
  had been closed and the shade drawn down. Barloff had evidently got that
  far in safeguarding himself, only Red Vallon&rsquo;s Apach&eacute;s had struck,
  perhaps suspicious of <i>her</i> visit, without waiting for the old Russian
  to go out! What else could those blows mean but an attack on Barloff? Certainly,
  Barloff must still be in there, for Barloff, warned, wasn&rsquo;t going out;
  he was going to appeal, by telephone presumably, to the police.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s mind was racing, as he whipped his mask from his pocket,
  adjusted it over his face, dropped to the ground, and ran across the yard.
  The night&rsquo;s work obviously now, was far from over yet! He had still
  to play, after all, that other r&ocirc;le of his in the underworld&mdash;the
  man in the mask! Red Vallon had said that the Pigeon, French Marr and the
  Cadger were to carry out the robbery inside the house. That made three to
  one! His one chance then was to take them by surprise.</p>
  <p>He was working now with Whitie Jack&rsquo;s skeleton keys at the rear door.
  The Cadger was an expert safeworker, just as the Wop was, and that was part
  of the game to make it appear to be the Wop&rsquo;s work. The Wop was safe
  now, of course, but&mdash;he bit at his lips, cursing his clumsiness with
  the keys&mdash;old Barloff certainly wasn&rsquo;t! They had intended to get
  Barloff out of the house, but if, without waiting for that, they struck with
  Barloff there, they would not stand on any more ceremony with the old man
  than they had with the Wop, since the Wop was to stand for it anyway. It
  was strange, ominously strange, that there was no outcry from Barloff, that
  even the sound of blows and splintering wood had ceased!</p>
  <p>The door gave under his hand. He pushed it open cautiously, a bare half
  inch at a time. In front of him was a small room, obviously the kitchen,
  that connected with the rest of the house only by the side door of Barloff&rsquo;s
  rear room from which the light now filtered in across the kitchen floor.
  He stole silently forward in the direction of the lighted doorway and halted,
  as, a little back from the edge of the door jamb, he stared in amazement
  into the room beyond.</p>
  <p>The door near Barloff&rsquo;s desk that led into the front room hung shattered
  on its hinges, its panels broken and splintered, but the only occupant of
  the room was Barloff himself. The man was standing there, a hatchet in his
  hand, surveying the wreckage, and mumbling inaudibly to himself.</p>
  <p>And then suddenly there came a twisted smile of comprehension to Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  lips. Old Barloff laid the hatchet down on the desk, and, rubbing his hands
  together in a sort of fiendish exaltation, a malicious grin on his cunning
  and crafty face, ran over to the safe and knelt before it. His mumble became
  quite audible now:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Wop! The Wop! Dead&mdash;eh? And all these little rentals, these
  nice little rentals, just in! And, if they are stolen&mdash;eh? I am a poor
  man&mdash;eh? I could not replace them. And so they would be mine&mdash;mine.
  She&rsquo;s sure he is dead. She said so&mdash;that they murdered him. But
  she did not see it with her own eyes. If she comes back and tells the police
  that, I will say that the Wop must have escaped the trap they set for him,
  for with my own eyes I saw him, and since he is dead he will not be able
  to deny that. Yes, yes, Barloff, your old brain is still your best friend!
  And the others&mdash;ha, ha! They have planted it on the Wop&mdash;ha, ha!
  It would be a pity to disappoint them&mdash;and lose the rentals. Yes, yes,
  Barloff, that is so, is it not? Certainly, the Wop has robbed you, and tried
  to get revenge on you, too, because you were honest enough to go to the police
  five years ago!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man had the safe open now, and was snatching books and papers from the
  interior, and throwing them in a litter upon the floor. And now he had an
  old tin cash box in his hands. He laid this on the floor and opened it, and
  in a sort of hideous rapacity seemed to gloat over it. He dipped in his hands
  and lifted out banknotes, and let them filter through his fingers, and rubbed
  his hands together, and buried them again in the money; while behind the
  steel-bowed spectacles his little black eyes glittered with feverish exaltation
  again, and his whole body seemed to quiver in unholy, greedy worship.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s jaw locked hard. The man&rsquo;s whole life was a damnable
  hypocrisy&mdash;a rogue&rsquo;s alias. Thousands the man had somewhere, and,
  by comparison, the paltry hundreds in the cash box, if hundreds even there
  were, seemed to hold up as to a mirror the man&rsquo;s soul, stripped bare,
  until it stood out in all its naked, shrivelled miserliness, its godless
  grovelling to the only god it knew!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rentals&mdash;all the rentals!&rdquo; mumbled Barloff again. &ldquo;I
  am a poor man&mdash;how can I pay them over to-morrow when they have been
  stolen from me to-night, and I have nothing left? Yes, yes, Barloff, you
  are getting old, but you are not yet a fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was suddenly all haste. He snatched up the cash box, and ran to
  the piece of furniture which had struck Billy Kane as so incongruous an adjunct
  to the furnishings of the room&mdash;the old morris chair. He turned this
  over on its back, there was a faint click of a hidden spring, and the bottom
  underneath the seat gaped outward on what were evidently ingeniously concealed
  hinges. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes, behind his mask, narrowed in grim humor,
  as he caught a glimpse of piles of neatly stacked banknotes in the hollow
  bottom of the chair, that was a sort of spacious, boxlike compartment&mdash;and
  then the old miser had thrust in the cash box, closed the seat again, and
  righted the chair. Old Barloff, after all, did not place all his faith in
  a presumptive burglar&rsquo;s chivalry for the obvious helplessness of the
  rickety old safe!</p>
  <p>Barloff was rubbing his hands together unctuously once more, as he hurried
  back now to the desk. The desk was close to the already splintered door that
  led to the front of the house, and Barloff, catching up the hatchet in one
  hand, pulled the portable telephone instrument toward him with the other,
  and snatched the receiver from its hook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police&mdash;quick&mdash;quick!&rdquo; he called into the transmitter,
  his voice pitched in a well-simulated scream of terror, and brought the hatchet
  down with a crash on the splintered panels.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane made no movement save that his lips twitched a little. The low,
  cunning trickery of the man produced a sort of nauseating disgust, and, too,
  a sort of merciless anger; but, given enough rope now, Barloff was in a fair
  way to hang himself, and it would afford him, Billy Kane, a very genuine
  pleasure to adjust, as he now proposed to do, the noose that would accomplish
  that hanging!</p>
  <p>Barloff was still raining his hatchet blows on the door; and then suddenly,
  evidently having got his connection, he was screaming again, between blows,
  into the mouthpiece of the telephone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that the police?&mdash;Yes, yes!&mdash;Quick&mdash;This is Ivan
  Barloff&mdash;Barloff, Barloff, Barloff&mdash;yes, Barloff&mdash;Quick&mdash;Help!&mdash;For
  God&rsquo;s sake, help!&mdash;It is the Wop!&mdash;Do you hear?&mdash;The
  Wop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barloff slammed the receiver back on the hook, and flung the hatchet down
  on the floor. It was quiet in the room now except that the old man was talking
  again to himself, in a sort of triumphant glee:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha&mdash;got to escape from the Wop now&mdash;got to escape&mdash;yes,
  yes, Barloff, you have done well, very well&mdash;but you must hurry now&mdash;yes,
  hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane drew silently back into the darkness at the far side of the kitchen.
  There was still a little more rope left to give Barloff for Barloff&rsquo;s
  undoing! He, Billy Kane, had no intention of interfering with the hypocritical
  old scoundrel&rsquo;s self-styled escape, nor of preventing Barloff now from
  rushing, for instance, to the police to amplify his tale; but Barloff, to &ldquo;escape&rdquo; and
  carry out his ruse successfully, could not rush out through the door supposed
  to be barred by the Wop and so reach the street that way! Barloff then, if
  Barloff were logical, had a choice of the kitchen and back door, or the window.</p>
  <p>The light in Barloff&rsquo;s room went out. Billy Kane smiled in satisfaction.
  With the kitchen in complete darkness now there was no chance of his being
  seen if Barloff came that way, and&mdash;no, it was the window! The sash
  creaked as the window was opened. There was a low thud as the man dropped
  to the ground, and then the sound of the other&rsquo;s footsteps running
  across the yard toward the fence.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane laughed a little, grimly under his breath, as he stepped instantly
  forward and entered the room old Barloff had just vacated. It was his turn
  now at the telephone! A hint to the police as to where the money was, and,
  with the Wop&rsquo;s alibi thoroughly established, Barloff would be condemned
  by his own story. It would require only a moment to telephone, and then he
  would make his own get-away; also, it would be ten minutes at least before
  the police from the nearest station could answer Barloff&rsquo;s call, but
  if, in the meanwhile, the Cadger and his pack arrived, they would not only
  get nothing, but would run a very excellent chance of being trapped by the
  police, and&mdash;.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane with his hand groping out through the darkness for the telephone,
  stood suddenly tense and still; and then, as suddenly, actuated partly by
  some intuitive sense of danger, and partly because some indefinable sound
  of movement caught his ear, he swerved, throwing his body sharply to one
  side. There was a swish like the ugly sweep of some weapon cutting through
  the air from a ferocious, full-arm swing, a queer numbness from a glancing
  blow on the side of his head, a crash upon the desk, a metallic clatter on
  the floor&mdash;and then he lunged forward, and his hands, pawing out, touched
  and closed on a man&rsquo;s form in front of him.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s head was dizzy and swirling. He was conscious that arms
  which were like bands of steel were around him, and that his own arms, to
  keep from being torn apart and his hold on the other loosened, were straining
  until they hurt in their sockets. It seemed as though in the pitch blackness
  they were reeling around the room in the crazy, jerky, unbalanced dance of
  some mad orgy! A voice was snarling in his ear, snarling vicious oaths, snarling
  in a fury that seemed ungovernable, beyond all license, that seemed to have
  taken possession of the other, body and soul, and made the other&rsquo;s
  strength demoniacal. That was it! It could not be anything else. That was
  what made the man so strong. The man was mad&mdash;a madman! He tried to
  think, as he gasped and panted for his breath. It wasn&rsquo;t the Cadger,
  or French Marr, or the Pigeon, for then there would have been three of them.
  Who was it? His brain was sick and swimming, and refused its functions. He
  could not think very well. He must fight&mdash;that was all&mdash;fight!</p>
  <p>It seemed to Billy Kane as though hours were passing. It seemed as though
  gradually, very gradually, his strength was oozing away, and that his hands
  were slipping from around the man&rsquo;s back. He clenched his teeth together.
  He remembered suddenly that murderous swish through the air. It seemed to
  steady him, to bring to him, too, a sudden fury in place of that unnerving
  giddiness. He wanted to strike; to strike, as murderously as he had been
  struck, at this thing whose hot, tainted breath was on his cheek, at this
  thing that snarled like a beast as it struggled and fought. He wanted to
  strike, only the giddiness from the blow on his head was back again, and&mdash;.</p>
  <p>The other had wrenched himself free. Billy Kane flung his weight forward
  to retain his hold, and with the impact both men reeled, tripped on the littered
  floor, lost their balance, and, locked together, crashed to the ground.</p>
  <p>They rolled over once, and then the other&rsquo;s snarl became a vicious
  laugh. The giddiness was coming in quick flashes over Billy Kane now, and
  he felt his hands wrenched and torn away from the other, and he felt the
  other&rsquo;s body upon him now like some crushing, insupportable weight.
  He reached out in the darkness in a desperate, frantic effort to close again,
  to protect himself from the short-arm jabs that were raining into his face.
  His fingers touched the man&rsquo;s bare, collarless throat, slipped on the
  throat&mdash;and suddenly held. There was a string, or a cord, or something
  around the man&rsquo;s neck. It was very curious! But his fingers had hooked
  in between the cord and the flesh, and he clung there tenaciously. If he
  could only twist it, and twist it hard enough, he could choke the other!
  He wasn&rsquo;t strong enough to do anything else&mdash;just twist at the
  cord&mdash;and choke the other&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
  <p>There was a sound that seemed to come from the front of the house, like
  the opening of a door, and then voices&mdash;unmistakably voices. But the
  other had heard it too. The man was struggling now to get away, not to strike
  any more blows, just to wrench and tear himself loose from that cord that
  Billy Kane had twined around his hands and fingers. And then the cord gave
  with a sudden snap, the man sprang to his feet, and, without a sound, like
  a shadowy form just visible in the darkness, flung himself out through the
  window.</p>
  <p>The cord was still twined around Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers as he lay, half-dazed,
  his head swimming weakly, flat on his back on the floor. He shook it free
  from his hand and raised himself up into a sitting posture, as he smiled
  in a queer, bitter way. There was a light in the front room now, and he was
  too exhausted to reach the window as his late antagonist had done, unless
  he stumbled and lurched there, and then he would be heard in the front room.</p>
  <p>It was the end of the Rat, alias Bundy Morgan&mdash;and it was the end of
  Billy Kane. It was probably the Cadger and his crowd out there, but, at least,
  they would not take him alive. His hand dove into his pocket for his automatic
  and encountered the brandy flask that had already stood the Wop in such good
  stead. He snatched it from his pocket, and, his mask already awry on his
  face, carried the flask to his lips, and drank eagerly.</p>
  <p>The stimulant whipped through his veins in a fiery tide. It cleared his
  brain. No, it wasn&rsquo;t the Cadger out there&mdash;the Cadger and his
  crowd would be scared off for good now&mdash;there were two men&mdash;he
  could see them coming through the doorway&mdash;and he heard old Barloff&rsquo;s
  voice.</p>
  <p>He drank again greedily, shifting the flask to his left hand, while his
  right dove once more into his pocket, and this time secured his automatic.
  He drew his mask back over his face. The light over the desk went on, and,
  sitting there on the floor, Billy Kane blinked in the sudden glare at old
  Barloff and a police officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move, please, either of you, except to put your hands
  up!&rdquo; said Billy Kane in a low voice.</p>
  <p>There was a startled exclamation from the officer, as his hands went up
  above his head; while a gray, blank look spread over the old miser&rsquo;s
  face, as he, too, obeyed with equal celerity.</p>
  <p>It was very curious! Billy Kane frowned in a puzzled way. It was very curious&mdash;not
  so much that he should be sitting there on the littered floor, with the side
  of his head trickling a warm flow of blood down under the neck of his shirt,
  and holding a brandy flask in one hand, and holding up two men at the point
  of his automatic with the other; it wasn&rsquo;t so much that, it was an
  object on the floor near the desk that looked like a round piece of grained
  wood, about an inch in diameter and three feet in length.</p>
  <p>He thrust the flask into his pocket, and, over his mask, rubbed the back
  of his hand across his eyes. It wasn&rsquo;t a vagary of his sick brain,
  was it? Well, he would know in a minute as soon as he lifted it and felt
  its weight. No, that wasn&rsquo;t necessary, he remembered that <i>metallic</i> clatter
  upon the floor. He knew what the thing was. It was the iron shaft of the
  crutch that he had seen two nights ago&mdash;a detachable shaft probably&mdash;the
  weapon that he was satisfied had already murdered David Ellsworth, and murdered
  Peters.</p>
  <p>His mind was clear now and working in lightning flashes. His assailant had
  been the one man in the world upon whose throat he had prayed to get his
  fingers&mdash;the Man with the Crutch! Well, his fingers had been there,
  only he had been, at a disadvantage, weak and dizzy from the blow from that
  thing there, and&mdash;yes, this was curious too! He was watching the two
  men, his automatic covered them unswervingly; but out of the corner of his
  eye he could not help but see that red patch on the floor beside him, that
  looked like an ordinary flannel chest protector, and to which the cord that
  he had torn from his antagonist&rsquo;s neck was still attached. He reached
  for it and thrust it into his pocket, as he rose slowly, and a little unsteadily,
  to his feet.</p>
  <p>He eyed the two men now for a long calculating second. Yes, his brain was
  quite clear now&mdash;exhilaratingly clear. And the mental exhilaration seemed
  to bring in its train a new physical strength as well. In a flash he saw
  the way out now, and with it, too, the means of slipping Barloff&rsquo;s
  self-knotted noose around the miserly old Russian&rsquo;s throat. But he
  must work quickly. There was not an instant to spare. This officer could
  not have come in answer to Barloff&rsquo;s telephone call, for he realized
  that, long as it had seemed, his fight here in the room could not have lasted
  in reality more than two or three minutes, and it had begun almost on the
  instant that Barloff had run from the house. There would not, therefore,
  have been time for the telephone call to have been answered, for the nearest
  police station was too far away, and besides, in that event, there would
  have been more than one officer. Barloff had probably encountered the policeman
  out on the street, and, carrying out his devilishly inspired plan, had poured
  his story into the officer&rsquo;s ears, and rushed the other back to the
  house. But in that case, the men from the station would be on their way here
  now, and the leeway left him, Billy Kane, in which to act must, even now,
  be narrowed to the very perilous margin of but another four or five minutes&mdash;perhaps
  less!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Move to the wall, face it, and keep your hands up!&rdquo; ordered
  Billy Kane curtly.</p>
  <p>The officer, with a chagrined scowl and a shrug of his shoulders, obeyed.
  Barloff, white and trembling, and thoroughly frightened, needed no urging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the drop on me,&rdquo; snarled the officer. &ldquo;But
  don&rsquo;t worry, my bucko, I know who you are! That mask ain&rsquo;t doing
  you any good! There&rsquo;s a free ride and board coming to you again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s automatic was pressed into the small of the officer&rsquo;s
  back. With his free hand he deftly relieved the other of a pair of handcuffs
  and a revolver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Billy Kane coolly. &ldquo;Now,
  Barloff, stick your right hand out behind you!&rdquo; He slipped one of the
  steel cuffs over the Russian&rsquo;s wrist. &ldquo;Now you, officer! No,
  your <i>right</i> hand! I know it&rsquo;s customary in making an arrest to
  leave your right hand free, but in the circumstances I am forced to inconvenience
  you a little in your movements.&rdquo; He snapped the other cuff shut. &ldquo;Thank
  you! You may both turn around now!&rdquo; He stepped back, hurled the officer&rsquo;s
  revolver out through the window, and picked up the weapon whose blow, luckily
  for him, he had partially evaded. He had in no way been mistaken. It was
  the iron shaft of the crutch, and it was ingeniously fashioned with a spring
  catch that obviously fitted into a socket in the now missing armpiece of
  the crutch. It served him now as a support. He leaned upon it, using it as
  a cane, as he swayed a little on his feet. &ldquo;I can only spare a moment,&rdquo; he
  said engagingly to the officer; &ldquo;but possibly I can make that moment
  well worth your while. We&rsquo;ll talk quickly, if you please. I imagine
  that you were on your beat out there on the street when Barloff here found
  you. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where else would I be?&rdquo; said the officer gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to make sure of,&rdquo; returned Billy
  Kane pleasantly. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I want to get through here in
  a hurry&mdash;before your reinforcements arrive. What story did this man
  tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said the officer shortly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got your
  nerve with you! But you can&rsquo;t get away with it! I tell you, I know
  you! You might as well take that mask off. You&rsquo;re the Wop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jumping at conclusions,&rdquo; said Billy Kane calmly, &ldquo;because
  Barloff here has told you the Wop had broken in and robbed him. Well, ask
  Barloff, then!&rdquo; He turned on Barloff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the Wop,
  am I, Barloff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; Barloff swallowed hard; he was evidently
  floundering in a perplexed mental maze. &ldquo;But my money&rsquo;s gone,
  and the Wop was here. I saw him. I saw him. Maybe you&rsquo;re a pal of his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am for to-night,&rdquo; said Billy Kane quietly. &ldquo;When did
  you see the Wop? What did you tell this officer here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you are, are you!&rdquo; Barloff seemed suddenly relieved. He
  shook his free fist at Billy Kane. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a pal of the Wop&rsquo;s,
  are you! Well, I don&rsquo;t know where you came from, but I saw the Wop
  just as plainly as I see you now.&rdquo; He edged around and addressed the
  officer eagerly. &ldquo;I was sitting at the desk there, officer, just as
  I told you, and that door was open, and there was a light in that front room.
  The Wop must have got the front door open without my hearing him. I saw him
  stealing across that room out there. I rushed to the door, and shut it, and
  called for help. He began to smash it in and I grabbed up the telephone and
  called the police, and then ran for the window, and got out by the lane to
  the street where I found you. He would have killed me. He swore he would
  when he went to prison.&rdquo; His voice changed suddenly into a whining
  wail. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got my money! Look at the floor&mdash;look at the
  safe! He&rsquo;s got my money, and run with it when he heard us coming.&rdquo; He
  began to claw frantically at the officer&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;The Wop&rsquo;s
  got it! Look, officer, this pal of his has been hurt! Look at the side of
  his head&mdash;that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t get away too&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  why we found him here on the floor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk as though you&rsquo;d been frisked of a million!&rdquo; Billy
  Kane was tauntingly sarcastic now. &ldquo;How much did you have, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much! How much!&rdquo; howled Barloff. &ldquo;Enough to ruin
  me! All this month&rsquo;s rentals that I had just collected. Three hundred
  and eighty-seven dollars!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three hundred and eighty-seven dollars!&rdquo; Billy Kane mimicked
  the other admirably. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;d keep
  three hundred and eighty-seven dollars in that crazy old safe that&rsquo;s
  falling to pieces, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where else would I keep it?&rdquo; Barloff was shaking his fist again. &ldquo;Yes,
  I kept it there! And that&rsquo;s where it was to-night&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
  gone now&mdash;gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all you had?&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s sneer was irritatingly
  contemptuous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; shrieked Barloff. &ldquo;All&mdash;yes, it is all! But
  it is enough! I am a poor man, and the money was not mine, and I cannot replace
  it, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He choked suddenly, and shrank back, dragging the officer with him a step.
  Billy Kane had moved abruptly to the morris chair, and had toppled it over
  on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You pitiful liar! You haven&rsquo;t seen the Wop in five years!&rdquo; rasped
  Billy Kane, and the iron shaft in his hand crashed through the false bottom
  of the chair. A package of banknotes tumbled out on the floor, another, and
  yet another. A second blow dislodged the cash box, and a further rain of
  banknotes. &ldquo;You thought the Wop was dead, and that you could make him
  stand for this, did you!&rdquo; rasped Billy Kane again. &ldquo;You yellow
  cur&mdash;so that you could steal those few miserable rentals yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped the officer. Barloff was a grovelling thing
  at his side. He jerked the other toward him, and stared into the white, working
  features.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane backed to the window, and there was an abrupt change in his voice
  as he addressed the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going now,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I am not quite
  sure of the technical charge against your prisoner, but I imagine it is just
  plain theft&mdash;of three hundred and eighty-seven dollars. And it might
  be interesting, too, to know where so poor a man got that small fortune there
  on the floor! Perhaps Barloff will tell you! As for the Wop, he has never
  been near this place, and you will find him at the Reverend Mr. Claflin&rsquo;s
  house, where he has been all evening. I think that&rsquo;s all, officer,
  except&rdquo;&mdash;Billy Kane had straddled the window sill&mdash;&ldquo;except
  that I apologize to you for anything in the shape of l&egrave;se majesty
  of which I may have been guilty, but as I have certain personal reasons that
  justify me in not desiring to appear publicly in the matter, I am sure you
  will admit I had no other&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not finish his sentence. He dropped hurriedly to the ground,
  and ran, or, rather, half ran, half stumbled his way to the fence and lane.
  Someone was at the front door again&mdash;obviously the police detail from
  the station.</p>
  <p>He made his way along the lane, and from that lane into another. He was
  still weak and progress was slow, and for half an hour he kept under cover.
  When he finally emerged into the open he was blocks away from Barloff&rsquo;s
  house, and very much closer to a certain temporary sanctuary in the heart
  of the underworld!</p>
  <p>Ten minutes later, behind locked doors, he was sitting at the dilapidated
  table under the single incandescent light, in the Rat&rsquo;s den. Before
  him lay a small red flannel sack, that might have passed for an ordinary
  chest protector, and which he had cut open with his knife. He raised his
  hand, and passed it across his eyes. The Wop and Barloff were extraneous
  considerations now. There was something far more vital to think about, but
  his brain was refusing its functions again. He was very tired&mdash;very
  tired and weak. There was the Man with the Crutch, the man who, he knew now,
  had killed Peters and David Ellsworth, the man who had looted David Ellsworth&rsquo;s
  vault of its money and its priceless rubies, the man for whose guilt he,
  Billy Kane, was held accountable, the man with whom he had fought to-night.
  In a numbed way, because his mind was in a sort of torpor, Billy Kane was
  dimly conscious that there was no more any mere coincidence in this repeated
  appearance of the Man with the Crutch. He knew now that Jackson, the footman,
  had only been an underling. It was curious, singular, sinister. Who was the
  man? What did it mean? The man wasn&rsquo;t even lame, was he? He remembered
  the extraordinary agility the other had showed two nights ago&mdash;and why
  was the shaft of the crutch detachable?&mdash;and the man hadn&rsquo;t fought
  like a crippled man to-night&mdash;and there had been no sign of the upper
  portion of the crutch, either!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s head sank forward a little on his shoulders. He raised
  himself with a jerk, and stared at the red flannel sack in front of him.
  A score of magnificent rubies scintillated in fiery flashes under the light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all here,&rdquo; mumbled Billy Kane, with a twisted
  smile. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all here&mdash;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Rendezvous</h2>
  <p>It was night again in the underworld.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane slipped suddenly into the dark shadows of a doorway. Fifty yards
  ahead of him, up the poorly lighted, narrow and miserable street, three men
  had paused on the sidewalk, and were engaged in what was apparently an animated
  discussion. Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes narrowed in a puzzled, perturbed, and
  yet grim way, as he watched them. He had followed them for an hour now&mdash;from
  a saloon, where he had found them, to a disreputable pool room, and from
  there again to a saloon, and now here.</p>
  <p>He did not understand. It was one of those strange portals, so extraneous
  to the aim of clearing his name of the murder of David Ellsworth, and yet,
  too, so essentially a corollary of the Rat&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le that he played
  here in the underworld, at which he was knocking again. His lips curled in
  a queer smile. How long would it be before the end? And what would that end
  be? In his possession now, save for a portion of the rubies, perhaps half
  of them, was everything that the murderers of David Ellsworth had stolen
  from the old philanthropist&rsquo;s vault on that night which seemed now
  to belong to some past age and incarnation. He knew now that the Man with
  the Crutch was the actual murderer&mdash;but there he faced a blank wall.
  He had even fought with the man in the blackness of old Barloff&rsquo;s room
  last night, not knowing until too late who his assailant was, and the man
  had got away.</p>
  <p>His hand at his side clenched. It could not endure very long&mdash;this
  impossible situation in which he found himself with that strange, unknown
  woman, who, believing him to be the Rat, held the threat of Sing Sing over
  his head. And there was the Rat himself whose name and personality and home,
  such as it was, he had usurped during the latter&rsquo;s absence, an absence
  that might terminate at any moment. And there were the police who dragged
  the city and the country from end to end for Billy Kane. From anyone of these
  three sources, swift as a lightning stroke, without an instant&rsquo;s warning,
  the end might come with that goal of life still unreached, and, greater than
  life, his honor, still unreclaimed. And it seemed to-night somehow that his
  chances were bitterly small, that somehow the odds seemed to be growing and
  accumulating against him. He was on another errand now, because he could
  not help himself. He was allowing precious moments that should have been
  devoted to the one chance he had, that of searching ceaselessly, pitilessly,
  remorselessly, for the Man with the Crutch, to be directed into other channels&mdash;because
  he could not help himself.</p>
  <p>He stepped out from the shelter of the doorway, and started forward again
  along the street. The three men had turned from the sidewalk, and had disappeared
  inside a dingy, black and tumble-down tenement. Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips tightened
  a little. It was a hard neighborhood, nestling just off the Bowery&mdash;as
  hard almost as the three characters themselves who had just vanished from
  sight. There were a few pedestrians here on the side street, a few figures
  that skulked along in the semi-darkness, rather than walked, but not many;
  and for the most part, though it was still early, not more than nine o&rsquo;clock,
  the buildings that flanked the street were dark and unlighted.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane jerked his slouch hat farther down over his eyes as he walked
  along. He did not understand. Two hours ago he had been sitting in the Rat&rsquo;s
  den with Whitie Jack&mdash;who had ventured out of hiding again, safe now
  since the interest of the police in Peters&rsquo;, the butler&rsquo;s, murder
  had become definitely centered in the Man with the Crutch&mdash;and someone
  had knocked at the door. Whitie Jack had answered the knock, and had brought
  back the message that Bundy Morgan was wanted at the telephone in a little
  shop across the street. He, Billy Kane, in his r&ocirc;le of the Rat, alias
  the said Bundy Morgan, had perforce answered, and, as he had picked up the
  receiver, he had instantly recognized the voice of the woman whom he knew
  by no other name than the one he himself had given her&mdash;the Woman in
  Black. He was subconsciously rehearsing the rather one-sided conversation
  now, as he moved along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Bundy?&rdquo; she had asked. &ldquo;And do you know
  who is speaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he had answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, then!&rdquo; Her voice had been quiet, deliberate, and yet
  pregnant with a curiously sharp, imperative command. &ldquo;Find Clarkie
  Munn and Gypsy Joe at once, and shadow them to-night. Do not let them out
  of your sight. And see that you do not fail! Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he had replied mechanically; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was all. She had hung up the receiver at the other end of the line.</p>
  <p>He had heard of Clarkie Munn and Gypsy Joe in the days when he had frequented
  the Bad Lands on old David Ellsworth&rsquo;s philanthropic missions, for
  the very simple reason that they were notorious and outstanding criminal
  characters even in the heart and center of the worst crime and vice in the
  city. They were both lags, both men with prison records, and marked by the
  police. Also they were versatile. They had in turn been apaches, gangsters,
  box-workers, poke-getters and second-story sneaks; and they were credited
  with measuring human life purely as a commercial commodity&mdash;worth merely
  what they could get for it.</p>
  <p>He had heard of Clarkie Munn and Gypsy Joe&mdash;who hadn&rsquo;t?&mdash;but
  as to their lair, or where they were to be found, he had not had the slightest
  inkling. Whitie Jack, however, had solved that problem for him. He had sent
  Whitie Jack out to run them down, and Whitie had returned within an hour
  with the report that they were in a certain far from reputable saloon, and
  that they had been joined by the Cherub. He, Billy Kane, had never heard
  of the Cherub, but an adroit leading question or two had set Whitie Jack&rsquo;s
  glib tongue in motion. The Cherub had proved a topic that had aroused an
  unbounded enthusiasm in Whitie Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dey ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; on de Cherub&mdash;none of &rsquo;em
  has,&rdquo; Whitie Jack had asserted, switching his cigarette butt from one
  corner of his mouth to the other in order to permit of an admiring grin. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  de angel kid&mdash;he is! Youse&rsquo;d think he spent his life handin&rsquo; around
  hymn books an&rsquo; leadin&rsquo; de singin&rsquo; down at de mission joints&mdash;only
  he don&rsquo;t! If he got enough for it he&rsquo;d pull a gun an&rsquo; blow
  yer bean off, an&rsquo; youse wouldn&rsquo;t believe it was him even while
  he was doin&rsquo; it, he&rsquo;d look dat innocent. Believe me, Bundy! He&rsquo;s
  got &rsquo;em all skinned, an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t got no limit except de
  sky. Mabbe some day de police&rsquo;ll get wise, but dey ain&rsquo;t fallen
  to de sweet little face of him wid his baby eyes yet. But, aw, say, wot&rsquo;s
  de use! Youse know him as well as I do. Youse&rsquo;d think dey&rsquo;d just
  lifted him out of a dinky little cradle an&rsquo; soused him all over wid
  Florida water&mdash;dat&rsquo;s de Cherub. But de guy dat knows him ducks
  his nut&mdash;dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head in a sort of savage perplexity. He had dismissed
  Whitie Jack then, picked up Clarkie Munn, Gypsy Joe and the Cherub, and had
  followed them here. He had come abreast of the tenement in which they had
  disappeared now, and he looked quickly around him. There was no one on the
  street close enough to pay any particular attention to his movements; and
  there was no doorbell to ring, for in that locality the formality of entering
  a tenement, where humans hived instead of lived, and where at all hours the
  occupants came and went as a matter of course, consisted in pushing the door
  open without further ceremony. His hand slipped into the side pocket of his
  coat, and his fingers closed in a reassuring touch upon his automatic. For
  what particular reason he was to watch Gypsy Joe and Clarkie Munn he was
  as much as ever in the dark; but one thing was clear&mdash;there was only
  one way to keep in touch with his quarry.</p>
  <p>He stepped from the sidewalk, and, with well-simulated unconcern, pushed
  the tenement door open, entered, closed the door softly behind him, and stood
  still, listening intently. The place was gloomy and dark, and heavy with
  a musty, unsavory odor of garlic and rank, stale tobacco; but ahead of him,
  along what seemed like a narrow passage flanking the stairs, a faint glow
  of light struggled out into the blackness, as though from a partially opened
  door, and from this direction a murmur of men&rsquo;s voices reached him.</p>
  <p>He moved stealthily forward for a few steps; and then halted abruptly, and
  pressed back against the wall. Yes, here were the men he sought. In so far
  as locating them in the tenement was concerned, he was in luck. The hallway
  had widened out beyond the staircase, and from where he now stood, through
  a half-opened door, a door that was in poverty-stricken and disreputable
  repair, whose panels, smashed and broken probably in some fracas of former
  days, were patched with strips of cardboard that in turn, hanging by a tack
  or two, gaped blatantly, he could make out Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s dark, scowling,
  unshaven features, as the man sat sprawled out on a chair in the centre of
  the room; also, Clarkie Munn was swearing viciously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s Shaky Liz&mdash;eh? Where&rsquo;s Shaky Liz?
  Who&rsquo;s right now about comin&rsquo; back here? Her tongue&rsquo;s been
  hangin&rsquo; out fer a drink now fer two weeks, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s bust
  loose. Dat&rsquo;s wot she&rsquo;s done&mdash;yes, an&rsquo; probably queered
  de whole lay too! I told youse so! I told youse youse&rsquo;d have to show
  me about Shaky Liz before I&rsquo;d go de limit. See! I ain&rsquo;t fer any
  juice chair up de river&mdash;not yet! Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, shut up!&rdquo; The words were clipped off; the voice was almost
  a boyish treble. &ldquo;Can yer croakin&rsquo;, Clarkie, youse give me a
  pain! Youse came back here because I said so&mdash;dat&rsquo;s why! I had
  to steer clear of Shaky Liz while she put de stunt across, an&rsquo; we got
  to know now if de girl fell fer it all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Clarkie Munn, &ldquo;an&rsquo; Shaky Liz has
  gone an&rsquo; got drunk, an&rsquo; spilled de beans! I know her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she has,&rdquo; purred the other, and there was something of finality
  made the more horrible by the boyish tones, &ldquo;she gets hers&mdash;instead
  of de other, dat&rsquo;s all. An&rsquo; anyway, youse have no kick comin&rsquo;!
  Youse an&rsquo; Gypsy here, an&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; Shaky Liz has all got
  a century apiece to start wid. We can&rsquo;t lose, can we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, we can!&rdquo; complained Clarkie Munn. &ldquo;We can lose
  de other two hundred dat&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; when de job&rsquo;s done, can&rsquo;t
  we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another voice spoke in a curiously meditative, raucous way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d be workin&rsquo; fer him. He handed me
  one once dat I ain&rsquo;t fergot. But dere ain&rsquo;t no one dares to touch
  him now&mdash;he&rsquo;s too big. Youse&rsquo;d get smeared off de map. He&rsquo;s
  got de coin, but he&rsquo;s no good anyway else, except dat he&rsquo;s sharper&rsquo;n
  hell. D&rsquo;ye remember de roll he coughs up when he peels us dem century
  notes dat night? Say, I guess he packs dat along wid him all de time. Say,
  I wish we had him wid de girl to-night&mdash;I guess we&rsquo;d get our two
  hundred apiece, all right, all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clarkie Munn sat suddenly bolt upright in his chair, staring across the
  room, obviously at the last speaker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be wid youse, Gypsy!&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;Him
  an&rsquo; me don&rsquo;t belong to de same lodge neither. We&rsquo;re all
  right, we are, fer dirty work, dat&rsquo;s where we stand; but where do we
  ever get a look-in when dere&rsquo;s anything juicy goin&rsquo;! But youse&rsquo;d
  have to know he had de roll on him. Youse wouldn&rsquo;t get anywhere unless
  youse did. I&rsquo;d be wid youse, Gypsy. I wish something like dat&rsquo;d
  break loose.&rdquo; He swung around in his chair. &ldquo;Eh, Cherub?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse give me a pain!&rdquo; murmured the boyish voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When youse gets a chance to get dat guy, youse&rsquo;ll get a chance
  to hang yer hat in a bathroom suite in de swellest joint in town, an&rsquo; use
  a limousine fer a gape wagon, an&rsquo; wear white spats an&rsquo; yellow
  gloves in summer time. Can de wish stuff!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, hugging close against the wall, moved silently farther on toward
  the rear of the hall until he was beyond the radius of light from the doorway
  of the room. The street door had opened, and a footstep, hesitant, scuffling,
  was out there somewhere behind him. The step came nearer, and now he could
  make out a woman&rsquo;s form, that, either in reality or as an illusion
  due to the uncertain light, seemed to sway a little unsteadily as she walked.
  Opposite the door she stood still, and now in the fuller light Billy Kane
  could see her quite distinctly. Obviously, it was the woman they had referred
  to as Shaky Liz&mdash;an old, unkempt, hag-like creature, who blinked sore,
  red-rimmed eyes in apparent astonishment and consequent indecision at the
  partially open door and the light from within. And then she stepped forward
  into the room, and the next moment the door closed with a slam behind her,
  and with the slam her voice rose in a curious, gurgling cry that seemed to
  mingle terror and an unbridled fury.</p>
  <p>In an instant, Billy Kane had retraced his steps, and was crouching against
  the closed door. He could see now even better than before. The gaping strip
  of cardboard that did duty for the smashed panel, dislodged still farther
  by the violent slam of the door, afforded him an almost unrestricted view
  of the interior. Clarkie Munn had not moved from his chair, and a little
  away from him, legs swinging from a dilapidated, rickety table, Gypsy Joe,
  black-visaged and swarthy, sucked indifferently at a cigarette; but over
  in the far corner of the room by the bed, the woman, her hat knocked to the
  floor, her tangled gray hair draggling about her eyes, was engaged in a violent
  struggle with a small boyish figure, who had her by the throat and was shaking
  her head savagely back and forth. Billy Kane drew in his breath. He remembered
  Whitie Jack&rsquo;s description of the Cherub in action&mdash;and it was
  literally true. The blue eyes were bland and round and seemed to smile, the
  young face was the face of a guileless youth in repose, and yet the boy&mdash;he
  couldn&rsquo;t be much more than a boy&mdash;was in a passion worthy of an
  incarnate fiend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse have been out hittin&rsquo; de can, have youse?&rdquo; snarled
  the Cherub. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach youse! Do youse think I&rsquo;ve spent
  two weeks hangin&rsquo; around dis dirty hole of yers, an&rsquo; standin&rsquo; fer
  youse being me sick, disabled grandmother wid me supposed to be doin&rsquo; me
  best to keep bread in yer mouth, an&rsquo; playin&rsquo; poor, an&rsquo; having
  to listen to her tryin&rsquo; to get me jobs, an&rsquo; handin&rsquo; me
  de soft, goody-goody talk&mdash;d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m standin&rsquo; fer
  dat just to have youse go out an&rsquo; kick de stuffin&rsquo; outer de whole
  lay! I&rsquo;ll teach youse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; screamed Shaky Liz. She shook herself suddenly
  free, and with crooked fingers clawed like a wild cat at the Cherub&rsquo;s
  face. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t crab no game! It&rsquo;s a lie! I got it all
  fixed before I went out. I guess I got a right to a drink now, ain&rsquo;t
  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Cherub warded off her attack with a vicious sweep of his fist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he snarled again. &ldquo;An&rsquo; suppose she&rsquo;d
  seen youse! Or suppose she&rsquo;d come back here by any chance an&rsquo; found
  de poor bedridden grandma gone out fer a drink&mdash;eh! Blast youse, couldn&rsquo;t
  youse wait a few hours more? De whole outfit &rsquo;ud be glad if youse had
  drunk yerself to death den!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shaky Liz dashed the hair out of her eyes, and swept her hands in a half
  angry, half expostulating gesture toward the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t queer no game!&rdquo; she insisted truculently. &ldquo;I
  guess I know wot I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; youse ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; in
  here to pull no rough-house business neither!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, let her alone, an&rsquo; give her a chance to tell her story,&rdquo; drawled
  Gypsy Joe from the table. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got all night to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the Cherub softly, and smiled beneficently, as
  he sat down on the edge of the bed and calmly lighted a cigarette. &ldquo;Go
  on, Liz, spill it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old hag stared at him for a moment in silence, as she dug again at her
  dishevelled locks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse dirty little runt!&rdquo; She found her voice at last, and
  in spite of her scowl there was a grudging note of admiration in her tones. &ldquo;Youse
  are pretty slick, ain&rsquo;t youse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; admitted the Cherub imperturbably. &ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t,
  youse wouldn&rsquo;t have a hundred dollars in yer kick now, an&rsquo; two
  hundred more comin&rsquo; to-morrow&mdash;if youse ain&rsquo;t queered it
  fer yerself. Go on, give us de dope!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shaky Liz preened herself. She adjusted the threadbare bodice of her dress
  that seemed to bulge and sag uncomfortably, picked up her hat, and smirked
  at her audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; She wagged her head secretively. &ldquo;Youse
  don&rsquo;t any of youse need to worry. When de Cherub pipes me off this
  afternoon dat de stunt is to be pulled to-night, I sends fer her as soon
  as he gets out of de way, an&rsquo; she comes on de run. She don&rsquo;t
  suspect nothing, &rsquo;cause wid two weeks&rsquo; acquaintance she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can dat!&rdquo; interrupted the Cherub politely. &ldquo;We all knows
  dat fer two weeks youse an&rsquo; me has been gettin&rsquo; acquainted wid
  her, an&rsquo; feedin&rsquo; on her jellies, an&rsquo; dat I&rsquo;m de
  errin&rsquo; child dat&rsquo;s taken a shine to her an&rsquo; dat mabbe can
  be influenced fer good&mdash;if she tried hard enough. Wot did she say when
  she comes here dis evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot did she say?&rdquo; repeated Shaky Liz, with a sudden and malicious
  grin. &ldquo;Why, she falls fer it, of course! Wot d&rsquo;ye expect? Me,
  I was lyin&rsquo; dere on de bed when she blows in. She asks me how I was,
  an&rsquo; I says I ain&rsquo;t no worse dan usual, but dat it&rsquo;s me
  young grandson dat&rsquo;s troublin&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; how I ain&rsquo;t
  got no one to tell it to except her, an&rsquo; how I dunno as I durst tell
  even her. An&rsquo; den she says I oughter know well enough dat I can trust
  her, an&rsquo; dat she won&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; den I gives
  her de spiel. I says I ain&rsquo;t slept all de last night thinkin&rsquo; about
  it. I tells her it wouldn&rsquo;t do no good me talkin&rsquo; to youse, &rsquo;cause
  I ain&rsquo;t got any influence wid youse an&rsquo; she has, an&rsquo; besides
  dat I was afraid of Gypsy an&rsquo; Clarkie if dey got wise to me. An&rsquo; I
  tells her wot a good boy youse are, too, Cherub, an&rsquo; how though mabbe
  youse might be better it ain&rsquo;t all yer fault &rsquo;cause youse&rsquo;re
  easily led by bad company, but dat youse have stood by yer old grandmother.
  Savvy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De one bright spot in me life,&rdquo; said the Cherub sweetly, &ldquo;is
  dat me own grandmother is dead, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t know de raw deal I&rsquo;m
  handin&rsquo; her. She looked just like youse, too&mdash;not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shaky Liz scowled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse close yer face!&rdquo; she flung out. &ldquo;I tells her dat
  me grandson has got pulled in by two of de toughest crooks in New York.&rdquo; Shaky
  Liz&rsquo;s scowl became a grin. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s youse, Clarkie, an&rsquo; youse,
  Gypsy. I tells her who youse are, an&rsquo; dat last night youse three was
  here, an&rsquo; dat youse all thought I was asleep, but dat I heard youse
  whisperin&rsquo; together, an&rsquo; dat Clarkie an&rsquo; Gypsy was persuadin&rsquo; me
  little boy to pull a trick down to Kegler&rsquo;s dock on de East River, &rsquo;cause
  dey didn&rsquo;t dare do it demselves on account of de police bein&rsquo; leery
  about dem ever since dey comes down from Sing Sing de last time. I tells
  her how I hears youse two crooks explainin&rsquo; dat Kegler&rsquo;s got
  a bunch of coin in his safe to pay off some sand barges dat he had expected
  yesterday, but dat had got held up down de Sound, an&rsquo; dat instead of
  takin&rsquo; de money back to de bank he was lettin&rsquo; it rust in his
  box, knowin&rsquo; dat de barges&rsquo;d be along de day after to-morrow,
  an&rsquo; dat youse had de combination of de safe, an&rsquo; de key to de
  front door, an&rsquo; dat dere wouldn&rsquo;t be nobody around dere, an&rsquo; dat,
  anyway, nobody&rsquo;d suspect me little lad, an&rsquo; dat he was to go
  down dere alone at ten o&rsquo;clock to-night an&rsquo; make de haul, an&rsquo; den
  meet Clarkie an&rsquo; Gypsy uptown somewhere fer de split.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gypsy Joe, on the table, circled his lips approvingly with the tip of his
  tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de stuff, Shaky!&rdquo; he commended. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  youse mind dese guys, dey ain&rsquo;t neither of dem got anything on youse.
  I&rsquo;m fer youse, old gal!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shaky Liz grinned complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me, I was cryin&rsquo; good an&rsquo; hard by dis time,&rdquo; she
  said, and grinned again, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she had a face dat white youse&rsquo;d
  think she was goin&rsquo; to pull de faint act. I says I ain&rsquo;t slept
  all de last night tryin&rsquo; to think wot to do, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s
  why I sent fer her. An&rsquo; she asks me if I&rsquo;m sure de boy was goin&rsquo; to
  do it. An&rsquo; I says I am. An&rsquo; she asks me where he is, an&rsquo; I
  says I don&rsquo;t know, an&rsquo; dat I don&rsquo;t know where to find him;
  dat he went out just before I sent fer her, an&rsquo; dat he says he won&rsquo;t
  be back till late to-night, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s wot makes me sure he&rsquo;s
  goin&rsquo; to do it. Sure, I was cryin&rsquo; good an&rsquo; hard den&mdash;savvy?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I says he&rsquo;s a good boy, an&rsquo; if I tells de police
  dat&rsquo;ll finish him; an&rsquo; I says I&rsquo;m sick an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t
  walk, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t go down dere myself, an&rsquo; dat she&rsquo;s
  de only one I dares trust, an&rsquo; besides dat she&rsquo;s got a lot of
  influence wid de boy, an&rsquo; dat I knows she can persuade him not to fall
  fer it, an&rsquo; den nobody&rsquo;ll know anything about it. An&rsquo; she
  says: &lsquo;Yes, of course&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do anything. But where is he?
  Where can I find him?&rsquo; An&rsquo; I says dere ain&rsquo;t only one place
  I knows, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s down to Kegler&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; dat he&rsquo;ll
  be all alone dere, an&rsquo; dat if she gets dere before ten o&rsquo;clock
  she&rsquo;ll be in time to try an&rsquo; stop him. An&rsquo; she bends over
  me, an&rsquo; pats me hands, she does, an&rsquo; she says: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
  youse worry, Mrs. Cox,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo; An&rsquo; I
  says: &lsquo;An&rsquo; youse won&rsquo;t tell nobody, nor take nobody down
  dere, so&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;d know about me little lad&rsquo;s disgrace?&rsquo; An&rsquo; she
  says: &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go alone; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure I can promise
  youse it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rsquo; An&rsquo; den she goes away. Dat&rsquo;s
  all!&rdquo; Shaky Liz was fumbling with the bodice of her dress again, and
  suddenly pulled out a black, square-faced bottle. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; she
  announced with a cackle. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I guess I gotta right to dis if
  I wants it&mdash;ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse can bet yer life youse have!&rdquo; agreed Gypsy Joe with fervent
  heartiness&mdash;and reached for the bottle.</p>
  <p>In a flash the Cherub was up from the bed, and between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nix on dat, Gypsy!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Shaky&rsquo;s end
  is all right, I guess; but <i>we</i> ain&rsquo;t through yet. Nix on dat&mdash;get
  me!&rdquo; He stepped closer to both Clarkie Munn and Gypsy Joe. &ldquo;Now,
  den,&rdquo; he said briskly, &ldquo;since we&rsquo;re satisfied wid Shaky,
  we&rsquo;ll get down to tacks&mdash;eh? Everybody makes sure dey knows dere
  own play, an&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t make no renigs. I goes down dere, an&rsquo; youse
  two are trailin&rsquo; out of sight behind, an&rsquo; she buttonholes me,
  an&rsquo; I gets her inside widout youse if I can, but anyway we gets her
  inside widout any noise, an&rsquo; de trap-door where dey shoots de sweepings
  from de warehouse into de water under de dock does de trick. If dere&rsquo;s
  enough weight on her she&rsquo;ll be dere forever. An&rsquo; dere&rsquo;s
  one thing more. Nix on de easy-fingered stuff wid any safe business, or anything
  loose lying around dat looks like meat! Savvy? To-morrow morning de place
  looks like it did when dey left it to-night. De girl&rsquo;s disappeared,
  dat&rsquo;s all&mdash;an&rsquo; dere&rsquo;s nothing to show dat Kegler&rsquo;s
  dock had anything to do wid it. Get me? Dey&rsquo;ll never find her, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s
  wot&rsquo;s wanted, an&rsquo; why we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; two hundred apiece
  more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gypsy Joe removed the cigarette from his mouth, watched the blue spiral
  of smoke from its tip curl upward for a moment, and pursed his lips in a
  ruminative pucker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder wot de Rat had it in fer her fer as hard as dat?&rdquo; he
  said, with a shrug of his shoulders. &ldquo;She must have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The&mdash;<i>Rat!</i> She&mdash;the <i>girl</i> they were talking about!
  The room seemed suddenly to swirl before Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes, the figures
  inside to become but blurred, jerky objects&mdash;and then it was black around
  him. Automatically he was stepping backward with a catlike tread; automatically
  he was feeling his way along the black hallway. And then the cool evening
  air fanned his face, and he was in the street.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  Against Time</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane put his hand to his forehead, and brought it away wringing wet
  with great drops of sweat. It had come like a blow without warning upon him,
  staggering him for an instant with horror&mdash;and then his brain had cleared
  as if by magic. It was cruelly clear now.</p>
  <p>The girl that they meant to murder was&mdash;the Woman in Black. He had
  had no thought of that while they talked in there, not until Gypsy Joe had
  mentioned the Rat. And then it had seemed as though the pieces of a puzzle
  had been suddenly fitted together as by some unseen hand, and bare to his
  brain, naked, an ugly picture stood out in hideous perspective. He knew too
  well that the Rat had an incentive for getting rid of her. And he knew why.
  And it was <i>she</i> who had telephoned him, Billy Kane, to watch Gypsy
  Joe and Clarkie Munn to-night. Who else would know of anything afoot concerning
  those two except the &ldquo;she&rdquo; to whom Shaky Liz had told her damnable
  Judas story?</p>
  <p>And he saw now why, and understood her instructions to him to watch Clarkie
  and Gypsy Joe. If she failed in her efforts through moral persuasion to prevent
  the Cherub from committing what she believed was to be a robbery, she still,
  through him, Billy Kane, could look for the recovery of the cash, and still
  keep the young hound, that she believed in and was trying to save, out of
  the hands of the police, and do it with a clear conscience since she would
  be in a position to return the proceeds of the theft. And then, too, perhaps,
  there had entered into her calculations the element of self-protection. She
  expected the Cherub to go alone, but if by any chance his pals went too,
  those pals were Clarkie Munn and Gypsy Joe&mdash;and he, Billy Kane, in that
  case, would be on their heels. And he understood, too, why she had not been
  more explicit over the telephone. She had not actually anticipated trouble,
  and she had respected her promise to the old hag to keep the Cherub&rsquo;s
  name out of it.</p>
  <p>He was running now, making across town in the direction of the East River.
  He did not know where Kegler&rsquo;s dock or warehouse was, but Kegler was
  evidently a rather large dealer in sand, and any directory in the first drug
  store he passed would supply that information.</p>
  <p>His mind worked on&mdash;curiously self-explanatory of his own actions.
  It had seemed pure impulse at the time that had prompted him to retreat so
  precipitately from the tenement; but he realized now that it was his brain
  subconsciously, but logically, at work. He, as the Rat, could not call in
  the police to raid that room where the inmates would denounce him as the
  author and instigator of the very crime for which he demanded their arrest;
  and to have gone into the room alone himself and have attempted to hold them
  up at the point of his pistol, while it might have been spectacular and dramatic,
  would have been little less than the act of a fool. It was not so easy for
  one man to hold up three others, to say nothing of a woman who was quite
  as abandoned, and certainly as full of trickery, and cunning, and resource
  as her male companions. There would have been, then, only one other alternative&mdash;to
  have gone in there coolly as the Rat, and call off the game that he was supposed
  to have started. But he had already learned that they had no love for the
  Rat, even though he was their employer in the present instance, and that
  secretly they were asking for nothing better than just such a favorable chance
  as that would be to &ldquo;get&rdquo; him, and to get, too, the large amount
  of cash that they credited him with having on his person.</p>
  <p>His lips were tight, as he ran. He was conscious that he would not have
  hesitated to take the risk, to take any risk, if there had been no other
  way of saving her. But there was another way, a very much simpler, more common
  sense and natural a way; the way he was taking now. He had only to go to
  this Kegler&rsquo;s dock where she would be waiting for the Cherub, and warn
  her. That was all. He had ample time if he hurried, since <i>they</i> had
  not started yet.</p>
  <p>Time! Yes, he had time enough. Cool, deliberate reason reassured on that
  point, but the thought brought him a little panic-struck catch of breath.
  It might have been better, perhaps, if he had gone to the Bowery, or perhaps
  over into Lower Broadway, in the hope, say, of getting a taxi that would
  have saved him many minutes. He shook his head, and called himself a fool
  for allowing his mind to wander to inconsequent things. There were not many
  taxis hunting fares on the Bowery, and who ever heard of an empty taxi on
  Lower Broadway at this hour of night! And, besides, it was not half past
  nine yet, and she was not to be there until ten. And yet&mdash;time! He flirted
  the moisture from his forehead again, as, reaching a small drug store on
  a corner, he turned, and entered, and asked for the directory.</p>
  <p>He was out again in scarcely a minute. He had found Kegler&rsquo;s in the
  directory without difficulty, but not without certain new misgivings. Kegler&rsquo;s
  was much farther along the East River than, somehow, and entirely without
  reason, he had imagined it would be. He began to run again, and again that
  twinge of panic seized him. True, he had a start on the others; true, they
  had just as far to go as he had, but with the distance that he knew now there
  was to cover, and the limit that existed in the time in which to cover it,
  it became more than probable they would have arranged for some special means
  of conveyance, whereas he had none.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane dropped suddenly from a run into a slow, even nonchalant walk.
  A short distance ahead of him, a small, and apparently, an old and second-hand
  car was coughing and chugging laboriously at the curb in front of the lighted
  window of a little grocery store. A few steps more, and he saw that the car
  was empty. Billy Kane&rsquo;s lips broadened in a hard smile. It might be
  reprehensible to steal a car for a few hours; but, as between a car and a
  human life that he knew depended on him alone, he experienced no pangs of
  conscience. It was the way out!</p>
  <p>He edged over to the curb as he approached the machine, and, close to the
  car now, glanced around. In through the store window he could see a man,
  back turned, evidently the car&rsquo;s owner, leaning over the counter, talking
  to the proprietor of the store. Billy Kane, wary of attracting premature
  notice from the pedestrians here and there along the street, reached out
  calmly, opened the door without haste, and with a deliberate air of proprietorship
  slipped into the driver&rsquo;s seat&mdash;but in the next instant he had
  thrown in the gears, and the machine shot from the curb like a mad animal
  stung to frenzy.</p>
  <p>A yell went up behind him; there came to him the glimpse of a man&rsquo;s
  figure rushing wildly out through the store door into the street; and then
  another yell, that was echoed from different directions along the street.
  The car took the first corner on little better than two wheels. The yells
  died away behind. At the next intersecting street Billy Kane turned again,
  and thereafter for a few blocks zigzagged his course, until, satisfied that
  he had thrown any immediate pursuers off his track, he headed again over
  toward the East River.</p>
  <p>And now as he drove more quietly, confident that he need no longer fear
  the element of time, his mind harked back again to that scene in the old
  hag&rsquo;s room, and there came a puzzled frown furrowing his forehead,
  and a queer strained look into his face. It was not so clear after all! The
  picture in the large was there. The patient, cold-blooded winning of her
  confidence in order to lure her without suspicion or hesitation to her death
  was clear enough, as was also the hideous betrayal of that confidence, a
  betrayal that plumbed the depths of human infamy, and whose unscrupulous
  ingenuity and vile cunning was so typical of the Rat; but the details, examined
  more critically, seemed somehow foggy and obscured, and seemed to hint at
  something he did not quite understand. It was not that it was evidence of
  the Rat&rsquo;s return. That thought did not trouble him, for certainly he,
  of all others, who had so unceremoniously possessed himself of the Rat&rsquo;s
  den and all the Rat&rsquo;s belongings, should be the first to know of it
  if the other had put in an appearance again; and the fact that the plot had
  reached its consummation to-night he did not consider to have any bearing
  on that point either. Many of the Rat&rsquo;s plans, begun in the past, as
  he, Billy Kane, had only too good reason to know, had reached their climax
  since the Rat himself had been away. This was probably one of them. Certainly
  it had been begun more than two weeks ago, as both Shaky Liz and the Cherub
  had said, and that was before he, Billy Kane, had assumed the Rat&rsquo;s
  r&ocirc;le, and, therefore, quite logically it seemed, before the Rat had
  gone away. It was not that&mdash;once started, the unholy quartet to whom
  the Rat had entrusted his dirty work was quite capable of carrying it through
  to its detestable conclusion&mdash;but it seemed strange that, adventurous
  as the Rat was and much as he undoubtedly desired to get the Woman in Black
  out of his way, he would have dared to do this. What she held over the Rat&rsquo;s
  head, he, Billy Kane, did not know; but he knew the Rat was well aware that,
  in event of her disappearance, certain evidence would be forthcoming against
  him within twenty-four hours. That had been her protection, a protection
  with which she had appeared to be thoroughly satisfied, and she had taken
  occasion more than once to give that warning to him, Billy Kane, in the belief
  that she was warning the Rat himself. There seemed to be only one answer
  then to this move on the Rat&rsquo;s part. In some way, unknown to her, he
  must have come into possession of that evidence, or in some way have rendered
  abortive the means by which, in event of her disappearance, it would be brought
  to light.</p>
  <p>The car rattled and jangled along. It was a miserable contraption, seedy,
  and badly down at the heels, but so that its engine functioned he asked nothing
  better. He was near the river front now, and in the region of warehouses
  and buildings that, remote from the bridges and the regular trend of traffic,
  showed no lights at night, and where the streets were utterly deserted, and
  where occasionally he caught glimpses of the river itself like a silver thread
  under the moonlight. He ran still more slowly now, studying his location
  with all possible care. Kegler&rsquo;s dock, according to the directory,
  was still farther on, of course, but he realized that, well as he knew his
  New York, this was somewhat out of the ordinary radius, and that it would
  be all too easy to miss his way.</p>
  <p>He shook his head a little in perplexity. There was another thing&mdash;one
  of the little details. Shaky Liz, Gypsy Joe, Clarkie Munn and the Cherub
  were not in the ranks of the Crime Trust as Red Vallon, and the Cadger, and
  Vannet, for instance, were, and where the Rat might naturally be expected
  to work upon a basis of mutual trust. It seemed strange that the Rat, in
  executing a plan like this, would give, not one, but four outsiders a hold
  on him, for if their tongues were ever loosened it meant the death house
  in Sing Sing for the Rat to a certainty. Nor did the fact that they themselves
  were accomplices wholly justify this seeming lapse from cunning on the Rat&rsquo;s
  part. Accomplices before now had been known to turn State&rsquo;s evidence!
  It was queer! The Rat probably had a very good reason&mdash;only it seemed
  a little queer!</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shrugged his shoulders. Enough of that! He was peering out of
  the car now with growing anxiety, and with the realization forcing itself
  upon him that, if he had not actually lost his way, he at best had a very
  confused knowledge of his exact whereabouts. His lips tightened. It was growing
  late, too; it must be getting perilously near ten o&rsquo;clock. He had had
  no doubt but that, from the address in the directory, he could easily find
  the place, and he was still sure it was farther on; but the quarter here
  was outrageously dark, and a plethora of turnings, that seemed to be nothing
  more than private trafficways for various wharfs and warehouses, made an
  exceedingly nasty complication. He nosed the machine along, his face growing
  more set and anxious every moment. It was black here&mdash;black&mdash;nothing
  but a cursed blackness. If there were only someone about&mdash;someone from
  whom he could ask directions! But there was nothing, no one, only the black,
  looming shapes of buildings, and even these were becoming more scattered
  now; and the only signs of life were the whistles and churnings of passing
  craft on the river.</p>
  <p>The minutes passed. A sense of helplessness, of impotency, that brought
  a cold chill to his heart, was upon him now. Down here on the river front
  he was hopelessly lost. There was no light in the ramshackle car that he
  had appropriated&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t equipped with anything that even approached
  a modern device. He stopped the car, lighted a match, and looked at his watch.</p>
  <p><i>Ten minutes of ten!</i> </p>
  <p>Ten minutes! There were ten minutes left! He started the car again mechanically.
  There were ten minutes between her and a trap-door that opened into the silvery
  streak of water out there, whose shimmering now had lost its beauty and seemed
  like the hideous, insinuating, silky movement of some ghastly reptile. Ten
  minutes stood between her and that trap-door; and he, fool that he was, had
  lost his way! And yet he could hardly blame himself; the East River front
  at night was&mdash;but what did it matter whether he blamed himself or not!</p>
  <p>A low cry of bitter hurt came from his compressed lips. It wasn&rsquo;t
  only the Woman in Black! Her deadly peril now, the almost certainty of her
  death, brought him, in an overwhelming surge of anguish and fear the consciousness
  that it was the woman he loved. He remembered the abhorrence and contempt
  she held for him in those steadfast, fearless brown eyes of hers, and he
  loved her for that abhorrence and contempt. It seemed to typify her, as somehow
  she seemed to typify a purity and a courage that was soul deep&mdash;for
  that contempt and abhorrence was for the man whom she believed to be the
  Rat, who in turn typified the dregs and lees of all that was vile. But he,
  Billy Kane, was not the Rat, and some day, as he was conscious now, he had
  hoped to stand before her in his own person, and with his own name cleared.
  His hands gripped on the steering wheel until it seemed as though the taut-drawn
  skin would burst over the knuckles. He remembered the poise of that dainty
  head, the curve of the full, white, rounded throat, and he saw her now in&mdash; No!
  He would not let his brain complete that thought. It would drive him mad.
  He was already in a state bordering on frenzy, almost out of self-control.
  Ten minutes! There could be very few of those ten minutes left now!</p>
  <p>A cry came from him again, but this time one of sudden hope. To his right,
  from a large building at the head of one of those trafficways that led to
  the river bank itself, he caught sight of a lighted window. In an instant
  the machine was tearing forward in that direction; and in a minute more he
  had leaped out, and was pounding frantically with his fists at the door of
  the building. This wasn&rsquo;t Kegler&rsquo;s, he knew that; but here was
  some sign of life at last in the deserted neighborhood.</p>
  <p>A step sounded from within. It seemed to drag. It seemed as though it were
  covering some interminable distance inside there. And then the door opened,
  and an old, decrepit man, who perhaps held down a sort of pensioned night
  watchman&rsquo;s job, a lantern in hand, stuck out his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my way,&rdquo; said Billy Kane quickly. &ldquo;Can
  you tell me where Kegler&rsquo;s place is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean the sand docks?&rdquo; inquired the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>The man stepped out from the doorway, and pointed back along the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it over there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The one beyond
  our wharf down here.&rdquo; He glanced at the car. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t
  get through here with that car because this bit of road don&rsquo;t connect&mdash;see?
  You&rsquo;ll have to go back a bit the way you came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane held his watch under the lantern&rsquo;s light. There were neither
  the five, nor the four, nor the three minutes that he had dared hope might
  still remain. It was already after ten o&rsquo;clock!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I get down from here on foot&mdash;it&rsquo;s shorter this way,
  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Billy Kane between closed teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, you can,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t
  find no one there. They was expecting some barges in, but they haven&rsquo;t
  come yet, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane had already swung away from the other, and was making for the
  river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; he called out over his shoulder, as he ran. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  leave the car here till I get back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He heard some reply from the other, but he could not make out the words.
  Whatever they were, they were inconsequent now. He, Billy Kane, unless by
  some miracle, was too late to warn her&mdash;and too late perhaps even to
  save her. He knew fear now as he had never known it before, but it was not
  fear for himself. And he knew a passion that seemed to find its roots in
  the very soul of him. If he was too late&mdash;at least there would be a
  reckoning, come what might! His lips twitched in a queer, distorted smile.
  It was strange! This fear and this passion, though they were supreme within
  him, seemed curiously under control, and he was abnormally cool and calm
  now, and his brain, as though lashed into virility by some powerful stimulant,
  was working swiftly, incisively, leaping in flashes from premises to conclusions.</p>
  <p>It was certain that they were already there, but there was still a chance
  that they had not yet had time to do her any harm. And it must be his wits,
  not blundering force, that would be its own undoing, that must turn that
  chance to account. He must play the Rat now in exactly the same way as, when
  back there in the tenement, the thought had flashed across his mind that
  he might have played it in the old hag&rsquo;s room. The chances of success,
  it was true, were a hundredfold slimmer now than they would have been then;
  but now it was forced upon him as the only way, and then it had seemed an
  unnecessary and uncalled-for risk to take. It was the one way now. It might
  fail, but it would gain him access inside that dark, looming building across
  the open stretch of brick-and-sand-strewn yard where he was running now;
  and once inside, if it were not already too late, there must be some way
  out for her. And if it were too late&mdash;well then, the Cherub, and Gypsy
  Joe, and Clarkie Munn would not have to press the Rat for payment for their
  work!</p>
  <p>Again the distorted smile flickered on his lips. He had his bearings now,
  both literally and mentally. He ran without caution, making almost unnecessary
  noise, and reached the door of the building; a building that, he could discern
  now, made the shore end of a long dock, and which, according to the old watchman&rsquo;s
  directions, was obviously Kegler&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>The building was in utter and complete darkness. He dismissed the possibility
  that she was still anywhere without, still waiting for the Cherub&rsquo;s
  arrival, as too improbable to warrant the waste of even a second, and making
  still more noise at the door now, he tried it, found it unlocked, pushed
  it open, stepped inside and closed it behind him. A quick, startled exclamation,
  from a long way off, it seemed, reached him, and then a sibilant whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clarkie&mdash;Gypsy!&rdquo; Billy Kane called softly. &ldquo;Are
  you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gawd!&rdquo; a voice ejaculated hoarsely.</p>
  <p>A light went on somewhere over Billy Kane&rsquo;s head. He was in a short
  passage that was flanked on either side by what were evidently the business
  offices of the concern, and at the end of this passage now a door was suddenly
  swung open. Gypsy Joe was standing in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Rat!&rdquo; he exclaimed in heavy amazement, and mechanically
  fell back as Billy Kane advanced.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  The Old Warehouse</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes were apparently blinking in the abrupt transition
  from darkness to the glare of light; but with the knowledge that it might
  literally mean the difference between life and death to him&mdash;and her&mdash;no
  single detail of his surroundings was escaping him. The door ahead of him,
  a heavy, cumbersome affair, opened inwards toward him, and was now swung
  full back against the wall, but if the evidence of that iron loop on the
  door jamb could be trusted, the door was equipped with a massive bolt. Gypsy
  Joe was still to a large extent blocking the doorway, but he could see that
  the huge, lighted space beyond was a sort of storage warehouse, windowless,
  of course, or else he would have seen a light from outside. And the switches,
  the electric-light switches&mdash;the one for the bulb over his head in this
  passage here, and the one for the light in that room ahead of him! They were
  vital too! He could not see any in the position where he might naturally
  expect to find them&mdash;by the door where Gypsy Joe stood. He glanced back
  over his shoulder. Yes, there was one there at the side of the front door,
  a switch for the passage light undoubtedly; but Gypsy Joe had certainly not
  used that one, so there must be another then, as well, inside the storage
  room.</p>
  <p>He had been perhaps the matter of a bare few seconds in traversing the length
  of the passage, and now as he stepped across the threshold into the warehouse
  itself, the Cherub and Clarkie Munn had joined Gypsy Joe, and were staring
  at him with scowling, startled, uncertain faces&mdash;but Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  eyes were not on the three men. The blood seemed to leap through his veins
  in a great surging tide, and upon him was the sense of a mighty uplift. It
  was not too late! It was not too late! His brain seemed to seize upon those
  words and reiterate them in a sing-song way. A woman&rsquo;s form lay upon
  the floor, and she was bound and gagged; but dark eyes met his, and in the
  eyes was a softer light than he had ever seen there before when they had
  been fixed on him. &ldquo;For once,&rdquo; they seemed to say, &ldquo;you
  have not failed. I told you to watch Gypsy Joe and Clarkie Munn, and you
  are just in time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Cherub laughed suddenly and a little noisily, as from unstrung nerves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, youse gave us a jolt!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s de
  idea? I suppose youse came along to make sure dat we earned yer money, eh,
  an&rsquo; dat dere wouldn&rsquo;t be no fluke about her bein&rsquo; bumped
  off fer keeps? Well, if youse had been about a minute an&rsquo; a half later
  youse&rsquo;d have missed de trap-door scene, &rsquo;cause it&rsquo;d have
  been all over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes had met the girl&rsquo;s again. The soft light in
  them had gone, and in its place had come a horror, and sudden accusation,
  and a bitter misery; and her face, already deathly white as she lay there,
  seemed now to tinge with gray.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shook his head in response to the Cherub, as he turned and faced
  the three men. They were edging a little closer to him. He caught a surreptitious
  nudge that passed between Gypsy Joe and Clarkie Munn. He moved back a step&mdash;but
  it was a step that brought him nearer to the girl. If he could hold them
  in a state of puzzled suspense with its consequent indecision for a moment,
  that was all he asked. And he was counting on a sort of frank audaciousness
  for that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted the Cherub, a sudden, curious silkiness in
  his tones. &ldquo;Did I call de turn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s come down to pay us off,&rdquo; suggested Gypsy
  Joe smoothly. &ldquo;Dere&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; slow about de Rat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Billy Kane quietly. He took his
  knife from his pocket, and coolly opened it; then nonchalantly, but with
  a swift, lithe movement, stooped and cut the cords that bound the girl&rsquo;s
  wrists. He pressed the knife into her hand&mdash;she needed no further hint
  that she could free her own ankles&mdash;and, as he straightened up again,
  his eyes swept the wall by the door. Yes, they were there&mdash;two electric-light
  switches. He faced the trio again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, wot do youse know about dat!&rdquo; observed Clarkie Munn,
  with an unpleasant grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Clarkie,&rdquo; Billy Kane lied calmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  leery that somebody&rsquo;s split, and I&rsquo;m afraid the police know too
  much. Understand? I&rsquo;m not taking any chances, and the game&rsquo;s
  off&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Cherub&rsquo;s bland, blue eyes seemed to shade a darker hue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all right, den,&rdquo; said the Cherub sweetly. &ldquo;But
  wot about us? Mabbe youse can call de game off if youse likes, &rsquo;cause
  it&rsquo;s yer game, but where does we come in? &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t our fault
  de job&rsquo;s crimped&mdash;dat&rsquo;s up to youse. Does we get paid or
  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de talk, Cherub!&rdquo; applauded Clarkie Munn, an undisguised
  snarl in his voice.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who said you wouldn&rsquo;t get paid?&rdquo; he demanded roughly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
  attend to that when we get out of here. Do you want to hang around and get
  pinched?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Cherub, and smiled. &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t
  want to get pinched&mdash;an&rsquo; we ain&rsquo;t worryin&rsquo; none about
  it either, not about gettin&rsquo; pinched down here. It&rsquo;s a cinch
  youse wouldn&rsquo;t have risked comin&rsquo; here if de bulls had been followin&rsquo; a
  yard behind. We knows youse too well fer dat, Bundy! Get me? An&rsquo; youse
  ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; across when youse gets out of here, youse are comin&rsquo; across
  right now! An&rsquo; youse&rdquo;&mdash;he whirled suddenly on the girl,
  who had risen to her feet and was backing toward the door&mdash;&ldquo;youse
  stand where youse are! I ain&rsquo;t sure we are through wid youse yet, no
  matter wot Bundy says&mdash;see?&rdquo; He jerked his head at his two companions,
  though his eyes never for an instant left Billy Kane&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Wot
  about it, fellers? If she gets out of here she knows too much, an&rsquo; we
  got to fade away outer New York anyway, whether de bulls are on now or not.
  An&rsquo; dat takes de coin&mdash;all de coin we can get. Well, de Rat always
  carries a wad, but if we pinches it an&rsquo; lets de Rat loose afterwards
  he&rsquo;s got a bunch behind him dat&rsquo;ll nose us out where de bulls
  couldn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll get ours. Dat&rsquo;s de size of it.
  Do we play fer table stakes, or hedge de bets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was coming now, as Billy Kane had known inevitably that it would come.
  There was no answer needed from either Clarkie Munn or Gypsy Joe. It was
  written in the ugly menace in their faces, and had been from the moment they
  had recovered their startled surprise at his entry into the place.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane flung a quick glance around him. The girl was a little behind
  him, close to those electric-light switches, her way clear to the front door,
  save for the peril of that lighted passage down which she must run. In front
  of him, just out of arm&rsquo;s reach, the Cherub&rsquo;s bland eyes smiled
  into his with a sort of hideous serenity; while over the Cherub&rsquo;s shoulders,
  one on each side, showed the vicious faces of the other two&mdash;and, under
  cover of the Cherub&rsquo;s body, Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s hand seemed to be
  stealing in the direction of his hip pocket.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane seemed suddenly to go to pieces and to lose his nerve. His tongue
  circled his lips with nervous repetition. He put out his hands in an imploring
  attitude, and stumbled a step forward toward the Cherub, and caught a glint
  of light on a revolver barrel in Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s hand, as it came stealing
  now from the latter&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;wait a minute, Cherub!&rdquo; Billy Kane whispered thickly,
  and licked at his lips again, and stumbled forward another step. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he
  whispered&mdash;and then, swift as the winking of an eye, Billy Kane flung
  his body forward with all his weight upon the Cherub, hurling the Cherub
  back upon Clarkie Munn, and whirling, whipped a lightning left full into
  Gypsy Joe&rsquo;s face on the other side. There was a flash, the deafening
  roar of a report, as the Cherub reeled into Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s revolver;
  then a scream of agony, and the Cherub, grasping at his leg with both hands,
  went to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The switches there&mdash;beside you!&rdquo; Billy Kane shouted at
  the girl. &ldquo;Put out the lights&mdash;both switches! Quick! Run for it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gypsy Joe, recovering his balance, and with a bellow like a maddened bull
  was charging forward; Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s hand had swung upward again&mdash;and
  then the place was in darkness. A second late, Clarkie Munn&rsquo;s revolver
  cut a vicious flame-tongue through the black, but Billy Kane had flattened
  himself out on the floor, and was wriggling rapidly backward toward the door
  and the now dark passageway.</p>
  <p>There was a moan, then a shrill scream in the Cherub&rsquo;s voice, and
  coincidentally a torrent of blasphemy from Gypsy Joe, as the latter, quite
  obviously, in his rush and in the blackness now, had stumbled none too gently
  into the wounded man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse fool! Curse youse, youse fool!&rdquo; shrieked the Cherub. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
  youse got a pocket torch? Ain&rsquo;t either of youse got a torch? Flash
  a torch on him, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was across the threshold now; and now, rising to his knees, he
  groped out for the edge of the door, found it, and, as he slammed it shut,
  it seemed to cut in two, as a knife might cut it, the sudden, white, piercing
  ray of a flashlight that leaped out from the interior of the warehouse. And
  then in another second he had shot the bolt home in its grooves, and, in
  the darkness, leaning heavily for an instant against the door to recover
  himself, he stared down the black passage for the girl, and could see nothing.</p>
  <p>There came an abortive rush against the door; snarls and oaths came muffled
  from within. He moved a step forward along the passage. They were a negligible
  quantity in there now. The door would hold, and when they succeeded in getting
  out and making their way along the side of the dock perhaps, they would be
  more concerned in getting to cover themselves than anything else; and besides
  they would have a wounded man to hamper their movements. It was she now,
  the Woman in Black, that concerned him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he called quickly. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A draft of air touched his face. The front door at the farther end of the
  passage was being opened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am here, Bundy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was her voice, but there was something of cold, merciless forbidding
  in it. He halted instinctively. He did not quite understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bundy, are you listening?&rdquo; came the level tones again. &ldquo;This
  is the end, absolutely and finally the end to-night. You have saved my life,
  but I owe you no thanks for that. You saved it, after hiring thugs to take
  it, you thing of loathing, because you dared do nothing else, since you say
  you believe the police got wind enough of this thing tonight to scare you
  off. Very well, Bundy&mdash;but there is more, isn&rsquo;t there, that the
  police do not know? Well, they will know it, and certain secrets in that
  den of yours, the moment I can reach them. I have warned you often enough.
  I am through, Bundy, this is the end of the Rat to-night, nothing shall stop
  that&mdash;but I am still a fool. I am still giving you warning of what I
  mean to do now. I am still giving you a chance to save yourself if you can;
  the rather slim chance that the police will not be able to run the man who
  was known as the Rat to earth! And I am giving you that chance because&mdash;well
  because, even in spite of yourself, I am still alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You do not understand. Wait!&rdquo; He
  was groping down the black passage, as he heard the front door shut quickly,
  and heard a footstep running, receding, outside. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he cried
  again. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, wait!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer. He knew there would be none. He had heard her running
  away out there, hadn&rsquo;t he? He reached the door, and looked out&mdash;and
  hung there hesitant&mdash;and called again&mdash;and there was no answer.
  He listened. He could not hear her footsteps any more. There was no sound
  from anywhere, not even from that warehouse door behind him. They weren&rsquo;t
  hammering on that any more.</p>
  <p>And then Billy Kane laughed in a short, bitter, mirthless way, and started,
  running at top speed, in the direction in which he had left his purloined
  and dilapidated car. The end! The end of the Rat! He laughed again in the
  same bitter mirth, as he ran. It was the end of more than that! It was the
  end of hope&mdash;of her&mdash;of that love that had come to him upon the
  thresholds of these strange doors of the night. It was the end of Billy Kane!
  And whether as the Rat now, or as Billy Kane, the police would be equally
  hard upon his trail. He stood in far worse case now than on the night of
  David Ellsworth&rsquo;s murder, for now the underworld, that would be combed
  for the Rat, and where the Rat was too well known to have it offer the slightest
  hope of escaping detection, was closed to him as a refuge. He knew what she
  meant to do&mdash;to tell her story to the police, to expose all the criminal
  acts and affiliations of the bona fide Rat, and to lead them to the Rat&rsquo;s
  den, and expose the secrets that she had so often hinted were hidden there.</p>
  <p>He clenched his hands as he ran. The end! No! Not yet! Not until they had
  him, and they had not got him yet! He did not know which way to turn; but
  while he still had his freedom there was still the hope of running down the
  murderer of David Ellsworth&mdash;and there were the proceeds of that robbery
  now, most of them, in the Rat&rsquo;s den. That was what seemed to stand
  out as immediately vital now&mdash;to get those things&mdash;that money and
  those rubies. He had staked everything on the hope that some day he could
  hand over to justice both the proceeds of that crime and the murderer as
  well&mdash;hand them over <i>together</i>, as a complete vindication of his
  own name&mdash;and even now, in this hour that seemed blackest of all, he
  still dared to cling to that hope. He knew who the murderer was, and he had
  already recovered a large share of what had been stolen. He still hoped to
  find the murderer, and he still hoped to find the remainder of those rubies,
  and so carry out his original plan. His jaws locked. His mind was made up.
  He would go! And, yes, he had far better than an even chance of getting there
  in time. She would take longer to reach the police and lead them to the den
  than it would take him to reach it&mdash;thanks to the car that, grim irony!
  he had stolen on her account. Afterward his position would be desperate enough;
  but now, without an instant&rsquo;s loss of time, he had to gain the den
  and get away again before they trapped him there.</p>
  <p>He reached the car. The old night watchman had evidently retired inside
  the building again, for there was no sign of the man. He experienced a certain
  sense of relief at this, as he cranked the obsolete machine; and then he
  was in the driver&rsquo;s seat again, and the car was roaring along the road.
  He drove fast, with mad haste, with reckless disregard for the ill-lighted
  road. There could be no accident comparable in disaster to his failure to
  put the miles behind him swiftly enough to insure him the few minutes leeway
  he asked for in the den.</p>
  <p>He bent over the wheel, tense, rigid, strained. The minutes sped away. A
  glimmer of hope came to him for that &ldquo;afterward.&rdquo; He could use
  the car again; get out of the city again before the chase got too hot. He
  could certainly hide in that way during the night, and that would give him
  the night in which to think. He had not time to think now&mdash;only that
  as he drew in toward the centre of the city he must keep as much as possible
  to the unfrequented streets, both because he must ignore such a thing as
  speed laws, and because he was driving a stolen car.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  The Last Portal</h2>
  <p>Billy Kane had no means of knowing how long he had been, when he finally
  leaped from the car at the corner of the lane on the street at the rear of
  the den. He knew only that, beyond any question of doubt or uncertainty,
  he had outdistanced her. With a quick glance around him to make sure that
  he was not observed, he slipped into the lane; and in an instant more, through
  the shed, and the underground tunnel, and the secret door that so craftily
  opened on the board joints of the rough panelling, he had gained the interior
  of the den. He ran across it, turned on the dangling incandescent over the
  rickety table, and running to the street door made sure that it was locked.</p>
  <p>He turned then, pushed the bed aside, and pulled up the plank in the flooring
  that he had loosened once in his search for the secret hiding places of the
  room, and that had since served him in that capacity as a private depository
  of his own. From the aperture he lifted out the hand bag containing the banknotes
  stolen from the Ellsworth vault, and the red flannel sack containing the
  rubies, which he had torn from around the neck of the Man with the Crutch
  last night, replaced the plank, set the bed back in its original position,
  and carried the hand bag and sack to the table. He opened the bag, tossed
  in the red flannel sack&mdash;and stood for an instant eyeing the bag with
  a frown of distrust. He remembered that it did not close very well, that
  he had bent the catches with his steel jimmy that night when he had forced
  the bag open in the room of the Man with the Crutch, and that it was now
  quite liable to gape apart without warning&mdash;in which case, should the
  contents be seen by anyone, and they could not help but be seen if such an
  accident should occur in the presence of anyone within eyeshot, it would
  be likely to prove, not only awkward, but disastrous for the possessor of
  the bag. His frown cleared. There was still room in the bag for, say, a shirt;
  and, than a shirt there was nothing better to disguise the contents underneath.</p>
  <p>He walked over to the old bureau, that was flanked on one side by the secret
  door to the den, and on the other by the cretonne hanging that, stretched
  diagonally across the corner of the room, served the Rat as a wardrobe. There
  was the shirt that he had worn on the night when he had first come here,
  the night he had been wounded by the police. Whitie Jack had washed the blood
  stains out, and had shoved it in the top bureau drawer.</p>
  <p>He pulled the drawer open, bent over it, reached in for the shirt, straightened
  up&mdash;and the shirt dropped from his fingers. He did not move. Something
  cold, and round, and hard was pressed none too gently against the nape of
  his neck. His eyes had lifted to the mirror in front of him mechanically,
  and he stood there staring into it now like a man dazed and numbed. An arm
  was stretched out from behind the cretonne curtains, and a hand held a revolver
  against his head. It was like some uncanny moving picture that he was watching.
  For now the cretonne hanging moved; and now a figure moved out from behind
  the hanging, and stood behind him, Billy Kane, and stared, too, into the
  mirror, over his, Billy Kane&rsquo;s, shoulder. There were two faces in the
  glass now, two faces that in form and features seemed identical&mdash;or
  else it was some strange mirage that caused a double reflection of his own
  face. And then one of the faces smiled malevolently, leeringly. It wasn&rsquo;t
  his own face that smiled. He wasn&rsquo;t smiling&mdash;though his lips moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Rat!&rdquo; he said, below his breath.</p>
  <p>He felt a hand slip into his pocket, and remove his automatic. And then
  the other spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remarkable resemblance, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;Billy Kane? And the
  recognition appears to be mutual&mdash;Billy Kane! I&rsquo;ve been waiting
  here quite a while for you this evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane did not answer. The Rat! The Rat was back! It was the moment,
  arrived at last, that had haunted him from the moment he had taken upon himself
  the other&rsquo;s personality here in the underworld; but though he was more
  at the other&rsquo;s mercy with that revolver muzzle boring into his neck,
  more helpless than he had thought to be when this time should arrive, more
  powerless where, instead, he had told himself a hundred times that at the
  worst it could be but a fight man to man, he found himself far more unmoved
  now than he had anticipated he would be. He found himself curiously composed.
  There seemed even a grim, sardonic humor stirring in his soul. What did it
  matter now? To-night he had no further use for the Rat&rsquo;s mantle&mdash;she
  had seen to that by now. To-night the whole house of cards had toppled anyway,
  and the ultimate worst had happened, save only that the police had not yet
  got their steel bracelets around his wrists. And yet there was a significance
  in the cold menace of the other&rsquo;s tone, and a still deeper significance,
  that he did not like, in the other&rsquo;s ostentatious repetition of his,
  Billy Kane&rsquo;s, name. It was obvious that Billy Kane was no stranger
  to the Rat!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get back to that table, and sit down there!&rdquo; ordered the Rat
  curtly.</p>
  <p>Billy Kane, because he had no choice, obeyed. It was like some weird, extravagant
  hallucination of the brain. He was looking up from his chair into what seemed
  to be his own face&mdash;only as he studied it now, fascinated by it, he
  saw what no mirror had ever shown him was a part of his own identity. The
  face was a little older, a little more drawn, and there was an expression
  in the eyes, a smoldering something, a devil&rsquo;s malignity that burned
  out through the half-closed lids, leaving the pupils like fever spots behind.
  And he remembered now that she had commented upon the freshness of his face
  on that first night when they had met.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; sneered the Rat suddenly. &ldquo;So you played the
  Rat, did you? And did you think I didn&rsquo;t know? Well, you seem to have
  liked it&mdash;Billy Kane&mdash;and so I guess you&rsquo;d better finish
  out the act, and play it until the end. You can manage that, can&rsquo;t
  you&mdash;say, for another ten minutes&mdash;until the Rat is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s hands tightened on the table edge. It was not only the
  words, it was the eyes, and the face that were working now, that seemed to
  possess some deadly eloquence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Billy Kane steadied his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to tell you,&rdquo; said the Rat roughly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  been here long enough to know that apart from the old cobbler and his wife
  upstairs, who mind their own business and are always deaf when they don&rsquo;t
  want to hear, this place is sound-proof to revolver shots. Well, the game
  is up to-night. Your game&mdash;and my game! I&rsquo;ve got one or two little
  things to do here, and then I&rsquo;m going; but I&rsquo;m going to leave
  the Rat behind&mdash;dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s fingers began to drum a light tattoo on the table. It
  was strange that he could force his fingers to do that with an air of such
  apparent unconcern. He was laboring under no delusions. He was fully conscious
  that there was no bluff in the other&rsquo;s words, that he was actually
  sitting there and facing death in the most literal sense of the term. The
  Rat&rsquo;s reputation was quite enough in itself to make it certain that
  the man would not hesitate in putting his threat into execution. And then,
  besides, there were strange stirrings in his mind now that were not comforting
  things. The Rat, cognizant of it all the time, had deliberately let him,
  Billy Kane, play the role&mdash;and the drama was to end with the Rat&rsquo;s
  death. It seemed horribly logical. It would let the Rat out of <i>her</i> clutches
  to-night, for instance, and leave only a dead Rat as prey for the police.
  He started involuntarily. Was that it? His fingers stopped their movements.
  Suppose he warned the Rat that the police were coming now? No! That would
  only cause the Rat to hurry&mdash;and to shoot the sooner. Well then, suppose
  the police found <i>two</i> Rats here? It would not save Billy Kane, but
  it would end the career of one of the most infamous scoundrels in the United
  States&mdash;and it would pay his debt to her! If he could only stave the
  man off a little, fence for time!</p>
  <p>He could have laughed out wildly at the mocking irony of it. He was praying
  now for the police to come! She would lead them, or some of them, through
  that secret door, wouldn&rsquo;t she?&mdash;though they would guard both
  doors, take no chances, even while they would hardly expect to find anyone
  here. The Rat was standing with his back to the secret door, and Billy Kane&rsquo;s
  eyes swept past the other now in a well-simulated vacant, wavering way&mdash;and
  fell again upon the Rat.</p>
  <p>The man was leaning a little farther over the table now, his lips parted
  in a vicious smile. It was as though, innate in the other, was an unholy
  joy to be derived from a victim&rsquo;s plight, a joy that he sought to augment
  by making his victim writhe the more if he could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so you played the Rat, did you?&rdquo; The Rat was sneering again. &ldquo;Well,
  you found out a lot more than was good for you, didn&rsquo;t you? There was
  a woman, wasn&rsquo;t there? Maybe she didn&rsquo;t introduce herself because
  she thought you knew her well enough; but maybe you&rsquo;re entitled to
  know something about her, because she&rsquo;s one of the reasons why you&rsquo;re
  going to snuff out in a few minutes.&rdquo; His voice rose suddenly in a
  furious burst of blasphemy. &ldquo;Blast her!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;She
  went too far! She thought she could make me dance every time she cracked
  her little whip, did she? She&rsquo;ll wish now, if there&rsquo;s any wishing
  where she&rsquo;s gone, that she&rsquo;d stayed up on the Avenue with the
  rest of the swells where she belongs, and left her infernal, nosey charities
  on the East Side alone. Margaret Blaine&mdash;the banker&rsquo;s daughter!
  Ha, ha! She had it in for me because a girl she was interested in down here
  went and jumped in the river. See? She swore she&rsquo;d put me through one
  way or another for that. And then she stumbled on a pal of mine the night
  he croaked off, and found some papers on him that put me to the bad for fair.
  And that wised her up to a lot more. And then, curse her, she tumbled to
  the game here, and&mdash;well, I guess you know the hand she played.&rdquo; He
  laughed raucously. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d ought to! But you needn&rsquo;t
  worry about it any more! She&rsquo;s gone out&mdash;Billy Kane&mdash;understand?
  She went out&mdash;for keeps&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes stole to the secret door again. He remembered the
  fascination with which he had watched it slowly open on the night he had
  lain there on the bed, and Karlin, in the hands of the police now, had sat
  at the bedside, and Red Vallon had been here at the table. And it seemed
  now as though the door moved again as it had moved that night. But he could
  not be sure. Perhaps it was his imagination that was father to the wish&mdash;and
  he dared not look steadily, or too long in that direction.</p>
  <p>He brushed his hand across his eyes. He understood well enough now why the
  Rat had been indifferent to what Shaky Liz, or the Cherub, or any of them,
  might hold over him&mdash;there would be no Rat, if he, Billy Kane, in the
  Rat&rsquo;s stead, were murdered. And the Rat believed, of course, that she&mdash;her
  name was Margaret&mdash;Margaret Blaine&mdash;that she was dead. But he,
  Billy Kane, was playing for time, wasn&rsquo;t he? And the Rat, in his hideous
  propensity for a cat-and-mouse game, seemed quite willing to talk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You killed her!&rdquo; Billy Kane&rsquo;s ejaculation was one of
  stunned incredulity. &ldquo;But&mdash;but she threatened me, when she thought
  I was you, by saying that if anything happened to her the evidence against
  you would be produced just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, she did!&rdquo; leered the Rat. &ldquo;In twenty-four hours
  after her disappearance. And it&rsquo;ll be twenty-four hours all right before
  they have any proof of that. It wasn&rsquo;t pulled off where a howl would
  go up ten minutes after she snuffed out! Sure, in twenty-four hours! Well,
  I&rsquo;m in no hurry, am I? In twenty-four <i>minutes</i> the Rat&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  you&mdash;won&rsquo;t need to care what busts loose! It&rsquo;ll save <i>me</i> a
  lot of trouble if they find the Rat sprawled out on the floor with a bullet
  through him, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door! Had it moved inward a bare fraction of an inch, as it had that
  other night? There would have been time by now, just time, for her and the
  police to have got here. Was that a widening crack along that panel there&mdash;or
  only a shadow flung with taunting malice by the murky light? No&mdash;it
  moved now! He was sure of it. It moved!</p>
  <p>He forced himself to laugh in a short, nervous way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that lets you out,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
  to become of you if the Rat&rsquo;s found dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Rat was moving back from the table to the side wall of the den.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said the Rat, with an ugly grin. &ldquo;And
  don&rsquo;t move&mdash;you understand? I&rsquo;m a dead shot, and I&rsquo;m
  not risking anything by being a few feet farther away. You&rsquo;d only go
  out a little sooner, and miss something that&rsquo;ll maybe sweeten your
  last moments&mdash;see?&rdquo; His revolver still covering Billy Kane, he
  raised his left hand and pressed against the wall. A small panel door swung
  outward. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in there!&rdquo; mocked the Rat. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  the secret she was forever talking about having discovered, and that&rsquo;s
  the place she looted all right, and where she got the dope about a lot of
  our plans, and kept me from wising up the crowd about it in order to save
  my own skin. But there&rsquo;s a thing or two she didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; His
  hand crept farther along the wall, and pressed suddenly against it again,
  and now a full board-length of the panelling slid away. Something metallic
  fell with a thud to the floor&mdash;and then Billy Kane was on his feet,
  clinging with a fierce, unconscious grip to the table.</p>
  <p>He had forgotten the police and that secret door at the far end of the room,
  forgotten the peril in which he stood, forgotten that ugly black muzzle of
  a revolver in the other&rsquo;s hand. His mind and brain seemed to be reeling.
  Some inhuman devil&rsquo;s trick was being played upon him. That was one
  of those iron crutch shafts, painted to resemble grained wood, that the Rat
  was picking up&mdash;yes, and fitting it now with deft, accustomed fingers
  to the armpiece! The Rat&mdash;the Man with the Crutch&mdash;the murderer
  of David Ellsworth&mdash;the man whose very r&ocirc;le he had taken upon
  himself and played!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried, and swayed at the table. And then passion seized
  him. &ldquo;You hound of hell!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;The Man
  with the Crutch&mdash;it was you who killed David Ellsworth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; The Rat&rsquo;s lips were thinned, merciless; the
  revolver edged forward. &ldquo;Well, what about it! Why don&rsquo;t you say
  Peters, too? You stuck your nose pretty deep into that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane mechanically sank back in his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got it, have you?&rdquo; jeered the Rat. &ldquo;Sure,
  the Man with the Crutch was me! And you, you fool, through your cursed interference
  with Red Vallon, put the police on my trail for Peters&rsquo; murder. Well,
  I&rsquo;m going to let you be the Man with the Crutch too&mdash;as well as
  the Rat. That&rsquo;ll let me out on both counts!&rdquo; He stood the crutch
  up against the wall, and from the opening drew forth some clothes and flung
  them down beside the crutch. &ldquo;Get the idea? This is the costume that
  goes with the crutch&mdash;sort of reserve stock. Understand? It wasn&rsquo;t
  always convenient to come here as the Rat, or leave here as the Man with
  the Crutch&mdash;or the other way around, if you like. I&rsquo;ll leave the
  stuff there where it&rsquo;ll show up, and the police can put two and two
  together the same as you have. And that answers your question as to what
  is to become of me. I am a gentleman of several parts, and I can spare <i>two</i> of
  them. What&rsquo;s left is none of your business, and anyway I&rsquo;m getting
  tired of this, and I&rsquo;m pretty near ready to go. But there&rsquo;s one
  thing more&mdash;there were some rubies you were looking for, weren&rsquo;t
  there, besides the ones you&rsquo;ve been taking charge of and so kindly
  placed in that bag there a few minutes ago without giving me the trouble
  of making you hand them over?&rdquo; Again his left hand, thrust back of
  him, sought the interior of the opening, and came out with a number of small
  plush trays piled one on top of another, the topmost flashing and scintillating
  now with its score of fiery, blood-red stones. &ldquo;You were looking for
  these, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; prodded the Rat, with a chuckle. &ldquo;Well,
  you had &rsquo;em here with you all the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane was fighting desperately for self-control. Could they hear outside
  there? The man was condemning himself out of his own mouth! God, could they <i>hear</i> out
  there&mdash;did they understand that this man had murdered David Ellsworth,
  and that Billy Kane was clear! He met the Rat&rsquo;s eyes with deliberate
  defiance now. More! Everything! The man must be led into telling everything&mdash;he
  had not told enough yet to make it sure&mdash;and perhaps they had not heard
  it all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Peters,&rdquo; he rasped out. &ldquo;You killed Peters, too&mdash;Peters,
  who helped you kill David Ellsworth! Weren&rsquo;t you satisfied with your
  share, that you had to steal his?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Rat had advanced to the table, and, setting down the trays, always with
  his revolver covering Billy Kane, had begun to pour the contents of one tray
  at a time into the open hand bag. He stopped now, and stared at Billy Kane
  in a sort of contemptuous surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way you doped it out, is it?&rdquo; he said,
  and laughed raucously. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re kind to Peters, aren&rsquo;t
  you? Peters, who wouldn&rsquo;t harm a fly! I killed Peters because his evidence
  at the inquest finished Billy Kane for fair, and I didn&rsquo;t want that
  evidence changed. It was <i>me</i> Peters saw coming down the back stairs
  and entering the library that night&mdash;only he thought it was you. Do
  you take me for a fool? I knew you&rsquo;d see the report in the papers,
  and that, knowing there was something wrong about Peters&rsquo; story, you&rsquo;d
  hunt Peters out and have a show-down, and that between you there was a chance
  of you getting at more of the truth than I wanted, and that Peters would
  then retract his evidence. Get me?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t for letting you out. I&rsquo;d been banking on you
  to do a lot for me. The only guy that was in with me on that deal was Jackson&mdash;and
  he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;just as the Rat is going to be. I spotted you long
  ago when you used to nose around here for that old fool who pitched his money
  away. I watched you quite a while before I was dead sure I could pass for
  you&mdash;and then I warmed up to Jackson. The rest was easy. We croaked
  old Ellsworth, and planted you. That gave me the coin I wanted to do what
  I was getting ready for&mdash;to pull out of this Rat&rsquo;s game forever.
  It was getting too fierce with that cursed woman on my heels. So before I
  pulled the Ellsworth trick, I set things going to get her too, and passed
  the word around that I was going away for a while, so&rsquo;s there&rsquo;d
  be no chance of her tumbling to anything&mdash;and I stood pat as the Man
  with the Crutch. And then you acted like a Christmas tree shaking itself
  in my lap. There were a lot of things coming along with certain friends of
  mine, and with you playing the Rat and getting away with it, and with you
  there to stand for it if anything broke wrong, it looked like a cinch to
  nose them out at the tape on the little deals I&rsquo;d started for them,
  and that would let me get away with the whole wad myself. See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Rat was pouring the rubies from the trays into the hand bag again, his
  eyes glinting with a curious rapacious craftiness; and then, coming to one
  of the trays whose corner had been cut off, he laughed outright in a sort
  of self-complacent mirth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember this?&rdquo; he taunted. &ldquo;The night I croaked
  old Ellsworth I beat it for here on the quiet the minute I left the house,
  and I put the trays and half of the stones into that hiding place there,
  and then I changed my clothes and wore my crutch over to where I lived when
  I wasn&rsquo;t at home here, and hid the rest of the stuff there. You know
  that, all right! Blast you, you got it, and you nearly queered me! The Rat
  was supposed to be away then&mdash;see? Well, that night when I was limping
  around with my crutch, I was told the Rat was back&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t
  take me long to find out your game. It looked like a piece of luck that was
  too good to be true! It suited me&mdash;I was for it hard. The only thing
  I was afraid of was that you might quit, so I left that ruby and the piece
  of tray for you on the table. I thought I knew you. It would give you a start,
  all right&mdash;but it would look as though this was where you were going
  to get the clue you needed, and you&rsquo;d stick for fair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Rat attempted to close the bag, and snarled at the bent catches. He
  finally fastened one of them partially, tossed the bag on the floor behind
  him, and, his face suddenly working again, flung his revolver arm out toward
  Billy Kane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got anything to say before you go out&mdash;say it!&rdquo; He
  was biting off his words. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that because I&rsquo;ve
  been talking a lot to you that I&rsquo;m bluffing. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
  opened up if I&rsquo;d been bluffing, would I? And, besides, there&rsquo;s
  another count on which you&rsquo;re due to snuff out. The game&rsquo;s up
  all around. I stalled on ringing down the curtain on the girl and on you
  as long as I thought there was a chance of my getting something out of those
  schemes that you kept butting in on. But you queered that, too, away back
  on the night you put Karlin in bad, and the police got him. Karlin&rsquo;s
  begun to weaken and talk a little. That&rsquo;s the finish of the gang, and
  any more pickings for me. Sooner or later Karlin&rsquo;ll spill everything
  he knows, and he knows a lot, to save himself; and then they&rsquo;ll be
  looking for the Rat on several other counts. So I passed the word to put
  the game with the girl through for to-night&mdash;while I took care of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Kane felt his face whiten. He knew that round, black muzzle would
  spit its tongue-flame in a moment. With the Rat&rsquo;s hand around it, it
  seemed curiously like the head of a snake that was coiled to strike. Had
  they heard out there? Here was the bag that contained everything, all that
  had been taken from David Ellsworth&rsquo;s vault, and here was the murderer,
  self-confessed. Had they heard? Had she heard? Would they remember, would <i>she</i> remember
  that Billy Kane&rsquo;s name was cleared? And if they were out there, why
  didn&rsquo;t they come in? Were they going to stand there and see him shot
  down&mdash;see another murder committed? No! He understood. The slightest
  sound from the direction of that secret door would be but the signal for
  the Rat to fire. It was up to him&mdash;somehow&mdash;some way&mdash;to give
  them a chance to act. It was up to him in some way to beat the Rat to that
  first shot, that would not be delayed many seconds now.</p>
  <p>He eyed the Rat for a moment steadily; appraised again the cold-blooded,
  callous implacability in the other&rsquo;s face&mdash;and then Billy Kane
  squared his shoulders, and his hands on the table slid back a little until
  the thumbs extended over the edge, and he laughed coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the limit, is it, Bundy?&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Well,
  then, I&rsquo;ll take it standing up, you cur, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Rat nodded indifferently.</p>
  <p>It seemed as though Billy Kane, for all his apparent coolness and composure,
  was not equal to his self-appointed task. He half rose to his feet, and sank
  back heavily in his chair again, and his hands, as though to steady himself,
  clutched with seemingly desperate energy farther over the table&rsquo;s edge&mdash;and
  then, in a flash, the table was in mid-air between the two men, and, as it
  hurtled forward, Billy Kane, crouched low, leaped for the other, as the Rat,
  with an oath, sprang to one side to avoid the table.</p>
  <p>A red flame blinded Billy Kane&rsquo;s eyes, an acrid smell filled his nostrils,
  and seemed to stifle him, and make his head swim dizzily, and his left side
  seemed curiously numb and dead, but his hands had reached their mark, and
  had closed like steel vises around the Rat&rsquo;s throat. And he hung there,
  hung there because a fury and a seething passion gave him superhuman strength&mdash;hung
  there as cries resounded through the room, and there came the rush of feet&mdash;hung
  there as he crashed downward to the floor dragging the Rat with him&mdash;hung
  there as an utter blackness came and settled upon him.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>It was strange and very curious. He opened his eyes. He was in bed, and
  someone was sitting there very quietly, with head bent over and resting on
  the back of his outstretched hand. He tried to remember. He should have been
  on the floor in the den, shouldn&rsquo;t he? And where was the Rat? Had they
  got the Rat? His eyes opened a little wider. That dark head there seemed
  strangely familiar. His side hurt him brutally. He remembered that shot now.
  A sort of grim humor came upon him. He was back where he had started from
  on that first night in the underworld&mdash;in bed with a pistol-shot wound.
  The Rat must have got him after all. But the Rat&mdash;the Rat! He started
  up in bed involuntarily.</p>
  <p>There came a little cry. The dark head was raised. It was the Woman in Black.
  No, that wasn&rsquo;t her name. It was Margaret&mdash;Margaret Blaine. He
  wanted to call her that. He tried to speak. He was very weak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t try to move,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You
  have been very badly hurt, though, thank God, not dangerously so. And it&rsquo;s
  all right&mdash;I know you want to know that. They&rsquo;ve got the Rat&mdash;for
  the murder of David Ellsworth. We heard it all last night, and did not dare
  to move while he kept that revolver on you, and I was mad with fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Billy Kane weakly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning now,
  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cool fingers closed his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden attempt
  at severity&mdash;and, as suddenly, her eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;Oh,
  I did not know last night&mdash;I did not understand&mdash;and you risked
  your life to save mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her life! He was not so weak but that he could understand that. His hand
  groped out for hers. It seemed as though he had always loved her&mdash;only
  those strange doors of the night had stood between. But now&mdash;now there
  was something in her eyes, behind that film of tears and those wet lashes,
  that made him dare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your life! Would you trust me with it again&mdash;for always?&rdquo; he
  whispered.</p>
  <p>Again the cool fingers closed his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Billy, you are to be absolutely quiet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Those
  are the very strictest orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But her head was nestling on the pillow against his cheek, and there was
  a great gladness in his heart.</p>
