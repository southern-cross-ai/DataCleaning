<h2><a name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">THE time was August, 1943. Intending passengers
on the Portuguese ship <i>Dom João III</i> had been instructed to
go aboard before 11 p.m. In wartime guests were not permitted on
the ship, and since the bar was closed there was nothing for the
passengers to do but turn in. Some time during the night the trim
ship quietly cast off her lines and slipped out to sea. As a
neutral ship she required no escort. Along her sides in gigantic
letters appeared her name and her nation, together with the
Portuguese flag, the whole brilliantly displayed under
floodlights.</p>

<p>Having been forced to go to bed early, most of the passengers
were out on the promenade before breakfast. They found the ship
gleaming with fresh white paint, the attendants solicitous. It
was better than they had expected in wartime. The American coast
had already sunk below the horizon astern; the ship was alone on
the sea. It was a rare morning; the sun shone gloriously on the
blue expanse; the breath of the sea was as exhilarating as
wine.</p>

<p>"Man litters up the earth," remarked little Mr. Mappin to his
secretary as they stepped out on deck, "but he cannot spoil the
sea."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the secretary impassively. His name was
William Miller, a big, blond, pink-skinned fellow with thick
spectacles that gave him an owlish appearance. Helped by the
spectacles, he cultivated an absolutely dead pan.</p>

<p>Mr. Mappin went on: "I'm glad we chose the ship instead of a
plane. We'll have a blessed interlude of peace at sea before
plunging into the mess over there."</p>

<p>The younger man looked out across the sea, scowling. "The ship
is so slow!" he murmured. "I'ts hard to wait!"</p>

<p>"As for me," said Mr. Mappin, holding up his glasses to the
sky and peering through them, "I'm not naturally a man of action.
Haven't got the figure for it. So I'm willing to put off what is
before us as long as possible."</p>

<p>"You were a brave man to volunteer for it," said Miller
gravely. When he spoke softly his voice rumbled.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Mappin, adjusting his glasses. "I was
too cowardly to refuse the job."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" said the other, shrugging.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, if we had taken the plane we should have been
marked from the start as important travellers. This way we may
escape notice."</p>

<p>"Not much chance of that," said Miller sombrely.</p>

<p>Even here on the peaceful, sunny sea the ship's company
reflected the troubles on shore. All the passengers were supposed
to be on the side of the United Nations, or what would they have
been doing in the port of New York? But it was clear from their
sidelong glances that they doubted each other. A cloud of
suspicion hung over the promenade deck. Passengers were guarded
in their approach to others, and some pointedly kept to
themselves. The feather-brained women and the garrulous old men
of peace-time voyages were conspicuous by their absence.
Everybody aboard the <i>Dom João III</i> was <i>on business</i>.
For instance, a trim, smartly-dressed young woman with
magnificent black eyes.</p>

<p>"It's not natural for such a one to keep such eyes lowered as
she walks the deck," remarked Mappin to Miller. "Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Down on the passenger list as Miss Kate McDonald of Dundee.
Has a British passport. The purser told me."</p>

<p>"Could be forged."</p>

<p>"If so, it's a good job. Bears the stamp of a dozen British
consulates, including New York."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Mappin, "but don't tell me those eyes opened
for the first time in Scotland."</p>

<p>One young man, an exception to the other passengers, was
making up to all and sundry. A good-looking, smiling young
fellow, as blond as Miller, but livelier, he seemed to be of a
type that is to be found on shipboard during peace or war.</p>

<p>"Name of Ronald Franklin," said Miller in response to Mappin's
question. "An American; agent for Swiss watch movements in
America. As they are doing an enormous business during wartime,
he has to make continuous trips back and forth."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mappin. "Why can't he transact his business by
cable?"</p>

<p>"Looks like a harmless fellow," said Miller indifferently.</p>

<p>"Look again," said Mappin. "Notice that while he grins and
jokes with everybody his handsome blue eyes are sharp and
wary."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir."</p>

<p>William Miller drifted away and plump Mr. Mappin toddled
around the promenade alone. In a sheltered open space astern, a
ping-pong table had been set up. Young Franklin was bouncing a
celluloid ball as Mappin came along.</p>

<p>"Like to play?" he asked, with the winning smile.</p>

<p>"Not with you," said Mappin, glancing at Franklin's long legs.
"Give me somebody my own size."</p>

<p>Franklin laughed and fell in beside him. "Ronald Franklin," he
said, offering his hand.</p>

<p>"Walter Brown," said Mappin, taking it.</p>

<p>Franklin's conversation flowed as smoothly as a tidal river.
Before they had made two rounds of the promenade Mappin was in
possession of all the salient facts about him. His job of selling
Swiss watch movements in America; his headquarters at the McAlpin
Hotel; unmarried; born in Elyria, Ohio, where his parents and
younger brothers and sisters still lived; educated at St. Paul's
School and Yale. He embarked on a lively description of his
youngest brother, Johnny, who not only had the makings of a good
athlete but was smart at his books too.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take charge of that kid's education," said
Franklin. "He deserves the best and he shall have it!" And so
forth and so forth. "You may think it funny that a husky looking
guy like me isn't in the army," he said with a sidelong look,
"but as a matter of fact I only have one lung."</p>

<p>"So," said Mappin sympathetically.</p>

<p>After completing two rounds of the deck, Franklin said with a
charming, deprecating laugh: "But I must be boring you with these
personal details."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Lee. "I am never bored."</p>

<p>A pause followed which Lee Mappin understood was to give him a
chance to talk about himself. This young man was too smart to ask
leading questions. "I envy you your life of usefulness," Lee said
with an innocent air. "I inherited a bit of money and I've never
done any work at all. Just travelled. It was pleasant enough
until Pearl Harbour, but then it got on my nerves. I was too old
to serve in the Army and I had had no business or professional
training. There was absolutely nothing I could do in the war. So
I decided to write a book. I always wanted to write a book. I'm
going to write a history of Portugal. That's what I'm going to
Lisbon for."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" murmured young Franklin. "Who's the young
fellow who's travelling with you?"</p>

<p>"My secretary, William Miller. He will do the necessary
translating for me. Speaks Portuguese and Spanish and all
that."</p>

<p>"A fine-looking fellow. How did he get exempted from the
Army?"</p>

<p>Mappin blinked mildly through his polished glasses. "Defective
eyesight, poor fellow."</p>

<p>When Mappin finally dropped in his deck chair, William Miller
looked at him inquiringly. "We lied to each other fluently," said
Mappin. "And neither believed a word. It was good comedy."

<p><br>
THERE was one couple among the passengers who were above
suspicion because everybody knew who they were and what their
business was. This was John Stanley and his young wife. It had
been announced in the papers that Stanley was going to Lisbon as
Fourth Secretary to the hard-pressed United States Legation. He
was nearly seven feet tall and broad in proportion, and, as is so
often the case, his pretty little wife stood scarcely breast-high
beside him. They had only recently been married. She was Vera
Whittier, daughter of the tobacco nabob.</p>

<p>When the chimes sounded for breakfast the Stanleys and Mr.
Mappin came face to face on the landing where the two branches of
the descending stairway came together. "Why, Mr. Mappin!" said
Mrs. Stanley, "what a delightful surprise!"</p>

<p>Mappin blinked at her mildly from behind the polished glasses.
"I beg your pardon! My name is Brown."</p>

<p>The girl became red with embarrassment. "Sorry," she said
stiffly; "my mistake."</p>

<p>She ran down the rest of the stairs, followed by her lumbering
young husband.</p>

<p>When the couple faced each other across a little table in the
dining saloon she was seething with anger. "I've never been
treated so rudely in my life! Certainly that is Mr. Mappin. He's
been to our house to dinner! There's nobody else could look like
that, the ugly little toad!"</p>

<p>"Easy, my pet," said Stanley. "Remember this is wartime, and
he probably has good reasons for not wanting to be known."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't have to stare me down, did he? Such
rudeness!"</p>

<p>"You should have waited for a sign from him."</p>

<p>"Not at all! My mother said it was the woman's place always to
bow first."</p>

<p>"We have left the comfortable, easy-going States behind us,"
said Stanley seriously, "and now we will have to watch our step
and weigh every word."</p>

<p>"And do I have to submit to a lecture from you into the
bargain?"</p>

<p>"No, my pet. But, God knows! all this has just been rubbed
into me down in Washington! Be very careful not to mention to
anybody that Mr. Mappin is aboard."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanley tossed her pretty head.</p>

<p>At another little table across the saloon, Miller murmured:
"Unfortunate you were recognised, sir."</p>

<p>"It hardly matters," said Mappin.</p>

<p>Miller glanced across the saloon through his lashes. "She is
angry. She's giving her husband hell about it."</p>

<p>Mappin shrugged. "Poor young devil! He <i>would</i> marry an
heiress!"</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better get her aside and square yourself with
her?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mappin calmly. "If I did, I'd have to bear
with her meaning glances and secret signals during the whole
voyage."</p>

<p>"She is likely to gossip to the other passengers."</p>

<p>"Let her gossip. We are safe away from port. It was advance
information of our sailing that was dangerous."</p>

<p>"The ship's wireless is working, sir."

<p><br>
AFTER breakfast, when young Mr. and Mrs. Stanley resumed their
promenade on deck with cigarettes, they were presently joined by
the agreeable Ronald Franklin. The young man's charming manner
and smile recommended him to both husband and wife.</p>

<p>They continued their stroll with the little woman in the
middle. Franklin was able to give the budding diplomatist much
valuable information about the complicated situation in Lisbon.
He had left there only six weeks before.</p>

<p>"Rather like a madhouse," he said, "but conducted with the
most punctilious regard for diplomatic procedure."</p>

<p>By and by a cabin boy presented a radiogram to Stanley. It
required an answer and the tall young man hastened away to the
radio cabin on the bridge deck.</p>

<p>When he was left alone with the bride, Franklin's conversation
assumed a warmer tone. Vera Stanley, who had been around, was
instantly aware of it, but since she was in love with her giant
husband, she felt safe in leading another man on a little. In
fact, she rather admired his cheek.</p>

<p>"How delightful to find anybody like you aboard this stuffy
ship!" Franklin said.</p>

<p>"What good will that do you?" she asked pertly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't misunderstand me," he said, turning a pair of blue
eyes on her that seemed to beam with deep (but modest)
admiration. "I know you're just married and all that. For me, it
will make the voyage pass more quickly just to have you to look
at!"</p>

<p>"Really!" said Mrs. Stanley, dimpling.</p>

<p>There was considerably more of this as they circumnavigated
the promenade. Vera Stanley enjoyed it. This young Franklin, she
told herself, had a continental finish you never found in an
American boy. It was one of the things she had looked forward to
in Europe. "A fast worker," murmured Mr. Mappin to William Miller
as the couple passed their chairs.</p>

<p>"What an odd-looking little man!" said Franklin to Vera
casually, when they had passed out of hearing of the chairs,
"With his white vest and spats and neat Panama. I saw you meet on
the stairs at breakfast. So odd-looking and so distinctive, you
feel that he must be somebody."</p>

<p>"He is," said Vera dryly. She had forgotten her husband's
warning. "It's no less a person than Amos Lee Mappin."</p>

<p>"Mappin," said Franklin carelessly. "Sounds familiar, but I
don't seem to connect it with anything. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's one of the best-known men in New York. It's
considered quite a triumph when you can get him to come to
dinner. He's been at our house, but I couldn't see the
attraction. Never spoke a word to me."</p>

<p>"What has he done to become so famous?"</p>

<p>"He writes books. The history of famous crimes and how they
were solved and all that. And once in a while he solves a case
himself. Don't you remember the boarding-house for ex-convicts on
Henry Street a couple of years ago? The house with the blue door,
the newspapers called it."</p>

<p>"I must have been out of the country," said Franklin. His
smooth face had stiffened. "A detective, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it makes him mad to be called a detective. He poses as a
psychologist or a criminologist, or something high-sounding like
that. They say he charges a terrific fee, and won't take a case
at any price unless it happens to interest him. Horrid little
man! Did you see him try to stare me down? I detest him."</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin, treating the subject as of no interest, allowed
it to drop.</p>

<p>When John Stanley returned, Franklin, with his charming
deprecating smile, handed over his wife and, leaving them, made
his way in turn, nonchalantly and by a circuitous route, up to
the radio shack.

<p><br>
SOME minutes later, Captain Gonçalves came striding aft along
the starboard promenade. A handsome man with a firm, seaman-like
expression, he was rendered magnificent by the lavishness of his
gold braid. By this time the sea was heaving gently and there
were only a few passengers left in their chairs. When the Captain
came opposite to Mr. Mappin's chair, he stopped suddenly and
pointed across the sea.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said dramatically.</p>

<p>Mappin and William Miller scrambled out of their chairs and
approached him. Still pointing across the sea, he said swiftly:
"Sir, I have need to speak with you without being observed.
Please to be waiting for me in your cabin at eleven."</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" murmured the astonished Mappin.</p>

<p>Other passengers were crowding up. "What is it, Captain? What
is it?"</p>

<p>"A whale spouting," said the Captain coolly. "But now he has
flipped his tail and sounded. You will not see him again."</p>

<p>"What is sounded?" asked a lady passenger.</p>

<p>"Dived to the bottom of the ocean, Madam." The Captain bowed
and continued down the deck.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose is biting milord?" said Mappin to William
as they regained their chairs.</p>

<p>"Very mysterious," said William.</p>

<p>"Even an honest seaman soon learns to put on a conspiratorial
air in these bad days!" said Mappin.</p>

<p>It lacked less than half an hour of eleven, and Mappin and
Miller presently descended to their cabin. They had one of the
two de luxe cabins of the <i>Dom João III</i>, a pleasant room,
gay with cretonne covers and curtains, having two single beds, a
sofa and a whole row of big portholes looking out on the blue
sea. It was entered by a short passage with a bathroom on one
side and a trunk room on the other.</p>

<p>Promptly on the hour, there was a knock on the door and the
magnificent Captain entered with his gold-laced cap under his
arm. He was accompanied by a room steward, but at a glance from
the Captain, the steward remained in the little passage. The
Captain closed the inner door of the suite, and after bowing to
Mr. Mappin and to Miller, looked inquiringly at the latter.</p>

<p>"This gentleman?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"My secretary, Mr. Miller. He enjoys my entire confidence,
Captain. You may speak freely."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you must have been astonished by my method of
address on deck," began the Captain.</p>

<p>"Nothing astonishes me nowadays," murmured Mappin.</p>

<p>"The fact is," the Captain went on, "one suspects spies in
everybody during these unhappy times. My ship's company is
selected and investigated with the greatest care, but alas! I
have only too much reason to believe that there are spies among
them." The Captain laid his hand on his heart. "The people of my
country are on your side, gentlemen; never doubt that, but there
are corruptible ones among them as among all peoples, and the
enemy is lavish with his money."</p>

<p>Mappin interrupted this little speech with just a shade of
impatience. "Quite so, Captain. But what is the particular
trouble?"</p>

<p>"I know that you are Mr. Amos Lee Mappin," the Captain went
on. "The New York office of the line&mdash;how do you say
it?&mdash;tipped me off. But of course I shall respect your
desire to travel incognito. I am entirely at your service, Mr.
Mappin." Another bow.</p>

<p>Mappin matched his bow. "I am extremely obliged, Captain. I
see by your face that there is something else you had to
say."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I wanted to convey a warning. Have you noticed a
passenger who calls himself Ronald Franklin?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"I suspect him of being an enemy agent. His papers are all in
order, so I cannot take action. But he travels back and forth on
our ships with suspicious frequency."</p>

<p>"Very good, Captain. I'll act accordingly."</p>

<p>"I mustn't appear to single you out during the voyage,"
Captain Gonçalves went on, "but I entertain all the first-class
passengers from time to time. There is no reason why you
shouldn't drop in at my quarters on the bridge deck if you wish
to speak to me. Or better still, I make my inspection of the ship
every morning at eleven, and if you happen to be in your cabin at
that hour..."</p>

<p>"I get you. And thank you again, Captain."</p>

<p>With more bows the Captain retired, and presently they heard
him enter the next stateroom.</p>

<p>"A little long-winded," remarked Lee Mappin, "but his heart is
in the right place."</p>

<p>At the luncheon table William Miller reported to his chief:
"I've been talking to Franklin. Or rather I let him talk to me.
He's German."</p>

<p>"So," said Lee. "Did you hear it in his voice? I
couldn't."</p>

<p>"No. He speaks good American plus slang, correctly used. No
trace of an accent."</p>

<p>"Then how did you know?"</p>

<p>William smiled a little bitterly. "It takes a German to know a
German."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Lee. "And if you spotted him for a German, he
must have spotted you for the same. It increases your
danger."</p>

<p>William shrugged off the suggestion of danger to himself.</p>

<p>"Also bear in mind that if he's smart, he now knows that you
know he's German. So watch your step."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," said William grimly.</p>

<p>As they were finishing their lunch, a cabin boy handed Lee a
radio envelope.</p>

<p>Inside it bore a cryptic message written on the radio
operator's typewriter:</p>

<p>"Please go to your cabin in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "Another mystery!"</p>

<p>William murmured, "Sir, you treat it too lightly!"</p>

<p>Lee answered in the same tone: "Perhaps I take it more
seriously than I let on."</p>

<p>In their cabin Lee tore the message into small pieces and
tossed them through the open port. Presently Captain Gonçalves
walked in without knocking. He said:</p>

<p>"I take some risk in visiting you at this hour, but the matter
seems important."</p>

<p>"Why are you reluctant to meet me openly?" asked Lee
mildly.</p>

<p>"I am in your hands, Mr. Mappin. My orders from my government
are that I must not under any circumstances favour either one
side or the other in this war. Portugal's very existence depends
on maintaining the strictest neutrality."</p>

<p>"Good man!" said Lee, shaking hands with him. "What's the
trouble?"</p>

<p>The Captain handed him another radiogram form. It bore a
message written in pencil in a flowery hand. "When I returned to
the bridge after inspection, the radio operator gave me this,
saying he thought I ought to see it. Ronald Franklin handed it in
to be sent."</p>

<p>The message read: James A. Dryden, &mdash;&mdash; West 32nd
St., N.Y. Grand weather. Regards to all. (Signed) Amos Lee
Mappin.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Very ingenious," said Lee, smiling. "Naturally the ship does
not accept messages in code during wartime, and so our enemy has
been forced to construct a code out of innocent-sounding phrases.
He wouldn't have a code phrase for my name, of course, so he had
to write it out in full, and it appeared most natural as the
signature. The purpose of this message, Captain, is simply this:
Amos Lee Mappin is aboard this ship."</p>

<p>"I wasn't sure what it meant," said the Captain, "but it is
obviously unneutral and it has not been sent."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain. I'll give you a message now." There were
forms for radiograms in the cabin desk, and Lee wrote quickly:
Stan Oberry, &mdash;&mdash; W. 42nd St., N.Y. Look into
activities James A. Dryden, &mdash;&mdash; W. 32nd St. N.Y.
(Signed) Lee.</p>

<p>"For your information, Captain, this Oberry is a private
detective whom I sometimes employ. If he turns up anything
suspicious, he will pass it on to the F.B.I." Lee handed back
Franklin's faked message. "Let Sparks file this with his other
transmitted messages," he said, "because it is likely that
Franklin may use some pretext to assure himself that it has been
filed. At the end of the voyage it can be returned to me for
evidence."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p class="first">DURING lunch on the sixth day after leaving New
York, an electrical impulse suddenly went through the dining
saloon of the <i>Dom João III</i>, and the passengers started
jumping up and running to the portholes. From table to table the
word travelled: "The Azores!"</p>

<p>Like a magical apparition, while they ate, the silhouette of
an island had risen from the empty sea; startling, inexplicable,
there in the middle of the great waste of water they had become
accustomed to, a bundle of mountain shapes tied together.</p>

<p>On deck after the meal, the island had drawn appreciably
closer. The lower slopes now showed a delicate green verging
upward into misty blue summits. Ronald Franklin, standing with
his friends, the Stanleys, beside the rail, gazed at the island
through his expensive binoculars.</p>

<p>"That's not Sao Miguel where we're supposed to be bound for,"
he said, lowering his glasses. "Looks to me like the island of
Flores to the north. We're off our course." The young man's face
never lost its smooth look, but there were moments when the flesh
seemed to harden under his shaven cheeks.</p>

<p>Lee and William Miller were not surprised by the appearance of
Flores out of the sea, because during inspection that morning
Captain Gonçalves had told them he was altering his course.</p>

<p>"I have been instructed by my office to put you ashore at the
town of Horta for a brief visit," he said.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Lee. "Please radio Horta the expected
time of arrival so I can be met."</p>

<p>"I have done so."</p>

<p>"What about the other passengers?"</p>

<p>"I shall allow no other passengers ashore," said Gonçalves.
"Mr. Franklin, I fancy, would be only too glad to cable Lisbon.
I'll tell them there isn't time."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lee. "I shan't be gone more than an hour or
so. Just have to see a man and..."</p>

<p>Gonçalves held up his hand. "Please don't tell me what your
business is, Mr. Mappin. I am neutral."</p>

<p>Lee laughed and clapped his shoulder.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the passengers had the pleasure of seeing
the panorama of Flores roll by with its vivid green slopes and
bold cliffs. It disappeared astern and they were alone on the sea
again. But when they issued out on deck after dinner that night,
they found a brilliant light blinking off the port bow. Then more
lights appeared and dark shapes of land loomed in the night. Upon
rounding a headland, a whole sparkling necklet of lights was
revealed which disappeared suddenly as a high island intervened,
and reappeared again.</p>

<p>The engines stopped, the ship lost way, and finally with a
roar of slipping chain, the anchor was let go. A charming doll-size
town lay spread before them with a little fort mounting
guard over it. This was Horta, on the island of Fayal. A launch
came chugging out of the harbour, and a Jacob's ladder was
dropped over the ship's rail. There was considerable grumbling
about "favouritism" among the other passengers lined up along the
promenade when "Mr. Brown's" short legs twinkled down the ladder
and dropped into the launch, followed by William Miller's long
legs.</p>

<p>It was less than five minutes' voyage to the quay. Not many
transatlantic ships call at Horta, and apparently the whole
able-bodied population had come down to see her. Lee and William
climbed some stone steps and found themselves surrounded by a
gaping crowd. They received a fleeting impression of stucco
warehouses in the background, a little custom-house.</p>

<p>Through the crowd pushed a burly, red-faced man in tweeds.
"Ha! Brown," he cried, thrusting out his hand. "I'm John
Westerholm. This way! This way!"</p>

<p>Close at hand he had a car with the top down, and a Portuguese
chauffeur. The three of them climbed into the rear seat and, with
a continuous squawking of the horn, the car turned into the
little main street of Horta. A brief glimpse of charming little
stucco houses in pastel colours, with elegant second-floor
balconies, and then they were out in the country climbing a
smooth road lined with hydrangea bushes. They turned into a
private driveway and drew up before a long, low house with a
superb vista of stars and sea. Over the entrance was fixed a
little shield bearing the United States coat of arms.</p>

<p>"Come in! Come in!" cried Westerholm, jumping out of the car
and flinging open the door. Everything about him was big and
noisy. He exuded good humour.</p>

<p>Inside the house the immense, bright living-room with its
parchment-shaded lamps, easy chairs, and shelves of books was
like a room from home transported intact across the sea.</p>

<p>"So this is what you're like," he said, looking little Lee
over in the light. "I've heard so much about you!"</p>

<p>Lee's glasses twinkled. "I take it you were expecting
something bigger," he said.</p>

<p>Westerholm waved his hands. "No sir! I don't measure a man's
value by his inches!" He led them across the big room into a
study. "Sound-proof!" he said dryly. On the table stood a bottle
of Scotch, and glasses, and from a small refrigerator appeared
soda and ice cubes as if by magic. "I knew the Captain wouldn't
want you to stay long," he said, "so all is ready."</p>

<p>"I promised I'd be back within an hour or so," said Lee. "It
will be enough. I wanted to have a look at you and to have you
meet William Miller. I want to ask you a couple of questions, and
to answer any you may wish to ask me. But my principal object in
coming here is to instruct you in our new code. Invisible writing
is no good; our previous code is in the hands of the enemy. This
has never been written down. So listen well!"</p>

<p>Their heads drew close over the table. After Lee had explained
the principle of the code, he said: "The first and the last
paragraphs of your letter are not to be coded, you understand.
The essential part of the communication is in the middle, and
that must be made to sound perfectly harmless."</p>

<p>"Boy! that's quite an order!" said the big man ruefully. "I
never was good at puzzles. This is worse than acrostics!"</p>

<p>"You need use it only when some poor devil's life or liberty
is at stake," said Lee. "It's worth going to a little trouble
for!"</p>

<p>Westerholm made some notes on a scrap of paper. "I'll study
this for a couple of hours and destroy it before I sleep," he
said.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Lee. "But don't neglect to burn it. If it should
fall into the hands of the enemy we're sunk! I suppose you have
spies, even on the island of Fayal."</p>

<p>"And how!" said Westerholm.</p>

<p>They passed to lighter matters. "How long have you lived on
Fayal?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Nearly ten years, Mr. Mappin. The consular duties here are
nothing. I chose the post for the opportunity of doing some work
of my own. After Pearl Harbour I sent the Missus and the kids
home. I would have gone with them had I not received a hint that
I could do a bit of really useful work here."</p>

<p>"I know of what you have done," said Lee, lifting his glass to
him.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all! Nothing at all!" said Westerholm. "What about
your two questions?"</p>

<p>"What are the communications between the islands and
Lisbon?"</p>

<p>"The ships on the line you came on, to and from Ponta Delgada
about every fortnight. They do not call at Horta unless ordered.
Also the Island mail-steamer from Lisbon every other week. That
calls at all the islands."</p>

<p>"Can we use the mail-steamer in our work?"</p>

<p>Westerholm spread his hands. "Doubtful. The Captain is
incorruptible. The Purser is a good friend of mine and you can
approach him safely. It would be difficult, though, to smuggle
anybody aboard the ship without the Captain's knowledge."</p>

<p>"Is there any other means of getting our friends through?"
asked Lee.</p>

<p>"In case of emergency you could send me passengers by one of
the Lisbon fishing-boats. There is one skipper that you can
depend on absolutely. His name is Pedro Chavez. The boat is the
<i>Enguia</i>. Chavez lives in Lisbon. I'll give you his address.
His vessel has an engine. The voyage would be uncomfortable, but
not dangerous at this season."</p>

<p>"The second question is, what is the chance of catching an
American or Allied vessel homeward bound?"</p>

<p>"Can't give you exact dates, of course. A homeward bound
convoy will be leaving Algiers after September 10th. They'll be
passing to the south of these islands say a week later. I'll be
in radio communication with the convoy for ten days or more. In
case of need, I can summon one of the faster ships to call at
Horta."</p>

<p>"What about submarines?"</p>

<p>"None in this part of the sea at the moment. The passage of
the convoy may bring them here, of course. As to later sailings,
I'll have to let you know. What about coding such messages?"</p>

<p>"In a cable where you are limited to a few words, you must use
your ingenuity. In this case you would cable: 'Mother will be
ready to go home after September 15th.'"</p>

<p>"I get you."</p>

<p>"Have you any questions?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Westerholm shook his head. "Only your address in Lisbon."</p>

<p>"<i>Lisboa Palace Hotel</i> until further notice."</p>

<p>"Have you a trustworthy Portuguese servant or messenger?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. William speaks the language, but he could hardly
pass for a Portuguese."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do for you from this end."</p>

<p>After a little more talk, Lee looked at his watch. "We must
start back."</p>

<p>They left the house.</p>

<p>At the quay the launch was waiting. They shook hands with
Westerholm, and Lee said: "This is the shortest visit to a
foreign port on record."</p>

<p>"It has bucked me up," said Westerholm. "If I can do anything
more for you, cable me from Ponta Delgada to-morrow."

<p><br>
NEXT morning, at the time of the Captain's inspection, the
island of Sao Miguel was close aboard; wicked-looking, scarred,
brown cliffs, green shoulders, and a great central mass mounting
until it was lost in cloud.</p>

<p>Captain Gonçalves entered the de luxe cabin with a scowl.</p>

<p>"What should I do about Franklin to-day?" he asked. "We'll be
here six hours. I can't very well keep all the passengers aboard.
I've a good mind simply to forbid Franklin to go ashore, and the
hell with him. After all, I'm the Captain of this ship. I don't
have to give my reasons."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Better not, Captain; it would be showing
too much of our hand. After all, it makes little difference. As
soon as we land in Lisbon he'll convey the news of my arrival to
his friends. Let him send a cable from Ponta Delgada if he wants.
It would be worth something to me to find out who he cables
to."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said the Captain, "if that is your
wish."</p>

<p>However, when the ship dropped anchor before that dazzling
white town, when the lordly stairway was let down on the
starboard side and the launches gathered around the foot of it,
Ronald Franklin did not press forward with the other passengers.
He remained leaning his elbows on the rail of the promenade
looking down with a superior smile.</p>

<p>"Not going ashore?" said Lee as he passed.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" said Franklin nonchalantly. "Stuffy little
burg! I've seen it all a dozen times."</p>

<p>From the launch on the way ashore, Franklin could still be
seen leaning negligently on the rail. William said softly to
Lee:</p>

<p>"What's he up to, anyhow? I didn't like the look on his
face."</p>

<p>Lee answered calmly: "Thinks it will be more profitable to
search our cabin while everybody is out of the way."</p>

<p>William started. "Good God! I locked the door."</p>

<p>"Surely. But don't you reckon, after all his voyages on this
ship, that he has collected a set of pass keys? Three master keys
will open every stateroom door."</p>

<p>"I'll go back!" said William grimly.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "I want him to search the cabin. He will
find nothing that he ought not to see."</p>

<p>"Do you carry your papers about with you?" said William.
"That's dangerous, too."</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "They're not on my person, either...Have you any
papers on you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I possess no incriminating papers," growled William.</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"Gott! how I hate him!" muttered William under his breath.
Unconsciously his big fist clenched. William in his pink and
whiteness was apt to impress the beholder as soft, but it was a
false impression. "When he comes close to me my bristles rise!"
he went on. "A Judas! Some day, some day there will have to be a
showdown between him and me."</p>

<p>"That would be fatal to our work...now!" suggested Lee
dryly.</p>

<p>William gritted his teeth. "I know! I know!"</p>

<p>They were seated alongside the engine trunk while the other
passengers stood or sat towards the bow of the heavy, broad-beamed
launch. Among them, Miss Kate McDonald, the pseudo-Scotswoman,
turned her handsome face.</p>

<p>"Oh look, Mr. Brown! We are entering a little inner harbour.
It looks as old as time itself. And see the quaint arcades all
around it!"</p>

<p>Lee moved forward to join her. In her well-fitting suit of
Lincoln green with a beret to match, she was charming. She owed
little to make-up; the pallor of her smooth cheeks was seductive,
and her great dark eyes were full of mystery. But she was uneasy,
too; the handsome eyes were never still.</p>

<p>In going up the stone steps of the quay she was immediately in
front of Lee. She paused and wavered slightly. Lee quickly put a
hand under her elbow.</p>

<p>"Silly of me!" she said with a laugh. "The thought of toppling
into the water occurred to me, and right away I began to
stagger!"</p>

<p>This bit of clinging-vine business did not sit very well on
Miss McDonald, who was obviously well able to take care of
herself. But Lee supported her to the top of the steps.</p>

<p>On the quay the passengers were surrounded by native men and
boys, who with more or less English were recommending themselves
as guides to the town. Miss McDonald pressed a little closer to
Lee.</p>

<p>"Let's not have a guide," she murmured. "It's so much more fun
to mooch around by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Surely!" said Lee, drawing her hand under his arm and making
for the street. To-day Lee and William had no cares beyond seeing
the sights. William followed the couple, looking grim. Life had
borne hard on William, and the springs of joy were dried up in
him; women had little appeal.</p>

<p>"They say the Madeira work is better here than in Madeira
itself," the girl was saying. "I'd like to get some, but I expect
it will turn out to be dearer than in New York."</p>

<p>"It will be while the ship's in harbour," said Lee.</p>

<p>The girl intrigued him. In the midst of her chatter he noticed
how her eyes were painfully drawn aside by the sight of a
long-lashed little girl staggering under the weight of an adorable
dirty baby. "Like babies?" he asked idly.</p>

<p>She quickly recovered herself. "Dear me, no!" she said with a
tight laugh. "I'm not the mother type! It's a crime to bring
babies into a world like this!"</p>

<p>Up and down the main street of Ponta Delgada the old houses
had broken out in a rash of modern store fronts with show windows
displaying all the attractions of the A. &amp; P. or Woolworth's
at home. Lee found it rather depressing.</p>

<p>"Let's strike up hill," he said, "and see some gardens. This
town is famous for its gardens, I've heard."</p>

<p>"Let me do a little shopping first," pleaded Miss McDonald.
"Just half an hour for shopping and the rest of the afternoon is
yours."</p>

<p>She paused at the door of a shop that sold embroideries and
women's wear. "Better let me go in here alone," she said archly.
"I've got to look at all kinds of unmentionables."</p>

<p>"Old-fashioned?" said Lee, affecting to be astonished.</p>

<p>"No, Scotch," she answered with a smile. "Come back in half an
hour and pick me up?"</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>The two men walked on. A group of boys followed, running out
in the street, or darting ahead under their feet to get a look
back at them. Some dropped away when their curiosity was
satisfied, but others took their places.</p>

<p>"Damn the woman!" grumbled Lee. "I know I'm not attractive to
the sex. I know she's playing me for a sucker. But God forgive
me! I like her!"</p>

<p>"You're not obliged to come back in half an hour," said
tight-lipped William.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>They turned up one of the sun-drenched streets accompanied by
their admirers and presently came to a pretty little
<i>praça</i>. One side of it was filled by a magnificent
building, and through an open gateway they glimpsed a garden with
old trees of strange shapes. They turned in, hoping to lose their
attendants, but the boys came, too.</p>

<p>Inside, the wealth of verdure was like nothing they had ever
seen. Beyond the first garden there was a lovely sunken garden,
and beyond that actually a playing field with nobody playing in
it. The whole was surrounded by a lavishly decorated stone wall.
They sat down on a bench and all the boys stood and stared
unwinkingly.</p>

<p>"Look," said William, "do any of you understand English?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of replies: "Yes, gentleman!...Si,
Senor!...Sure!"</p>

<p>"Then get the hell away from here!"</p>

<p>Nobody moved.</p>

<p>Bye and bye, a boy they had not noticed before approached Lee
timidly, offering him a rumpled pink card. Lee took it. It bore
the address of an antique shop which, among other things,
advertised old silver and Portuguese ship models.</p>

<p>"Sounds interesting," said Lee, handing the card to
William.</p>

<p>"<i>Qual e a distância</i>?" William asked the boy
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Five minute, gentleman," he answered eagerly. He was a
handsome boy, straight and slim, with shadowed black eyes.</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Lee rising. "It will be more fun than
mooching with McDonald."</p>

<p>The other boys accompanied them out of the garden. In the
street their young conductor turned on them with a torrent of
invective, and they slunk away.</p>

<p>"I don't know what he's saying," said William. "Talks too fast
and uses slang words I never heard before."</p>

<p>Having got rid of their hangers-on, the boy led them through
one narrow, close-ranked street after another. Window-sashes and
doors seemed to be unnecessary in Ponta Delgada, and they had
intimate glimpses of domestic life as they went. Often they were
hailed in English in friendly fashion. It was surprising to find
how many of these islanders claimed to have worked in Brooklyn or
Pittsoborgo or New Bedford. To all of William's questions, their
young conductor only answered, "Five minute, gentleman."</p>

<p>Several times five minutes passed, and William finally halted.
"We're getting too far from our base," he said. "Any reputable
shop ought to be in the centre of town."</p>

<p>The boy pleaded piteously with William. There were actually
tears in his big brown eyes.</p>

<p>"What's he saying?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual stuff about his poor father and mother and his
sick sister," said William. "He says they haven't made a sale in
the shop since the last ship called."</p>

<p>"Let's go on," said Lee. "We have all afternoon."</p>

<p>They were now in the poorest and most ancient quarter, where
the houses appeared to be on the point of collapsing and the
gutters were full of trash. Upon turning a corner they came upon
several rough-looking men leaning against the wall on both sides
with arms folded and hats pulled over their eyes. They had not
seen so many men in one spot before. The women and children of
this corner had disappeared. Lee glimpsed frightened faces
peeping around the upper window openings.</p>

<p>William stopped. "I don't like this," he muttered. "Where's
the boy?"</p>

<p>They discovered that he had disappeared as if swallowed by the
pavement.</p>

<p>Upon turning to retrace their steps, they found that several
of the men had slipped behind them, cutting off their retreat.
Additional men were silently edging out of doorways, perhaps a
dozen in all. None spoke; out of dead-pan faces, the stare of
bright, inhuman, black eyes never wavered.</p>

<p>A hairy individual with villainous blank features blocked
Lee's way. Lee demanded boldly: "What do you want?"</p>

<p>By way of answer, another man silently leaped on his back,
bearing him to the ground. Some of the women at the windows
whimpered. Lee made no struggle. It would do him no good, he
knew, and he'd only get hurt. Out of the tail of his eye he saw
that it was taking four or five men to get William down. Then a
handkerchief was thrown over his eyes and tied. His arms were
expertly pinioned to his sides, and a gag forced between his
teeth. He could still hear William cursing furiously and
thrashing about. After a while it stopped. Have they killed him?
thought Lee. No sound came from any of the Portuguese except
their heavy panting.</p>

<p>He heard a motor car draw up and stop. He was unceremoniously
picked up and dropped in the rear compartment on top of William.
A tarpaulin was thrown over them. Lee was overjoyed to find that
William was still able to struggle in his bonds. He nudged him
urgently to persuade him to be still, but William continued to
strain at his bonds.</p>

<p>The car sped through the streets, honking continuously,
turning the corners on screaming brakes. In a few minutes they
slowed down and sped along a smooth, straight road. A breath of
flower perfume reached Lee's nostrils. Out in the country, he
thought. Turning out of the smooth road, they began to climb a
stony track in first gear. Then the engine was thrown out of gear
and they bumped slowly down a long descent and stopped. What now?
thought Lee.</p>

<p>They were lifted out and dropped in grass. The rope was
unwound from Lee's body and while a man sat on each limb, another
started frisking him. The thought flitted through Lee's mind:
Fancy! four men to hold down little me! He could hear nothing
from William. Lee's snuff-box, his wallet and his loose change
were taken, beside what other trifles they found in his pockets.
Every inch of his clothes was felt between thumb and finger for
concealed papers. They took off his shoes and socks to examine
them. When they put them back on, Lee's heart leaped in joy. They
are going to take us back, then!</p>

<p>Sure enough, they were loaded back in the car and the return
journey began. It took longer than on the way out, and Lee
guessed they were entering a different part of the town. He heard
the scuff of rope soles on the pavement and many voices. These
townspeople never stopped talking!</p>

<p>The car turned into a quieter street and stopped. Lee and
William were quickly lifted out, and dropped on the pavement. The
car sped away. For a moment there was silence, then little
shuffling sounds as people stole up; they whispered excitedly.
Lee heard exclamations of pity. He twisted in his bonds and
groaned under the gag. If they're honest, why the hell don't they
release us? he thought. He heard the word "policia" repeated.</p>

<p>Finally the police arrived. The bandage was thrown off Lee's
eyes, the gag removed, his limbs unbound. A second policeman was
questioning the bystanders. All insisted on talking at once. A
roar of talk now filled the narrow street. When William was freed
he added to it with his mighty cursing.</p>

<p>"In broad daylight! In broad daylight!" he shouted. "What the
hell kind of a town do you call this!"</p>

<p>Lee and William were led to the police station in the nearby
main street, followed by an ever-increasing crowd. Lee had no
doubt that the kidnappers formed part of it, but how could he
identify them? He noticed that William was limping.</p>

<p>"Badly hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>William shook his head. "Only bruised."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have struggled so hard."</p>

<p>"Couldn't help it...In broad daylight! We might as well have
been in Chicago!"</p>

<p>"It is possible our efficient friends were trained in our
country," said Lee.</p>

<p>"They were after more than our wallets," growled William. "A
fat lot of good it's going to do us to tell our story to the
police."</p>

<p>"Sure! But we must act the part of good citizens. The police
must be allowed to believe that it was just a common
robbery."</p>

<p>In the police station they found partial quiet at last.
William told their story to a soldierly and courteous Inspector.
As it proceeded, the officer lost his calm, pounded his desk and
burst into grieved protests. William translated.</p>

<p>"He says such an outrage has never before been perpetrated on
this island. Says they have no serious crime here. Says it is all
due to the war."</p>

<p>"He's nearer the truth than he suspects," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>The officer broke out afresh when William ended. William
translated impassively. "Says they will leave no stone unturned
to apprehend the miscreants. Says they can promise us they'll
have them in custody within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Police talk the same way in any language," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>William continued: "But how can they convict the scoundrels,
he wants to know, if we are not here to identify them."</p>

<p>"Explain that that would be impossible," said Lee, "but
suggest that if they arrest the kidnappers and get evidence
against them, we might come back. That may spur the police to
greater efforts."</p>

<p>They left a minute description of the stolen property. All
this took time, and when they issued from the police station it
was near the hour for the launch to return to the ship. The crowd
in the street gaped at them as if they had been circus freaks.
Out of the crowd appeared Miss Kate McDonald, who clung to Lee's
arm almost weeping.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Brown, what happened? I searched for you everywhere
and when I saw you and Mr. Miller led through the streets by the
police I nearly fainted!"</p>

<p>Lee suspected that the tearful girl knew exactly what had
happened, but consoled himself with the thought that, after all,
she hadn't got what she was after. "We weren't the criminals but
only the victims," he said dryly.</p>

<p>"How dreadful! How dreadful!" she mourned.</p>

<p>On the launch, and on the ship when they boarded her, Lee and
William had to run the gauntlet of incessant questions from the
passengers. Lee, fearful of an outbreak from the grim William,
answered all as politely as he could. Franklin was on the
promenade. He had already heard something of the story and was
full of sympathy. Lee noted how eagerly his eyes ran over their
persons, looking for evidence of the struggle they had been
through. Later, after Kate McDonald presumably had reported to
him, his eyes were glum enough.</p>

<p>Lee was thankful when he got William down to their cabin. A
glance round the little room revealed signs that it had had a
thorough going-over while they were ashore. Lee did not mention
this to the fuming William. Captain Gonçalves presently came to
them. He, likewise, was seething with indignation, and it was up
to Lee to soothe them both. He told Gonçalves the whole
story.</p>

<p>"How could Franklin have engineered such a thing when he never
left the ship or sent any radiograms?" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Kate McDonald."</p>

<p>Gonçalves' eyes opened wide. "What makes you think that those
two...?"</p>

<p>"Simply because they have never been seen to speak to each
other aboard ship. Young, personable and unattached, it's not
natural."</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>"I fancy they're both well known in Ponta Delgada," said Lee,
"and McDonald would know exactly whom to approach. She carried
Franklin's instructions ashore and the money for the job."</p>

<p>Gonçalves sadly shook his head at the venality of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>"It could happen anywhere," said Lee. "These poor fishermen
and labourers want us to win, but they cannot resist the
temptation of turning a German dollar."</p>

<p>"Well, by God!" cried Gonçalves, striking his fist into his
palm; "I'm going to take a chance on it and put Franklin in irons
for the balance of the voyage."</p>

<p>Lee laid a hand on his arm. "No, my friend. What would be the
result? Franklin would be released in Lisbon, and you censured.
We have no evidence."</p>

<p>"Very well! Very well! But that fool of a steward put Franklin
at my table simply because he has travelled on this vessel
before, and I have to look at his smug face at every meal!"</p>

<p>"No harm to let him see that you don't like his face," said
Lee mildly.

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY on the morning of the ninth day, the
<i>Dom João III</i> steamed grandly past the noble tower of Belem
on the Tagus. An enormous huddle of palaces, churches, convents
and hovels followed, rising from the river as on steps and
crowned by a hoary old Moorish fort with square towers. Along the
quays at the water's edge spread the markets of the town, and
moored to the quays, bow foremost, stretched an endless rank of
picturesque fishing boats with lateen sails. In front of the city
the narrow river spread out in a wide, placid lake with ferry-boats
crossing to and fro.</p>

<p>"So this is Lisbon!" murmured Lee. "What's it going to do to
us, William?"</p>

<p>"Whatever it does, we can take it," growled William.</p>

<p>The ship was moored to her dock. After the formalities of the
custom-house had been concluded, Lee and William taxied to the
hotel with their luggage. They crossed fine squares each with its
noble monument in the centre, and each surrounded by handsome
buildings. Since this part of the city was levelled by an
earthquake in 1755, it all bore the formal stamp of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The <i>Lisboa Palace</i> was an immense and too-ornamental
pile, typical of the European de luxe hotel. Since it was half a
century old, its magnificence had become a little old-fashioned
and faded, but it still had an air. Like others of its kind, the
entrance was deceitfully modest; a revolving door, a small room
with four chairs, the "bureau" on one side and the head porter's
desk beyond; stairway and lift on the other. All the magnificent
public rooms, lounge, restaurant, etc., were above.</p>

<p>"The restaurant is said to be the best in Lisbon," said Lee.
"That's why I came here. I am told they serve salt codfish in
forty-one styles, all delicious."</p>

<p>"They can keep it," grumbled William.</p>

<p>Lee registered under his own name, and secured a corner suite
on the third floor. The door was opened with a big brass key. On
one side their windows gave them an oblique view of the
<i>Roçio</i>, the principal centre of Lisbon, and on the other
side they glimpsed a corner of the huge Central Railway Station.
The furniture of the suite was upholstered in red velvet with
antimacassars over the backs of the chairs and sofas; old-fashioned
lace curtains hung at the windows; but the service was
such as could not be equalled in America. The smiles of the
porter in his striped vest, and the buxom chambermaid, suggested
that they had known and loved these Americanos for years. Lee
knew how to make these smiles permanent.</p>

<p>William immediately set out to find a couple of rooms from
which they could conduct their affairs inconspicuously.</p>

<p>"Must be central," suggested Lee, "yet a little retired...Try
to find a place that has a way out at the back," he added
dryly.</p>

<p>William had also to set lines in motion towards finding a
trustworthy Portuguese messenger or servant. He had a couple of
addresses furnished by Westerholm. "Offer good pay," the Consul
had suggested, "but not <i>too</i> good or the Portuguese will
make up his mind that you are wicked fellows. Almost any
Portuguese will serve you faithfully&mdash;unless the enemy gets
at him with a bigger offer."</p>

<p>Lee taxied to the U.S. Legation in the western part of Lisbon
to pay a courtesy call. His driver, like the previous one, tore
through the streets sounding his horn continuously. All the other
taxis were doing the same. He could speak English after a
fashion, and he explained to Lee that if there was an accident,
unless he could prove that he had blown his horn he was liable to
be convicted of manslaughter. So to be on the safe side he blew
it all the time.</p>

<p>At the Legation, Lee, who appeared to be expected, was shown
directly into the Minister's private office. He was received by a
tall, lanky gentleman, grey-haired, handsome, whose slightly
derisive American grin instantly recommended him to Lee's
affections. What a pleasure, after all the Latin faces in the
streets! He said:</p>

<p>"Welcome to Lisbon, Mr. Brown! I have been advised of your
coming. I know who you are, of course. In fact, I have read one
of your books."</p>

<p>"That didn't improve your mind any," said Lee. "Better address
me as Mappin, and have done with it."</p>

<p>"But I might when others were present make a slip."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't matter. My presence in Lisbon is already known to
the enemy, and I decided to register under my own name. It's more
dignified and not a bit more dangerous."</p>

<p>"But how will you account for your trip to Lisbon and your
stay here?"</p>

<p>"Amos Lee Mappin has come to Lisbon to gather materials for a
book. I won't get far with that, of course, but it will do for a
talking point."</p>

<p>The Minister looked at Lee ruefully. "I suppose it has not
occurred to you that your stay here adds to my difficulties."</p>

<p>"How come?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been advised that the Legation must not under any
circumstances give countenance to your activities in Lisbon. I
haven't been told what those activities are, but I can
guess."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you..." began Lee.</p>

<p>The Minister quickly held up his hand. "Don't! If you get into
trouble with the Portuguese authorities I will have to go on the
stand and swear I know nothing about it. It's a game we all have
to play, this neutrality."</p>

<p>"I knew that before I came," said Lee, "but what...?"</p>

<p>"Here's the rub; a broad hint has been conveyed to me that
your person is dear to the State Department and to the
Administration generally, and that if anything <i>should</i>
happen to you in Lisbon, it will be the worse for me."</p>

<p>Lee laughed. "You're a good fellow!"</p>

<p>"Same to you," said the Minister.</p>

<p>"I know quite well," said Lee, "that in Lisbon I am, so to
speak, a man without a country. If I get in a jam I shall not
call on you. On the other hand, I intend to keep out of jams if
it is humanly possible."</p>

<p>"Does the enemy know the nature of your business here?" asked
the Minister.</p>

<p>"Not yet. But of course they will know as soon as I get
busy."</p>

<p>"You will be in grave danger, Mappin."</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about that."</p>

<p>"You will need a bodyguard. I employ several Portuguese
agents. Let me lend you a couple of them."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Better not," he said. "I've already
learned that working as a secret agent for one of the Powers is a
leading industry in Lisbon. Your agents must be known to all the
other agents, and if they followed me around, the trail would
lead direct to you. Let me find my own bodyguard."</p>

<p>"Lose no time about it," said the Minister earnestly.</p>

<p>"Here's a thing you can do for me," said Lee: "Advise the
British Ambassador of my presence in Lisbon, and say what you can
in my favour. You might suggest to him that he recommend me to
the British consular agents throughout Portugal. They have so
many and we have so few."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," said the Minister.</p>

<p>Lee stood up. "One question before I go. Is it proper for you
to tell me if you have received any instructions respecting
Friedrich Erbelding and his family?"</p>

<p>"No, Mappin. There's no reason why I shouldn't tell you if I
had."</p>

<p>"You know who he is, of course?"</p>

<p>"The famous author, certainly."</p>

<p>"The admirers of his books are making a concerted effort to
get him out of Germany," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Difficult, Mappin; he makes no secret of his scorn for the
government."</p>

<p>"All the more difficult because he has a wife and several
small children. He can't leave them behind."</p>

<p>"I had heard he was in a concentration camp?"</p>

<p>"He was. Where he is now I don't know. I have to find
out."</p>

<p>"Even if he has escaped from Germany," said the Minister, "he
would have to cross occupied France and Franco's Spain in order
to reach neutral Portugal. And encumbered with a family, I should
say it was a sheer impossibility, Mappin."</p>

<p>"Suppose, just for the sake of argument, that he does reach
Lisbon," said Lee. "What would you do for him?"</p>

<p>"I'd issue him a temporary United States passport," said the
Minister promptly. "A man like that is a citizen of the
world."</p>

<p>"Well, wouldn't that be enough?"</p>

<p>The Minister shook his head. "Before he could board a ship or
a plane, he would have to have a Portuguese exit visa."</p>

<p>"Any difficulty about that?"</p>

<p>"It depends. Suppose Germany represented to Portugal as a
friendly nation, that Erbelding was a dangerous criminal and
asked for his detention?"</p>

<p>"What would Portugal do?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't know. But I know what they would like."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"They would <i>like</i> to have the Erbeldings smuggled out of
the country without their knowledge."</p>

<p>"I see," said Lee. "Thanks for the tip."</p>

<p>"But Mappin," the Minister continued, "it is useless to talk
about diplomatic usage and passports and visas in this case. The
Germans will be panic-stricken if Erbelding escapes them. They
have good reason to fear what he would write in a free country.
If he should reach Lisbon he will never get as far as my office.
The Gestapo is here in force. They have had the nerve to hire a
hotel."</p>

<p>Lee took out his notebook. "I'd better have that address."</p>

<p>"<i>Hotel Excelsior, Rua Azorrague, 38.</i>"</p>

<p>Lee turned towards the door.</p>

<p>"What are your plans?" asked the Minister anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know...yet," said Lee. "But I have promised not to
drag you into it. If you hear anything I suppose you'll let me
know."</p>

<p>"Surely! And good luck, Mappin!"</p>

<p>"Thanks. Reckon I'll need every bit of it."

<p><br>
THE days that followed were busy ones. The <i>Dom João
III</i>, having discharged her cargo, sailed for New York.
William found two rooms in the <i>Rua Cachimbo, 23</i>, that
seemed to suit their purpose. It was a street of no special
character on the edge of the business district, lined with
third-class hotels, small business offices, cheap apartments, and
neighbourhood stores at the street level. Number 23 was supposed
to be a business building; consequently it had no concierge, and
the street door was always unlocked. One could enter or leave at
all hours without observation.</p>

<p>"That has its disadvantages as well as its advantages,"
remarked Lee.</p>

<p>"I shan't leave you alone in that building," said William.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You can't play nursemaid all the time. You have
other work to do."</p>

<p>William set his lips obstinately. "The back door of the house
opens on a narrow passage or alley," he went on, "that finds its
way out to another street."</p>

<p>"Good! That may prove useful."</p>

<p>"Only for a short time," William pointed out. "As soon as they
discover that this house is our hangout, they'll watch both
entrances."</p>

<p>"We must have other hangouts or hideouts in reserve," said
Lee. "What about the house of Pedro Chavez, the fisherman, that
Westerholm recommended to us?"</p>

<p>"That address is in the <i>Alfama</i>," said William, "the
ancient Moorish quarter, a sort of rabbit warren on the slopes
that lead up to the castle. I'll visit it to-morrow."</p>

<p>William reported next day that Pedro Chavez' house seemed
ideal for their purpose. Teresa Chavez, the wife, lived there
alone when her husband and son were away fishing; a woman of
character, William said, who enjoyed the respect of her
neighbours. A tiny house in an out-of-the-way lane, it contained
only three rooms, but Teresa was glad to rent a room to William.
Her son could sleep in the kitchen when he came home, she said.
There was a secret way out through the garden. The fishermen were
expected to return in two days. Lee subsequently visited the
house, and approved of the arrangements.</p>

<p>William rounded up a Portuguese youth named Manoel to be their
messenger and general utility man. He was a student of the
University at Coimbra, but assured his new employers that he had
plenty of time on his hands. A typical, happy-go-lucky product of
Lisbon, with a black cape slung over his shoulder, he was forever
singing, whistling or dancing.</p>

<p>"I hope his head is not as empty as it sounds," said Lee.</p>

<p>They determined to keep Master Manoel under observation for a
few days before entrusting him with any confidential work.</p>

<p>To receive their mail and telegrams, Lee engaged a lock box in
the General Post Office. "I do not believe," he said, "that the
enemy has succeeded in getting his tentacles into the Portuguese
Post Office. If our letters get as far as Lisbon, they will get
to us."</p>

<p>In due time William found Pedro Chavez aboard his boat, the
<i>Enguia</i>, moored to the <i>Cais do Sodré</i>. His report was
favourable. "A simple, honest fisherman, strong as an ox,
ignorant, but shrewd; looks on our enemies as his. By paying him
something in advance, I have persuaded him to lie in port for a
week while he overhauls his engine and mends his nets. He will
sleep at home and we can get in touch with him at any time. His
boy, Carlos, is eighteen years old and cast in the same mould as
his father."</p>

<p>So far, neither Lee nor William had been followed in the
streets. They were prepared for it as soon as the enemy became
organized. They used taxicabs when they had anything to conceal.
It is difficult to trail a taxi through traffic, and in a taxi
you can find out at once if you are being trailed by another
taxi. They wanted to keep the secret of the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>
as long as possible, and it was absolutely essential to keep
their connection with the Chavez family a secret.</p>

<p>For several days now Lee had been established in his "office."
William had put in a desk, a few plain chairs, and a cheap couch.
The previous tenant's telephone was still connected. Otherwise
the rooms were bare. The entrance door was at the head of the
first flight of stairs. From the stair hall you entered an inside
room without windows, through which you had to pass in order to
reach the front room, which had two windows looking down on the
noisy street.</p>

<p>Here Lee, by interview, by wire, and by post, had started
gathering together the threads of an organisation that stretched
across Spain and central France to neutral Switzerland&mdash;and
beyond. Here he received oddly-contrasting visitors; a fisherman
in a stocking cap, a banker in a silk topper, a railway guard, a
Portuguese waterfront bum and others. There was no sign on the
door of the office, only a number.</p>

<p>Lee's first great task was to instruct his agents in the new
code, and to make sure that it was passed from one to another. It
was not to be written down. His predecessor in this job, in
travelling between two stations of the underground, had simply
disappeared and been heard of no more. Lee therefore had been
instructed by his employers not to leave Lisbon, but to let
others do the travelling.</p>

<p>So far the enemy had made no overt move, but Lee and William
neglected no precautions. At the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> they had a
sitting-room and a bedroom beyond, which could be entered only
through the sitting-room. William insisted on sleeping on a
day-bed in the outer room, though there were two beds in the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Surely they would never dare to stage a show in this flossy
joint," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said William. "This old hotel has so many
corridors, so many pairs of stairs, so many entrances, so many
servants who might be bribed, I wouldn't put it past them."</p>

<p>Finally they discovered that they were followed whenever they
left the hotel. It was not far to the office, but they always
used a taxi for the journey. When they were followed they went
somewhere else, and after a while started out again.</p>

<p>Ronald Franklin and Kate McDonald had both booked at the
<i>Lisboa Palace</i>&mdash;separately. From time to time they ran
into Franklin around the hotel. He was always polite, but
betrayed no interest in their movements. After a few days Miss
McDonald checked out. She had taken the plane for England, a
clerk told them. On the sixth day after their arrival in Lisbon,
Franklin ostentatiously bade them good-bye. He was flying to
Switzerland, he said; would be back in time to catch the next
ship for New York. Manoel, sent to the air field to watch,
reported that Franklin had actually boarded the Swiss plane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lee had found a little restaurant on the <i>Largo
do Socorro</i> that suited him to a T. It was called the
<i>Macaco Branco</i>, a modest place where the proprietor was a
Cook, as Lee put it, the greatest prize a stranger could stumble
on in a foreign land. They saw the same people there every night,
and soon cultivated a bowing acquaintance with all. Stout,
middle-class Portuguese, it was by observing them through the
windows that Lee had first been led into the place.</p>

<p>Every night, after returning to the hotel by taxi, they walked
to the restaurant, indifferent as to whether they were followed.
Lee sampled the Portuguese dishes, one after another, and fell in
love with the native <i>vinho verde</i>, which is not green at
all, but red and sparkling. It had a bouquet, Lee said, as
delicious as spring flowers. Afterwards they would go to some
little cafe to hear the <i>fado</i> singers.</p>

<p>In spite of all precautions, Lee discovered after a week that
their hangout in the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> had been spotted. From
the front windows all day he could see men walking up and down
the other side of the street, watching the door. They frequently
relieved each other. "Well," said Lee with a shrug, "sooner or
later it was inevitable," Next morning, for an experiment, he and
William entered from the back street. So far, that door was not
watched.</p>

<p>Disquieting news arrived from underground sources. News had
leaked out in Germany that Friedrich Erbelding and his family had
escaped the country, and Gestapo circles were violently aroused.
For a week nothing had been heard from the Erbeldings. Lee's
Swiss agents were silent.</p>

<p>"I wish you could fly to Bâle and make your way across the
border as you have done before," Lee said to William. "We have
good friends in Munich. Perhaps you could trace the Erbeldings
from there."</p>

<p>"My first duty is to you," said William, scowling. "I couldn't
leave you here alone without a guard, without even an
interpreter."</p>

<p>"Manoel will do till you come back," said Lee.</p>

<p>"A boy of eighteen!" said William scornfully.</p>

<p>Next morning there was a message from the agent in Grenoble,
France, that the Erbeldings had arrived safely and had been
passed on to the South.</p>

<p>"Crossing the Spanish border is the greatest risk," said
William. "The Gestapo is watching every road."</p>

<p>Four days later, more news came, and it was the worst that
could be. Lee's agent in Barcelona reported that, at the request
of the German authorities, Friedrich Erbelding had been arrested.
The charge was travelling on a forged passport.</p>

<p>Lee carried this to the United States Minister, who promptly
telegraphed to the consul in Barcelona, asking him to
investigate. In due course there was a reply saying that the
Spanish authorities in Barcelona asserted Friedrich Erbelding had
escaped from prison, and that his present whereabouts and that of
his family was unknown. Nothing further from Lee's agent.</p>

<p>"A likely story!" said Lee bitterly.</p>

<p>"Probably led out by the Gestapo and shot," said the
Minister.</p>

<p>Lee flung up his hands and let them fall. "Those little
children!"

<p><br>
LEE had no sooner got back to the office than the telephone
rang. He heard the cautious voice of the American Minister
asking: "Is that you?" Both men had in mind the danger that the
wire might be tapped.</p>

<p>"It's me," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I want to see you."</p>

<p>"Okay, I'll be right over."</p>

<p>As a matter of precaution, Lee and William went out the back
way. Consequently they were not followed to the Legation. Lee had
recognised from the tone of the Minister's voice that they were
not going to hear good news. They found him pacing the floor of
his study.</p>

<p>"Thank God! I was able to find you!" he said. "The Gestapo has
it all fixed to do away with you to-night."</p>

<p>"So soon?" said Lee in an even voice.</p>

<p>The Minister stopped and stared. "Is that all you have to
say?"</p>

<p>Lee smiled crookedly. "Well, maybe I'm not so cold-blooded as
I'm trying to make out." He dropped in a chair and wiped his
face.</p>

<p>"It was only by the merest accident that I learned of it," the
Minister went on; "that's what makes me tremble...Do you eat at a
restaurant called the <i>Macaco Branco</i>?"</p>

<p>Lee nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought so! Two agents of the Gestapo who look like
Portuguese, but God knows what their real nationality may be,
will be dining there to-night. They plan to pick a quarrel with
you in the course of which you'll be knifed. In the confusion
they expect to escape through the kitchen."</p>

<p>Lee had recovered himself. "Fancy that!" he said. "How did you
hear of it?"</p>

<p>"These agents are a pretty worthless lot," said the Minister.
"Many of them, including my own, congregate in a bar near the
<i>Cais do Sodré</i>. One of my men happened to hear a whispered
conversation in English there. No doubt the thugs thought they
were safe in speaking English. You weren't named, but if you eat
at the <i>Macaco Branco</i>, of course you're the one they
referred to. Keep away from that place as you value your
life!"</p>

<p>"But it's an excellent restaurant," protested Lee. "The sole
with mussels is as good as it ever was in Paris. In all Lisbon, I
doubt if I could find a restaurant that would suit me so
well."</p>

<p>The Minister stared. "Surely you're not in earnest,
Mappin!"</p>

<p>Lee considered the situation. "If we stop going to that
restaurant, they'll find us somewhere else. We'll never know when
to expect an attack. But if we beard them there, it will
demoralize them. They'll never dare attack us in that place
again, and I can at least continue to eat well."</p>

<p>"Consider the risk!"</p>

<p>"William and I will be armed," said Lee in his mild way, "and
guns are quicker and more deadly than knives."</p>

<p>"Well, you know your own business best," said the Minister
with many shakes of the head.</p>

<p>Lee turned to William. "Am I not right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said William promptly. "If we let them get us on
the run we're done for."

<p><br>
AN hour later, Lee and William were entering the <i>Macaco
Branco</i>, which faced on the tiny square bearing the fine name
of <i>Largo do Socorro</i>. There was a long, narrow room with a
double line of tables, each set for four. The walls were
decorated with tropical scenes, and down at the end wall, looking
down the lines of tables, a handsome white monkey sat in an ilex
tree. A long time ago these pictures had been painted by a poor
artist in payment for his meals. With the passage of years, they
had become rather dingy, but the worn table linen was snowy and
the thick glasses shone like crystal.</p>

<p>It was early, and the tables were not all filled. Lee and
William bowed to all the regulars and paused to pass the time of
day with the Senhora at the counter. Her broad face was wreathed
in smiles. These were the only Americanos among her guests. She
approved of them highly, and hoped they might be the first of
many. The table they usually occupied was close to the kitchen
door.</p>

<p>"This would be just in line with the plans of our friends,"
remarked William.</p>

<p>"Let us hope that they will not get to carry out their plans,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>Lee, keeping the tail of an eye on the street door, studied
the <i>lista de comida</i>. He ordered a <i>galhina branca</i>
for the main dish, and with it chose to drink <i>Colares</i>,
another fragrant local wine that he favoured. He and William were
sipping it when two burly men entered the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Here they come," said Lee, putting down his glass.</p>

<p>The Senhora, seeing new customers, bustled out from behind her
counter. She offered them a table near the door, but they ignored
it, and came slowly back, looking from side to side as if to
choose the places that were most to their liking.</p>

<p>"It's a mistake to suppose that assassins give themselves away
in their faces," Lee said to William softly. "Look at these two,
with their smooth mugs and their neat and sober clothes. If you
didn't know better, you would swear that they were respectable
tradesmen or minor professional men. They are, however, just a
little <i>too</i> un-selfconscious; they are taking too much
pains <i>not</i> to look at us."</p>

<p>William's eyes behind the thick glasses were like points of
ice.</p>

<p>The newcomers, having chosen the table next to the Americans,
seated themselves and ostentatiously shook out their
<i>guardanapos</i>. One asked for the <i>lista</i>.</p>

<p>Lee took another sip of wine. "Well," he said, "let's get it
over with," and pushed his chair back. Facing the two at the next
table, he said with slightly exaggerated politeness: "Good
evening, gentlemen. I understand that you speak English."</p>

<p>The two men gaped at him like clowns. This was out of line
with their well-rehearsed programme. Their yellow faces turned
slightly greenish. Their team-play was broken up. One tried to
make believe that he was insulted; the other stammered:</p>

<p>"No, sare! No Angleez! No Angleez!"</p>

<p>The tall William with his glittering blue eyes stood close
beside Lee with his right hand thrust significantly in the pocket
of his jacket.</p>

<p>Lee continued in his pleasant voice: "I am told that it is
your intention to provoke a quarrel here and in the end to stick
a knife in me. I only want to warn you that we are ready for
you."</p>

<p>Their mouths fell open; their two faces made a picture of
comic dismay. They leaped up so suddenly that their chairs
crashed over backward. Snatching their hats, they charged blindly
for the door, knocking against the tables, colliding with the
waiters. In a flash they were gone. Lee and William looked at
each other and laughed.</p>

<p>"Qué há? Qué há?" demanded the distressed Senhora, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>"Scoundrels? Assassins! Malefactors!" said Lee with
gestures.</p>

<p>She got it. A new flood of Portuguese poured from her
lips.</p>

<p>"What's she saying?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Just thanking you for running them out of the place," said
William.</p>

<p>"Tell her the pleasure's mine!"</p>

<p>They resumed their seats and the <i>galhina branca</i>
appeared from the kitchen, lovely under its blanket of snowy
sauce. "Now we can enjoy our dinner," said Lee. "They won't
bother us again in this place."

<p><br>
ON the following morning at the office there was a letter from
Manoel in the mail. Freely rendered into English, the boy said
"with a thousand regrets" that they would not see him any more.
He had been warned that it would be extremely unhealthy to work
for "O Senhor Mappin." He was young, he said, and he wanted to
have some fun before he was liquidated.</p>

<p>"Well, we must try again," said Lee.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p class="first">One night, upon returning to the hotel after
listening to the <i>fado</i> singers, Lee and William saw an
incongruous figure loitering outside the entrance. It was a
middle-aged man who looked like a peasant labourer. His hair and
beard were matted and soiled, his clothes torn, his hat a wreck.
But there was something in the nobility of his glance that made
them look a second time.</p>

<p>"This person wants to see you, sir," said the commissionaire,
with a contemptuous jerk of his head.</p>

<p>When Lee turned around, a wild eagerness broke in the man's
face. "Mr. Mappin?" he stammered. "You are Mr. Mappin?" He spoke
English with a strong German accent.</p>

<p>Lee seized his dirty hand in both of his and pressed it.</p>

<p>"Erbelding!" he murmured, completely shaken out of his
affectation of calmness. "Thank God! Thank God! We had given you
up for lost!"</p>

<p>"You know me?" stammered the man.</p>

<p>"From your pictures...Your family?"</p>

<p>"They are safe, too," said the other, "...at least they were
an hour ago when I left them."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the railway station. The most public place seemed to be
the safest for them."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"But what an agony of terror they are enduring!"</p>

<p>"Let's go! Let's go!" cried Lee.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" asked Erbelding suspiciously.</p>

<p>"William Miller; a German like yourself who fights for
freedom."</p>

<p>They shook hands.</p>

<p>The Central Station was almost next door. As they hastened
along the pavement, tears were making channels down Erbelding's
grimy cheeks. Lee caught up his hand and pressed it.</p>

<p>"Don't notice me!" Erbelding murmured. "It is the relief!...we
have been through so much!...And such a slender hope of finding
help here!...The blessed face of a friend..."</p>

<p>"Don't talk," said Lee. "There'll be time later."</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs leading up to the station, Erbelding
held back. "What if the police have laid a trap for me here?" he
said nervously. "I have no papers. Anybody is privileged to
arrest me!"</p>

<p>Lee thought fast. "Look, William, engage a taxi, and have it
wait here at the foot of the stairs. Let Mr. Erbelding sit inside
it where he can't be seen, and you stand on the curb with your
hand on the door so I'll know which is the right cab when I come
back."</p>

<p>Erbelding wrung his hands. "She won't come with you. I have
instructed her not to move under any circumstances."</p>

<p>Lee pulled out his notebook. "She is familiar with your hand.
Write her a note on a page of my book. Write: 'This is our
friend, Mr. Mappin. Come!' and sign it Friedrich."</p>

<p>It was done, and, slipping the book in his pocket. Lee
scampered up the stairs. In the big waiting-room there was no
chance of mistaking the group he was looking for. There they sat,
a young flaxen-haired German woman, with three little tow-heads
pressing against her. All four faces, frozen with terror, were
still turned towards the archway through which their man had
disappeared. They were miserably unwashed and uncombed, and they
had not even so much as a lunch box to carry.</p>

<p>Also, across the room. Lee saw two cagey-looking, well-dressed
men&mdash;obviously somebody's secret agents, how well he knew
the type by now!&mdash;watching the Erbeldings.</p>

<p>Lee went quickly to the mother and her babes, and the two
watching men became alert. Lee said: "I am Mr. Mappin. Your
husband is waiting outside in a cab. Was afraid of running into a
trap. Come with me and you'll be safe."</p>

<p>All four pairs of clear blue eyes studied Lee's round face
with a heart-breaking look of doubt. Even the youngest, who could
not have been more than three. Lee thought with a kind of fury:
There are men in the world who could betray such innocence!
Slipping the notebook out of his pocket he showed the young woman
her husband's message in such a way that the watchers across the
room could not see what he was doing. The two men were edging
nearer.</p>

<p>She made up her mind.</p>

<p>"Come, children," she said in German. "This is our
friend."</p>

<p>Lee picked up the youngest, the mother took the other two by
the hand, and they started for the stairs. The two men followed.
The children's lips were pressed together; none made any sound.
The little one in Lee's arms leaned away from him a little, still
piteously searching his face as if she dared not let herself
believe that help had come.</p>

<p>At the foot of the broad stairs a taxi was waiting beside the
walk, with William Miller holding the door open. The father spoke
quietly to them from inside and, suddenly coming alive, the
children scrambled in, followed by their mother. Lee said to the
driver:</p>

<p>"<i>Rua Cachimbo, 23.</i>"</p>

<p>William squeezed in last. "Those men were near enough to hear
you," he murmured to Lee.</p>

<p>"Okay," said Lee. "That's part of the scheme."</p>

<p>They drove away. Looking through the back window, Lee saw the
two men enter another cab and follow. Inside, the children were
distributed on their parents' laps. There was much clinging and
soft weeping, but an enormous relief could be felt in the
air.</p>

<p>"<i>Ich hab' Hunger! Ich hab' Hunger</i>," whimpered the
little one.</p>

<p>"They haven't had anything since morning," explained the
mother apologetically.</p>

<p>"I'll take care of that," growled William.</p>

<p>The ride was a short one. As they turned into the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i>, Lee said to William:</p>

<p>"You run upstairs and turn on the lights in the front room,
and leave them burning. We'll go right on through the back and
get another cab for the <i>Alfama</i>. Follow us as fast as you
can."</p>

<p>"Right," said William. "I'll buy food on the way."</p>

<p>"Get plenty."</p>

<p>They drew up at number 23 and piled out on the walk. As he
shepherded his charges through the door, Lee, out of the tail of
his eye, saw the following car stop some yards behind them. One
man stood beside it watching, while the other darted into a shop.
To telephone! thought Lee.</p>

<p>Leaving William to pay the taxi, the others by-passed the
stairs and went on out through the back door into a narrow
passage which led them into a wider lane and thence into an
unfrequented street. Throughout this little journey the children
were as quiet as mice. Lee thought: They've learned to take
whatever comes!</p>

<p>The little street brought them to a thoroughfare where stores
were still open and traffic passing. Here they climbed into
another cab and Lee gave a new address; he now had enough
Portuguese to get around with.</p>

<p>"<i>Calcado Burro</i> at the end of <i>Rua dos
Bacalhoeiros</i>."</p>

<p>They sped away with the usual squawking of the horn. Lee
looked out of the back window until he was certain no other cab
was following.</p>

<p>"You can relax now," he said. "The danger is past."</p>

<p>This was a longer drive, and Friedrich Erbelding had time to
tell part of his story. "It was in Grenoble," he began, "that I
first heard the name of Amos Lee Mappin as one who had come to
Lisbon to help us and others like us. It remained in my memory.
In occupied France we found friends. We were travelling on a
false German passport. There was no difficulty until the fact of
our escape from Germany became known; then the Gestapo began
searching for us everywhere."</p>

<p>"How did you get across the Spanish border?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I engaged a fishing vessel to bring us from Perpignan in
France to a point on the coast of Spain near Barcelona. It cost
me dear, but it was the only way. In Barcelona I was arrested and
thrown into prison, and my family detained in another place. My
passport, my money and credits, everything I possessed, was taken
from me. I shall arrive in my new home a pauper!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that part," said Lee. "You'll be taken care
of."</p>

<p>"Charity!" said Erbelding bitterly.</p>

<p>"Not at all! Your books sell widely in America. There will be
royalties waiting for you, lecture dates if you want them; and
you can write more books...Go on with your story."</p>

<p>"When I was thrown into prison," Erbelding continued in a low
voice, "I thought it was the end. You can imagine my feelings in
respect to these helpless beings who depend on me. I cannot tell
you exactly what happened; I have no Spanish. In Barcelona there
are many brave Republicans. I suppose bribes were paid. In the
night I was led out of prison and brought to my family by unknown
friends. We were given tickets on the express to Madrid, some
money to buy food, and the address of another Republican in
Madrid. By a miracle we found him.</p>

<p>"The Gestapo is very strong in Madrid, and I was advised that
it would be impossible to travel further by railway. A cart and a
driver were secured for us, and we were driven by unfrequented
roads to the Portuguese border. We slept in farmhouses. The
people were kind. Poor people everywhere are kind. The driver put
me over the border by a smugglers' path. Then he had to leave us.
We walked the rest of the way to Lisbon, sleeping where we could.
That is why you find us in such a state."</p>

<p>"Good God!" murmured Lee. "These little kids!"</p>

<p>"In Lisbon," Erbelding continued simply, "I didn't know where
to go. I knew the Gestapo was here, too. All I had was a name I
had heard in Grenoble; Amos Lee Mappin. I enquired the way to the
leading hotel and I learned that you were living there. So I
waited and you came!"</p>

<p>"America will try to make it up to these children for what
they have been through," said Lee.</p>

<p>"It is my dream!" murmured their father.</p>

<p>They left the taxi at the opening to a steep and narrow street
that presently broke into steps continuing up. This was the
<i>Alfama</i>, a maze of narrow alleys running up and down in
every direction, breaking into steps, diving under archways,
crossing bridges over alleys below. Here and there, on an angle
that was not covered with buildings, grew a tree.</p>

<p>"No wheeled traffic in this part of the town," said Lee. "Only donkeys!"</p>

<p>Late as it was, there was plenty of life in the quarter. From
within the houses came the sound of guitars and singing; endless
conversation. Cloaked figures loitered in the doorways or
gossiped companionably from balcony to balcony overhead. Lee,
counting the corners, turned to the left and presently knocked on
a heavy oaken door. This alley ended in a cul-de-sac.</p>

<p>"Looks like a trap," said Lee, "but there's a way out in the
rear."</p>

<p>The door was opened by a neatly-dressed Portuguese woman, old
before her time. This was Teresa Chavez. She started to frown at
the soiled and bedraggled travellers. Lee, she knew. Lee pushed
forward the little children and her face melted. She murmured
compassionately and led the way through a tiled passage to the
room at the back that William had engaged for such an emergency.
It was a good-sized room and contained two big beds. The German
woman's harassed face lighted up at the sight as at a glimpse of
heaven.</p>

<p>Lee, indicating the children to the landlady, said
"Banho!"</p>

<p>The Portuguese woman's voluble answer floored him. He could
only shake his head and pull at his ears. However, it was clear
that she agreed that baths were desirable. Never ceasing to talk,
she dropped to her knees beside the littlest one and unfastened
its jacket. The child, staring with round eyes, made no
objection.</p>

<p>The mother understood the other woman better than Lee did.
Pointing to the baby, she said "Katti," to the little boy
"Hansi," and to the bigger girl "Trud'l."</p>

<p>Flinging her arms around Katti, Teresa administered a whole
fusilade of kisses. The alarmed child looked imploringly at her
mother, but said nothing.</p>

<p>William presently arrived laden with bottles of milk, loaves
of bread, butter, cheese, cooked meat and oranges. How the
children's eyes glistened! Their mother said firmly: "They must
be washed before they eat," and the three small faces fell.</p>

<p>"Have a heart!" said Lee. "They'll have to be washed
afterwards anyhow."</p>

<p>The mother relented. The food was spread on the table and the
children fell to. Lee watched them with delight. "Me, I'm fond of
my food, too," he said, "so I have a fellow-feeling." When the
edge of their appetite was taken off, they began to chatter
quietly together between bites in German.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, William had gone downstairs to the kitchen with
Teresa to consult about baths. The little house had two rooms on
the street level and a kitchen below, that looked out on a tiny
garden. William reported that there was no plumbing in the
ancient house, but Teresa was already fetching water from the
fountain, and there was plenty of fuel in the house to heat
it.</p>

<p>"We will leave you now," said Lee at last. "You are safe here,
so have a good sleep. Teresa is provided with funds to purchase
new clothes and whatever else you may need."</p>

<p>Erbelding started to protest.</p>

<p>"I'm not paying for this," said Lee, waving his hands. "The
money is put up by the admirers of your books in America...We'll
be back to-morrow," he went on. "You mustn't be anxious if it is
late before we get here. We'll be closely watched and we must
take no unnecessary risk of leading them here."</p>

<p>Lee and William backed out of the room, embarrassed by the
travellers' expressions of gratitude. Little Katti slipped out of
her chair and, running to Lee, held up her arms to be lifted, so
she could kiss him with a bread-and-buttery mouth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning, Lee was eating breakfast in his
sitting-room at the hotel when William came in. William had gone
out earlier to see what arrangements he could make.</p>

<p>"Had good luck," he said briefly. "The fishing-smack
<i>Enguia</i> is still lying at the <i>Cais do Sodré</i> and
Pedro was aboard her. He is willing to make the voyage to the
island of Fayal." William named a sum of money.</p>

<p>"Not too much," said Lee.</p>

<p>"He asked double," said William, "and according to
instructions I bargained with him. He expected it."</p>

<p>"When can he sail?"</p>

<p>"To-night."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"It is customary for the fishing boats to sail at night,"
William explained, "so it won't attract any attention. The
<i>Enguia</i> has a small cabin. The crew will sleep outside. I
don't suppose our friends will object to the hardships, after
what they have been through."</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Lee. "Wouldn't it be dangerous, though, to
embark the Germans in a public place like the <i>Cais do
Sodré</i>?"</p>

<p>"We talked about that. Chavez suggested that we carry them to
Belem by car. At ten o'clock to-night he will come ashore in a
small boat to pick them up at a point on the beach a hundred
yards west of the big tower. No one will be hanging around there
at such a time, he said, unless we are followed."</p>

<p>"We'll take care of that," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I gave him some more money on account," William went on, "to
lay in provisions for the passengers, including tinned milk,
fruit and so on for the children. Also clean bedding, towels,
soap and other things. Chavez is to receive the balance from
Westerholm upon the delivery of his passengers at Fayal."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "You thought of everything."</p>

<p>"I called at Teresa's house," said William. "Everything okay
there. Our friends were still sleeping. I left word for them to
be ready to start at nine to-night."</p>

<p>After William had eaten something, Lee proposed that they
visit the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>. "We must make it appear to those
who are watching us that we are keeping to our usual
routine."</p>

<p>They took a taxi from the hotel and were followed by another.
One of their trailers took up his post opposite number 23, while
the other went to telephone. Lee found the outer door to their
offices broken in. It bore only a flimsy lock and the damage was
not great. Inside, the electric light was still burning. The
place bore signs of having been ransacked, but that troubled them
little, because all compromising letters and telegrams were
destroyed as soon as read and digested.</p>

<p>Five minutes after their arrival, a dandified young officer of
police entered the office, complete with cocked hat, sword and
white gloves. Saluting smartly, he said: "I am sent by the
Minister of Police to request the Senhor Mappeen to accompany me
to the Ministry."</p>

<p>Lee's eyebrows ran up.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," he said, rising.</p>

<p>When William also rose, the officer said: "The presence of
this gentleman is not necessary."</p>

<p>"He's <i>got</i> to come," said Lee firmly. "He's my secretary
and interpreter."</p>

<p>The officer acquiesced with a shrug.</p>

<p>In an official car they sped through the streets, attended by
outriders on motor cycles. Driving into the courtyard of a
palatial building, they were conducted through corridors and a
waiting-room into a private office. An important-looking young
officer in uniform arose with a bow and introduced himself as
"Inspector da Gama." He spoke English.</p>

<p>"A distinguished name in Portugal," said Lee, bowing.</p>

<p>To the right of the inspector's desk sat a magnificent
personage, elderly, tall and slender, in impeccable morning
dress. He did not rise. The cropped head and dangling monocle,
the scarred cheek, proclaimed his nationality. Beside him sat a
little stooge, whose anxious eyes were continually searching his
master's face. On the other side of the Inspector at a smaller
desk sat a secretary-interpreter, who took down Lee's answers.
There was nobody else in the room.</p>

<p>The personage screwed his monocle into his face and looked Lee
over arrogantly. "And who is this gentleman?" Lee asked very
politely.</p>

<p>"He attends on behalf of a nation friendly to my country,"
said the Inspector. There was a hint of dryness in his voice.</p>

<p>Lee bowed ironically to the personage. "Charmed!" he
murmured.</p>

<p>The personage allowed the glass to fall out of his eye and
looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>Lee introduced William, and they seated themselves facing the
Inspector. The latter said:</p>

<p>"Senhor Mappin, I have to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"By all means!" said Lee with careful politeness. "May I
inquire if it is on behalf of the Portuguese Government or of the
government of this gentleman? This gentleman's government may be
friendly to the Government of Portugal, but I doubt its
friendliness to <i>my</i> government."</p>

<p>The Inspector bit his lip. "It is the Portuguese Government
that desires information," he said.</p>

<p>"Then, if I may ask," said Lee, "Why does this gentleman
honour us with his presence during the interrogation?"</p>

<p>"Patience, Senhor. That will presently appear."</p>

<p>Lee was heartened by a certain brightness that had appeared in
the officer's eye. The personage must have sensed it, too, but it
was nothing he could object to. He became stiffer than ever. His
little attendant looked terrified.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin, what is your business in Lisbon?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"By profession I am an author," said Lee. "I am about to write
a book about your beautiful city and I am here to gather material
for it."</p>

<p>"We are honoured," said the Inspector, bowing. "Why, if you
are only an author, was it necessary for you to rent an office on
the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>?"</p>

<p>"I have to know the people of Lisbon," said Lee. "I walk about
and make the acquaintance of fishermen, porters, newsboys, all
kinds. I could not talk to such people in the <i>Lisboa
Palace</i>, so I ask them to come to this humble office where I
can question them about their lives."</p>

<p>A sound like a snort escaped the Personage, but the Inspector
of Police was pleased with this answer, which let him out.</p>

<p>He took a new tack. "Mr. Mappin, I am informed that you met a
woman with three children at the Central Station last night and
carried them to the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>."</p>

<p>"That is correct, Senhor Inspector."</p>

<p>"Who were these people?"</p>

<p>"I forget the name," said Lee blandly; "some common German
name like Schmidt."</p>

<p>"Senhor," protested the Inspector. "How could you so soon
forget the name of people you were appointed to meet?"</p>

<p>"There was no appointment, Senhor. The meeting was accidental.
When my secretary and I returned to the hotel last night, a
wretched man accosted me at the door. He had brought his wife and
children to Lisbon, he said, and here they were without money or
food. I had never seen the man before, but my heart was touched
by his story. I hastened back to the station with him and picked
up his family. I gave them money for food. They said they had
friends in Oporto and I supplied them with money for the tickets.
That's where they've gone, I suppose."</p>

<p>"There were no more trains to Oporto last night, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Well, they had money enough for a night's lodging. They took
the morning train, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Senhor, why did you find it necessary to leave the house on
<i>Rua Cachimbo</i> by the back door?"</p>

<p>"Because we had been followed to the front door," said Lee
quickly. "It appears that I am followed in Lisbon wherever I
go."</p>

<p>"Not by my men," said the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Senhor," said the Inspector. "This man you assisted is
described to us as a dangerous criminal seeking to escape
justice."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Lee, opening his eyes wide. "Of course I knew
nothing about this. One does not think of hungry little children
as criminals."</p>

<p>"You are right, Senhor. Where did you feed them?"</p>

<p>"I could not take them to a restaurant," said Lee. "They were,
well, too dirty, Senhor. We stopped at a shop and my secretary
went in to buy food. They fed themselves in the taxi, while we
took another cab and returned to our hotel."</p>

<p>"The address of the food shop?"</p>

<p>William gave it.</p>

<p>The Personage rose abruptly. A rusty flush was creeping up
over his withered neck and into his cheeks. "Enough!" he said
harshly. "This man is lying, as you are well aware, Inspector. It
makes farce of your neutrality! Senhor Salazar shall hear of
this!" He marched out of the room with the little stooge creeping
at his heels and casting terrified glances behind him.</p>

<p>Lee and the Inspector exchanged a glance&mdash;not entirely
neutral. "Senhor," said the latter gravely, "Believe me, you are
in the most extreme danger. Unless you can satisfy me that there
is nothing in this gentleman's charge, I can't give you the
protection of the police."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," said Lee guardedly. "If you will let me
have a car, I'll drive directly to the United States Legation and
ask the protection of our Minister."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked relieved. "That would be much the better
plan. The car you came in is waiting in the courtyard." Coming
out from behind the desk, he offered his hand. "How do you say
it? Good lok, Senhor."</p>

<p>They drove to the Legation with their hooting escort. At the
door Lee said to the police chauffeur: "Do not wait for me. It
may be some time before I can obtain an audience with his
Excellency, the Minister. I will take a taxi back to my
hotel."</p>

<p>The moment the Minister caught sight of Lee he said: "You have
brought important news?"</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Lee, "do I give everything away in my
face?"</p>

<p>"Only to a friend."</p>

<p>"Well, it's true. The friends whom we gave up for lost have
turned up in Lisbon."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" cried the Minister, staring. "Is it
true?...Well, thank God! Where are they?"</p>

<p>"For your own sake, you'd better not know," said Lee. "Safe
for the present."</p>

<p>"Right! The next thing is to get them out of Lisbon."</p>

<p>"It's all arranged," said Lee. "For to-night."</p>

<p>Striding across the room, the Minister clapped Lee on the
shoulder. "Mappin, you're a wonder!"</p>

<p>"I almost think I am!" said Lee, grinning.</p>

<p>"Can I help?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I suspect the Gestapo may force the Lisbon police to
send out a general alarm for the little family. Three little
tow-headed kids, fatally easy to identify in this dark-haired city!
Therefore, I dare not transport them in taxicabs. Have you a car
in the establishment that doesn't show the U.S. coat of arms that
I could borrow for to-night?"</p>

<p>"They all have to carry the official license plates, but I
have private plates for an emergency."</p>

<p>"And a chauffeur you can trust? The Gestapo knows that our
family is in Lisbon."</p>

<p>"I think I can trust him, but he's not an American...No! by
God! If you need a chauffeur I'll drive the car myself!"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head decisively. "If you were discovered it
would provoke a diplomatic crisis. William can be the chauffeur.
It's only that I don't want him to have to come here to get the
car."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll have my chauffeur park the car on the east
side of the <i>Praça do Carmo</i>&mdash;you know where that is?
North of the <i>Rua Garrett</i>."</p>

<p>Lee nodded.</p>

<p>"He will lock the car," the Minister went on, "and bring me
the key. I'll send the key by another servant to you at your
hotel."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "William will pick up the car at the
<i>Praca do Carmo</i> about 7.15."</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin," put in William agitatedly, "I can't leave your
side on a day like this."</p>

<p>Lee wagged his hand soothingly. "Now, William don't begin that
again. We're in the same danger alone or together, the same for
me, and a greater danger for you."</p>

<p>William frowned. "But Mr. Mappin..."</p>

<p>"We'll discuss that later," said Lee. To the Minister he went
on: "Could you furnish Erbelding a United States passport just on
my say-so?"</p>

<p>"Not the customary passport. But I can give him a letter that
will carry him past all U.S. officials. And of course I'll cable
the State Department that he's on the way." He sat down to write
the letter on the spot. "What's the wife's name?"</p>

<p>"Gertrude."</p>

<p>"And the children?"</p>

<p>"Trud'l, aged 7, Hansi 5 and Katti 3."</p>

<p>The seal of the United States was affixed to this document,
and the Minister handed it over. As Lee and William were leaving,
he said longingly:</p>

<p>"I wish I could go all the way in this with you two men."</p>

<p>"You have trouble enough," said Lee.

<p><br>
AT half-past six Lee set out for the <i>Macaco Branco</i> as
usual. William was to take a different course and have the
legation car waiting in the <i>Rua dos Bacalhoeiros</i> at the
mouth of <i>Calcado Peixe</i> at nine o'clock. The keys of the
car had been received. William was still reluctant to divide
forces.</p>

<p>"It gives us two chances," said Lee. "If you should be stopped
I can chance taking the Erbeldings to Belem by taxi, and if I am
stopped, you can run up the back way and fetch them to your car.
Do not be anxious about me. I will not be liquidated as long as
they think I may lead them to the Erbeldings. After they find out
that their prey has escaped them, then look out!"</p>

<p>Lee was followed to the restaurant by two men. These
men&mdash;not the same two that he had put to rout on a former
occasion&mdash;waited from the little square opposite the
restaurant. Lee ate his dinner with his customary deliberation.
When he paid his bill he said to the Senhora: "I want to pay my
compliments to the cook." Maybe she understood him, maybe not. At
any rate, he went back into the kitchen. It was a tidy place with
rows of copper pots hanging from above. There was a door with
glass panes giving on an alley, but&mdash;alas for Lee's
plans!&mdash;one of the watchers had come around and was loafing
in the alley.</p>

<p>Lee had no intention of trusting himself alone with the man in
a dark alley; he returned through the restaurant and asked Madame
to phone for a cab. When it came, he climbed in and had himself
driven to the Central Station. On the night before, he had
unconsciously noted the layout of the station. It had two broad
stairways, one on each side. Lee scampered up one side, ran
across the concourse as fast as his short legs would carry him
and down the other stairway. The sight of a running man in a
railway station attracted no particular attention. At the foot of
the stairs he dived into the first taxi in the rank.</p>

<p>"Take me to Black Horse Square," he said.</p>

<p>The ruse was successful. He was not followed. After waiting
about at the square for a minute or two to make certain, he took
another cab to the <i>Rua dos Bacalhoeiros</i>. No other cab
tailed him; he let out a long breath of relief and relaxed.</p>

<p>At Teresa's house he found the Erbelding family all dressed in
their new clothes and ready to go. After twenty-four hours of
rest and good feeding, Trud'l, Hansi and Katti looked as good as
new. Each member of the family now had a little satchel to carry,
and the father a small tin trunk ready to hoist on his shoulder.
Lee glanced at these objects with some anxiety; another means of
ready identification. However, if William kept the appointment,
they would only be exposed to the public view for a few
seconds.</p>

<p>Lee explained the plans that had been made for them. The
mother paled a little at the thought of an ocean voyage in a
fishing-smack, but said nothing; the father was dumb with
gratitude. Afterwards, all sat in a strained silence waiting for
the zero hour. Teresa kept offering the children more food until
they turned away their heads. She stuffed their pockets with
bananas.</p>

<p>At five minutes to nine, Lee, with a final glance at his
watch, said: "Well, let's go!"</p>

<p>Teresa burst into noisy weeping and embraced the children one
after another. She led them out the back door of the house and
across a tiny garden to a door in the garden wall. Here they left
her, wiping her eyes on her apron.</p>

<p>Turning to the right in a narrow passage between walls, they
went down a flight of steps, passed under a building through a
sort of tunnel, and found themselves in a narrow, winding street.
This was the <i>Calcado Peixe</i>, which ran steeply down to the
<i>Rua dos Bacalhoeiros</i>. The passage of Lee's little party
attracted a good deal of notice from the loiterers in the
doorways; however, there were no policemen in this out-of-the-way
lane. What Lee feared was the brightly lighted street below. Big
in his mind loomed the question: Will William be there?</p>

<p>At the last turn in the <i>Calcado</i>, Lee halted his convoy
in the shadow while he looked around. His heart gave a leap of
joy when he saw the big black Legation car resting squarely
across the opening below, with William sitting at the wheel. A
slight puffing at the rear told him that the engine was
running.</p>

<p>They hastened down the last few yards. William saw them
coming, and, leaning out, opened the rear door. They scrambled
in, the door slammed, and the car started westward. The three
children sat on the floor so that no tell-tale white heads should
show through the windows.</p>

<p>Keeping to the level streets close to the river, William drove
at customary Portuguese breakneck speed. At such a speed there
was little danger of a chance recognition through the windows.
Westward to Black Horse Square, across the <i>Cais das
Columnas</i>, the <i>Praça do Municipio</i>, past the long Marine
Arsenal and back to the quays again to reach Belem. They had to
cross the whole of Lisbon. There was no conversation. The little
children crouched in the bottom of the limousine without making a
sound.</p>

<p>So speedy was their passage that they reached Belem almost
half an hour too soon. Lee had William drive on to the West for
several miles at a more moderate speed and back again. Nobody
took any interest in their progress. Finally William drew up at
the corner of a quiet street in Belem. He had been over the whole
route earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>"This is the nearest we can drive to the beach," he said.</p>

<p>Off to the right the great medieval fortress rose against the
stars with its battlemented tower like a gigantic pepper-shaker.
Turning to the left, they silently proceeded through a lane
between garden walls, meeting nobody. Another sharp turn brought
them out on a shingly beach. The black river lapped it softly
and, stretching away, lost itself in the night. Far away, pin-point
lights sparkled.</p>

<p>Glancing at the shadowy tower, William said: "This is about a
hundred yards east."</p>

<p>"He might not land at this exact spot," said Lee. "Better walk
up and down."</p>

<p>William vanished in the darkness. The others sat against an
overturned boat to wait. Soon William reappeared, saying:</p>

<p>"Pedro is coming."</p>

<p>A heavy boat pulled by two men grounded on the shingle. The
oarsmen got out and joined the waiting group.</p>

<p>"This is Pedro," said William, "and this is Carlos."</p>

<p>In the dark, Lee had to take them on trust; however, there was
something in their tall, lean figures, in the way they kept their
heads up, in the firm clasp of their hard hands, and in their
deep, male voices that inspired confidence.</p>

<p>The final arrangements were quickly made. It appeared they had
made other voyages to the western islands; they had worked for
Mr. Westerholm; they knew his place; there was a little beach
immediately below his house where the passengers could be put
ashore in secrecy and safety.</p>

<p>"How about petrol?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"We have sufficient for the outward journey, Senhor. Senhor
Westerholm will provide for the return."</p>

<p>"He will be expecting you," said Lee. "I'll cable."</p>

<p>"Make your mind at ease, Senhor," said Pedro in his deep, slow
voice. "The accommodations are rough, but we have carried a lady
before and she did not complain. There is plenty to eat and
drink. Your friends will be in good hands!"</p>

<p>"Good luck to you all!" said Lee.</p>

<p>He squatted down to give each of the children a hug. At a word
from their father, the stoical little beings allowed the
fishermen to lift them into the boat. The father and mother clung
to Lee's and to William's hand, struggling to find speech to
thank them.</p>

<p>"Not a word!" protested Lee. "We'll meet again in happier days
and talk our heads off!"</p>

<p>The father and mother followed their children and the
fishermen pushed off. Lee and William followed the boat with
their eyes until darkness swallowed it. They returned to the
car.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p class="first">THE lock on the office door in the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i> was repaired. Lee and William continued to spend a
while there every day as a feint. Meanwhile, William found
another room where they could carry on their business over one of
the jewellery shops in the <i>Rua Augusta</i>. This was near the
post-office where they had to go every day. By the reckless use
of taxicabs, with many changes en route, they kept the secret of
their new address from those who continually watched and followed
them.</p>

<p>Lee grew weary of the continual espionage. The spies were
often changed. One night, walking from the restaurant to the
hotel, they found themselves trailed by two new men. These looked
like Portuguese, and therefore less formidable than the usual
hard-faced men without a country. Lee said to William:</p>

<p>"Let's brace them, just for fun."</p>

<p>Turning around, they walked up to their sleuth hounds, who
became extremely self-conscious and tried to pass. Lee planted
himself squarely in their path. They were in front of a motion
picture theatre.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," said Lee pleasantly. "Wouldn't you
enjoy seeing this show?" At the same time he showed them the
corner of a fifty-escuda bill, which represented a couple of
American dollars.</p>

<p>These were simple fellows and, being found out, they couldn't
think of anything else to do but accept Lee's offer. They nodded
and grinned. Lee gave them each one of the bills, bought them
tickets at the bureau, and saw them inside the swinging doors.
After lingering a minute to make sure they didn't come out again,
Lee and William walked on.</p>

<p>"Now I feel as light as air," said Lee. "We can mooch about a
while and see the sights."</p>

<p>Crossing the Roçio, the principal square where the electricos
start, they were accosted by a newsboy whose post was on an
island between two streams of traffic. He was about seventeen
years old. Half boy, half man, he wore his ragged clothes with a
gallant air, cap cocked on one side of his head and a damaged
carnation in his buttonhole. The expression of good-humoured
impudence in his bright eyes appealed to Lee.</p>

<p>Sizing up Lee from head to foot in a lightning glance, the
youth drew a paper from his bundle, saying: "Americano gentleman.
I spik Americano; hokay; out of this world!" He thrust the paper
under Lee's nose. "Here you are, Gentleman; <i>New York
Times</i>!"</p>

<p>Lee, having a mind to draw him out, affected to scowl and
shake his head angrily. "Nein! Nein! Deutscher!"</p>

<p>The youth turned his head and spat on the pavement with
inimitable contempt.</p>

<p>Lee was delighted. "Here, give me that paper!" he said. "I was
fooling you. So you don't like Germans."</p>

<p>In untranslatable Portuguese, the young man voiced his opinion
of the race.</p>

<p>"Walk along beside me a little," said Lee. "I've got a
proposition to make you...William, how the hell do you say
proposition?"</p>

<p>"He's got the idea," said William dryly.</p>

<p>Lee passed the young fellow a folded fifty escudas note.
"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Bosco, gentleman." He executed a few dance steps.</p>

<p>"Listen, Bosco. The Gestapo hangs out at a hotel in the <i>Rua
Azorrague</i>, 38. I'll pay well for any important information
you can bring me from there. Get me?"</p>

<p>Bosco nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't expect you to get inside the building, but I know
they employ Portuguese servants. You can pal up with them."</p>

<p>An enthusiastic nod from Bosco. Obviously he was charmed by
the opportunity of doing a little secret service.</p>

<p>"Is this your regular stand?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, gentleman."</p>

<p>"Go on selling your papers here each night," Lee continued.
"My friend and I will be passing by. Always offer us a paper
before you say anything, because we are usually followed. I'll
tip you off where we can meet. And, listen Bosco. My name is
Mappin. Say it."</p>

<p>"Senhor Mappeen."</p>

<p>"Right. What I specially want to know is anything the Germans
say about me. Savvy?"</p>

<p>"Hokay, gentleman."</p>

<p>After they had passed on, Lee said to William: "Of course, I'm
taking a chance on the boy; but if he does sell us out to the
Germans, they can't hate us any worse than they do already. At
the same time, I have a hunch that this boy is going to serve
us."</p>

<p>"When he does have something to report to us," said William,
"how will you arrange to receive it? We can't shake off our
trailers every night."</p>

<p>"He can telephone to the hotel."</p>

<p>"The Germans may have got at the switchboard operators."</p>

<p>"We'll test that out when we get back."</p>

<p>In the hotel, they paused in the lounge before going up
stairs. The effulgent Miss Kate McDonald came swimming to greet
them. In a black dinner dress with rhinestones, she looked
dazzling.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brown!" she cried. "I'm so glad to find you! I just got
back. I asked for you at the bureau, but they said there was no
such person stopping there."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a secret," said Lee. "My name is not Brown, but
Mappin; Amos Lee Mappin."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then you're the famous author!"</p>

<p>"Not too famous," said Lee.</p>

<p>"I have always wanted to know a famous author!" she gushed. "I
would so like to be able to write myself...I'm just going in for
a late dinner. Won't you join me?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Lee, "we have just eaten. We're full to the
neck."</p>

<p>"Too bad!" said Miss McDonald. "I have a holiday for a few
days. Can't we see a little of this town together?"</p>

<p>"Delightful!"</p>

<p>"How about to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Sorry. To-morrow my secretary and I are booked up all
day."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be seeing you again." She sailed away.</p>

<p>As Lee made for the lift he growled to William: "Is it
possible the fool woman still thinks I'm not on to her?...She's
very handsome," he added regretfully. "I'll call up the Legation
now."</p>

<p>William returned downstairs to watch the switchboard.</p>

<p>From his sitting-room above, Lee called up the Legation.
Getting the Minister on the wire, he said:</p>

<p>"I have a little piece of news for you. My fellow-traveller,
Miss Kate McDonald, is back. You remember what I told you about
her."</p>

<p>"Surely. The British Embassy will be interested. And in return
for your piece of news, here is one for you. I have a dispatch
from Basle saying that your other fellow-traveller, Ronald
Franklin, has booked a place on the plane for Lisbon to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Really! What a coincidence!"</p>

<p>"I'll have him met at the air port in the afternoon, and
report further."</p>

<p>"Many thanks," said Lee.</p>

<p>In a few minutes William came upstairs. He said: "I had my eye
on the switchboard girl while you were talking. She didn't know I
was watching her."</p>

<p>"Did she make notes of the conversation?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>William shook his head. "Didn't even listen. She was gossiping
with a friend on another wire."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "Then that means of communication is open."

<p><br>
BEFORE starting out for dinner next day, Lee called up the
Legation again. "What about our traveller from Basle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said the Minister ruefully. "My friends, after seeing
him descend from the plane, lost him on the way into town."</p>

<p>After dinner, as Lee and William returned across the
<i>Roçio</i> trailed at a distance of fifty yards by a couple of
men who were certainly not Portuguese, they saw Bosco again. He
thrust a paper at Lee. The young fellow's speaking eyes
proclaimed that he already had something to report. To gain a
moment, Lee dropped the paper, and as Bosco picked it up,
murmured: "Wait a while and phone me at the <i>Lisboa
Palace</i>." With the change for the paper, he passed Bosco a
bill folded small. Bosco palmed it as expertly as a magician.</p>

<p>Later, in their suite, William took down Bosco's communication
over the phone, since the young fellow was more fluent in
Portuguese. Lee, listening with some impatience, was surprised at
the length of it.</p>

<p>"Smart lad that," said William when he hung up. "Apparently
you were not mistaken in him." William read from his notes,
translating as he went: "Bosco hung around the <i>Rua
Azorrague</i> all morning. All the people in that neighbourhood
spend their time gossiping about the Germans. They are well
hated, Bosco says. With his bundle of papers under his arm, he
can go anywhere without attracting attention. He scraped
acquaintance with a Portuguese fellow who is employed by the
Germans as a porter and messenger.</p>

<p>"The porter couldn't tell him anything, but he had a friend,
also Portuguese, who operates the lift in the hotel and does
various inside jobs. This man has picked up quite a little German
while working there, and as the Germans don't realize it, they
sometimes give themselves away in his hearing. He said he had
heard your name but couldn't connect it with anything. Bosco, the
porter and the lift operator met in a <i>leiteria</i> at lunch
time. Bosco said he didn't get much from them then, but he
divided the fifty escudos, and so laid the foundation of a
beautiful friendship.</p>

<p>"At six-thirty," William continued, "when the porter and the
lift operator came off work, the three met again at the same
place. The lift operator said a new German had arrived during the
afternoon. He understood this man had come from the airport. He
carried a suitcase. It was a tall, blond fellow, maybe thirty
years old, wearing American style clothes. He Heil-Hitlered with
all the other Germans. This would be Franklin, of course."</p>

<p>Lee smiled. "We'll have him if he tries to travel on that
American passport again!"</p>

<p>"As Franklin went into a room with the other Germans," William
continued, "the lift operator heard your name spoken. Then the
door closed and he could hear no more. Shortly after five,
Franklin left the hotel. The lift operator carried his suitcase
out to the curb and heard him tell the taxi-driver to take him to
the <i>Victoria</i>. That's all."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Lee. "To-morrow night I'll give Bosco a
hundred escudos."</p>

<p>With a smile, Lee then called up the Legation. When he got the
Minister on the wire, he said, not without malice: "I can add a
little to your news of our friend from Basle."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Upon leaving the airport he drove direct to the hotel of our
acquaintances in the <i>Rua Azorrague</i>. After spending a
couple of hours in consultation with them, he was driven to the
<i>Hotel Victoria</i>."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Minister sorely. "You enjoy better service than
I do!"

<p><br>
WHEN they returned to their suite after dinner on the
following night, a note in a plain envelope was brought to their
door.</p>

<p>"Where did this come from?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Delivered just now by a private messenger, Senhor. He said
there would be no answer."</p>

<p>On a plain sheet of paper inside appeared two lines of
typewriting; no superscription; no signature:</p>

<p>The <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> has discovered that Herr E. and
family have escaped the country. A word to the wise.

<p><br>
"THIS was inspired by Inspector da Gama," said Lee. "He's a
good fellow."</p>

<p>Soon after, there was a call from Bosco. William, after taking
down his communication, reported to Lee.</p>

<p>"This afternoon about three a grey sedan stopped before the
door of the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> in the <i>Rua Azorrague</i>.
This was a private car, not a taxicab. It was driven by a tall
young man with a wicked-looking face; has a scar down one side. A
short, heavy-built man got out and went in. Has a face so ugly
you would never forget it, Bosco said, like a <i>cão de fila</i>,
he means bulldog. After a little while the young man with the
scarred face came back on foot and went into the hotel. So Bosco
assumed he had put the car in a garage and that these two are
going to stop at the <i>Excelsior</i>. The car carried a French
license plate."</p>

<p>"Good observation," put in Lee. "That boy's all right."</p>

<p>"At quarter-past six," William resumed, "Bosco met his two
friends at the <i>leiteria</i>. The lift operator had not yet
learned the name of the Bulldog visitor, but he's evidently a big
shot. Has all the others scared speechless. He closeted himself
in a room with the local leaders. He pounded the table and
shouted so loud, he could be heard all the way to the elevator.
But not what he said. The lift operator could not go any closer
because some of the Gestapo men were listening outside the
door.</p>

<p>"When the Bulldog came out of the room he was still in a rage.
Cursed everybody who got in his way. The local leader of the
Gestapo is a tall, skinny man with a prominent Adam's apple and a
long nose. Bosco calls him the Stork, but his name is really
Schoenhut. Schoenhut, it seems, is an amorous fellow, and as such
is an object of ridicule to the Portuguese in the <i>Rua
Azorrague</i>. He was sweet on the cigar-maker's daughter. She
led him on. One night she invited him into the room back of the
store where her boy friends were waiting. They gave Schoenhut's
jacket a terrible dusting. The whole street is laughing over the
story.</p>

<p>"The Bulldog happened to meet Schoenhut in a corridor and gave
him a terrible dressing-down before all the others. He slapped
his face so hard that Schoenhut staggered against the wall. Yet
he took it without a word. They are all ready to crawl on their
bellies before the Bulldog. The telephone was going all
afternoon. Men were continually coming in and being sent out in
different directions. The slick fellow who looks like an American
was one of the busiest. In the scraps of conversation that reach
the lift operator's ears, two names recurring. One sounded like
Urbaldino, the other was Mappin."</p>

<p>"Something cooking," said William as he concluded.</p>

<p>"Obviously," said Lee, "and it promises us no good."</p>

<p>"I suggest we stay in our rooms to-morrow," said William. "We
have Bosco to report what our enemies are doing, and we can
telephone the Legation."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Lee. "But we're not going to ask the Legation for
help except in the direst necessity...Let's go downstairs and buy
some reading matter before we retire from the world."</p>

<p>Outside the lounge, as Lee turned away from the news-stand
with an armful of magazines, he came face to face with Ronald
Franklin. The young man's face lighted up; his glance was
apparently as open as the sky. "What a pleasure!" he cried,
offering his hand.</p>

<p>Lee took it. William watched Franklin, stiffening. Lee did not
feel that any harm could come to himself there in the lounge of
the <i>Lisboa Palace</i>; moreover, he felt a professional
interest in such a perfect specimen of effrontery. Franklin's
busy eyes took everything in and gave nothing away. Lee lingered
to draw him out a little. William was disgusted.</p>

<p>"I got back yesterday," said Franklin enthusiastically. "I'm
registered at the <i>Victoria</i>. This old dump is a little too
rich for my blood."</p>

<p>"How's business?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Not too good. The demand exceeds the supply. I've been
combing Switzerland for fine watch movements. No dice."</p>

<p>"When do you sail for America?"</p>

<p>"I'll travel by plane if I can get a place. A mere civilian
like me doesn't stand much of a chance against the brass
hats."</p>

<p>Franklin detained Lee for several minutes longer by describing
his alleged experiences on the recent journey to Switzerland, Lee
listened with a half-smile, mentally adding the young man to his
gallery of specimens for future use.</p>

<p>When he and William finally made their way to the lift, Lee
said: "He's wasted as a spy&mdash;and a second-string spy at
that. He has the makings of a great actor."</p>

<p>William growled: "If I had his smooth throat under my thumbs,
how I would enjoy squeezing it!...I wonder what brought him here
to-night?"</p>

<p>Lee had no answer to that.</p>

<p>Ever afterwards, he was to remember a little talk he had with
William that night before they turned in. They were seated in the
red velvet chairs with the antimacassars, smoking a last pipe.
William's face, as always, was as blank as a sheet of note-paper
that has not been written on. The thick lenses guarded the
secrets of his eyes. Yet every now and then Lee received an
intimation that William at heart was one of the simple, kind-hearted
Germans that typified the race in happier times. It was
the experience of unspeakable wickedness and injury that had
driven him in on himself and made him hard. Lee had become
strongly attached to William.</p>

<p>"William," he said, "do you sometimes become weary of the
everlasting strain of danger we are under?"</p>

<p>Even the thick lenses could not conceal William's startled
glance then. "Why...why, I don't think of it," he said. "I accept
it as my fate."</p>

<p>"But you remember a time when a man could take his ease and
let himself go?"</p>

<p>"Please," said William in a distressed voice, "I would rather
not talk about those days."</p>

<p>Lee spared him. Later he said: "This Bulldog that Bosco tells
us about sounds like a pretty important guy. You know the Gestapo
better than I do. Have you any idea who he is?"</p>

<p>William nodded. "The French license plate gave me a clue. It
will be Albrecht Stengel. He is chief of the Gestapo in the
occupied countries."</p>

<p>"Stengel!" cried Lee. "The Butcher of Paris! My God, William,
we must be big men in their eyes if they send Stengel after us!"
Lee jumped up and paced the room. "Stengel is an adversary worth
having! If we could put an end to Stengel's foul career it would
be as good as winning a battle, William!"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said William grimly, "if he doesn't put an end to us
first!"

<p><br>
LEE awoke in his bed feeling giddy and sick. Some moments
passed before his brain cleared sufficiently for him to realize
where he was. Then he saw by the square of brightness on the
carpet that the sun was high in the sky. Focussing his eyes with
difficulty, he glanced at his watch. Nearly noon! He sat up
abruptly and such a wave of giddiness came over him, he had to
press his knuckles against his eyes and wait for it to pass. When
he felt better, he put out his hand towards the water bottle on
the night table&mdash;and quickly drew it back again. There's
something the matter with me, he thought. I never oversleep like
this. I've been drugged. Maybe it's in the water.</p>

<p>He put his feet to the floor and, holding his head between his
hands, staggered to the door leading to the sitting-room. He got
it open; he looked into the room beyond, and his heart sank like
a stone. William's bed was tumbled and empty. Lee was aware of a
sickening sense of loss. The quiet William, who said so little
and who felt so much!</p>

<p>With a great effort of his will, Lee cleared his foggy brain
and searched the room foot by foot with trained eyes. William's
clothes were gone; a couple of small coins lay on the carpet; his
clothes, then, had been snatched up in a hurry. The bedclothes
were not thrown back, as they are when a man rises, but tumbled
in a heap. An extra blanket which William was accustomed to throw
over the back of a chair was gone. There was another bottle of
water on a stand beside the bed, half empty like his own. Both he
and William were great water drinkers. Had somebody counted on
that?</p>

<p>Finally, lying on the carpet near the door to the corridor,
Lee saw a significant clue, the key to their suite. Yet he
remembered how William had always taken care to turn the key
sideways in the lock so it could not be pushed through. They must
have had a thin instrument to turn the key from the outside. When
Lee tried the door it was locked. So they had a pass key! Why
William instead of me? Lee asked himself.</p>

<p>Upon examining the necks of the two water bottles under a
strong glass, Lee found strange fingerprints. Unfortunately, his
prints and William's covered them. But by piecing bits of the
strange prints together he was able to secure and preserve a
complete set, fingers and thumb of a right hand.</p>

<p>When Lee considered how to meet the situation, despair seized
on him. William was his sole prop. He couldn't speak but a few
words of the language of the country. What was he to do first? A
blankness faced him. Lee shook his head violently to rid himself
of such unnerving thoughts and started for the telephone. Before
he reached it, the bell sounded.</p>

<p>He heard a male voice, unknown to him, ask in slow, careful
English: "Is this Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lee. "To whom am I speaking?"</p>

<p>"Are you looking for your secretary?" The sleek voice seemed
to writhe with malevolence like a snake.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Lee asked again.</p>

<p>He heard a short laugh. "A friend...Your secretary is waiting
for you at <i>Rua Cachimbo, 23</i>." Click. The connection was
broken.</p>

<p>Lee immediately called the number of his office on the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i>. There was no answer.</p>

<p>He called the Ministry of Police and asked to be connected
with Inspector da Gama.</p>

<p>While he waited with the receiver at his ear, William's
question of the night before came into his mind: "I wonder what
brought Franklin here to-night?" An answer suggested itself:
While Franklin kept me in talk downstairs, the woman slipped into
our suite&mdash;I know they had a pass-key&mdash;and doctored the
water bottles!</p>

<p>When he heard the Inspector's voice, he said: "This is Mappin
speaking."</p>

<p>"Yes, Senhor Mappin."</p>

<p>"My Secretary, William Miller, has disappeared from the hotel.
He would not leave me voluntarily at such a time. I fear that an
ugly crime has been committed. Can you come?"</p>

<p>"Immediately, Senhor!"</p>

<p>"Bring a sufficient escort," said Lee dryly.</p>

<p>He ordered coffee from the restaurant and dressed himself. His
nerves had quieted now and his hand was steady. Before he
finished drinking the coffee, Inspector da Gama arrived with two
plain-clothes men. The anxious resident director of the hotel
followed at his heels, but this elegant gentleman was requested
to wait in the corridor for the present.</p>

<p>Lee told his story briefly. On hearing it, the Inspector
said:</p>

<p>"We will proceed to the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>."</p>

<p>"It may be a trap," warned Lee.</p>

<p>"Possibly," said the Inspector, "but I do not think so. It is
too obvious. Any case, the police are prepared for traps...I'll
leave men in the hotel to start an investigation&mdash;unless you
wish to be present."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "I don't understand the language. I would
only delay matters. But leave a man who can make an intelligent
report."</p>

<p>Leaving the detectives in the suite, they descended in the
lift and picked up two more men in the foyer. Lee, expecting the
worst, carried the little satchel in which he kept his aids to
detection. The police car waited in the street with its motor
cycle escort. During the drive, Lee was aware of nothing in the
streets; his eyes were turned inward. The same question was still
plaguing him, and he put it to the Inspector:</p>

<p>"Why did they choose him instead of me?"</p>

<p>"Because he was German," said da Gama. "They hated him worse
than you. It suited them to call him a traitor."</p>

<p>Their arrival in the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> created a sensation.
People came running from the little stores and out of hallways.
Lee glanced around the circle of gaping faces, asking himself:
Which of these are agents of the Gestapo?</p>

<p>They proceeded into the house and up the dark stairs. The
uniformed officers went first, gun in hand, then the detectives.
Lee and the Inspector brought up the rear. The door from the
hallway was not locked; the room inside it was empty. It had no
hiding-places. An officer opened the door to the front room and
drew his breath sharply. The Inspector put out a restraining
hand.</p>

<p>"Don't go in, Senhor Mappin."</p>

<p>Lee pressed forward. "Nonsense!" he said. "I am no stranger to
death."</p>

<p>William had been flung across Lee's desk on his back. He was
still wearing pyjamas, now drenched with blood. His clothes were
scattered about the floor; also on the floor lay the hotel
blanket and some lengths of rope, indicating how he had been
brought through the city. The marks of a gag showed around his
mouth. Lee looked down at his dead friend with a face of stone.
Ugly burns on his breast showed how he had been tortured before
he was killed. His sufferings had been ended by a knife thrust in
the heart.</p>

<p>Lee, calling on all the strength of his will, started his
examination of the room and the body. There was no lack of
fingerprints. No less than five men had taken part in the
torturing and murder of William&mdash;possibly six, because there
was one bloody print on the dead man's breast of gloved fingers,
a left hand. Lee showed the Portuguese officers the modern method
of lifting fingerprints and preserving them on thin films of
rubber.</p>

<p>Though they were six to one, William at one moment had
succeeded in partly freeing himself, and had put up a desperate
struggle. The room was wrecked. In the course of the fight, a man
had had his glasses knocked off. They had been stepped on and
broken; the two little ovals of broken glass lay separated on the
floor. Lee, with a hard smile, carefully gathered them up in two
separate envelopes. This was priceless evidence.</p>

<p>In the end, William had died almost instantly. There was not a
great deal of blood. He had been stabbed by a knife with a thin
blade ten inches long, driven to the hilt. Only a powerful young
arm could have delivered that blow.</p>

<p>Forcing open one of the dead man's clenched hands, Lee
recovered several coarse, crinkly hairs, black interspersed with
white. These went into another envelope; more valuable evidence.
William's strong white teeth were clamped together in the throes
of death. Forcing them apart. Lee found between them a torn scrap
of a brown cotton material with a seam in it. Was it the end of a
glove finger? Finally he picked up some small lumps of charcoal.
Others has been stepped on and ground into the floor. Such was
the sum of the evidence yielded by the scene of the murder.</p>

<p>Inquiries by the police among the neighbours in the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i> brought forward one man who had something to
contribute. This man lived across the way from number 23. About
half-past two in the night, aroused by some activity in the quiet
street, he had looked out of the window and had seen a small
black truck of elegant design standing in front of number 23. It
was the sort of vehicle, he said, that is used by undertakers to
transport bodies from place to place. Such trucks usually have
plates affixed to the sides bearing the name of the undertaking
establishment, but this had none. It drove off almost
immediately. The driver was outside his range of vision. The
licence plate on the rear had been smeared with mud or some such
substance and was illegible.</p>

<p>On his return to the hotel, Lee received the report of the
detectives who had been left there. It gave him very little
additional to go on. Afterwards he made an examination of the
courtyard on his own account. Just beyond the service door he
found a thin film of mud on the asphalt paving which had dried
since night. During the night it had taken the tracks of a car
which had turned around in the courtyard and waited there for a
space.</p>

<p>This car was shod with four new tyres, all of the same popular
make. Such treads gave him little ground for hope, until he found
that the right-hand rear tyre had a cut in it which left a
distinctive mark. He carefully sketched the imprint of the treads
and the cut in his notebook.</p>

<p>Without saying anything to the police, Lee engaged a certain
M. Gade, who had been recommended to him at the Legation, to
search for the car, possibly an elegant little black truck. M.
Gade was a French refugee who had set up for himself in Lisbon as
a private investigator. So far as Lee could learn, he had no
political affiliations.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p class="first">THAT night, as the solitary figure of Lee
crossed the busy <i>Roçio</i>, Bosco was selling his papers as
usual on the island between two streams of squawking taxis and
clanging electricoes. It was the busiest hour of the evening.
About fifty yards behind Lee followed a pair of secret agents
with their hard eyes fixed on every movement of the plump little
figure in the expensive Panama hat. In Lisbon, Lee carried a
Malacca stick.</p>

<p>As he bought a paper, he exchanged a look with Bosco. Lee
could see in Bosco's expressive eyes that the youth knew what had
happened. Turning aside his head, Lee murmured:</p>

<p>"Call me at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>The extra half hour was to give him time to procure an
interpreter. From the hotel he called the Legation and the
Minister said he would send over his own private secretary, a
Miss Whiteley.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she arrived, and Lee was relieved to find that
she was of the efficient type of secretary instead of the merely
ornamental. He had no heart to-night to flatter a pretty woman.
Miss Whiteley declined refreshment, and they got down to
business. She was aware of what had happened.</p>

<p>"I have a Portuguese agent," said Lee, "who calls me up every
night about this time. He has only a few words of English and I
need you to take down what he says and translate it for me. You
will find him a pretty rough character."</p>

<p>"I am accustomed to all kinds," said Miss Whiteley
demurely.</p>

<p>When the telephone rang. Lee answered it. "This is Senhor
Mappin, Bosco. Get me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Gentleman. My heart, he is sad to-night."</p>

<p>"Mine too, Bosco. I have a lady here who will take down what
you have to say and translate it for me. You can talk to her just
as you would to me. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Gentleman."</p>

<p>"Hold the wire."</p>

<p>As Miss Whiteley took the instrument, Lee said to her: "After
he has finished talking, tell him to wait half an hour and call
up again for instructions."</p>

<p>Miss Whiteley took down what Bosco had to say in shorthand, so
he was able to talk as fast as he liked. After she had finally
hung up, she read Lee what she had written, translating as she
went:</p>

<p>"From nine o'clock this morning, I was selling my papers in
<i>Rua A</i>." Miss Whiteley raised her eyes inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Lee. "I know the street."</p>

<p>"Several men came to the <i>Hotel E.</i>," she resumed, "and
others went away. They were not all the same men I had seen
before. About eleven o'clock my friend, the porter, came out and
went into a restaurant on the same side of the street. They do no
cooking in the hotel. I waited in the doorway until he came out
carrying a tray. He could only stop to tell me that the Bulldog
had slept in the hotel and the food was for him.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later the blond American, F., drove up to the
hotel in a taxi. He was pleased with himself. After he went in,
his taxi drove on a little way and stopped, and the driver went
in to get a drink, so I followed him in and made up to him and
offered to buy him a second glass of wine. All we Portuguese
stand together when our country is full of foreigners. What I was
after was to find out where he had picked F. up. He said at the
<i>Lisboa Palace</i>, and he got a good tip out of him.</p>

<p>"When we came out of the wine shop there was another taxi
standing in front of the <i>Hotel E.</i> The Bulldog came out. He
had been drinking. His ugly face was red. He felt good. He got in
the taxi, so I got in the other taxi and followed. Bulldog was
driven to the Central Station and took the noon express for
Madrid..."</p>

<p>"At that moment I was just coming to my senses!" muttered
Lee.</p>

<p>"I drove back to the <i>leiteria</i> in the same cab," Miss
Whiteley resumed from her notes, "and joined my friends who were
eating their lunch there. The lift operator said there was a big
change around the hotel this morning. Everybody happy. Bulldog
slept in the hotel. He didn't wake up until eleven and sent out
for his breakfast. They were all drinking and slapping each other
on the back. When the young blond fellow came, they all went into
a room and shut the door. The news he brought them made them
laugh like hyenas..."</p>

<p>Lee, pacing up and down the sitting-room, drove his fist into
his palm. "I'll make them laugh! I'll make them laugh!" he
muttered.</p>

<p>Miss Whiteley went on reading from her notes. "They were very
cautious in their talk. As they came and went through the
corridors, my friend was listening with long ears to find out
what made them feel so good, but he got no clue. When he was
telling me this I didn't know what had happened. In the
afternoon, when I went for my evening papers, I heard the story.
Then I knew what made the Germans laugh. I was sorry I hadn't
known it in the morning. I met my friends at supper time and I
told them. I told the lift operator he must find out more, more.
What time did Bulldog return to the hotel this morning? Was he
seen? Was there anybody with him? What did his room look
like?&mdash;he could get this from the chambermaid; she's
Portuguese. Was there blood on him? I told him you would pay well
for any information, and they said they'd find out what they
could."</p>

<p>Miss Whiteley closed her notebook. "That's all."</p>

<p>Lee, pacing the room, muttered: "The boy's got eyes in his
head. But he tries to do too much. They'll catch him!" After
taking a minute or two to digest what he had heard, he went on:
"When Bosco calls again, tell him this..."</p>

<p>Miss Whiteley wrote as Lee dictated:</p>

<p>"After this I won't stop and buy a paper from you every night.
The men who trail me have sharp eyes. It's too risky to pass you
money the way I've been doing. Give me your address, and I'll
send it by mail. If I need to see you I'll come to your house.
Call me up every night about eight-thirty whether you see me in
the street or not. And also call me up in the mornings at eight
so I can give you instructions. Always use a different pay
station when you call.</p>

<p>"Don't try to sell your papers in the <i>Rua A.</i>. any more.
There's not enough business in that little street to justify it,
and the Germans would soon get on to you. Nor should you
undertake to watch the <i>Hotel E.</i> yourself. No matter how
clever you are, if they see you hanging around day after day they
will smell a rat. You're doing good work. I don't want to lose
you. Get your wide-awake friends to watch the hotel and report to
you. Change them often. And make certain that the porter and the
lift operator are not followed to the <i>leiteria</i>. Remember
Germans are suspicious of everybody. Tell me over the phone each
day how much you spend, and how much you need. <i>Don't display
your money or tell anybody how much you're making.</i>"</p>

<p>When Bosco called again, Miss Whiteley gave him all this in
his own language.</p>

<p>After she had hung up she said to Lee: "Bosco says he
understands everything. He lives at <i>Calcado Poço, 7</i>." Lee
entered it in his notebook. "He says," she went on, "that he will
continue to sell his papers every evening at the same spot on the
<i>Roçio</i> because people are accustomed to seeing him there.
If you want to use him at that hour, he can get another fellow to
take his place. He says, do him the favour to pass there when you
can, whether you speak or not, so he'll know you're safe."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p class="first">EARLY next morning, Lee visited an optician and
handed him the two broken lenses. The man put the pieces together
without too much trouble and pasted them with transparent gummed
paper. Measuring the refraction of light with his instruments, he
wrote out the prescription from which they had been made.</p>

<p>Later, Lee and his friend, the Minister, were sitting in the
study of the United States Legation. Their faces were heavy. Lee
said:</p>

<p>"The police seem to be active in the case. Inspector da Gama
is a first-rate fellow&mdash;up to a point. I have the feeling,
however, that word has come down from above that it would be
better for the State to hush up this crime rather than to solve
it. No Portuguese wants it to be known that Lisbon is a place
where such an outrageous crime could be committed."</p>

<p>"Sure," said the Minister, "and Portugal's neutrality is
precious to them. The death of an individual weighs nothing
beside reasons of State."</p>

<p>"A man without a country at that," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>"Right. That's why I can't come forward and demand a complete
investigation. He was not an American citizen."</p>

<p>"I suppose you noticed," said Lee, "that the Lisbon morning
papers did not carry a word about it."</p>

<p>"Sure. But it's being gossiped about freely. The American
correspondents have been to me to ask if they should cable the
story home. I put them off until I could consult you."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "If they tried to send it, it would be
censored. In this case I agree with the censors. If the story
were published in America, it would set up a reaction against
Portugal that might have unfortunate results. Sooner or later,
Portugal will be forced to abandon neutrality. When that happens
we want her to come in on our side. That's a reason of State,
too."</p>

<p>"Then we must allow this crime to be hushed up?" said the
Minister gloomily.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," said Lee. "It certainly originated in the
<i>Hotel Excelsior</i>, but we have as yet not legal evidence. If
we can bring it home to the real murderers, the shoe will be on
the other foot. It will give Portugal a shove in our
direction."</p>

<p>"But if the Lisbon police won't solve this crime...!"</p>

<p>"I will," said Lee quietly.</p>

<p>The Minister sprang up from his desk. "What are you
saying!"</p>

<p>"I mean, of course, unless the Gestapo gets me first," amended
Lee.</p>

<p>The Minister strode agitatedly back and forth. "Impossible!"
he said. "I can't allow you to remain in Lisbon after what has
happened."</p>

<p>Lee merely smiled.</p>

<p>"You would simply be inviting the Gestapo to shoot you!"</p>

<p>"My position is no more dangerous to-day than it was day
before yesterday," said Lee. "Of course, they'll get me&mdash;if
they can."</p>

<p>"Your life is too valuable to be sacrificed in such a fashion,
Mappin!"</p>

<p>Lee raised his eyebrows. "Valuable? Why? Hundreds of Americans
are giving their lives daily. This is the best way I can
serve."</p>

<p>"But your hands are tied! What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, I don't know yet. But I've had a certain experience
in solving murders." As the Minister prepared to bring up further
reasons, Lee raised his hand. "William Miller gave his life," he
said. "A man without a country, without a family or a friend, so
far as we know; a solitary patriot. There is nobody in the world
to avenge him but me...Besides, I'm not going to let the Gestapo
put a stop to all my other work, too."</p>

<p>The Minister threw up his hands. "Well, if you won't leave
Lisbon, at least come and live in the Legation."</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Many thanks, but if I had to sit in the
Legation all day doing nothing, I'd go off my nut. Let me go my
own way, Mr. Minister. Our country mustn't be dragged into this
affair&mdash;in case I fail."</p>

<p>The Minister dropped in his chair. "If they get you,
<i>that</i> can't be hushed up," he said gloomily, "and I'll be
blamed for it."</p>

<p>"Not if the full facts are published," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You're an obstinate man, Mappin!"</p>

<p>"I don't think I am," protested Lee. "I often change my mind.
But once or twice in every man's life a situation arises where
only one course is possible. In such cases, argument is
futile."</p>

<p>"You must have a proper guard..."</p>

<p>"I will find him."</p>

<p>"More than one."</p>

<p>"Too obvious a guard would hamper me...Please see that the
British Embassy is informed of the true facts."</p>

<p>"I will...How does the case stand to-day?"</p>

<p>"Inspector da Gama expresses himself as baffled. Upon
analysis, the drinking water was found to be drugged with Duotol,
a tasteless anodyne that can be purchased anywhere. Two guests at
the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> who have rooms on the same corridor as
mine heard the kidnappers as they passed in the night. From one
we got the exact hour, 2.18. The other man was awake. He actually
opened his door and looked out. He saw a group of men
disappearing around a corner carrying a body on a stretcher. They
were dressed like undertakers' assistants. This man knew it was
customary, when death occurs in a de luxe hotel, to remove the
body at night without the knowledge of other guests. He therefore
went back to his bed and thought no more about it."</p>

<p>"Could he describe the kidnappers?"</p>

<p>"No. Couldn't even swear to the number. However, I know there
were four to carry the stretcher and another to lead the
way."</p>

<p>"How could they get out of the hotel?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily, it seems. They carried William down a service
stairs, two flights. At the bottom there was a watchman stationed
between stairway and service entrance. This man presumably went
off duty at seven o'clock in the morning. When the police
searched for him at noon, he had vanished; he had not been
home."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they got him, too."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but it is more likely he received a bribe&mdash;a
bribe that would look princely to a watchman. Anyhow, he has
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That is all the police have to tell me," said Lee. "I have a
report from my agent." He described what Bosco had told him.</p>

<p>"I'll ask Madrid for information about the Bulldog," said the
Minister.</p>

<p>"Also Paris," suggested Lee. "Paris is their headquarters. I
suspect that the Bulldog is not other than the infamous Albrecht
Stengel, the butcher of Paris."</p>

<p>"What about the body, Mappin?" asked the Minister. "Let that
be my care. What are your instructions?"</p>

<p>"The English cemetery is a pretty spot," said Lee softly.
"Bury him there and put a simple stone on his grave. If he had a
family or friends in Germany, he concealed it for their sakes.
Perhaps when the war is over I'll be able to find those who were
close to him. I don't even know his true name."</p>

<p>When they shook hands the Minister said: "I shall be anxious
about you every moment of the day, Mappin."</p>

<p>"Forget me! Forget me!" said Lee. "You have plenty more
important things on your mind."</p>

<p>Crossing the Minister's ante-room, Lee's eyes fell upon a tall
young American standing there, who nodded and smiled. Clearly he
wanted to speak, but was waiting for the older man to speak
first. Lee, taking him for one of the correspondents, had no
heart for speech. He answered his greeting and passed on out.</p>

<p>As he arrived at the door of the hotel, another taxi dashed up
behind his. Lee, who carried his gun in the side pocket of his
jacket, instinctively put his hand on it. But the man who tumbled
out of the second taxi was the same one he had seen at the
Legation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mappin," he said, a little breathless in his eagerness,
"can I speak to you a moment? I'm not after a story. It's a
personal matter. I <i>must</i> speak to you."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Lee. "A fellow-countryman. Come into
the hotel."</p>

<p>Lee led him to the lounge. "Will it take long?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said the young men, half modest, half bold.</p>

<p>Lee laughed, almost won already. They found seats. "Shoot!"
said Lee.</p>

<p>"My name is Luke Tremaine," said the young man. "I'm a free-lance
correspondent over here. Not much to it. I'm not a very
good reporter, I guess. But I couldn't stay home. I've been
turned down by all the medical boards I could get to. On account
of what they call a heart murmur. It doesn't interfere with me. I
can keep going as long as anybody..."</p>

<p>Lee saw what was coming and frowned. "Why are you telling me
all this?"</p>

<p>"I want to work with you, Mr. Mappin. This opportunity is like
the answer to a prayer!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" said the startled Lee. "You know what happened to
my last assistant?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I know. That's why I'm asking you. Don't shake your
head. You've got to have somebody. You can't go around alone. I
speak Portuguese&mdash;colloquially. Picked it up here in the
streets this past year. I know Lisbon like a book..."</p>

<p>"There's no story in this&mdash;for the present," warned
Lee.</p>

<p>The young man looked hurt. "The hell with a story! I'm asking
to be your man."</p>

<p>Lee studied him with a fresh interest; brown hair, steady blue
eyes set far apart, a nondescript nose, a mouth wide but not
loose, and inclined to turn up at the corners. The general effect
was of a warm-hearted, laughter-loving fellow who was nobody's
fool. Well-cut American tweeds hung on his big frame carelessly.
Nice lad to have around, thought Lee, warming towards him;
however, he continued to shake his head.</p>

<p>"You've got your whole life before you," Lee said. "Are you
married?"</p>

<p>"No. No close ties...Don't turn me down because it's too
dangerous," Luke went on, at once laughing and beseeching. "It
would break my heart!"</p>

<p>"Wait here until I come back," said Lee.</p>

<p>He telephoned to the Legation. The Minister gave Luke Tremaine
a first-rate recommendation. Knew the boy well; knew his people
at home. Good heart; good head. Luke had been trying for a year
to get some newspaper to send him to the front. The Minister had
offered him a job in the Legation. Luke wouldn't take it because
he said an official job was too soft in wartime. Such was the
gist of it.</p>

<p>Lee returned. Luke's eyes sought his face with a painful
eagerness. Lee said off-handedly:</p>

<p>"Well, let's play along for a while until we see how we get
along together."</p>

<p>Luke let out a subdued whoop that made all the correct
Continentals within hearing stare. "When do I start?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lee. He named a figure.</p>

<p>"Too much," said Luke promptly.</p>

<p>Lee waved that objection aside.

<p><br>
A SERVANT came to Lee to say that Senhor the Resident-Director
craved a word with Mr. Mappin in his office.</p>

<p>"You come along, too," said Lee to Luke.</p>

<p>In the Director's office, that finished gentleman sprang up
from his desk and projected a series of jack-knife bows in Lee's
direction. Lee said:</p>

<p>"This is my new secretary, Mr. Tremaine."</p>

<p>The Director arrested his bowing to stare incredulously at
Luke. Another secretary already! Turning back to Lee with hand on
heart and tears in his voice, he expressed his horror and grief
at the dreadful thing that had occurred. Lee had nothing against
the man, but this excessive sorrow annoyed him and he cut it
short. The Director was implying that after what had happened he
could no longer expect Mr. Mappin to stay in his hotel, and Lee
said clearly:</p>

<p>"I shall keep my rooms."</p>

<p>This took the wind out of the Director's sails. Obviously he
wanted to get rid of a guest who might bring down another such
catastrophe on his house. "But you must have other rooms," he
protested. "There are several suites available..."</p>

<p>"The same rooms," said Lee firmly. "They suit me."</p>

<p>The Director raised his hands and let them fall in a gesture
of resignation. These Americanos!</p>

<p>"There is only one thing I must ask of you," Lee continued,
fixing him with a stern eye. "I wish to have a strong bolt fixed
to the inside of the entrance door to the suite this afternoon. I
want the old-fashioned kind of bolt." He illustrated with his
hands. "When you shove it across, it turns and locks in its
place."</p>

<p>The Director started to object, but Lee's eye was too strong
for him. "Very well, Senhor, it shall be done," he said
humbly.</p>

<p>Over lunch in the hotel, Lee said to Luke: "Your first job
must be to find buildings around town that have two or more
entrances. Hotels, arcades, theatres, and the like. As we can use
such a place only once, we must have several in reserve."</p>

<p>"I already know of some such places," said Luke.</p>

<p>"Secondly," Lee went on, "you must understand that we will
have to descend to the level of our enemies and snoop and spy and
use all kinds of dirty, underhand tricks."</p>

<p>"Okay by me, if they are enemies," said Luke cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I have one spy," said Lee, "who has been very successful.
You'll meet him. We must have others."</p>

<p>"Look for them among the poor people of Lisbon," said Luke.
"They're good people."</p>

<p>Later, in talking over the case, Lee said, "There were five
men in the kidnapping party."</p>

<p>"Why five?"</p>

<p>"Not more than four men can carry a stretcher swiftly and
silently without getting in each other's way. William was a big
man, and they must have been fairly husky. The fifth man was to
spy out the way and open doors. Some were Portuguese, I take it.
Well, spies have no country. They were dressed in the style of
undertakers' assistants. In the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> I know they
were joined by others, for it was certainly Germans who
questioned William and tortured him. Yet it seems to have been a
Portuguese who killed him."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"The autopsy revealed that the murder weapon was a slim blade
ten inches long. It was plunged to the hilt with one sure stroke.
In other words, a stiletto. That's a weapon unfamiliar to Germans
and Americans."</p>

<p>"Americans?" said Luke, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"One of the principals is an American of German descent...At
first I believed that the water bottles were drugged by a woman,"
Lee went on, "but now I doubt it. The woman I had in mind is one
of them, but I don't believe they'd trust her as far as
murder."</p>

<p>Luke's eyes brightened at the mention of the word 'woman.'</p>

<p>"Who is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She's lunching at the fourth table behind you. Wait a minute
before you look."</p>

<p>Luke presently took a fleeting glance behind him. "Gosh! What
a smooth piece of dress goods! What is she?"</p>

<p>"Calls herself a Scotswoman," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Scotch! That's a new thing in camouflage."</p>

<p>"She's already full of curiosity about you. When she starts
making up to you, don't discourage her. You might learn
something."</p>

<p>Luke took another glance. "Discourage anything like
<i>that</i>! No fear!"</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, Lee said: "Now run along and
find some buildings that have a way out behind. We must be
prepared with as many tricks as a fox to throw our trailers off
the scent."</p>

<p>A look of concern came into young Luke's face. "Should I leave
you alone?" he said.</p>

<p>The words brought a memory of the lost William winging back.
Lee touched the young man's arm. "Good fellow!" he said warmly.
"...They won't attack me to-day. As I figure it, they don't want
to liquidate me if it can be avoided. My death would make a noise
that couldn't be silenced. They are hoping that the murder of
William will send me skedaddling back to my own country. When
they find that I mean to stick, it will be different."</p>

<p>Luke was not entirely convinced. "My main job is to stay with
you."</p>

<p>"This afternoon," Lee went on, "I have some work to do in the
hotel. I am developing a new theory as to the drugged water
bottles. I know they possessed a pass-key to our suite."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Because when I entered the sitting-room our key was lying on
the floor, yet the door was locked...I promise not to go out
until you return."</p>

<p>Luke's face cleared.</p>

<p>"Bring your clothes when you come," said Lee. "Are you
armed?"</p>

<p>"Always," said Luke, touching his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"If your gun is not too big, I suggest you carry it in the
right-hand pocket of your jacket. Then you don't have to
draw!"</p>

<p>"I'll change it as soon as I'm alone," said Luke.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p class="first">When Luke returned to the <i>Lisboa Palace</i>
with his suitcases, Lee said: "I need your help. I've been trying
to talk to Natalia, our chambermaid. She has as much English as I
have Portuguese but our words don't match. So we bogged
down."</p>

<p>He rang, and Natalia presently entered, bobbing and smoothing
her apron. She was ample and good-natured, and her expressive
eyes had a gallant roll. It was evident from her smile that Lee
had laid a foundation for goodwill. He said:</p>

<p>"This is my secretary. He speaks Portuguese."</p>

<p>Without waiting for questions, Natalia burst into a flood of
passionate oratory. She shook her fists, she held out her arms,
she crossed herself repeatedly and pointed to heaven.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!" interrupted Lee. "What's she
trying to tell me?"</p>

<p>Said Luke: "She says the police accused her yesterday of
poisoning the water bottles. And she swears by Mary and all the
Saints that it is false!"</p>

<p>"Tell her to make her mind easy," said Lee. "It never occurred
to me that she could have done it, or I wouldn't be making
friends with her now."</p>

<p>This was repeated to Natalia and she smiled again. Lee went
on:</p>

<p>"I want to ask her some questions about the gentleman who
occupied the adjoining room, number 218. His name, as I got it
from her, sounded like 'All go down.' What is it exactly?"</p>

<p>Luke spelled it out after Natalia: "Algadao&mdash;with a
little jigger over the last a."</p>

<p>"When did he take that room?"</p>

<p>"The day after you came."</p>

<p>"When did he leave?"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday; eight o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Lee. "Before the crime was discovered! We appear to
be getting warm! Ask her if she knows where he went from
here?"</p>

<p>Luke repeated Natalia's answer. "He said he was going to
Madrid."</p>

<p>"Madrid again!"</p>

<p>"But he bought a ticket to Torres Pretos. The porter told me.
The porter carried his bag to the station and heard him ask for a
ticket."</p>

<p>"Where is that place?"</p>

<p>"It's a small port on the ocean about two hours by the
railway."</p>

<p>Lee shifted his line of approach. Pointing to the brass key
which hung on a chain from Natalia's waist, he asked: "Does that
key open all the doors on this corridor?"</p>

<p>The answer was "Yes." Natalia explained that each corridor in
the hotel had its own master key; that nobody was authorised to
carry this particular key but herself; that there was a duplicate
kept in the office.</p>

<p>"Natalia," asked Lee, "did you ever lose your key for a while?
Did you ever lend it to anybody? Was it ever out of your
possession?"</p>

<p>She answered with a whole series of denials.</p>

<p>"Now think well before you answer this one. If you can help
me, Natalia, I'll double what I gave you before. Did Senhor
Algadao ever have that key in his hand?"</p>

<p>As Natalia cast back in her mind, her eyes widened, and
suddenly a whole fusillade of "Si Senhors" broke from her.</p>

<p>"Under what circumstances?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Natalia's story, as translated by Luke, was as follows. Four
or five mornings previously, while she was doing up Lee's room,
the door to the corridor was open and Senhor Algadao came in. She
remonstrated with him, saying what would the Americano gentleman
think if he came back. Algadao did not leave immediately, but
took time to look around and open the bedroom door and look in.
He remarked what a handsome suite it was. Then he told Natalia he
had forgotten to ask for his key at the office, and to lend him
hers to open his door. Natalia, thinking no harm, unhooked her
key and handed it to him. He unlocked his door and brought it
back to her.</p>

<p>"Right away?" asked Lee. "Think before you answer."</p>

<p>"He unlocked his door; he went into his room; he came out
right away again and brought me the key."</p>

<p>"Time enough to take an impression of it," Lee murmured to
Luke.</p>

<p>Natalia had more to say: "He stayed in his room a little
while, then he went away. When I brought clean towels to his room
the door was locked. So he had his key all the time."</p>

<p>"How did you explain this to yourself?"</p>

<p>Natalia shrugged and looked self-conscious. "Well, Senhor, old
as I am and the mother of four...well, gentlemen will be
gentlemen! When the Senhor came in this room he threw his arm
around my waist and gave me a kiss. I thought he asked for the
key just to save his face."</p>

<p>"Did you tell the police about the key?"</p>

<p>"No, Senhor. It seemed of no importance. It did not come to my
mind."</p>

<p>"Natalia," said Lee, "I never happened to see this Senhor
entering or leaving his room. Describe him to me."</p>

<p>As much with graphic pantomime as with words, Natalia pictured
a man of about forty-five, average height, with a moderate
protruberance in front. He had what she described as a greedy
expression, a long nose, shifty black eyes, and lank black hair.
He dressed like a lawyer, meaning that he wore a black cutaway
coat, striped trousers and a black, soft hat with the brim turned
down in front like an American. She mimicked the flat-footed,
pompous walk of the man.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Lee. "By the way, Natalia, who is occupying
that room now? I hear somebody moving around."</p>

<p>"Two Portuguese gentlemen, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Two of them, eh? This hotel is not patronized much by
Portuguese. I doubt if these two mean any good to us."</p>

<p>He gave Natalia what he had promised her and she
disappeared.</p>

<p>On their way out to dinner, Lee remarked to the clerk in the
bureau of the hotel that he had broken the key to one of his
cases, and where could he have another made? He was given an
address just around the corner from the hotel. As Lee did not
want to risk giving a premature alarm, he and Luke drove half-way
across town and shook off their trailers before returning to the
locksmith's shop.</p>

<p>To the workman Lee said: "Could you make a key from an
impression in wax or some other soft plastic?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Senhor...As it happens, I did such a job for a
Senhor less than a week ago."</p>

<p>Lee and Luke looked at each other. This was better luck than
they expected.</p>

<p>"A key like this?" asked Lee, exhibiting their hotel key.</p>

<p>"Of that same size, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Would you know that man again?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senhor."</p>

<p>"But you have many customers. How could you be sure of knowing
this one?"</p>

<p>"This was such an unusual order, I took a good look at this
man. A man of forty-five, Senhor, with the beginning of a nice
belly. He was dressed like an advocate and he walked like this."
The locksmith illustrated.</p>

<p>Luke let out a soft whoop and clapped Lee on the back. The
locksmith looked suspiciously from one to another. However, the
gift of a twenty-five escudo note satisfied him that these were
right men.</p>

<p>"Say nothing about this to anybody," warned Lee, "and there
will be more in it for you."</p>

<p>As Lee and Luke strolled on to the <i>Macaco Branco</i>, the
former said: "What say we take a little trip to Torres Pretos
to-morrow? If we can shake off our sleuth hounds, a day in the
country would be charming."</p>

<p>"Suits me all right," said Luke.</p>

<p>The salient part of Bosco's report that night, when they
returned to the hotel, had to do with Schoenhut. Schoenhut was
described by Bosco as the local chief of the Gestapo. He was a
tall, skinny fellow with a prominent Adam's apple, a long nose
and tousled grey hair. Bosco had christened him "the Stork."
During the morning the Stork had sent the lift operator to an
optician (not the same one that Lee had consulted) to order a
pair of glasses. The lift operator was given a prescription from
a German oculist to have filled. He had had the wit to copy down
the figures of the prescription and had given them to Bosco.
Bosco repeated the figures over the phone, and Lee took them
down.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke compared the two sets of figures in mounting
excitement.</p>

<p>"Glory be, they match!" cried Luke.</p>

<p>"That ought to settle the hash of number one when the time
comes!" said Lee.

<p><br>
THE Portuguese local railways do not go in for speed; however,
Luke and Lee did not find the next day's journey tedious. They
had succeeded in evading their trackers before going to the
station; consequently they were free from espionage until they
chose to return to Lisbon, and they felt like schoolboys on
holiday. The scenery was magnificent, and at each little station
they were intrigued by the human scene. Between stations, Lee
took lessons in Portuguese from Luke, assisted by fellow-passengers
amidst great laughter.</p>

<p>Torres Pretos was a hoary little seaport on the estuary of a
small river. It had a look of having been forgotten by the world.
Columbus could have sailed into the river in his caravels without
being surprised by anything new, for the railway station was out
of sight. There was a fort, a castle on a nearby hill, a tiny,
cobbled praça facing the quay, and a huddle of tall houses,
separated by dark lanes. An old stone hotel, the "<i>Grande</i>,"
faced the praça, and along the other side was moored a rank of
picturesque fishing-smacks with their bowsprits pointing
ashore.</p>

<p>During the afternoon a British destroyer steamed into the
river and dropped anchor, making a strikingly incongruous note
amidst all the antiquity. A boat came ashore to purchase fruits
and fresh vegetables. The hearty English voices echoed oddly in
the dim lanes.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke were the first guests to enter the restaurant of
the "<i>Grande</i>" for dinner. They had registered at the hotel,
since there were no more return trains. It was not difficult to
establish the fact that a Senhor "Gomez" had arrived three days
before and was assigned to room four. He was the only recent
arrival. They had not identified him yet, but felt pretty sure he
would come to dinner since there was no other respectable eating
place visible in town.</p>

<p>Other guests were entering the restaurant singly and in
couples. The door was thrown open with a bang, and a party from
the English destroyer barged in; the handsome young commander,
his navigating officer, a couple of blond juniors, a young
engineer officer and a little grey man in civvies whom Lee
guessed to be the local British Consul. A couple of tables were
pushed together at the back of the room and the British seated
themselves with loud talk and great laughter. Their conversation
was even freer than might have been expected from man-o-war's-men,
since they supposed there were no other English-speaking
persons within hearing.</p>

<p>"It would be nice to join up with those babies," said Luke
enviously.</p>

<p>"Later, perhaps," said Lee. "I have an idea."</p>

<p>They were in the middle of their dinner when Lee, who faced
the front, looked down in his plate, saying: "Here comes Senhor
All-go-down. Don't look right away."</p>

<p>The newcomer seated himself at a table opposite theirs on the
other side of the room. Luke, after giving him a glance,
said:</p>

<p>"He answers to the general description, but how can you be
sure?"</p>

<p>"(A)," said Lee, "it is a man I have seen in the public rooms
of the <i>Lisboa Palace</i>. (B) He knew me the moment he saw me,
and it has upset him horribly. He can't make up his mind what to
do."</p>

<p>"If he knows he's discovered, he may make a break for it."</p>

<p>"In that case, break after him. Luckily for us, he's a
stranger in this town. He won't be missed."</p>

<p>Luke grinned.</p>

<p>The man across the room decided that if he did make a break,
the long-legged one would certainly nab him; he might as well
have his dinner.</p>

<p>Lee's eye-glasses glittered. He said to Luke: "Did you notice
there was no key to the door of our room? In these village hotels
the keys are always mislaid. Maybe there's no key to All-go-down's
room either. Have you the nerve to go up and try the door
of number four? If the door is open, go through his things. You
know what we would like to find. I'll be keeping an eye on
him."</p>

<p>"I've got the nerve," said Luke, rising to suit the words, and
putting down his napkin, he strode out.</p>

<p>The man across the room was missing nothing. At Luke's
departure he became even more nervous than before. However, he
continued to eat his way doggedly through his dinner.</p>

<p>Luke was gone about ten minutes. He came striding back with a
perfectly dead-pan and seated himself. "Okay," he said. "I found
a bottle half-full of Duotol tablets. It is in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Not the pass-key?"</p>

<p>Luke shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he has turned that over to one of the others
for future use."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with him?" asked Luke. "Turn him
over to the police?"</p>

<p>"That was my original idea...I don't know. Finish your dinner
and watch him. If he leaves, follow him. Don't let him out of
your sight. If necessary, seize him and hang on to him."</p>

<p>Lee strolled towards the hilarious party at the back of the
room. "Gentlemen," he said to the officers, "when I heard your
English voices..."</p>

<p>"An Englishman!" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly..."</p>

<p>"American!" they cried, leaping up, and all trying to take his
hand at once. When it had been well shaken, a chair was drawn up
and Lee pushed into it. A glass was filled and re-filled for him.
They toasted him and Lee toasted them. Lee ordered more wine.
Amidst the confused conversation he learned that the destroyer
was the <i>Egret</i>, and that they were sailing at ten o'clock.
Out of the tail of his eye he saw Algadao leave the restaurant
and Luke follow him.</p>

<p>The handsome young Commander introduced himself as 'Esme
Harrington-Long.'</p>

<p>"He's an Honorable," added the little grey man in Lee's ear.
"Son of Lord Fausley."</p>

<p>The other officers were introduced; the grey man was "Mr.
Daw," and, as Lee had supposed, he was the British Consul in
<i>Torres Pretos.</i></p>

<p>Lee said to the company: "I am an American, as you have
guessed. My name is Amos Lee Mappin. I am hoping that Mr. Daw
here may know something about me."</p>

<p>The little man stared. "Amos Lee Mappin!" he repeated
solemnly. "Of course! Of course! I have had advices from Lisbon
concerning you." He got to his feet. "Gentlemen," he said,
leaning across the table impressively, "I am not at liberty to
divulge just what my advices were, but I can say this: Mr. Mappin
is a famous man in his own country, and at present he is engaged
in an important and merciful work on behalf of the United
Nations."</p>

<p>Cheers and felicitations from all around the table. Lee had to
drink with each of the British in turn. He merely touched his
lips to the glass. He took his passport from his pocket and
offered it to the Consul. There were loud protests.</p>

<p>"No! No!...Not necessary between friends and allies...We can
see what you are!"</p>

<p>"Please," insisted Lee. "This is wartime and I would like to
show my credentials. Read it to the gentlemen, Mr. Daw."</p>

<p>The Consul read: "Amos Lee Mappin; occupation, author; height,
5 feet 6 inches; weight, 170; eyes, gray; hair, brown..."</p>

<p>"What there is of it," put in Lee.</p>

<p>"Distinguishing marks: mole on left shoulder..."</p>

<p>Lee glanced down the restaurant. "If there were not ladies
present, I would take off my shirt."</p>

<p>Much laughter around the table.</p>

<p>"Hold up the photograph so all can see it," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Hardly does you justice," said Mr. Daw.</p>

<p>"Looks like my idiot cousin," said Lee, "if I had one."</p>

<p>The passport was returned to Lee's pocket. More wine was
brought and toasts trunk. All this took a lot of time. The
absence of Algadao and Luke caused Lee a keen anxiety, but it
would have been fatal to try to rush matters. When he saw his
chance, he got to his feet again.</p>

<p>"You fellows will make me tight if I don't look out," he said.
"I mustn't get tight to-night. I didn't come to this God-forsaken
town for the beauty of the architecture. I have business here. As
a matter of fact, I am faced by a certain difficulty, and I'm
going to ask you fellows to help me out, as one ally to
another."</p>

<p>There were loud cries of approbation and agreement around the
table. The sailors were delighted by the suggestion of an
adventure ashore. They begged Lee to go on. Only the young
skipper maintained a certain reserve; his was the
responsibility.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought to speak to your Commander in private," said
Lee.</p>

<p>Commander Harrington-Long shook his head. "Tell all of us," he
said.</p>

<p>This was what Lee wanted. "Well, it must be off the record, as
we say. In strictest confidence, gentlemen."</p>

<p>The restaurant had emptied when Lee began his story. While he
talked, he watched the faces of the two waiters covertly. They
were not listening. He told briefly of the murder of William
Miller&mdash;but not too briefly, because he wanted to enlist
their feelings. British jaws hardened when he spoke of the
Gestapo. Lee laid before them what he had learned of the
circumstances leading to the murder. He described the net he had
succeeded in weaving about the man he knew as Algadao, and how he
had found him in Torres Pretos.</p>

<p>"He is number two on my list," said Lee.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to win sailors warmed with wine. Long
before Lee got to the end of his story, they were raring to go.
"Where is he? Where is he?" they demanded. Only their commander
was still silent.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Lee. "I haven't yet told you what I want
you to do...I meant to turn this fellow over to the local police
until you blew in. Nothing else I could do. Here's my difficulty.
I've had evidence that the Portuguese would rather have this case
hushed up than solved. They feel it is dynamite for them. You can
hardly blame them. It would be useless to try this fellow until I
have rounded up his confederates. Some time may elapse. And I
have a fear that when Algadao is wanted for trial, he will turn
up missing..." Lee paused and looked around at his eager hearers
with a fatherly smile.</p>

<p>"Well?...Well?" they asked.</p>

<p>Lee said softly: "I want the <i>Egret</i> to carry him to some
spot on British territory where he can be detained until he is
wanted."</p>

<p>It created a sensation around the table. They were hot to do
what Lee wanted and said so&mdash;still they kept glancing at
their Commander, who did not commit himself.</p>

<p>"He's a stranger in this town," said Lee. "If we can carry him
off without raising an alarm, he'll never be missed."</p>

<p>Commander Harrington-Long still looked down at his plate,
considering.</p>

<p>"I suggest," added Lee, "that we ask Mr. Daw to call up the
British Ambassador in Lisbon and ask for instructions. His
Excellency knows all the circumstances."</p>

<p>It turned the scale. The skipper looked up with a broad grin.
"That would take too long," he said. "Besides, it's two to one
His Excellency is dining out and couldn't be reached. I'll take a
chance on carrying him to our next port. That's Gibraltar."</p>

<p>There was tremendous enthusiasm around the table.</p>

<p>"I will see that a full account of the circumstances is in the
hands of the authorities before you reach Gibraltar," promised
Lee, "so the burden of explaining it won't fall on you."</p>

<p>"Where is he? Where is he?" demanded the younger officers.</p>

<p>"He left the restaurant about half an hour ago," said Lee. "My
secretary is shadowing him. We shall have word directly. In the
meantime, another glass of wine to Hands Across the Sea!"</p>

<p>A little later a rough-looking fisherman entered the
restaurant from the street. The waiters glided to prevent him
from annoying the gentlemen. He raised his voice indignantly, and
those at the table heard the words: "Senhor Mappeen."</p>

<p>"Bring him here!" said Lee.</p>

<p>The fisherman offered Lee a scrap of paper torn from Luke's
notebook. On it was scribbled: "I have A. cornered in a wineshop.
The man will show you the way."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, let's go," said Lee.</p>

<p>After an amiable wrangle about the bill, Lee got his way and
paid for the wine, and they departed.</p>

<p>The wineshop was in a dingy basement at the westerly edge of
town. It had a forbidding aspect, and Commander Harrington-Long
said:</p>

<p>"You mustn't go into such a place, sir. The white waistcoat
would start a riot."</p>

<p>"I expect you're right," said Lee. He scribbled: "Bring him
out," on the bottom of Luke's note and sent the fisherman in with
it.</p>

<p>The Commander meanwhile had sent Mr. Daw back to the town quay
for the <i>Egret's</i> boat. To Lee he said: "We don't want a
fracas here. Would attract too much attention. We'll walk on down
the road and you follow. If you need help, you have only to sing
out."</p>

<p>"We won't need any help," said Lee smiling.</p>

<p>The officers disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Out of the wine shop came the miserable figure of Algadao,
Luke close behind him with his hand held significantly in his
pocket. As Algadao stumbled up the steps, Lee wondered to see him
carrying his suitcase, and chuckled. All fixed for the journey,
he thought.</p>

<p>"Let's take a little walk," said Lee pleasantly. He indicated
the road out of town.</p>

<p>Algadao hesitated, looking around him desperately. Luke poked
the gun in his ribs. "Get going," he said.</p>

<p>The prisoner started off briskly enough, but soon faltered,
and began to whine pitifully.</p>

<p>"Wants to know what we're going to do with him?" said
Luke.</p>

<p>"He's not going to be harmed," said Lee.</p>

<p>As they left the town behind them, the prisoner's knees began
to give under him and they had to support him on either side.
When his legs failed him altogether, Luke stopped and said
harshly:</p>

<p>"I'm getting good and God-damned tired of this. Walk, you
swine, or your walking days will end here and now!"</p>

<p>Algadao recovered the use of his legs.</p>

<p>As they proceeded, Luke told Lee his side of the story. "He
left the restaurant and went up to his room. When I was in there
before, I saw a little balcony overhanging the lane at the side,
and I thought he might try to get out that way. So I posted
myself at the corner of the hotel, where I could watch both the
front door and the side lane. Sure enough, All-go-down came out
on the balcony, dropped his suitcase over, and then let himself
drop. It was only about nine feet or so.</p>

<p>"He went through several lanes, thinking he had shaken me off.
I believe he was making for the railway station, but he met some
natives who told him there were no more trains, and he turned
back. I ducked into a doorway until he passed me. He made a
detour to keep away from the <i>Praça</i> and went to a garage.
There was a fellow working there, and All-go-down tried to hire a
car. I was afraid he might be successful, so I went in and said
to the mechanic:</p>

<p>"?'This so-and-so is an agent for the Gestapo."</p>

<p>"Gosh! All-go-down almost passed out when I materialised out
of the night. The mechanic didn't need any proof of what I said.
All-go-down's face convicted him on sight. I suppose the mechanic
thought I was some sort of a British secret agent. Anyhow, he
held All-go-down while I frisked him and took his gun. Then I
marched him out of there, pronto. The mechanic was a wise guy; he
wasn't mixing in anything that didn't concern him.</p>

<p>"Outside, this fellow whined and begged for mercy. Offered a
thousand escudos to let him go. When he raised it to two
thousand, I made out I was interested and we went into the wine
shop to talk it over. I had him covered under the table with one
hand while I wrote the note to you with the other. He knew it was
all up with him then, but there was nothing he could do. If I had
raised the cry of Gestapo in that tough joint, they would have
taken him apart...Where are we going now?"</p>

<p>"The British officers are just ahead of us," said Lee.</p>

<p>When the five waiting figures loomed out of the dark, Algadao
stopped short and caught his breath to let out a yell. Flinging
an arm around the man's head, Luke held him until one of the
British had him firmly gagged, and his hands knotted behind him.
Nothing more than a grunt or two escaped the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Well, Commander, here's where we part," said Lee. "Where's
your boat?"</p>

<p>"Coming down the river, sir. We'll signal her from the beach
with a flashlight...I wish I could ask you and your friend
aboard, but we must sail at once."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Lee. "Our acquaintance has been brief
but intimate. Good-bye, but not forever."</p>

<p>Hands were shaken all around. Lee and Luke turned back.</p>

<p>"That accounts for number two," said Lee.

<p><br>
UPON getting back to Lisbon next afternoon, Lee's first act
was to drive to the Legation to report. The Minister laughed at
the story of what had happened in Torres Pretos.</p>

<p>"I will lay the matter before the British Ambassador at once,"
he said.</p>

<p>"If he cuts up rough," said Lee, "if the young Commander is
likely to be reprimanded, better make an appointment for me to
see His Excellency."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy," said the Minister. "His Excellency's a
good fellow. If the Portuguese don't make an issue of it, why
should the British worry?"</p>

<p>"Algadao will never become an issue," said Lee. "He has
disappeared into thin air with his suitcase!"</p>

<p>"By the way," said the Minister, "I have a cable from
Westerholm. The Erbeldings have arrived safely."</p>

<p>"Good news," said Lee.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke then drove to pick up their letters and telegrams
at the Central Post Office on Black Horse Square. Lee always had
in mind the danger of being jostled upon leaving the post office
and the letters snatched. To-day, however, they were still free
of their trailers. From the post office they went on without fear
to their room in the <i>Rua Augusta</i>, where the mail was read,
answered and destroyed. Other fugitives from Germany were to be
expected.</p>

<p>At six they returned to the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> for baths and
clean clothes. Here, of course, the secret agents were waiting.
One, a flashy-looking fellow, was in the little foyer of the
hotel, and Lee went up to him:</p>

<p>"Glad to see you again," he said affably. "Have a cigar?"</p>

<p>"Many thanks," said the man, taking it without cracking a
smile.</p>

<p>As they went up in the lift, Lee said to Luke: "Silly game,
isn't it? They know that I'm on to them, and now they know that I
know they know."</p>

<p>They had not been long in their rooms when the telephone rang.
It was Bosco. As this was not his usual hour, Lee knew that the
message must be an important one, and stood beside Luke while he
took it.</p>

<p>Luke repeated: "Bosco says the Bulldog has returned to
Lisbon."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Lee. "Ask him how he found that out."</p>

<p>The answer came: "Bosco has just met his friends at the
<i>leiteria</i> and the lift operator told him. He thought you
ought to know immediately."</p>

<p>"Very good. What were the circumstances of the Bulldog's
return?"</p>

<p>"He arrived at the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> about an hour ago.
He was evidently expected, because the Germans were all as
nervous as cats. Bulldog came into the hotel in a black rage, and
they cringed before him. He met Schoenhut in the foyer. In the
lift-operator's hearing, the Bulldog asked him if he had picked
up the little pig. Schoenhut said no, and there was a terrible
scene. The Bulldog stamped and cursed like a madman. He dragged
Schoenhut into a room, and slammed the door, and the lift
operator couldn't hear any more."</p>

<p>Lee glanced ruefully in a wall mirror. "I suppose I could be
called a little pig," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Bosco says," Luke continued, "that the lift operator seems to
be scared half out of his wits, and says he's not going back to
the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> to work any more."</p>

<p>"That would be very inconvenient for me," said Lee. "Ask Bosco
if he has a hundred escudos on him."</p>

<p>"He says he's got two hundred."</p>

<p>"Tell him to pass it to the lift operator and say there's a
thousand a week in it for him as long as he sticks to his job and
reports on what goes on in the <i>Excelsior</i>."</p>

<p>"Bosco says that will keep the lift operator going for a while
longer."</p>

<p>"All right. Tell Bosco to try and establish another connection
inside the hotel. Ask him how about the chambermaid?"</p>

<p>"Bosco says he'll look into the chambermaid."</p>

<p>"And tell Bosco to have the Bulldog followed, if possible, but
not to expose himself."</p>

<p>"Bosco says okay."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p class="first">AT noon next day Lee and Luke set out for the
<i>Macaco Branco</i> for the meal that the Portuguese termed
<i>almoço</i>, meaning breakfast, which, however, was a tolerably
sustaining meal. Two racks of glass trays containing hors-d'oeuvres
would be followed by a fish course, that by an entrée,
and that by a chateaubriand, say, which, they took it, was the
generic name for steak in Lisbon. The Senhora was always
disappointed when they declined to order wine like everybody else
for breakfast.</p>

<p>They followed their usual course across the <i>Roçio</i> and
through the <i>Rua do Arco de Graça</i>. In this street they came
upon an arresting figure. It was a tiny old woman walking along
uncertainly, while she searched the faces of the passers-by with
a dreadful expression of anxiety in her faded eyes.</p>

<p>She looked like a print out of an old-fashioned book of
fashions, with her dress reaching almost to the ground, a wrap of
the sort that used to be called a dolman, and a little bonnet
trimmed with jet. She was lugging a satchel. It wasn't very big,
but it was too heavy for her. In her other hand she carried an
umbrella. Her clothes were not shabby, but looked as if they had
been kept for years in a press with lavender, only to be brought
out on rare occasions. Lost, strange, distressed persons were so
common a sight in Lisbon, nobody was paying any attention to her.
Lee and Luke paused instinctively.</p>

<p>"Speak to her," said Lee.</p>

<p>Luke addressed her in Portuguese. "Can we help you.
Madam?"</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly, like a child, and sadly shook
her head.</p>

<p>"Try her in English."</p>

<p>English had no better success. "<i>Sprechen Sie Deutsch</i>?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Lee came forward. "I speak a little German," he said in that
tongue. "How can we help you, Madam?"</p>

<p>Her face brightened. But Lee and Luke were a little stunned by
her answer. "Can you direct me to the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> in
the <i>Rua Azorrague</i>?"</p>

<p>Lee's expression hardened. "Sorry, I do not know that
street."</p>

<p>The little old lady drooped. Lee understood her to murmur:
"<i>Ich hab' Hunger</i>." Pity revived.</p>

<p>Lee said quickly: "My friend and I are on the way to eat. If
Madame would do us the honour of accompanying us. There is a
restaurant on the little square yonder."</p>

<p>She thanked him prettily. "I have money," she explained, "but
I cannot speak the Portuguese. I was afraid to enter one of the
restaurants alone."</p>

<p>Luke took the satchel and they walked on. Lee and Luke
exchanged a wondering glance over the bonnet of their little
companion. Who or what was she?</p>

<p>"Are you gentlemen English?" she asked in her gentle way.</p>

<p>"American," said Lee. "But though our two countries are at war
that is no reason why we..."</p>

<p>She quickly interrupted him. "I am not at war with America.
America loves liberty."</p>

<p>Once again Lee gasped for breath, so to speak. "Then why are
you looking for the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They told me it was the headquarters for German people," she
said simply.</p>

<p>"Not your kind of Germans," said Lee grimly.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, sir."</p>

<p>"Wait until we get to the restaurant," said Lee. "It is right
before us. There we can talk at our ease...By the way, my name is
Amos Lee Mappin and this is my secretary, Luke Tremaine."</p>

<p>"I am Frau Anna Mahler."</p>

<p>Her fears departed. She settled herself at the table like an
obedient child. Lee translated the <i>lista de pratos</i> for her
and she expressed herself as pleased with everything. "But I
could not eat all that!" she protested.</p>

<p>"Neither can we," said Lee.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke were charmed with her old-fashioned, lady-like
manners.</p>

<p>"What is wrong with the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i>, Herr Mappin?"
she asked anxiously. "You looked so strange when I mentioned the
name."</p>

<p>Lee said bluntly: "It's the headquarters in Lisbon for the
Gestapo."</p>

<p>She fell back in her chair with a look of pure terror.
"Gestapo!" she whispered. "Are you sure? How do you know
that?"</p>

<p>"It is something everybody in Lisbon knows."</p>

<p>"<i>Mein Gott!</i> What a narrow escape!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Where did you get the name of that hotel?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"I came by railway last night," said Frau Mahler. "On the
street I saw a sign 'hotel' and it was late, so I looked no
further. They gave me a room. There was no restaurant in that
hotel. This morning I ask them if there is a hotel for German
people and they tell me <i>Hotel Excelsior</i>. It was not far,
they said. I could have taken a cab, but the drivers looked so
fierce, they drove so fast, I was afraid."</p>

<p>"It was a lucky escape," said Lee. "If you're a free German,
you are one of us and you can be quite open. Tell us how we can
help you, <i>gnädige Frau</i>? Where do you come from, and where
are you going?"</p>

<p>"I want to go to America," she said unhesitatingly. "I have a
son there."</p>

<p>Luke heard the word "Amerika" and blurted out: "Well, you
certainly came to the right shop, Lady!"</p>

<p>Lee sent him a warning glance. "Does your son know you're on
the way?"</p>

<p>"No! No!" she said. "How could I let him know? I would have
been stopped."</p>

<p>"You can let him know safely from here," said Lee. "That's the
first thing to be done." He took out his notebook and she
obediently gave him a name, "Ludwig Mahler," and a street and
number in Chicago. "It is long since I had a letter," she said
sadly.</p>

<p>"You have a passport?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>She made haste to open the satchel and produce it. "It's a
good German passport," she explained, "from before the war. With
my name and photograph and all. Only the exit visa is false.
There are men in Germany who will do that for you for money."</p>

<p>"Didn't these same men tell you where you could find friends
on the way?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I had no friends on the way."</p>

<p>"In Germany didn't you hear about the Underground?"</p>

<p>Another shake of the head.</p>

<p>"An innocent abroad!" murmured Lee. "Tell us about the
journey, <i>gnädige Frau</i>."</p>

<p>"No trouble," she said. "My passport was good. In Switzerland,
in France, in Spain, there are many Germans. In the railway
station I write 'Lyons, third class', or 'Madrid', or 'Lisbon',
on a paper and push it in the ticket office. Nobody questioned
me."</p>

<p>"Well, you're all right now," said Lee, "...if you can keep
out of the hands of the Gestapo. All you need is an American
visa, and you can walk on a ship and walk off in New York. You
would have to wait a long time for a seat in a plane."</p>

<p>"No plane!" she said, looking scared again. "How would I get
an American visa?"</p>

<p>"You will have to tell the American Minister all about
yourself and let him investigate."</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," she said sadly. "I will tell
you...I was born Anna Ehrlich. My husband, Hans Mahler, was a
clerk in the municipality of Muenchen. He never rose very high,
and we were poor but contented enough until the war. We had one
child, our son Ludwig. He was a Social-Democrat and he went to
America when Hitler rose to power. Since then things have gone
from bad to worse in the Fatherland. We were little people; we
didn't mix in politics. We suffered and kept our mouths shut.
Nobody bothered us. Six months ago my husband died. We had our
savings. I thought and thought. Ludwig could never return to
Germany again, and I wanted to see him before I died. I made long
plans. Little by little, I turned everything we had into money. I
was such a little person, nobody noticed me. So at last I set
out. That is all, <i>mein Herr</i>."</p>

<p>"It's enough," said Lee. "Life will begin again for you
now."</p>

<p>"Where can I stay in Lisbon while I'm waiting?" she asked
timidly.</p>

<p>"We'll find you a place," said Lee. "Unfortunately, the
Gestapo witnessed our meeting."</p>

<p>The little woman's hand went to her breast. "The Gestapo!" she
echoed.</p>

<p>"Follow us everywhere," said Lee cheerfully.</p>

<p>"In a neutral land!"</p>

<p>"They take advantage of neutrality."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Watching the restaurant from the little square outside."</p>

<p>Frau Mahler seemed to lose her appetite.</p>

<p>"For that reason, you cannot live in our hotel," Lee went on.
"If you were watched all the time it would be like a prison."</p>

<p>"It should be a modest place, <i>mein Herr</i>," she said
timidly. "I haven't much..."</p>

<p>"You don't have to consider money," said Lee. "There is a fund
subscribed by loyal German-Americans to enable others to escape
from the Nazis."</p>

<p>"How wonderful!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"I know the very place for you," said Lee. "It is not a hotel,
but an humble Lisbon home kept by a kind-hearted woman. I'll take
you there after lunch."</p>

<p>"But if the Gestapo follows us, I will still be watched!"</p>

<p>Lee laughed. "My friend and I have ways of shaking them off
when we have need to."</p>

<p>"You are so kind, <i>mein Herr</i>," she whispered. "And to a
stranger!"</p>

<p>"Not kind at all!" said Lee gruffly. "It's my job to help
people like you."</p>

<p>When they had finished their lunch, they asked the Senhora to
telephone for a taxi. They waited for it just inside the door of
the restaurant, and the moment it drew up hastened across the
sidewalk and got in. There was no other cab instantly available,
and in this manner they got the jump on their trailers. After
turning half a dozen corners and making certain they were not
followed, Lee could safely tell the driver to take them to the
<i>Calcado Burro</i> at the end of the <i>Rua
Bacalhoeiros</i>&mdash;Street of the Codfish-sellers.</p>

<p>The little old lady's fears were relieved now, and as they
drove along she chattered about the scenes she saw through the
window.</p>

<p>"All these women seem to spend their time gossiping in the
street. Their homes must be a sight!...Many women are carrying
baskets of fish on their hands...The men have caps hanging down
their backs like children. Fish, fish everywhere."</p>

<p>"This is the quarter of the sailors and the fishermen," Lee
explained.</p>

<p>"Fish was always expensive in Muenchen," she ran on
innocently. "We were so far from the sea." She touched her
handkerchief to her eyes. "Ach! that dear Muenchen! I am old to
start a new life, <i>mein Herr</i>! How can I live without
music!"</p>

<p>"There is plenty of music in Lisbon," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Music!" She held up her tiny gloved hands in scorn. "Not
German music!"</p>

<p>Soon they were knocking at the great oaken door of Teresa's
little house in the heart of the swarming <i>Alfama</i> district.
Teresa's wrinkles spread with gladness at the sight of them.
Teresa never understood why Lee took so much trouble to save the
enemies of his country, but every visit he made always meant
perquisites, in addition to the rent, and he was therefore very
welcome.</p>

<p>"What about the little white-haired children?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They are safe," said Lee. Luke translated for him.</p>

<p>"Where is the pink-faced young man?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lee, not wanting to provoke an emotional display, merely said:
"He has gone home."</p>

<p>Teresa led them into the big bedroom at the back. It
over-looked a little pocket-handkerchief of a garden with gay
flowers and a miniature ilex tree.</p>

<p>"How pretty!" said the German woman. "Where does that little
door in the wall go?"</p>

<p>"To a back lane," said Lee. "We can get out that way if the
front door is blocked."</p>

<p>Teresa was studying Mrs. Mahler with strong curiosity. The two
women presented a striking contrast. With her deeply seamed face
and glowing, dark eyes, Teresa looked like a witch beside the
dainty little German lady.</p>

<p>"Teresa, this is Senhora Mahler," said Lee. "She has had much
trouble. Take good care of her for me."</p>

<p>"Si! Si! Senhor," said Teresa dutifully. It was clear from her
expression, however, that an old woman did not appeal to her
sympathies like the German children had. She was noting how
sharply Mrs. Mahler's eyes searched the corners. The room was
clean, by Portuguese standards, but not German clean.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Mahler, Lee said: "You are to ask Teresa for anything
you may need. Unfortunately, she does not speak your language,
but I am sure, with a woman's wit, you can make each other
understand. I will get you a German-Portuguese phrase book."</p>

<p>"Must I stay in my room all the time?" Mrs. Mahler asked
wistfully.</p>

<p>"No. You are safe in this district. Ask Teresa to write her
name and address on a piece of paper, so you'll be sure of
getting back here."</p>

<p>"I shan't go far," she said.</p>

<p>"Better not let anybody know you are German," Lee warned.</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, with widening eyes.</p>

<p>"Germans are not popular in Lisbon just now," he said
grimly.</p>

<p>She touched her handkerchief to her eyes. "Ah, my poor
country!"</p>

<p>She recovered her spirits before Lee left. "It is like a
beautiful dream!" she said, "to find friends in a strange
country!...What about my business here in Lisbon, Herr
Mappin?"</p>

<p>"I will take care of that," said Lee.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again?" she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"To-morrow at this same time, Frau Mahler."</p>

<p>"I shall be waiting for you."

<p><br>
ON his return to town, Lee told Mrs. Mahler's story to his
friend, the Minister, and a cable was immediately dispatched from
the Legation to Ludwig Mahler in Chicago.</p>

<p>Later, in the hotel, Lee asked the ample, rolling-eyed Natalia
what she had observed of the movements of the two men in number
218 adjoining during the last couple of days. Natalia now had the
air of a fellow-conspirator with them; she was enjoying the
situation.</p>

<p>"Name of Rosado," said Natalia; "old man, young man; they give
out they are father and son, but it is not so. The young man when
nobody is around calls the other Luiz. Old man big and hairy like
a bear; young man sly and naughty, always after women."</p>

<p>Lee said: "I've seen those two in the lift. I gave the young
one a cigar. Go on, Natalia."</p>

<p>"The old man goes out a great deal, the young man hangs around
the room doing nothing. I am always finding him there. He makes
love all the time. He has had much experience&mdash;but so have
I! It is very amusing." At this point Natalia gave them an
imitation in pantomime of Casanova's frank advances, and how she
rebuffed them. Luke rocked with laughter.</p>

<p>"Understand, Senhor, he is not doing this because he likes me;
it is because he has been told to do it. A woman always knows. He
is after something else. I do not know what it is."</p>

<p>"I know," said Lee. "It's what they've been after from the
first. All-go-down didn't get it, so they've put the Bear on the
job. He sounds like a tougher proposition. The young one, I take
it, is just a stooge."</p>

<p>Natalia, through the medium of Luke, continued: "The young man
is always asking me what hour do I get my lunch or my dinner,
when I go home and so on. I think maybe they enter this room,
Senhor, when I am out of the way."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," said Lee. "One may assume that they have
inherited All-go-down's pass-key."</p>

<p>Natalia said: "The Senhor takes it calmly!"</p>

<p>"They'll never find what they're looking for in here while
we're out," said Lee. "While we're in the room, the door is
bolted. When we shoot that bolt we turn it in its sheath. You
can't do anything with a bolt like that short of breaking down
the door."</p>

<p>Natalia pointed significantly to the water bottle.</p>

<p>"They won't catch us that way twice," said Lee. "We drink
bottled water from the bar."</p>

<p>Luke put in: "They have a nerve coming into our rooms. Suppose
we were to return and catch them here?"</p>

<p>"Not much danger of that," said Lee. "The men who trail us
about can keep them informed by telephone."</p>

<p>Natalia said dramatically: "Look, Senhor! Here is something
else." She was pointing to the keyhole of the communicating door
between their sitting-room and number 218. "It was stuffed with
paper, Senhor, and they have pulled it out!"</p>

<p>Lee laughed. "Childish!" he said. The communicating door was
bolted on his side. Shoving back the bolt, he tried the door, and
found it bolted on the other side as well.</p>

<p>"I will stuff the keyhole with paper again," said Natalia.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Let them peep and listen. We're on our
guard. Let them think we haven't discovered their trick."

<p><br>
WHEN they returned to the hotel after dinner, Bosco called up.
Bosco, it appeared, had made progress in organising his forces.
He was spending money like a lord on Lee's behalf. Since Lee had
told him not to loiter in the <i>Rua Azorrague</i>, he had hired
a room across the street from the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> with a
window commanding the windows of the hotel and the entrance. By
keeping a certain distance back from his window, he could see all
who entered and left the hotel without showing himself. Bosco had
also hired two sharp Lisbon newsboys who knew the city like a
book, and he knew where to lay his hands on more if required.
They hated Germans, he said.</p>

<p>Senhor Mappin had instructed him to follow the Bulldog without
showing himself, he went on. Very well, he had engaged a taxi to
wait in the street a hundred yards beyond the hotel with one of
his boys inside, watching through the rear window. Meanwhile, he
was at his window opposite the hotel. About ten o'clock a taxi
drove up and the Bulldog came out and was driven away. Bosco
opened his window and shook out a white cloth like a dusting rag.
This was the signal to the boy in the taxi.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Bosco had to report a failure then. The Bulldog
soon discovered that his cab was being trailed by another, and he
drove around until he succeeded in shaking it off. He returned to
the hotel in a couple of hours and remained there all afternoon.
Evidently there was something doing, because men were coming and
going all day.</p>

<p>Bosco further reported that the lift operator had brought the
chambermaid to the <i>leiteria</i>. She was an ugly girl, Bosco
said, and very pleased to get a little attention. He had a date
to take her out on her first night off. Finally, Bosco wanted to
know if he could hire a taxi by the week so that he could always
have it handy. He would need more money for that, he said. He
knew just the man.</p>

<p>"A clever fellow," said Lee dryly, "but he's like to ruin us
with too much cleverness. Tell him this: He is <i>not</i> to hire
a taxi. The Germans would instantly get on to it and his friend,
the driver would be found floating in the river one morning. The
public taxis are safer. Change them often. Tell him he is to stay
away from that room in the <i>Rua Azorrague</i>. How often does
he think he could use that trick with the dustrag before the
Germans spot it? It was just dumb luck that he got away with it
to-day. The Bulldog must be already investigating how it happened
that he was followed away from the hotel. Let Bosco's boys watch
the hotel in rotation and report to him."

<p><br>
NEXT morning the Legation telephoned that no answer had been
received from Ludwig Mahler, and Lee requested that the cable
company be asked to furnish a report on the message. Such a
report came from the Legation just before lunch.</p>

<p>"Party moved. Whereabouts unknown."</p>

<p>This was the unpleasant news that Lee had to carry to the
waiting mother.</p>

<p>Lee, with the help of the Minister, enlisted the services of
the F.B.I. in starting a search in America for the missing
man.</p>

<p>When they went for their lunch, Lee noted that they were
followed by the same two men as on the previous day. They had the
appearance of Portuguese, but were not the same two that he had
once side-tracked into a cinema. These were husky bravos with
hard, blue-chinned faces. All they needed were black cloaks and
broad-brimmed hats to walk on as brigands in a melodrama. The
older of the two sported a pair of ferocious mustaches; the
younger was decorated by a livid scar from temple to chin. This
one habitually kept his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>While they were eating their lunch, Lee was called to the
telephone. On returning to the table he reported that it was
Inspector da Gama. "They told him at the hotel that we were here.
He wanted to warn me that Stengel had returned to Lisbon. Very
decent of him. I didn't tell him that I knew it already. Da Gama
wants me to call him back in half an hour, in case he has further
news."</p>

<p>When Luke and Lee issued out of the restaurant, they saw that
their trackers had taken the precaution to have a taxi waiting
near. The Americans entered the first cruising taxi that came
along, and the usual chase through the streets began. Lee had it
in mind to use a cinema Luke had found with an emergency exit in
the rear, but after all they did not find it necessary to change
cabs. They lost their pursuers in the winding streets.</p>

<p>"Odd," said Lee, "that they let themselves be shaken off so
easily to-day. You'd think they'd be hell-bent to discover where
we've hidden the little woman."</p>

<p>They drove on to the <i>Alfama</i>. At the opening of the
steep <i>Calcado Burro</i> they paid off the taxi and Lee went
into a pay station to telephone Da Gama. "No further news," he
said when he came out.</p>

<p>Above the steps, the crooked little street presented its usual
lively appearance. Women with baskets darted in and out of little
basement shops or paused to exchange the latest news, speaking at
the top of their voices to make themselves heard above the cries
of the hucksters. Screeching children darted among the legs of
their elders, playing a game of their own. A young man posed
gracefully on the corner, twanging a guitar and allowing himself
to be admired. Always beneath the loud, near voices one could
hear a chorus of chattering as of a flock of birds.</p>

<p>"Gay, isn't it?" said Lee. "But I shouldn't like to live in
the thick of it."</p>

<p>The cul-de-sac where Teresa lived was strangely quiet by
contrast. All the doors of the little one-storey houses with
red-tiled eaves were shut and the windows shuttered. The inhabitants,
it appeared, had gone off to join the sociable throng in the
<i>Calcado</i>.</p>

<p>Lee knocked, and the door was quickly opened by little Frau
Mahler herself, her face wreathed in smiles. "Teresa has gone to
do her shopping," she said. "I was listening for your knock. I am
so glad to see you!" The great door swung to and she shot a bolt
across. "Teresa said I must always bolt it," she said.</p>

<p>She preceded them through the short tiled passage. The stairs
to the kitchen went down at one side. Opening the door to her
room, she went in saying:</p>

<p>"Enter, <i>meine Herren!</i>"</p>

<p>Lee had a glimpse of men within the room, and stopped short on
the threshold. Instantly the door of Teresa's room behind them
banged open, there was a rush of feet, and two men charged into
Lee and Luke, thrusting them into the rear room. The door slammed
to behind them.</p>

<p>The little old woman stood before them transfigured with rage
and hate. Her faded eyes were blazing. "Heil Hitler! Heil
Hitler!" she shrilled, thrusting up her hand in the Nazi salute.
"Now you see me for what I am! A faithful servant of <i>der
Führer</i>'s and a hater of all his enemies!"</p>

<p>Lee and Luke stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>"Heil Hitler! You shall say it, too, Yankee pigs! Under the
whip you shall say it!"</p>

<p>A man's voice rumbled from behind her: "Quiet, woman!"</p>

<p>She could not stop. For twenty-four hours rage had been
accumulating in her until it had reached the point of explosion.
"Yankee pigs!" she screeched. "Liars! Murderers! I spit on
you!"</p>

<p>"Quiet!" repeated the man. "Or you'll be put out of the
room!"</p>

<p>She burst into the loud, toneless weeping of hysteria and sat
on the edge of the bed. Lee and Luke looked away from the ugly
sight.</p>

<p>From the corner of the room a harsh voice said, in guttural
English: "Good afternoon, Mr. Mappin. I am happy to make your
acquaintance!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p class="first">IN the rear bedroom of the little house in the
<i>Alfama</i>, Lee Mappin and Luke Tremaine were fronted by five
hard, grinning faces. Beyond them two pairs of windows stood open
to the little balcony and the free air of heaven. They could see
a patch of blue sky and the sun gilding the green top of the
little ilex tree in the yard, a tormenting sight to trapped men.
For a moment or two, while the Gestapo agents savoured their
triumph, nobody spoke.</p>

<p>Luke muttered to Lee: "Anybody would have been fooled!
Anybody! She put on a marvellous show!"</p>

<p>"I ought to have seen through it!" said Lee.</p>

<p>Luke moved closer to Lee. He glanced towards the windows.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Useless," he whispered. "Our best chance
is to play for time."</p>

<p>In the right-hand corner of the room alongside the window, a
tall man with a prominent Adam's apple, a long nose, and grey
hair sticking out in every direction, sat at the same table where
one night the Erbelding children had eaten their supper. His long
fingers beat an idle tattoo while he grinned evilly at Lee.
Judging from Bosco's description, this was Schoenhut, the local
chief. The man guessed what was passing through the minds of the
prisoners:</p>

<p>"Shut the windows," he said. And when this was done: "Tie them
up!"</p>

<p>"We have no intention of trying to escape," said Lee
mildly.</p>

<p>"Can't trust you!" said the grinning Schoenhut. "Tie them
up!"</p>

<p>The other four men circled around them warily. Two had coils
of a light, thin rope. It was the same sort of rope that had
bound William Miller. The faces of all four were known to Lee.
Two he recognised with a grim start of humour as the two men who
had been trailing him earlier in the day. "Mustaches" and
"Scarface" he christened them for purposes of identification. No
wonder they had allowed him to give them the slip. They knew
where he was going and desired to get there first. Scarface was
still keeping his hands in his pockets. The remaining two were
men he had seen around the hotel; his neighbours in room 218, of
course: the Bear and the coarsely handsome Casanova as named by
Natalia. They were registered as Luiz and Antonio Rosado.</p>

<p>All four of these men were of the type of brutalised, hired
murderers. Possibly Portuguese, or they might have been of any
race. Professional murderers have no nationality. Though there
were so many of them, they hesitated about starting a mix-up.
Schoenhut laid a gun on the table and joined the others.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, what are you waiting for?" demanded Lee. "Tie
us up and be done with it!" To Luke he whispered: "Don't
struggle! You will need all your strength later."</p>

<p>Finally a rope was thrown over Lee's head and drawn tight
about his upper arms. When Scarface went into action, he had to
take his hands out of his pockets and Lee saw that he was wearing
brown cotton gloves. Lee's eyes burned at the sight. Beside him.
Lee saw Luke sweating, grinding his teeth in the effort to hold
himself in. Hard as his orders were, Luke obeyed. The ropes were
cast round and round their bodies and knotted at every turn from
shoulders to ankles. They were relieved of their guns. Mrs.
Mahler, sitting on the bed, watched the performance with hateful
delight. Lee wondered how the woman could ever have made herself
look innocent and gentle.</p>

<p>"Push up chairs for the gentlemen," commanded Schoenhut
sarcastically. As Lee and Luke sank on the chairs, he went on:
"Search their pockets and the linings of their clothes."</p>

<p>Nothing of any account was found upon them but their wallets.
There was a considerable sum of money in Lee's wallet. Young
Scarface counted it, and his eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"Put it back!" rasped Schoenhut. "We are not robbers!"</p>

<p>Lee permitted himself to smile.</p>

<p>Schoenhut was disappointed at not finding any papers. "You
have not been to the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> lately," he snarled.
"Where's your new office?"</p>

<p>"<i>Rua Ventura, 11,</i>" said Lee calmly. "On the fourth
floor."</p>

<p>Lee's seeming candour took the other man aback and he
scratched his chin to hide it. Luke grinned.</p>

<p>"There's nothing there," added Lee, "but of course, if you
want to break into the place and search it, I can't stop
you."</p>

<p>"Where do you keep your papers?" demanded Schoenhut.</p>

<p>"There are no papers," said Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>Lee went on: "As soon as it is read and digested, everything
is destroyed." He tapped his skull. "Everything is in here."</p>

<p>Schoenhut pounded the table. "And we know how to get it out of
there, too!" he cried with an oath.</p>

<p>It galled him that Lee was able to keep cool and smile while
he could not. Rising, he walked across the room and back; stood
for a moment or two looking out into the sunny yard. When he
resumed his seat his face was smooth.</p>

<p>"Well, we have all afternoon," he said with pretended
joviality; "Teresa won't disturb us and her husband is at
sea."</p>

<p>"Where is Teresa?" Lee demanded boldly.</p>

<p>"Down in the kitchen," said Schoenhut.</p>

<p>"Alive or dead?"</p>

<p>Schoenhut made believe to be grieved. "Why, Mr. Mappin, what
do you think we are!"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to say," retorted Lee.</p>

<p>"We have no desire to injure that good woman, but only to keep
her out of the way while you and I transact our business."</p>

<p>"What is our business?"</p>

<p>Schoenhut did not answer him directly. "We have no desire to
injure you either, but only to remove you as a threat to our
work. As an enemy spy, Mappin, I'd be justified in shooting you
at sight and throwing your body in the street. But you're such a
little fellow, I couldn't bear to do it!"</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question," said Lee. "What's our
business this afternoon?"</p>

<p>As Schoenhut started to speak again, the bearded man whom
Natalia had christened the Bear, interrupted him: "Better wait
until <i>he</i> comes," he said significantly.</p>

<p>Schoenhut subsided, lit a cigarette, and leaned back in his
chair. "You're a pretty cool customer," he said to Lee.</p>

<p>"I see no reason to be otherwise," said Lee.</p>

<p>Lee was presenting a perfectly bland face to his tormentors,
but Luke, glancing sideways, could see the fine drops of
perspiration springing on his upper lip. By twisting a little in
his bonds, Lee was able to glance at his wrist watch. "Quarter to
three," he murmured to Luke. Luke wondered what difference time
made to them now.</p>

<p>Silence fell in the room. The two beds had been pushed to the
back to make more space. Mustaches and Scarface sat down beside
Mrs. Mahler and the three of them lit cigarettes. It was odd to
see the difference a cigarette hanging from her lips made in the
prim old woman. She looked like an old vixen now. Schoenhut
leaned back silently, drumming his fingers on the table. The Bear
stood against the wall in a state of suspended animation.
Casanova opened one of the windows and lounged beside it
breathing in the fresher air. Minutes passed.</p>

<p>Lee smiled at Luke. "Keep your dander up!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"I'm okay," said Luke quickly. "I was prepared for something
like this."</p>

<p>More minutes passed. In the distance they could hear the human
bustle far off in the <i>Calcado Burro</i>. Luke twisted
restlessly in his bonds.</p>

<p>"God! it's hard to wait in silence," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Having to wait is a Godsend!" said Lee quickly.</p>

<p>Luke glanced sharply in his face, but Lee volunteered no
further explanation.</p>

<p>Lee looked at his watch again. "Seven minutes to three!"</p>

<p>Finally there was a double knock at the street door. Mrs.
Mahler sprang up from the bed. "Here he is!"</p>

<p>Schoenhut rose. "Listen!" The first double knock was followed
after a space by another, then a third. "All right!" said
Schoenhut. "Let him in!"</p>

<p>In passing Lee the woman spat and whispered with an ugly,
contorted face: "Now you'll get what you deserve!"</p>

<p>They heard her open the street door and close it. The iron
bolt scraped across; heavy footsteps sounded on the tiles, and
into the room strode the man who had figured in Bosco's reports
as the Bulldog. He was of medium height, but the big head and the
immense breadth of shoulder seemed to dwarf him. With that broad
face, heavy brows, flattened nose, undershot jaw, Bulldog was
inevitable. Ordinarily his little pale eyes had a pained
roll&mdash;such a man is never satisfied, but now they were
swimming with venomous pleasure. At the moment everything was
going well for him.</p>

<p>Ignoring Luke, he stood in front of Lee. "So we meet at
last!"</p>

<p>Lee said nothing.</p>

<p>"I did it! I did it!" shrilled Mrs. Mahler. "I delivered him
into your hands!"</p>

<p>He glanced at her contemptuously. "You shall be suitably
rewarded. Leave the room now."</p>

<p>"No! No!" she protested, clasping her hands. "Please let me
stay! I've earned it!"</p>

<p>"It is no sight for a woman."</p>

<p>"I have no sex! I am a servant of <i>der Führer</i>! <i>Heil
Hitler</i>!"</p>

<p>Stengel shrugged and forgot her. She resumed her former seat
on the edge of the bed, watching and listening, moistening her
dry old lips in anticipation.</p>

<p>Stengel said to his men: "I have received information that
Pedro Chavez' fishing-boat has entered the river. He may be
expected home in an hour. We'll deal with him when he comes."</p>

<p>Stengel spoke a medley of tongues; Portuguese or German to his
men; English to Lee&mdash;all in the same thick, guttural tones.
When he spoke Portuguese, Luke softly translated for Lee.</p>

<p>With an arrogant jerk of the head, Stengel ordered the table
shoved up closer to Lee, and the chair placed behind it.
Schoenhut obsequiously hastened to obey. Stengel sat down,
smiling derisively.</p>

<p>"Well, Mappin!"</p>

<p>"Well, Stengel!"</p>

<p>"So you know me!"</p>

<p>"Your name is known all over the world."</p>

<p>"It's pleasant to find oneself famous."</p>

<p>"Well, that depends," said Lee, "upon what one is famous
for."</p>

<p>Upon Stengel's entrance, Scarface started to unwrap a cube-shaped
package that stood on the floor between the windows along
with a paper bag. The package contained a little charcoal
brazier, such as plumbers use, together with several irons; the
paper bag had charcoal to feed it. Lee grimly took note of the
charcoal. Scarface carried the stove out on the balcony, where he
proceeded to make a fire in it, blowing the charcoal until it
glowed cherry red.</p>

<p>"First of all," said Stengel to Lee briskly, "describe your
relations with the United States Minister to Portugal."</p>

<p>Lee sparred for time. "With a view to forcing the Portuguese
Government to ask for his recall?"</p>

<p>"Never mind why."</p>

<p>"I have had that danger in mind from the beginning," said Lee,
"and I have been most careful not to draw the Minister into any
unneutral acts on my behalf. It is true, he issued a pass to the
Erbelding family, but that cannot be called an unneutral act,
because my country has accepted the Erbeldings as citizens."</p>

<p>Stengel's face darkened. "Criminals and traitors!" he cried,
rapping the table sharply.</p>

<p>"In that case, why not let us have them, and all others like
them," asked Lee mildly.</p>

<p>"Germany punishes traitors!" said Stengel. He commanded his
anger. "You would like to draw me into a discussion, wouldn't
you? Pardon me if I decline." His stubby forefinger shot out.
"Mappin, who supplies you so generously with money?"</p>

<p>"There's no secret about that, Stengel. It's a private
organisation in America known as the Association for Aiding
Anti-Nazis. It's supported by voluntary contributions, principally
from German-Americans."</p>

<p>Stengel swallowed this pill with a wry face.</p>

<p>Scarface brought the little brazier into the room. The
charcoal was glowing redly. He stuck the irons into the fire and
blew on the coals. The irons were long and slender, and had
wooden handles. Lee and Luke watched with fascinated faces.</p>

<p>"This is reproducing the scene that was played in the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i>," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>"Now," barked Stengel. "I want the names of your European
agents. You have a sort of underground railway, haven't you?
Reaching across Spain and France and Switzerland into Germany
itself. Give me the names of the agents, beginning with those
<i>inside</i> Germany."</p>

<p>"There are agents in Germany, no doubt," said Lee, "but I have
no concern with them. I don't know their names. All my
communications are cleared in Switzerland."</p>

<p>"How are they passed back and forth across the border?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. By many routes, I assume."</p>

<p>"Whom do you address in Switzerland?"</p>

<p>Lee hesitated. Scarface drew one of the irons out of the fire
to look at it. It glowed almost white hot. He thrust it back.</p>

<p>Stengel rapped on the table. "Answer the question!"</p>

<p>No sound from Lee.</p>

<p>"Schoenhut," said Stengel, in a slow, caressing voice, "take
off Mappin's shoes and stockings. He has such dainty little feet
I'm sure they must be tender."</p>

<p>The tall German hastened to obey. The sweat ran down Lee's
white, mask-like face. Luke could bear no more.</p>

<p>"If they hurt you...if they hurt you," he cried brokenly, "I
can't stand it! I'm going to talk!"</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" said Lee, loud enough for Stengel to hear. "Talk,
if it will ease you! Anything you like! Now you know why I have
never taken you into my full confidence."</p>

<p>Luke's head dropped on his breast. He gritted his teeth in the
effort to regain control.</p>

<p>"For the last time!" Stengel barked to Lee. "The name of the
Swiss agent?"</p>

<p>Silence from Lee.</p>

<p>Stengel nodded to Scarface, who approached Lee with the
glowing, white-tipped iron in his hand. Scarface had the most
villainous face of them all; retreating forehead, bright, glassy,
black eyes without a vestige of human expression. He dropped to
his knees in front of Lee.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" cried Lee breathlessly, "I'll talk!"</p>

<p>Luke jerked up his head. "No!" he cried, turning a face of
horror and dismay. What he read in Lee's face reassured him. His
chin dropped on his breast again. He was silent.</p>

<p>"Get up!" said Stengel to Scarface.</p>

<p>The young man rose with an ugly look of disappointment, and
thrust his iron back into the coals.</p>

<p>"Proceed!" said Stengel to Lee.</p>

<p>Lee was breathing fast. He spoke a name and an address in
Berne, Switzerland. Stengel wrote it down. "Go on!" he said.</p>

<p>Under his questioning, Lee gave other names in Grenoble, in
Lyons, in Marseilles, in Nîmes, France; in Barcelona, Madrid and
other towns in Spain. As he proceeded, Stengel's face darkened
with suspicion.</p>

<p>"If you're lying, it won't do you any good," he said. "I
shan't let you go until I have verified these names." To
Schoenhut he went on: "If there is another knock on the door it
will be Pedro Chavez and his son. Let the woman open the door,
and you men fall on him inside. They can join the woman below. If
necessary, we'll spend the night here."</p>

<p>Lee lowered his head so that Stengel could not see into his
face.</p>

<p>Taking an envelope from his breast pocket, Stengel removed the
letter it contained and spread it on the table. "This will be the
test," he said to Lee. "Your next answers will tell me if you are
lying."</p>

<p>Lee, who thought he recognised the writing, eyed the letter
anxiously.</p>

<p>"This is a letter to you," Stengel went on, "which I
intercepted&mdash;never mind how. It doesn't make any sense as
written, and I want you to decode it. It's postmarked Nîmes,
France, and addressed to Monsieur Mappin at the Lisbon post
office."</p>

<p>Lee said nothing.</p>

<p>Stengel read from the letter:

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">The news from the front
continues to be discouraging. The Americans are still advancing
in Italy, but at an enormous cost to themselves in men and
material. A mere handful of Germans is keeping their whole armies
in check.</p>

<p class="letter">My aged and respected Aunt Clora Duval passed
away last Wednesday at Montpelier at six o'clock in the evening.
She did not suffer in the end. Our respected friend, Major
Wertheim, the German Commandant for this district, sent a
beautiful wreath of wax flowers. His wife and sister were amongst
the great throng who attended the last sad obsequies. My good
Aunt was so long a sufferer, we cannot regret her passing. But
our hearts are very sad.</p>

<p class="letter">In Russia the German armies
continue to retire, contesting every foot of the way. In this
manner we shorten our lines, especially our supply lines, while
the enemy's lines are always lengthening. As we retire our
material rolls up like a snowball. In the spring you will see
everything changed. Our leaders are preparing a secret weapon
that will annihilate the foe.</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely your friend,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Armand</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>"Who is Armand of Nîmes?" asked Stengel with an ugly
smile.</p>

<p>"I have already given you his real name," said Lee.
"Naturally, letters are signed with a pseudonym."</p>

<p>"What is he reporting to you in this letter?"</p>

<p>"Just what you have read," said Lee. "All our letters are not
about business. The man's aunt dies. He is my friend. He tells me
about it."</p>

<p>Stengel flushed darkly. "Do you take me for a fool?" he
snapped, rapping the letter. "This pretence of friendliness to
the Germans is only to fool the censors. Would any enemy of
Germany write such a letter to another enemy if it was not to
deceive?"</p>

<p>Lee was silent.</p>

<p>Stengel changed his line of attack. "Is Walther Niebuhr named
in this letter?"</p>

<p>Lee looked innocent. "No," he said. "I do not know that
name."</p>

<p>"You lie! It is known that Niebuhr has lately passed through
Nîmes!"</p>

<p>"The name means nothing to me," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Then translate this letter," shouted Stengel, "and prove
it!"</p>

<p>"The letter tells its own story," persisted Lee.</p>

<p>"Bring the iron!" roared Stengel.</p>

<p>Scarface moved with alacrity to obey. Lee began to sweat
again. Luke turned away his tortured face. Scarface, with the
glowing iron, dropped to his knees at Lee's feet.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Stengel suddenly.</p>

<p>Scarface turned a scowling face over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Mappin may fancy himself in the role of a martyr," Stengel
went on with a curling lip. "He's such a humane little man.
Perhaps he'll yield quicker to the sight of pain in another." He
jerked his head in Luke's direction. "Take off his shirt!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Lee involuntarily. "He knows nothing!"</p>

<p>Stengel laughed. "Maybe not. But you do...I think this is
going to work," he went on to his men. "If it doesn't, if the
young fellow dies on us, we still have Mappin to work on."</p>

<p>In order to remove Luke's jacket and shirt, they had to throw
off the ropes. Scarface thrust his iron back in the coals so he
could give a hand. Luke got his arms free and started to fight.
Lee had no heart to forbid him now. The chair crashed over and
there was a wild confusion of beating fists and threshing legs on
the floor. The tall Schoenhut walked around the struggling men
looking for a chance to help; Stengel sat back in his chair
laughing; the old woman watched from the bed with a clenched hand
pressed against her lips.</p>

<p>Though they were four against one, it took time to subdue
Luke. Lee glanced at his watch again. Finally the chair was
planted back on its legs and Luke dropped on it, bruised and
bloody. They had torn his shirt off him piecemeal, and he was
bare to the waist. He was a little groggy, and his head rolled
helplessly on his neck. They tied his hands behind him to the
back of the chair, and his legs to the chair legs.</p>

<p>"He's a pretty fellow, isn't he?" drawled Stengel in English.
"Hey, you!" he went on to Scarface. "Can you write '<i>Heil
Hitler</i>!' across his manly chest? I'll spell it out for
you."</p>

<p>Scarface laughed and drew the pot of glowing coals up to
Luke's chair.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say before we begin?" Stengel asked
Lee.</p>

<p>Luke, recovering partly from his stupor, cried out: "Don't
weaken! Don't weaken! I can take it! It's better this way
than..."</p>

<p>Lee slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>Stengel nodded to Scarface. "Go ahead! Make a neat job of it.
First a capital H."</p>

<p>There was a faint hissing sound, and the stench of burning
flesh filled the room. The sweat poured down Luke's face but he
made no sound. The convulsed face of the man who welded the iron
was like something seen in a nightmare.</p>

<p>The dreadful silence was broken by a peremptory pounding on
the street door. Scarface held his hand. The woman jumped up from
the bed, but halted irresolutely, looking at Stengel. Stengel
rose, growling:</p>

<p>"That don't sound like a man at his own door. Go with the
woman, some of you. Don't open unless you're sure..."</p>

<p>Three of the men ran out. They had no more than reached the
passage when the knocking was renewed and voices were heard
demanding admittance. Stengel's men came tumbling back.</p>

<p>"The police!" they gasped.</p>

<p>Stengel broke into low, furious cursing. The powerful blows on
the street door convinced him. His face expressed a hellish
disappointment. "Out through the yard!" he ordered.</p>

<p>The men started tumbling down the kitchen stairs, the woman
with them. "Take that with you!" Stengel ordered Scarface,
indicating the brazier. "Empty the coals in the alley."</p>

<p>Stengel was the last to leave the room. Schoenhut's gun was
still on the table. He picked it up, glanced at Lee, hesitated.
In that instant, Lee looked squarely into the face of death. But
Stengel thought better of it; thrust the gun in his pocket, and
hastened after his men. The kitchen door slammed shut, and after
a moment, the door in the garden wall.</p>

<p>The police had secured something to serve as a battering-ram,
and there were repeated heavy blows on the street door. It
yielded with the sound of rending wood and scraping iron, and men
poured into the passage. Inspector da Gama came running into the
rear room followed by his men.</p>

<p>Luke managed to smile at him with stiff lips. "Just in
time!"</p>

<p>Lee was sagging limply in his bonds. Da Gama bent over him.
"Are you hurt, Mr. Mappin? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head feebly. "A man can stand a strain..." he
muttered. "Goes to pieces afterwards...All right now...There's a
woman in the kitchen. Take care of her."</p>

<p>"They escaped through the yard," volunteered Luke.</p>

<p>The Inspector took three men and went after the fugitives. One
was left to free Luke and Lee, another told off to keep the
curious neighbours out of the house, and a third to take care of
Teresa.</p>

<p>When the ropes were cut away, Lee and Luke stood erect and
stretched their cramped limbs, then gravely shook hands.</p>

<p>"My boy!" murmured Lee compassionately, when his eyes fell on
the ugly wound on the young man's breast.</p>

<p>Luke covered the place with his hand. "I got off easy!" he
said.</p>

<p>"If I had decoded the letter," said Lee, "it would have cost
the lives of three fugitives!"</p>

<p>"I know! You did right...How in hell did the Inspector get
here?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday," said Lee, "the woman fooled me completely. To-day,
when we were allowed to shake off our trackers so easily, I
got suspicious. It was just possible, I thought, that she might
have been used as a decoy. There were discrepancies in her story.
So when I talked to da Gama the second time, I said to him on the
chance: 'Inspector, I may be walking into a trap. If I don't call
you again in fifteen minutes, come quickly and bring men with
you.'"</p>

<p>"Too bad you didn't think to tell him about the back way out.
Then we'd have them all."</p>

<p>Lee slowly shook his head. "I thought of it. If they were
arrested to-day, what would happen? Stengel would be sent back to
Paris and I to New York. All our work would stop...We have much
to do first, Luke."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p class="first">TERESA, brought upstairs by the policeman, was
more frightened than hurt. In the back room she launched into an
impassioned story to Luke and a pair of sympathetic policemen.
Lee, who could not understand a word of it, paced the little
passage trying to bring his thoughts into some order. Presently
Pedro and Carlos came home, amazed to find a gaping crowd before
their house and a policeman on guard at the door.</p>

<p>Teresa began from the beginning, and Lee, who wanted action,
was ready to tear his hair. He succeeded in getting Pedro out in
the passage with Luke to translate. It was his first sight of the
fisherman in the light. Pedro, lean, hard and weather beaten, was
a reassuring physical specimen.</p>

<p>"Pedro, where is your boat?"</p>

<p>"At the <i>Cais do Sodré, Senhor</i>."</p>

<p>"If it is necessary, could you sail again to-night? Same
terms."</p>

<p>A broad smile spread across the fisherman's rugged face. This
was more profitable than fishing. "Si, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Teresa must not be left alone here while you are gone. Could
you take her with you?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senhor. Teresa is accustomed to the sea."</p>

<p>"I want you and Carlos to come to the hotel with me now. We
must act quickly. Get your Sunday clothes on. I suppose you
haven't got guns?"</p>

<p>Pedro shook his head. "We have knives, Senhor. They are
quieter."</p>

<p>"They took our guns, but I have another at the hotel."</p>

<p>Pedro asked only one question: "What are we going to do,
Senhor?"</p>

<p>Lee answered him indirectly: "Pedro, a man must avenge his own
injuries, and not leave it to the police."</p>

<p>This suited Pedro exactly. "Right!" he said, adding an
uncomplimentary reference to the police. He called Carlos out,
and they disappeared into the front room to change their clothes.
Lee kept Teresa going until her men were ready.</p>

<p>In less then quarter of an hour they started out. Teresa had
put a temporary dressing on Luke's wound, and Carlos had lent him
a shirt to cover his nakedness. Luke lingered behind for a
moment, and overtook them with a paper package under his arm.
Teresa was dropped at the house of a sister who lived near.
Pleased at the idea of obtaining a new audience, she did not
plague the men with many questions. Nothing was said to her as
yet about a sea voyage.</p>

<p>Down in the Street of the Cod-Sellers, the four men piled into
a taxi, and Luke gave the word to drive to the <i>Lisboa
Palace</i>. As they started, they passed the police car coming
back with its attendant motor cycles and fanfare of sirens. The
men exchanged grim smiles.</p>

<p>In the hotel the clerks in the bureau looked askance at the
rough fishermen in their ill-fitting Sunday blacks, but by this
time Lee was established in the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> as a
powerful and mysterious personage whose acts were not to be
questioned. They went up in the lift. In the corridor leading to
their suite, Lee laid a finger on his lips and they entered their
rooms without making a sound. Lee laid an ear to the crack of the
door that communicated with room 218 and turned around, nodding
and smiling.</p>

<p>He rang for the chambermaid and opened the door so that she
could enter without knocking. Luke unfastened his paper package.
It contained various lengths of the light rope that had lately
been used to bind Lee and Luke and Teresa. Some of the cut pieces
were too short, and Luke coolly proceeded to knot them together.
When Natalia entered, Lee received her with finger on lips and
pointed next door.</p>

<p>Natalia whispered to Luke, and Luke passed it along to Lee:
"She says they came in a few minutes ago and are packing to
leave."</p>

<p>Lee said: "These are her instructions; let her take fresh
towels into the room. She had better leave the door open a little
so she can make a quick getaway. After arranging the towels, on
her way out she is to pull back the bolt on the other side of the
communicating door and beat it!"</p>

<p>When this was repeated to her, Natalia was scared but not
altogether displeased at the prospect of a row. She nodded her
head a great many times and went away to get the towels.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke, listening at the door, heard her come back. She
knocked at the door of 218; Lee heard a wary voice ask: "Who is
it?" and Natalia's reply: "The chambermaid, Senhor." Her voice
was steady. A man crossed the room and unlocked the door. He
said: "We don't need any more towels." Natalia answered: "Well,
since I've brought them, let me leave them here." She crossed the
room and came back. As she passed the communicating door, the
bolt was sharply drawn back. Lee flung the door open just as
Natalia's skirts whisked through the other door and it slammed
shut.</p>

<p>The four men walked into the adjoining room, Lee first because
he was the only one with a gun. "Put your hands up!" he said in
his mild way. By the windows the Bear and Casanova presented a
comic exhibition of astonishment. Their hands went slowly up.
Interrupted in the midst of their packing, they were in their
shirtsleeves. Suitcases and jackets lay on the beds. Luke
meanwhile had slipped aside to the corridor door, locked it, and
dropped the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>While Lee kept the two men covered, Luke came up to frisk
them. Pedro and Carlos were pressing up close at either side.</p>

<p>"These boys have knives in case my gun should fail to get you
both," Lee said, smiling.</p>

<p>Luke took a gun from each man.</p>

<p>"Now we're better armed," said Lee. "Hand me one and keep the
other. The boys will do better with their own weapons...I will
keep these two covered with both hands, while you search them
more carefully."</p>

<p>Luke went back to Casanova. The coarsely-handsome, pomaded
dandy's eyes glittered poisonously, but Lee stood beside Luke
with his two guns, and close by were the two husky fishermen with
their hands hovering inside the lapels of their jackets.
Casanova's raised arms trembled with rage&mdash;but he kept them
up.</p>

<p>"The tables are turned, eh?" said Lee.</p>

<p>From his various pockets, Luke drew coins, a penknife,
cigarettes, a wallet containing paper money and several
misspelled letters from infatuated women; a German passport in the
name of Antonio Rosado.</p>

<p>"No good," said Lee. "Put it all back except the
passport."</p>

<p>Finally, buttoned in one of Casanova's back pockets, Luke
found a brass key and an oddly-fashioned pair of tweezers made
out of thin metal.</p>

<p>"This looks more promising," said Lee. "Try the key in the
door of our room."</p>

<p>Luke reported that it locked and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>"Then this is what we are looking for," said Lee. "The other
instrument, obviously, was used to turn the key in the door."
Both objects were shown to Pedro and Carlos Chavez. "Examine them
well," said Lee. "You will have to identify them later, and
testify as to where they were found."</p>

<p>Lee then placed key and tweezers in an envelope, sealed it,
and wrote across the flap the circumstances under which they had
been found.</p>

<p>As Luke proceeded to search the Bear, the hairy man's little
eyes burned and he hissed through his teeth with rage. Luke went
through his pockets with an unconcerned air. This man's German
passport was in the name of Luiz Rosado. Nothing else of interest
to them was found on him.</p>

<p>"Who's got a pair of scissors?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Luke produced scissors from one of the suitcases. "Cut a
little patch from his beard," said Lee.</p>

<p>With an oath, the Bear lunged forward, but Lee raised the gun
and he fell back, cursing helplessly. Luke snipped a little patch
from his beard. Lee enclosed the hairs in another envelope and
endorsed it.</p>

<p>"I have an idea this will prove to be <i>very</i> valuable
evidence," he said.</p>

<p>Lee, with a gun in each hand, sat down facing the captives.
"Search their bags," he said to Luke.</p>

<p>This operation took a little time. Nothing incriminating was
found.</p>

<p>"Now tie them into two chairs," Lee said to the fishermen. He
handed one of the guns to Luke. "If either starts to resist,
crack him over the head with the butt."</p>

<p>Pedro and Carlos made a seaman-like job of tying up the
Rosados. With grunts of satisfaction, they pulled the ropes tight
and knotted them. Pedro suggested wetting the ropes to make them
contract, but Lee drew the line at that. As they were finishing
the job, the telephone rang in Lee's sitting-room and he went to
answer it.</p>

<p>He presently returned, smiling and twinkling. "It's the police
Inspector," he said to Luke. "Wants to question us about this
afternoon. I told them to bring him up. You had better go and
have your wound dressed. There's a doctor in the hotel. Then come
back." To the two captives, he went on: "If you holler for help,
I'll have to turn you over to the police. So take your
choice!"</p>

<p>Lee went into his own sitting-room, closing and bolting the
communicating door behind him. Inspector da Gama was shown in,
followed by his secretary-interpreter and another officer. The
Inspector's face bore rather a hangdog expression.</p>

<p>"Why did you not wait for my return?" he asked
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I had an important engagement at the hotel," said Lee
blandly.</p>

<p>"Please do me the favour of describing all the circumstances
that led up to the dastardly attack on you and your secretary
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Lee. "Let us sit down, Inspector."</p>

<p>The Secretary produced notebook and pencil.</p>

<p>Lee faithfully described his meeting with the woman who called
herself Mrs. Mahler, and how he had placed her in Teresa's house.
He went on to tell how he and Luke had returned there after lunch
that day, and how they had been set upon.</p>

<p>"But why?" put in the Inspector.</p>

<p>"They were trying to get information about my private
business," answered Lee. "They questioned us, and upon our
refusal to answer certain questions, they proceeded to torture my
secretary."</p>

<p>"Torture?"</p>

<p>"To brand him with hot irons."</p>

<p>"Horrible!...Had you ever seen these men before?"</p>

<p>This was a safe question. "There were six of them," said Lee.
"Four were unknown to me. The other two I had seen on several
occasions as they followed me through the streets."</p>

<p>"Describe all six of these men as precisely as you can."</p>

<p>Lee did so truthfully, leaving the Inspector to draw his own
conclusions.</p>

<p>Lee answered all questions, but volunteered no information.
Since he was not anxious to reveal the whole truth, and the
Inspector not a bit more desirous of bringing it out, they
understood each other pretty well. The <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> in
the <i>Rua Azorrague</i> was not mentioned, nor Albrecht Stengel
named. In the course of the examination Luke returned to the
room.</p>

<p>"Here is my secretary," said Lee. "He will be glad to answer
your questions."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," said the Inspector, "since I assume you
have told me all."</p>

<p>He finally rose to go. Since he still looked a little ashamed
of the part he was playing, Lee said encouragingly:</p>

<p>"It's a difficult situation, Inspector. I feel for you."</p>

<p>Da Gama thanked him gratefully. "If you could present me with
a case against these scoundrels I could act," he said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day the whole truth will come out," said
Lee.</p>

<p>"In the meantime I will do all I can, Senhor."</p>

<p>When the police left, Lee and Luke returned to the adjoining
room. The prisoners still sat bound to their chairs, glaring at
their captors in impotent rage. Pedro had found a deck of cards
in one of the suitcases, and he and his son, seated on the bed,
were playing a game that involved a lot of counting.</p>

<p>"Sociable little scene," said Lee.</p>

<p>Casanova began to curse him thickly in mixed German and
Portuguese.</p>

<p>"I'm a merciful man," said Lee mildly. "But if you don't keep
quiet, I'll have to order you to be gagged."</p>

<p>Casanova dried up.</p>

<p>Carlos was given money and dispatched to purchase supplies for
a voyage, and to see them carried aboard the <i>Enguia</i>. He
was then to fetch his mother from the <i>Alfama</i> and put her
on the fishing-smack. When all this was done he was to report to
the hotel by telephone.</p>

<p>Lee consulted again with the buxom Natalia. "Natalia," he
said, "is the man who watches at the service door to-night a
friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"He could be, Senhor," she said, smiling and bridling.</p>

<p>"Can you remain in the hotel later than usual to-night, say
until half-past nine?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Can I depend on you to tempt the man away from his post for a
few minutes at that hour, while our guests are escorted to a
taxi?"</p>

<p>Natalia's smile broadened. "Si, Senhor. It will not be
difficult."</p>

<p>"How much money will you need?"</p>

<p>With an inimitable shrug, Natalia said: "Nothing for
<i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"Very well, then keep it yourself," said Lee, slipping her a
bill.</p>

<p>Luke was sent out to buy two of the voluminous black capes
worn by the students of Lisbon, and a pair of the broad-brimmed
black hats that go with them. Sizes were obtained from the hats
worn by the captives. These two looked on and listened with
apprehensive scowls.</p>

<p>Luke was further instructed to return to the hotel by way of
the <i>Roçio</i>. If he found Bosco selling papers at his usual
post, he was to tell Bosco to make his way to the hotel by a
circuitous route and to ask for Mr. Mappin at the service
entrance in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Lee sat down on the bed with Pedro. "Teach me your game," he
said.

<p><br>
LUKE returned in due course with the capes and hats. When
tried on the scowling captives, the hats fitted well enough.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" growled the Bear.</p>

<p>"We're going to give you a little air later," said Lee. "We
want to keep you in good condition."</p>

<p>Luke said that he had found Bosco and that the boy might be
expected to follow in a few minutes. Natalia was instructed to
watch for Bosco at the service entrance and bring him to Mr.
Mappin's suite.</p>

<p>He came with his papers under his arm. A slim, straight youth,
seventeen years old and handsome in the dark, Latin fashion, his
knowing glance and derisive smile reminded Lee of New York boys
he had known. At the moment, Bosco was abashed by the faded
magnificence of the <i>Lisboa Palace</i>.</p>

<p>"Let me have a good look at you," said Lee. "This is our first
chance to get really acquainted."</p>

<p>Bosco merely grinned.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to report to-day?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Bosco. "The Bulldog went out at two o'clock.
I didn't try to follow him. I don't know if he has come back. I
can find out after six o'clock when I meet my friends."</p>

<p>"You said you knew a taxi-driver that we could depend on."</p>

<p>"Yes, gentleman."</p>

<p>"Can you lay your hands on him now?"</p>

<p>Bosco nodded eagerly. "If he has a fare I will have to wait a
little."</p>

<p>"That's all right. We won't need him until later. Give him a
hundred escudo note and arrange for him to wait all evening near
a telephone. Write down the number and bring it to me. On your
way back, stop at the <i>leiteria</i> and see if your friends
have anything to report, but don't stop to eat there. You can eat
here on your return."</p>

<p>Bosco left by the same way he had come, and Lee sat down to
resume his game with Pedro.</p>

<p>At six o'clock Carlos called up to report that the
<i>Enguia</i> was fully stocked and ready to sail and that he had
taken his mother aboard. They were not followed through the
streets, he said.</p>

<p>Carlos was instructed to cast off after dark and drop down the
river to an agreed spot below Belem, where he was to anchor and
wait for his father and their passengers. He was to expect them
about ten. When he got a signal of five quick flashes from the
beach he was to come in for them with a boat and a couple of
men.</p>

<p>Lee then ordered a generous dinner served in his suite,
including plenty of wine. He ordered covers for four persons
only, but took care to include sufficient food for six.</p>

<p>Bosco arrived back about the same time that the dinner came
up. He had made a deal with his taxi-driver friend, and the man
had agreed to spend the evening in the garage near the quays
where he kept his taxi. Bosco had the telephone number of the
garage. They were to ask for José. From the <i>Hotel
Excelsior</i> there was nothing to report. The Bulldog had not
returned.</p>

<p>"He suspects that hotel <i>may</i> be visited by the police,"
said Lee.</p>

<p>When the waiters had departed, Luke and Pedro carried the
dinner table into room 218 so they could keep an eye on their
captives while they ate. It was an oddly-constituted dinner party
and Lee, the connoisseur of humanity, was as much pleased with
his guests as the food. There was firstly his neat little self in
a white waistcoat, then big Luke with his bruised face and a
livid black eye; the weatherbeaten Pedro in his Sunday blacks,
and lastly newsboy Bosco. Bosco's eyes glistened at the sight of
the fancy food. But he had never been taught table manners and he
was embarrassed how to begin. Lee said to Luke:</p>

<p>"Tell him to pitch in and the hell with table manners! To-night
we're all men together!"</p>

<p>When the sense of this was conveyed to Bosco in Portuguese, he
grinned widely and fell to.</p>

<p>The two captives over by the window looked on at the feast
with bitter eyes. Finally Casanova could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"When do we eat?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The hell with you," Luke said coolly.</p>

<p>Lee glanced at Luke warningly. "They will be easier to handle
if they're fed," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>"All right," said Luke to the captives, "you will get yours
after we finish."</p>

<p>When the edge of appetite was dulled, Lee, to draw out his
youngest guest, asked: "What are you going to do after the war,
Bosco?"</p>

<p>Luke repeated it in Portuguese.</p>

<p>Food and wine had charmed away Bosco's self-consciousness. He
said politely: "Do me the favour to spik Angleez, gentleman. I
spik Angleez all right. I wish to spik more. After the war I
leave Portugal. It is good country but the people are poor. I
save my money now. I learn the Angleez more good. I go to America
and make moch money. When I have moch money I come back. I live
as a gentleman." Bosco looked around the room. "Maybe I live
here."</p>

<p>"But everybody in America is not rich," objected Lee.</p>

<p>"All right," said Bosco confidently. "I work hard. The
gentleman say I smart fellow. I make good...Maybe the gentleman
will take me to America to be his servant?" he added with an
insinuating smile.</p>

<p>"Servants don't make much money," said Lee.</p>

<p>"All right," said Bosco, "the gentleman will tell me what to
do."</p>

<p>"I'm no money-maker," said Lee.</p>

<p>Bosco regarded this as an excellent joke.</p>

<p>"What's Carlos going to do after the war?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Luke translated the discussion into Portuguese.</p>

<p>"The boy is right," said Pedro in his slow fashion. "Here the
people are too poor. I catch fish. So we do not starve. We can
buy but little; everything is too dear. Me, I am too old to go to
a new country. Maybe the gentleman will take Carlos to
America."</p>

<p>"Carlos is a good boy," said Bosco jealously, "but what could
a fisherman do in New York?"</p>

<p>"As much as a boy of the streets," retorted Pedro warmly.</p>

<p>To settle this, Lee said: "I will do what I can for both boys
after the war."</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, the table was carried close to
the captives and Bosco on one side fed the Bear while Pedro did
the like for Casanova on the other. It was a remarkable sight to
see the two scowling brigands opening their mouths as obediently
as baby birds in the nest. Pedro took it as all in the day's
work, but Bosco's eyes were dancing. He was warned not to exploit
the comic possibilities.</p>

<p>Lee suggested that Luke throw the rest of the men's belongings
into their suitcases and close them.</p>

<p>"If we take their baggage along," said Lee, "the hotel
management will suppose they have jumped their bill and no alarm
will be raised."</p>

<p>Lee, meanwhile, sat down to write the letter that Pedro was to
hand John Westerholm on the island of Fayal. Along with his
letter, he sealed up a pocket-knife in the envelope.</p>

<p>"Keep this on your person at all times," he instructed Pedro,
"and if anybody interferes with you, toss it overboard and let it
sink."</p>

<p>Bosco called up his friend, the taxi-driver, at the wineshop
and told him he was now engaged permanently by Mr. Mappin and
should remain on call at the garage at all times. For to-night he
was instructed to drive up to the service door in the courtyard
of the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> precisely at nine-thirty.</p>

<p>When the time approached, they arrayed their prisoners for the
journey. One at a time their bonds were freed and they were
required to stand. Their arms were then bound securely behind
them. When the capes were adjusted with one end thrown
picturesquely over a shoulder in Portuguese fashion, all sign of
the rope was hidden. A broad-brimmed black hat cocked at a jaunty
angle completed the picture. All being ready, Lee made them a
brief speech:</p>

<p>"No harm will come to you now or later if you obey orders and
keep quiet. You will be well fed and comfortably lodged. It is
not your lives we want, but only your testimony against those who
hired you. If you do not obey orders, you will be shot instantly.
We are not going to take any chances."</p>

<p>At nine twenty-eight the procession set out from Lee's suite.
The communicating door with 218 was bolted on both sides. Lee and
Bosco walked ahead; then the two prisoners, draped in their
capes, finally Luke and Pedro, each holding a gun concealed
inside his jacket. Through the long, softly-carpeted corridor
they went, making a couple of turns, and then down the service
stairs. It was the same route over which William Miller had been
carried. They met nobody except a startled waiter on the landing,
who stared at the unusual sight and scurried on up. One flight,
then another; there was no hitch; the service door was unguarded,
and as they reached it, the taxicab drove up in the court.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken. The Bear and Casanova were placed on
the rear seat; Luke and Pedro each with gun in hand faced them;
Bosco climbed in beside the driver and the cab drove away. Lee
returned up the back stairs to his rooms.</p>

<p>Luke was back inside an hour. "All serene," he said. "I waited
until I saw them taken aboard the <i>Enguia</i> and she started
down the river."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "That accounts for numbers three and
four."</p>

<p>"What next, Chief?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>"Do you want to lie up until your wound is healed?"</p>

<p>"No, damn it! I want to pay them back for it!"</p>

<p>Lee paced the room. "That letter that Stengel read to me this
afternoon told me that the celebrated Walther Niebuhr was on the
way. He is bringing his mother and father. Niebuhr is one of the
leaders of the Underground movement in Germany. There's a big
price on his head."</p>

<p>"How did Stengel get that letter?"</p>

<p>"Intercepted at the post office in Nîmes, I take it. The
Germans control there. We must make new arrangements. Luckily,
they don't know who wrote it...Niebuhr has no papers,
consequently his way is full of dangers. The letter was probably
written some days ago. They may turn up at any time&mdash;they
may never arrive. Our job is to help them through."</p>

<p>"Okay, Chief."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p class="first">LEE'S first necessity next morning was to
procure his letters and telegrams from the post office. With Luke
he set off early in a taxicab, and they soon found themselves, as
usual, followed by another cab. Looking through the back window,
Lee glimpsed two hard-faced men in the following car in addition
to the driver. These were new faces. One man was leaning forward
continually urging the driver.</p>

<p>To-day their trackers, favoured by luck or skill, were not to
be shaken off. The Lisbon taxi-drivers, sure of a handsome tip,
always enjoyed these chases and displayed great skill in
navigating the narrow streets. Lee's driver drove east to the
edge of the <i>Alfama</i> and back to the west with innumerable
tricky turns. It was no use; the following cab clung close
behind, and Lee became a little discouraged.</p>

<p>During a brief traffic block in the <i>Rua Garrett</i>, an
<i>electrico</i> stopped beside them. The view from behind was
blocked for the moment by another taxi. Lee looked at Luke and
Luke slipped out of the door of the cab and stepped on board the
trolley car. When traffic moved again, the car turned one way and
Lee's taxi another, and Lee had the satisfaction of seeing the
following cab take after him. He led it blithely down one street
and up another, finally giving his driver the word to return to
the hotel. The other cab was still close at his heels. As he got
out, it was pleasant to picture the chagrin of the two men upon
discovering that half their quarry had escaped them.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Luke turned up safely with the letters. No
telegrams to-day. The most important communication was a letter
postmarked Badajoz, Spain, a city on the border of Portugal. Lee
turned it over in his hands before opening it. It had been opened
by the Portuguese censor at the border and sealed again.</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Lee, "that this was opened in Spain and
put back in the mail. The censor's seal would hide the marks.
There are plenty of Germans in Badajoz."</p>

<p>"Read it! Read it!" urged Luke.</p>

<p>The substance of the letter as Lee decoded it was as follows:
"I have reached Badajoz after many hardships and dangers. A man
here has agreed to put us over the border and to keep us at his
house in Portugal for a few days. He is a Republican. Please let
me know if it is safe to venture openly into Lisbon. I know where
you are stopping, but it would be imprudent for me to show myself
there. Please appoint a place of meeting. Address me Juan
Barreto, Villa Boim, Alemtejo. That is my host."</p>

<p>"It's not signed," said Lee, "but of course it's from Walther
Niebuhr." He began pacing. "This is a dangerous letter," he
continued gravely. "He couldn't put the address of his
hiding-place into code, and there it is for anybody to read."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>"Motor to this address at once."</p>

<p>"All right. Let's go."</p>

<p>"I want you to stay in Lisbon to find a refuge for these
people when they get here."</p>

<p>Luke instantly blew up. "No, sir!" he said. "I'm not going to
let you go on such a journey alone!"</p>

<p>Lee looked at him, smiled, and gave in. "All right,
Fire-eater!"</p>

<p>"Even the two of us is not enough if we're going to run into
trouble," said Luke.</p>

<p>"Especially as I'm so little," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You can pull your weight, all right, and then some."</p>

<p>"If we bring them into Lisbon, where can we hide them?" said
Lee.</p>

<p>"The Senhora at the <i>Macaco Branco</i> has rooms to rent
upstairs."</p>

<p>"Telephone and see what she can do for us. Three people; two
rooms; it may be very late before we get back."</p>

<p>The report was satisfactory. Luke said: "The rooms will be
ready any time we may turn up."</p>

<p>Lee had spread out his road map on the table. "Here's <i>Villa
Boim</i>," he said. "It's a hamlet between Elvas and Borba. Four
or five hours' journey, allowing for bad roads. The shortest
route is from Barreira across the river, but the ferry takes half
an hour and what we'd gain in distance, we'd lose in time.
Besides, more time lost waiting for the ferry. We'll head north
and cross the Tagus at Villa Franca de Xira. Call up José at the
garage."</p>

<p>"A Lisbon taxi would be pretty conspicuous so far from town,"
suggested Luke.</p>

<p>"Surely. Ask José if he can hire a car without any markings.
Tell him he must bring extra petrol in cans, sufficient for a
three hundred mile journey and a little to spare. He'll have to
buy it in the black market and it will cost like hell, but
there's no help for it. Can't depend on getting petrol out in the
country. It must be an able car, and the faster the better. If he
says okay, ask him how soon he can be waiting for us at the
statue of Pombal at the top of the Avenida."</p>

<p>Luke at the phone conveyed all this to José. Turning to Lee,
Luke said: "José says yes, he can get the gas and there is a
Hispano-Suiza in the garage in perfect order that we can hire for
five escudos the mile."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Lee. "And how much for the gas?"</p>

<p>"Six escudos the litre."</p>

<p>"Robbery! But we've got no choice. Tell him all right."</p>

<p>"He'll be at Pombal's statue in half an hour and wait until we
come."</p>

<p>Lee pressed the bell that summoned Natalia. When she presented
her blooming self, he said:</p>

<p>"Natalia, you're a sight to cure sore eyes!"</p>

<p>When this was conveyed to her in Portuguese, she bridled and
smiled, and smoothed imaginary wrinkles out of her apron.</p>

<p>"The young fellow and I have to go on an expedition into the
country to-day which may prove dangerous," Lee went on. "It might
even end in shooting. He's wounded and I'm too little to be much
good. We ought to have help. Can you recommend a <i>man</i>,
Natalia?"</p>

<p>"There is my husband," she said. "He is not afraid of the
devil himself. But he has no gun."</p>

<p>"That's easy. We have a spare. Can we get hold of him quickly,
Natalia?"</p>

<p>"I can telephone him at his work. He could leave his work
if..." She concluded with an expressive shrug.</p>

<p>Lee got it. "I'll take care of that," he said.</p>

<p>Natalia went to the telephone. After a spirited exchange with
her man, she turned around to say it was all right; he would go
with the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Tell him to meet us at the statue of Pombal in half an hour,"
said Lee. "He may have to wait a little. Tell him to hold his hat
in his hand so we'll know him."</p>

<p>The name of this admirable man was Affonso Fardo.</p>

<p>Lee stuffed his wallet with banknotes and handed Luke another
roll. They secreted other money about their persons.</p>

<p>"On an expedition like this we must go well-heeled," said
Lee.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock when they set out. Since Lee did not want
to waste a lot more time driving around town, they walked to the
station and tried the trick of the two stairways again. This time
it didn't work; their trackers had been warned, perhaps; but by
good fortune there were only two taxis at the foot of the second
stairway. Lee took one, Luke the other, and the two spies were
left biting their fingers on the curb. Later, Luke and Lee joined
forces and dismissed the second cab.</p>

<p>After making a long detour around to the west, they were back
at the statue of Pombal within the half hour. José was waiting
for them in a sleek Hispano-Suiza limousine, and a moment later
they picked up a man carrying his hat in his hand, who introduced
himself as Affonso Fardo.</p>

<p>Affonso was a proper man to have at one's side in case of a
fracas. He was old enough to have good judgment, but he had not
run to fat like most of the Lisbonese men. His chest swelled
reassuringly under his jacket, his belt was pulled into the last
hole; he had the expression of a man who was well aware of his
own worth.</p>

<p>"I, Affonso Fardo, will serve you," he said to Lee as if that
settled all difficulties.</p>

<p>José, on the other hand, was as meagre as a jockey. With his
cap pulled rakishly over one eye, he looked like a street-boy who
had started to shrivel before he grew up. Not likely to be of
much service in a mix-up, he was a heaven-sent chauffeur, was a
part of the car; he appeared not so much to drive it as to will
it to do what he wanted.</p>

<p>They drove north out of Lisbon and turned east at Villa Franca
to cross the Tagus. The Hispano-Suiza ran as smoothly as a watch.
José was charmed with its performance. On a straight and
moderately smooth stretch of road, he got her up to 120
kilometers for a short space. "She flies like a swallow," he
said, patting the dashboard. The car belonged to General
Aljubarotta, he further informed them in tones of respect, but
his honour was gracious enough to hire it out occasionally to a
good driver.</p>

<p>"Extremely gracious of his honour," said Lee, "at the
price."</p>

<p>At Montemor Nova, an ancient place with a ruined castle beside
a romantic stream, they paused to order a generous <i>almoço</i>.
In order to save time they carried the food and wine with them to
consume in the car.</p>

<p>The next considerable town was Arraiollos, another hoary and
mouldering place out of a picture book, with medieval walls and
towers. As they crossed the little central <i>praça</i>, Lee
suddenly clapped a hand on Luke's shoulder and pressed him to the
floor.</p>

<p>"Down! Down!" he said, dropping to his own knees and bowing
his head.</p>

<p>"What the hell!" gasped the astonished Luke.</p>

<p>"The Bulldog," said Lee grimly. "Standing at the door of the
hotel picking his crooked teeth. His car is heading the same way
we are."</p>

<p>Luke fervently cursed the Bulldog. "How many men did he have
with him?"</p>

<p>Lee resumed his seat. "I couldn't see," he said. "They hadn't
come out yet...At any rate, we're in advance of them now. And
they don't know it!" He urged José for more speed. "It's all a
question of driving. If you're just a little better than their
chauffeur, José, they'll never catch us."</p>

<p>José patted the dashboard. "Best job in Portugal!" he said,
grinning. Though the man's frame was small, his spirit was
strong.</p>

<p>"It is good that I am with you," said Affonso.</p>

<p>All the ranges of hills and mountains in this part of the
world run north and south, so that their progress was a series of
long climbs followed by descents on the other side. On such a
road, they could make no great speed, but neither could the car
they supposed to be following them. At the top of the first
height. Lee, looking back, glimpsed a tiny object crawling across
the valley below.</p>

<p>"We have about ten minutes' start," he said.</p>

<p>These heights were covered with fine forests of the cork oak,
and they could seldom see far behind them or ahead. They had no
further sight of the following car, and could only hope they were
gaining on it. As they proceeded eastward, the terrain became
even more rugged and tumbled. The road was modern and well kept
up. There were no road signs, but as the map indicated it was the
only modern road in the vicinity there was no danger of going
astray.</p>

<p>With its wild heights and fertile valleys, it was a beautiful
country, unchanged in many generations. Even the farm buildings
and the villages had been there so long they had become a natural
part of the scene. But the passengers in the flying Hispano-Suiza
had little attention for natural beauties. The three on the back
seat rode with their heads over their shoulders. Every time they
screamed around a curve of the descent, Lee's heart rose in his
throat. A burst tire in this solitude! José seemed to read his
mind.</p>

<p>"All the tires are new," he said comfortably.</p>

<p>They had to slow up for other towns: Vimiera, Estremoz, Borba,
all ancient, all with maddeningly narrow, crooked streets that
had not been laid out for an elongated Hispano-Suiza. Finally,
about two-thirty, they rolled into Villa Boim, which consisted of
a big church, a small hotel, and a huddle of old houses around a
little cobbled praça. They were heading north at this point, and
on their right swept up a higher range of mountains than any they
had seen. On the other side of this range, according to the map,
lay Spain.</p>

<p>A romantic loafer lounged in front of the hotel. José stopped
the car and asked him if he knew where Senhor Juan Barreto
lived.</p>

<p>He did. Moving on past the hotel building, he pointed up a
lane, seemingly to the sky. There it was, he said. A long, low,
white building clung to the mountainside high above the town. It
was about a mile distant as the crow flies, but undoubtedly
longer by road. To reach it, the native said, they must follow
that very lane to its end. Could a motor-car make it? Oh yes, the
road was rough and crooked, but cars often went up and down.
Senhor Barreto himself had a car.</p>

<p>"Ask him," said Lee, "if he is acquainted with the Senhor and
what manner of man is he."</p>

<p>This question produced the usual flood of Portuguese. When
José sorted it out, Lee learned that Senhor Barreto was a Spanish
Republican. He had come to Portugal after the civil war and
bought land. He was a brave man. On more than one occasion, a
party of Falangists had sneaked over the mountain with the
intention of seizing him and carrying him back to Spain for
trial. But his house was like a fort, and there he was still.</p>

<p>They turned down the lane, crossed a brook and started to
climb the other side. The narrow lane was stony and very rough,
but offered no special obstacle to their progress. Small neatly-kept,
terraced fields spread away on either side. The higher they
climbed, the farther Lee could see down the valley where the
highway ran. No car was visible upon it.</p>

<p>Above the cultivated ground the stony track was swallowed in a
cork forest. It climbed the steep slope sideways, back and forth,
with a turn at each end so sharp that the Hispano-Suiza had to
back and fill in order to get around it. Now they could see
nothing below because of the trees.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to be chased down this hill," Lee remarked
dryly.</p>

<p>Without warning they issued out on a grassy terrace lying in
front of the house they were seeking. Behind the house the
mountainside swept on up to the sky. There was no sign of human
life visible. The house was built on a series of big arches which
formed its foundation. Each archway was closed with a pair of
heavy, wooden doors. These arches, they guessed, served the
farmhouse as barn, stable, cattle byres, granary, etc.</p>

<p>The living-rooms were above with a long, narrow gallery
running across the front ending in a curved stairway at each end,
the whole making a pleasing, antique composition. All the doors
and windows opening on the balcony were tightly closed, and
shuttered, except a door in the middle which stood open,
revealing a black interior. Through the open door issued a grim,
masculine voice asking:</p>

<p>"Who are you and what do you want?"</p>

<p>Lee had learned that the best way to answer such a challenge
is instantly to show yourself. He stepped out of the car and
pulled a little American flag from his pocket. Luke, close behind
him, spoke up to the open door:</p>

<p>"This is Senhor Mappin of New York. He wants to speak to your
guests."</p>

<p>The response to voice&mdash;or flag&mdash;was instantaneous. A
hard-bitten man of forty or so, with a rifle across his arm,
stepped out on the balcony. Others pressed behind him; a half-grown
boy; a blond young man, an old couple, children of assorted
ages. They hastened along the balcony and down the stairs. The
place came suddenly alive.</p>

<p>Lee remembered that his host was a Spaniard and restrained his
enthusiasm. Measured, courteous greetings were exchanged on the
terrace. Barreto, a tall, spare man, was a fine example of the
antique Spanish virtues, grave, reticent and hard. But it was the
young blond fellow's hand that Lee clung to a little longer.</p>

<p>"So you are Walther Niebuhr," he said in German. "I salute a
brave man!"</p>

<p>Niebuhr was an extraordinarily attractive young man, built
like a hero of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, with wide-set, candid
blue eyes and fresh, smiling lips. There was more in him, though,
than youthful good-humour; there was power and endurance behind
his smiling eyes. He coloured with pleasure as he said:</p>

<p>"What I have done is nothing. I am German, I have no choice;
but you have come half-way across the world to help us, out of
pure goodwill to mankind."</p>

<p>"We are working for the same end," said Lee.</p>

<p>"That is so; freedom for all peoples...So you got my letter. I
dared not hope you would answer it in person."</p>

<p>"I got it," said Lee, "but I am afraid others may have got it
for whose eyes it was not intended." He turned to Barreto. "We
are followed, Senhor. The party is led by Albrecht Stengel. I do
not know how close they may be. If we leave instantly, perhaps we
could reach the foot of the mountain and turn east before they
arrive."</p>

<p>Young Niebuhr smiled and shook his head slightly. Lee did not
get the significance of it until later.</p>

<p>Barreto also vetoed the plan. They all looked out over the
valley. Half a world seemed to be spread at their feet. The
highway from the west was visible for a distance of several
miles. No motor car moved on it.</p>

<p>"The risk is too great," said Barreto. "From the point where
we can first see them they can reach the village in five minutes
by car, whereas it would take you twenty minutes from here in
that big car. It is too long for mountain work. You must wait for
them here. You will be safe."</p>

<p>"Can you stand a siege?" asked Lee with a smile.</p>

<p>"It would not be the first time," answered Barreto gravely.
"There is ample food and water&mdash;and ammunition."</p>

<p>Lee glanced at the house. It appeared well-fitted to stand a
siege; doors and shutters were of iron, an unusual feature; the
roof was of red tiles. The only vulnerable spots were the wooden
doors in the archways below. Barreto, following Lee's eyes, said
quietly:</p>

<p>"They will never reach the doors. I have holes in the floor of
the balcony to shoot through."</p>

<p>"Very well, we will take our chance with you," said Lee.</p>

<p>"My son Jaime will watch the road from the balcony," said
Barreto.</p>

<p>Lee hung the strap of the binoculars around the boy's neck. "I
suppose you know how to use them," he said.</p>

<p>The boy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"Jaime is an old campaigner," his father said, not without
pride.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p class="first">IN Juan Barreto's house. Lee was introduced to
the elder Niebuhrs. Like so many old couples, they resembled each
other strongly; their faces were worn with care to an almost
transparent fineness, but steady still. They were very quiet,
scarcely ever spoke; their old eyes followed their handsome son
in all his movements with an inexpressible wistfulness.</p>

<p>The visitors were invited into the house to take wine, José
and Affonso being included since there were no distinctions of
rank in this household. In the house Lee met the Senhora Barreto,
another quiet woman who had borne much. The principal room
revealed an aristocratic bareness; a few pieces of ancient,
hand-carved oaken furniture, a holy picture, nothing more. Lee's
glance around approved the absence of cheap machine-made stuff
and dusty upholstery. Owing to the rising ground, the back
windows of this room were only a foot or two above the grass.</p>

<p>When the wine was poured and toasts drunk, young Niebuhr and
the grave Barreto exchanged a glance of understanding, and the
former said quietly:</p>

<p>"I shall not be going on with you from here, Mr. Mappin."</p>

<p>"Hey?" said the startled Lee.</p>

<p>"I will put the old folks in your care," Niebuhr went on.
"They will be safer if I am not with you, because I am the one
they are after."</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"I shall return to Germany."</p>

<p>"All the way across Spain and across France! You'll never make
it!"</p>

<p>"I think I will," said the young man confidently. "It will be
easier when I am on my own. One finds friends everywhere."</p>

<p>"I had hoped you would go to America or to England with them,"
said Lee regretfully. "You have done your share."</p>

<p>The smiling young man shook his head. "What would I do in
America? America is for Americans. I am German. I am useful back
there. They are waiting for me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry...!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"As long as the old folks were in Germany," said Niebuhr, "the
Gestapo could get at me through them. They were continually
hounded, and that was hell for me. They were too old to make such
a journey alone, and so I have brought them thus far. I leave
them with friends, and I go back with an easy mind."</p>

<p>Lee glanced at the old couple. The mother's head was lowered
and the tears were falling silently in her lap; the old man was
looking stonily ahead. This decision was no surprise to them.</p>

<p>Niebuhr went on softly: "I could not seek safety for myself,
Mr. Mappin, and leave my friends in danger back there."</p>

<p>"It is for you to say," Lee said slowly. "I would not try to
influence you...If you have made the decision, you should start
at once before your enemies get here."</p>

<p>Niebuhr shook his head again. "Barreto and I have decided
that," he said firmly. "If I wait until they come, I can draw
them away up the mountainside while you escape below. They will
never catch me on the mountain."</p>

<p>"Jaime will guide him over the mountain," added Barreto. "The
boy knows every path."</p>

<p>Lee accepted the decision with a nod. One could as well have
argued with a pair of flint stones. "At any rate," said Lee, "you
must let me give you money for the return journey. It is
subscribed by American sympathisers."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to have it," the young man said, with his
delightful open smile. "One can never have too much money for
bribes."</p>

<p>Lee handed him a roll of notes. As Niebuhr started to count
it, Lee put a hand over his. "Put it in your pocket. It's not a
loan, it's a subscription to the cause."</p>

<p>Lee drew the young German aside. "Herr Niebuhr," he said,
"have you and your fellow-workers ever succeeded in planting a
man in the Foreign Office?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the smiling answer. "We have an observer
there."</p>

<p>"If it is possible for you to procure for me copies of the
Prince zu L's confidential reports to the Foreign Minister, of
his doings in Lisbon, it would help me very much in my work here.
I would particularly like to see an account of his disbursements,
if he makes such reports. It might even hasten the end of the
war."</p>

<p>"I will do the best I can, Herr Mappin."</p>

<p>Jaime came to the open door to announce, without excitement,
that there was a car on the highway, coming from the east. This
tall boy, already toughened by danger, was going to be like his
father.</p>

<p>The men went out on the balcony. The car could be seen, like
an insect on the distant highway. Even through the binoculars it
was impossible to distinguish any details. After watching it for
a moment, one could see that it was moving fast.</p>

<p>"We will assume that it is our enemies," said Barreto, "and
prepare."</p>

<p>"Should we hide our car in the woods?" suggested Lee.</p>

<p>The Spaniard shook his head. "It will be better in the stable.
You can get away quicker."</p>

<p>There was an interior stairway to the lower level. The doors
that filled the first archway were unbarred and thrown open, a
space cleared inside, the Hispano-Suiza backed in, and the doors
closed again, but not locked. The men returned to the room
above.</p>

<p>Jaime reported from the balcony: "The car has arrived in the
village. It is stopped in front of the hotel where I can't see
it."</p>

<p>Juan Barreto looked over his little force appraisingly. There
were four men in Lee's party of various sizes and degrees of
muscularity. In addition to himself, Juan had Walther Niebuhr and
Jaime, who was as good as another man. From a wall cupboard, Juan
produced a formidable armament consisting of four rifles and as
many short guns with spare ammunition. Each man in Lee's party
had a short gun.</p>

<p>Affonso said with hand on hip: "I am a sure shot."</p>

<p>Juan said grimly: "There is to be no shooting unless I order
it."</p>

<p>The four children were placed in a far corner of the room and
told to stay there and keep quiet. Even the children of this
hard-bitten family did not appear to be unduly alarmed at the
prospect of shooting.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed before the car could be seen leaving the
village and crossing the cultivated strip at the foot of the
mountain. Lee said:</p>

<p>"By this time they must know that we have ascended the
mountain before them. It cannot have been good news."</p>

<p>Barreto's house faced west and the afternoon sun was striking
through the door and making a dazzling oblong patch on the cement
floor. To the left of this patch, Juan sat in a chair tipped back
against the side wall, with his hat pulled down over his eyes and
his rifle across his knees. He coolly rolled a cigarette and
lighted it. In this position, while sitting in the shadow, he
commanded an oblique view through the door of the spot where the
ascending car would issue from the trees.</p>

<p>The rest of the party grouped farther back in the room, the
younger members squatting on the floor since there were not
chairs for all. Mrs. Barreto moved about quietly, blowing up the
fire, putting some small sticks on it, and placing the coffee pot
on a tripod. Astonishing family!</p>

<p>It seemed to take an endless time for the coming car to climb
the mountain. Most of the men lit cigarettes. A thin cloud of
smoke floated into the dazzling shaft of sunlight and out through
the door.</p>

<p>While it was still some distance away, they heard the puffing
of the exhaust as the car climbed in low gear. These were the
hardest moments to bear. Lee arose and pressed himself against
the wall in shadow alongside Barreto, where he, too, could look
out.</p>

<p>At last the car rose into view; a grey closed car, with faded
paint and battered fenders. It rolled across the grassy terrace
and came to a stop squarely in front of the open door, and about
seventy-five feet away. The doors opened and men issued from both
sides. The squat figure and repulsive face of Stengel first
appeared, then the storklike Schoenhut, with the man they had
christened Mustaches and the bestial visage of Scarface. From
around the car appeared two uniformed policemen.</p>

<p>"Police?" murmured Lee, surprised.</p>

<p>"That's what they stopped in the village for," growled
Barreto.</p>

<p>The men below looked up at the balcony. Framed in the doorway,
the figures had a slightly unreal look like a scene reproduced on
the screen&mdash;in technicolour.</p>

<p>Barreto spoke the words they had first heard from him: "Who
are you and what do you want?"</p>

<p>Stengel's hoarse voice answered: "We want the German that you
are harbouring. We have a warrant for his arrest."</p>

<p>"You can go back where you came from," said Barreto
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"It's useless for you to deny that he's there," said
Stengel.</p>

<p>"I do not deny it," said Barreto. "The man is my guest. I
shall not give him up."</p>

<p>The Bulldog showed his ugly little teeth; even at the
distance, they could see how his face darkened. "You can't defy
the police, Spaniard! We'll surround you and rush the house. We
mean business."</p>

<p>There was a sharp report in the yard. A bullet flew through
the open door and embedded itself in the ceiling. Bits of plaster
fell to the floor. The women and the little children
flinched.</p>

<p>Barreto noted that the two policemen were sent around the
house to watch the rear windows. "Get ready to leave," he said
quietly over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Walther Niebuhr embraced his parents. The tears ran down the
cheeks of the old woman and the man, but they made no sound of
grief. Jaime softly started to unfasten one of the rear
shutters.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gaunt Spaniard appeared to go berserk. Leaping to
his feet and shouting curses, he discharged his gun through the
door as fast as he could pull the lever. But he was not aiming at
those below. Lee, understanding that he was to take part in this
diversion, shouted, too, and fired his pistol over the heads of
the men on the terrace.</p>

<p>The two policemen came running back around the house to see
what the uproar was about. Barreto spoke over his shoulder. "Now
go, quickly!" Niebuhr and Jaime slipped over the sill and those
in the room closed and fastened the shutter after them. When the
shooting began, Stengel and his men ran behind their car and
returned a few shots which thudded harmlessly against the wall of
the house. Realising presently that it was a trick, they held
their fire.</p>

<p>From the steep slope behind the house came two ringing young
voices, baritone and alto: "Stengel, you butcher! Here we are!
Come and get us if you're men enough!"</p>

<p>The two policemen started back around one end of the house;
Mustaches and Scarface went around the other end. Stengel and
Schoenhut remained hidden behind the grey car. From the rear the
young voices continued to shout: "Here we are! This way! Can't
you see us, bats!" There was actually a ring of laughter in the
sound. Some scattered shots were heard. Barreto said to Lee:</p>

<p>"Take your people and go down and get in the car. Start the
engine. When I fire my gun, drive out. Don't stop to open the
doors; they are not locked; drive into them!"</p>

<p>After a quick handshake, Lee shepherded his people down the
inside stairway and into the car. José started the engine. "Down
in the bottom of the car, all!" commanded Lee. Presently they
heard the crack of Barreto's rifle overhead, José let in the
clutch, and they charged forward. The doors crashed open and the
Hispano-Suiza sped out into the sun. The two Germans started
firing over the engine hood of their car. A bullet splintered
through a side window. Lee opened the door a crack and fired
back&mdash;not at the men but at their tyres. There were two
sharp explosions, and he pulled the door to, smiling.</p>

<p>"<i>Duas rupturas pneu</i>!" howled José in delight.</p>

<p>"I guess that will hold them for a while!" said Luke.</p>

<p>The two Germans started firing at their tyres but it was too
late. The Hispano-Suiza gained the shelter of the trees and
slowed down.</p>

<p>Since there was now no possibility of immediate pursuit, they
proceeded down the mountainside at a safe rate of speed, made
their way through the village, and set off west on the highway.
Only two hours had elapsed since their arrival. It seemed longer.
José, Affonso and Luke were in the highest spirits over their
success, but Lee's heart ached for the quiet, grey-faced couple
who sat on the back seat holding hands and paying no attention to
the passing scene. They had said good-bye to all they held dear
and were setting their faces among strangers.</p>

<p>Lee speculated on the chances of pursuit. "It will take them
at least half an hour to mend their tyres and call in their men.
Perhaps as much as an hour."</p>

<p>"We won't see them again this side Lisbon," said Luke
confidently.</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Lee, "but as long as they have secured the
support of the police, they may try to stop us by telegraphing
ahead. Let us do a little telegraphing ourselves."</p>

<p>From the town of Borba Lee sent this message:

<br>

<p class="telegram">
INSPECTOR DA GAMA,<br>
MINISTRY OF POLICE, LISBOA.</p>

<p class="telegram">PLEASE TO INSTRUCT LOCAL POLICE AT ESTREMOZ,
VIMIERA, ARRAIOLLOS, MONTEMOR NOVO AND VENDAS NOVAS TO AFFORD ME
AND MY PARTY OF FIVE, INCLUDING CHAUFFEUR, SAFE CONDUCT TO
LISBOA, AND DISREGARD REQUESTS TO THE CONTRARY FROM LOCAL
OFFICIALS TO THE EAST.</p>

<p class="telegram">AMOS LEE MAPPIN.</p>

<p><br>
Proceeding, they passed through Estremoz and Vimiera without
hindrance. At the entrance to the walled town of Arraiollos,
half-way, a closed barrier across the road forced them to stop.
Two policemen came out of the guard-house, one of whom held a
telegram. Instantly there was a pandemonium of voices. No
business can be transacted in Portugal without it. It was
impossible to keep José and Affonso from making their
contributions. José kept assuring the policeman in an indignant
voice that this was General Aljubarotta's car. The policemen were
impressed but adamant. Affonso described what would happen to
them for stopping so great a man as Mr. Mappin.</p>

<p>Lee's and Luke's American passports were above suspicion, and
the identification papers of the two Portuguese were in order,
but the German couple had no papers; there was the rub. A crowd
gathered, many of whom added their voices to the discussion. As
Lee could not very well offer the policemen bribes in the sight
of the crowd, he suggested an adjournment to the guard-house,
which was made. This was no better, because now the heads of the
crowd filled the windows, and various persons of consideration
crowded in until the air of the little shed became suffocating.
So they all surged outside again.</p>

<p>The old couple, sad and resigned, remained sitting in the car
holding hands. They did not know what it was all about and,
apparently, did not much care. Everybody had to go and gape at
them through the windows. The police remained polite but firm.
The old people had no papers; therefore they could not pass until
an investigation was made.</p>

<p>Time passed and they were getting nowhere. Lee kept glancing
anxiously to the east. The road over which they had come dipped
down into a valley and climbed a high mountain on the other side.
A greater functionary was brought up; mayor perhaps, or whatever
corresponded to mayor in this town. Lee dispatched Luke to the
post office to see if a message from Inspector da Gama was not
forthcoming.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the Mayor, the whole story had to be told
from the beginning. It was growing dark now, and Lee groaned
inwardly. The Mayor supported the police. He had a happy idea.
The old people, obviously, could not be allowed to proceed, but
if the American gentleman was in a hurry, let him drive on and
he, the Mayor, would take personal charge of his friends. They
should be lodged at the hotel and every comfort provided until
the matter was settled.</p>

<p>This did not help any. At the top of the distant mountain a
pair of headlights twinkled and started to descend.</p>

<p>The discussion continued. Affonso now acted as Lee's
interpreter. He loved the job and made the most of it. The
headlights crept down the mountainside and Lee broke into a
gentle sweat.</p>

<p>In the nick of time Luke came running from the centre of town,
waving a telegram over his head. The Mayor opened it. Lee did not
ask to see it. Judging from the general smiles and bows that
everything was now all right, he hustled his men into the car.
The pursuing car had reached the floor of the valley, not more
than five minutes away.</p>

<p>"That car that is coming," said Lee to the police, "contains
Germans, members of the Gestapo, who wish to seize this harmless
old couple and carry them back to Germany!"</p>

<p>The crowd murmured in anger. "Drive on!" Lee said, and left
them with that.</p>

<p>In each of the succeeding towns they were stopped, but now Lee
had only to identify himself and they were waved on with smiles.
They saw no more of the following car.</p>

<p>After crossing the Tagus and heading south, Lee, fearing there
might be an attempt to intercept them at the edge of the city,
had José make a wide detour to the west. They entered Lisbon from
that side. At ten o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Niebuhr were delivered
safely to the Senhora at the <i>Macaco Branco</i> and whisked to
their rooms upstairs. The four men enjoyed a belated dinner in
the restaurant.</p>

<p>On a subsequent day, Lee contrived to have the Niebuhrs
smuggled aboard an English ship in the harbour, without ever
having been seen by Stengel or his men. Bosco reported that the
Bulldog had been overheard to say in the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i>
that the "verdammt" Mappin was a magician. "I never had a finer
tribute!" said Lee, smiling.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p class="first">THE name of Monsieur Gade was announced on the
telephone as calling to see Senhor Mappin, and Lee requested that
he be brought upstairs. The tidy little Frenchman presented
himself in the sitting-room with a series of bows.</p>

<p>"Senhor Mappin," he said, "you engaged me to find if I could a
certain covered truck in Lisbon such as undertakers use to
transport bodies from place to place."</p>

<p>"Have you found it?" asked Lee eagerly.</p>

<p>"You described certain peculiarities in the tyres. I have
found a truck with such tyres, but it bears a plate with the name
of the proprietor, and you said the truck you were looking for
had no such distinguishing mark."</p>

<p>"Such a plate could be screwed on and off, couldn't it? If a
murder was contemplated, naturally they'd remove it."</p>

<p>"Assuredly, Senhor." M. Gade furnished Lee with the name of
the undertaking establishment where the truck was to be found.
"Cavilho," he said. "A superior sort of place, patronised by the
well-to-do. Do you wish me to accompany you when you go to look
at it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lee. "I am continually watched and followed about,
and I don't want my ill-wishers to find out that you are in my
employ."</p>

<p>"Very good, Senhor. Have you any further commands?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lee. "Somewhere in Lisbon I want you to find me a
long, low-hung grey sedan car. It bears a licence with this
number, but you will no doubt find that the licence plates are
stolen or altered. The car has seen hard use, the fenders are
battered, the paint faded, but mechanically it's in perfect
order. I was unable to get the name of the manufacturer. I shot
holes in the two right-hand tyres yesterday. They may have new
tyres by now, but one of my bullets entered the right-hand side
just above the running-board. That will be an identifying mark.
I'll know the car if you can find it. It is one used by the
Gestapo outfit. I am also hoping that in the place where this car
is kept, you may find a charcoal brazier such as plumbers use to
heat their irons, and three irons that go with it. That would be
vital evidence."</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Senhor Mappin."</p>

<p>Lee and Luke presently set out. The address given was in one
of the newer streets to the west, and the place was not unlike a
similar establishment in America, with this difference&mdash;that
there was no chapel attached, since no good Catholic would think
of being buried from such an unconsecrated place. The parlours
were handsomely furnished, and the proprietor who came forward to
greet them, a large, pale man with soft hands, wore the sort of
bland, commiserating smile that is characteristic of undertakers
everywhere.</p>

<p>"I am Senhor Cavilho," he said.</p>

<p>He lost his smile when Lee said bluntly: "May I see the motor
cars in your outfit, Senhor?"</p>

<p>"A very strange request, Senhor! Do me the favour of
explaining why you wish to see my motor cars."</p>

<p>"I am looking for a truck such as those used for transporting
bodies from place to place, which has certain distinguishing
marks."</p>

<p>"For why? For why? I demand an answer, Senhor."</p>

<p>"You shall have it," said Lee. "On the night of September 18th
this truck was used to transport an unconscious man to the place
where he was murdered."</p>

<p>Cavilho turned as white as paper and dropped suddenly on one
of his expensive chairs. "Who are you?" he stammered.</p>

<p>Lee presented his card. "I expect my name will mean nothing to
you, Senhor. If you require a reference, please call up the
American Legation and ask His Excellency, the Minister."</p>

<p>The shaken man tried to bluff it out. "Senhor, I can tell you
at once that no car of mine was out of the garage on the night of
September 18th." The attempt was not a success.</p>

<p>"I fear the Senhor is not being frank with me," said Lee
sternly. "The car or truck has already been identified by a man
in my employ."</p>

<p>Cavilho mopped his face with a white handkerchief. "He is
mistaken," he stammered. "No car could be taken out without my
knowledge."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Lee dryly. "Let us have a look at the cars,
Senhor, and I can tell you instantly."</p>

<p>The undertaker led them towards the back of the building and
down some steps into a garage. Among the vehicles there was only
one truck of the sort that Lee was looking for. A small, black,
covered truck, elegantly finished, it had a neat silver plate
bearing the proprietor's name screwed to each side near the
front. Lee showed Luke some scratches on the screws which showed
they had lately been tampered with. He stooped to examine the
tyres.</p>

<p>"This is the car," he said.</p>

<p>The unfortunate undertaker wrung his hands. "No! No!" he
lamented. "It cannot be! I know of no murder! My reputation is my
life! You are seeking to ruin me, Senhor! What reason have you
for making such an assertion?"</p>

<p>Lee showed him the pages of his notebook on which he had
sketched the tracks left by the car in the film of mud. "Drawn to
scale," said Lee, "on the morning following the murder. Notice
the clean, sharp design of the tread as left by new tires like
those on your car. The tread is no proof since many tyres of the
same make are sold. But notice the irregular impression of this
cut on the right-hand rear tyre. The car was seen standing at the
door of the house where the man was murdered. The proof is
positive, Senhor."</p>

<p>"I shall be ruined!" wailed Cavilho.</p>

<p>"No one has accused you of being a party to the murder," said
Lee crisply. "The best way to clear your reputation, Senhor, is
to be absolutely frank with the authorities. Did you or did you
not hire out this car on the night of September 18th?"</p>

<p>"How do I know you are an authorised person?"</p>

<p>"Call up Inspector da Gama at the Ministry of Police and ask
him."</p>

<p>"No! I will tell all!" wailed the distressed man. "It is true,
I did rent out this car on September 18th, Senhor...But I am not
guilty of any wrongdoing! I swear it. The man said it was to be
used in an innocent prank. The car was returned before morning.
There was no...no blood. It was in perfect order..."</p>

<p>Lee interrupted him. "Wait a minute! Who hired it?"</p>

<p>"The name has slipped my memory. I have it written down
somewhere. It was a cash transaction."</p>

<p>"Never mind. It was certainly a false name. Describe the
man."</p>

<p>"A handsome young man, Senhor. Full of spirits. He had the
appearance of a gentleman. An American like yourself,
Senhor."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Lee. He and Luke exchanged a glance.</p>

<p>"I saw no harm in it, Senhor," the man wailed. "They say that
Americans are very fond of practical jokes. One is never
surprised at anything an American may do. Senhor, I have a
blameless reputation..."</p>

<p>"I suppose he paid you a very good price," put in Lee
dryly.</p>

<p>Cavilho made no answer.</p>

<p>"And you undoubtedly exacted a large sum as a forfeit in case
of damage to the car."</p>

<p>He miserably admitted it.</p>

<p>"Many days have passed," said Lee, "and the car is not likely
to reveal any further evidence. Nevertheless, let us examine it.
Have you a strong flashlight?"</p>

<p>Such a light was produced. Lee opened the back doors of the
car and threw the flash inside. On the floor lay a folding
stretcher. "This went with the car?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Cavilho nodded miserably.</p>

<p>"Has it been used since?"</p>

<p>"No, Senhor."</p>

<p>Luke pulled out the stretcher and set it up on the floor. Lee
went over it inch by inch. It yielded no evidence. Lee then
climbed into the car and with the flashlight searched floors,
walls and ceiling. When he climbed out he opened his hand to
reveal a little, flat stone lying on his palm. It was oval in
shape, of a dark green colour, with crimson flecks in it and
highly polished.</p>

<p>"A bloodstone," said Lee. "Symbolic, eh? This may prove to be
important."</p>

<p>The undertaker shuddered. "Shall you report this to the
police?"</p>

<p>"Not at the moment," said Lee. "Not until I have completed my
case." He borrowed an envelope from Cavilho and, stowing the
bloodstone in it, endorsed it with the time and the place. "In
the meantime, Senhor, I recommend that you say nothing about it.
Best for you and best for all of us. When an opportunity arises,
I shall ask you to identify the man who hired this car from you.
By doing so you can clear yourself completely."</p>

<p>Judging from the man's face, there was no danger that he would
talk.</p>

<p>Arriving back in the hotel, Lee said: "Let's hang around
downstairs a while."</p>

<p>They found seats in the lounge and watched the panorama of
life in the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> during wartime. The old hotel
was one of the principal centres of intrigue in that city of
intrigue. The restaurant was filling up for lunch. Nationals of
all the warring peoples met in the lounge, ignoring each other or
nodding with fulsome, false smiles; English, American, German,
Italian, Japanese, besides all the neutrals who were not neutral.
Every man had a smile on his lips and a guard over his eyes. Lee
suspected that many a treacherous deal was effected by the foxy
merchants of all nations in the private rooms, and that the
secret history of the <i>Lisboa Palace</i>, if it could be
published, would surprise the world.</p>

<p>Ronald Franklin, smiling and debonair, came up the stairway.
Lee waved a hand to him and he came up with a face full of
gladness.</p>

<p>"You're looking very fit, Mr. Mappin. I missed you
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Went for a little trip in the country," said Lee. "I must see
something of the country, too, for my book, you know."</p>

<p>"For your book, of course," said Franklin without any
suggestion of irony.</p>

<p>"Are you lunching alone?" asked Lee. "I should be glad if you
would join us."</p>

<p>A spark of surprise appeared in Franklin's wary eyes.
"Delighted!" he cried.</p>

<p>"We had better go right in," said Lee. "The restaurant is
filling up."</p>

<p>Lee looked at Luke, and Luke understood him. "I'll join you
directly," he said.</p>

<p>Lee took Franklin's arm in sociable fashion and they went into
the restaurant. Luke disappeared in a telephone booth.</p>

<p>Presently the three of them were established at a table not
far from the door.</p>

<p>"How is the book progressing?" asked Franklin.</p>

<p>"I am taking notes," said Lee. "I shall not attempt to write
it until I get home. But what material! what material! This is a
dreadful city! Sometimes it terrifies me!"</p>

<p>"Extraordinarily interesting, I admit," said Franklin. "But
why terrifying?"</p>

<p>Lee blinked at him innocently through his glasses. "Take the
wanton murder of my poor friend, William Miller. Do you know the
police have not made the slightest progress towards solving it? I
am driven to the belief that they don't want to solve it."</p>

<p>Franklin never batted an eyelash. "What possible reason could
they have for not wanting to solve it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the parochialism one finds everywhere in the world.
They are afraid of bringing their city into disrepute."</p>

<p>"Well, with your record as a criminologist, why don't you set
about solving it yourself?" asked Franklin.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head sadly. "My ignorance of the language, and
of the whole situation over here, is too great a handicap."</p>

<p>"You must have some theory."</p>

<p>Lee lowered his voice confidently. "Well, William was a
German, you know."</p>

<p>"No! I didn't know that."</p>

<p>"And I suppose it has something to do with the affairs of that
unhappy country. Perhaps other Germans considered him a traitor
because he worked for an American."</p>

<p>"It is possible," said Franklin with a serious air.</p>

<p>Luke, who was of too forthright a nature to enjoy this sort of
verbal sparring, kept his eyes on his plate.</p>

<p>Kate McDonald entered the restaurant alone. She bowed
smilingly to Lee and to Luke, ignored Franklin; looked around for
the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>.</p>

<p>Lee sprang up. "Miss McDonald! You are alone. Pray join
us."</p>

<p>The girl was startled. "Oh, thank you! I couldn't think of
it."</p>

<p>"You must!" said Lee. "Look at us, three bored men without a
lady to grace our table. It will make all the difference between
mere food and a banquet!"</p>

<p>His talk bore her down; she hung irresolutely. The <i>maître
d'hôtel</i> came bustling up. "The young lady will lunch with us
if you will have another place laid," said Lee.</p>

<p>Franklin was not at all put about by this encounter. He was so
pleased with his own cleverness it did not seem to occur to him
that Lee was pulling his leg. The girl's intuition told her
better. She sat down with an embarrassed air.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tremaine you know," said Lee. "This is Mr. Ronald
Franklin. He crossed with us, don't you remember? I always
wondered why you two didn't hit it off together. The handsomest
couple on the ship!"</p>

<p>"Now come, Mr. Mappin!" protested Franklin. "I can only accept
that for the feminine half of the couple."</p>

<p>So it went. Lee was enjoying himself; Franklin put on a good
show; Luke and the girl stole curious, sidelong glances at each
other.</p>

<p>In the middle of the meal Lee, who was facing the entrance,
saw Senhor Cavilho, the undertaker, come in. He passed their
table, proceeded to the end of the room looking from table to
table; returned. Ronald Franklin was now facing him. Cavilho
changed colour and bit his lip. He passed on out of the
restaurant. Franklin had paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, Franklin excused himself on the
score that he had an engagement. Lee caught Luke's eye, and Luke
rose, saying that he had telephoning to do. Thus Lee and the girl
were left together at the table with their coffee and
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said Lee in a fatherly fashion, "you didn't
enjoy it very much, did you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him in a scared way. "Why yes...yes, of
course!"</p>

<p>"I was just having a bit of fun with you," Lee went on. "I
know that you and Mr. Franklin are very well acquainted
indeed."</p>

<p>She stared at him, terrified and fascinated. "You are
mistaken," she stammered. "I don't know why you..."</p>

<p>"I also know that it was you who arranged to have me seized
and tied up in the most humiliating fashion and carried off in a
motor car at Ponta Delgada..."</p>

<p>The girl put her napkin to her lips. "No!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"But I don't bear you any ill-will. I like you. I am only
sorry to see the company you keep. Did they tell you what they
did to my friend, William Miller? They murdered him, my dear...I
see by your face that that is news to you...You are in a bad jam.
If you confided in me I might be able to help you get out of
it."</p>

<p>She pushed her chair back from the table. She was breathing
fast.</p>

<p>Lee rose. "Well, at any rate, don't tell Franklin that we have
reached a kind of understanding. That would only make it worse
for everybody. And remember, if you want to come to me at any
time, you can be sure of finding a friend."</p>

<p>She fled from the room.</p>

<p>Lee re-seated himself. "Some fresh coffee," he said to the
waiter.</p>

<p>When he got up to his rooms Luke was there. "Has Cavilho had
time enough to get home?" Lee asked.</p>

<p>Luke nodded.</p>

<p>"Call him up."</p>

<p>After a brief telephone conversation, Luke reported that the
undertaker identified the man lunching with Lee as the same
individual who had hired his truck on the night of September
18th.</p>

<p>"You had not told him over the phone that he would find the
man at my table?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. He picked him out of the whole restaurant. He was
surprised and upset to find him sitting down with you."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lee. "That ought to be sufficient to hang number
five!"</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then Luke asked: "What are you going to
do about him in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"Nothing just now. As long as he doesn't suspect how much we
know, we can pick him up at any time. I don't want to alarm
Stengel too much. He must already be somewhat disturbed."

<p><br>
THE telephone rang. Luke answered it. "It's Inspector da
Gama," he said.</p>

<p>Lee took the instrument:</p>

<p>"Hello, Senhor da Gama?"</p>

<p>The Inspector said: "I was expecting to hear from you this
morning, Senhor. I wanted to know what happened yesterday. What
were the circumstances leading up to that message you sent
me?"</p>

<p>"Do you <i>really</i> want to know?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Well, I leave that to your judgment," said the Inspector
cautiously. "Not unless you wish me to take further action in the
matter."</p>

<p>"No further action will be necessary," said Lee. "We came
through quite safely. But I must thank you for taking such prompt
action. It's a long story, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Some day I shall expect to hear it all, Senhor Mappin...Your
pursuers did not get off so easily," he added, and Lee thought he
heard a chuckle in his voice.</p>

<p>"No? What happened?"</p>

<p>"It has been reported to me that their car was stoned at the
town of Arraiollos, and when they got out of it they were roughly
used by the crowd. The local police appear to have been helpless
to protect them. The Embassy of Germany has lodged a protest. It
is very regrettable."</p>

<p>"Very!" said Lee. "I feel for you, Inspector...How roughly
were they used?"</p>

<p>"Bruised and cut by flying stones, I am told, and pushed
around by the crowd. Only one was seriously injured. His leg was
broken. They brought him into Lisbon and put him into the <i>Bon
Secours Hospital</i>."</p>

<p>"Which one?" asked Lee eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not the leader of the party. The man's name is given as
Diehlmann."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Inspector. I shall give myself the pleasure of
visiting the poor fellow in hospital."</p>

<p>This time there was no doubt that the Inspector laughed.
"You're a terrible man, Senhor Mappin."

<p><br>
AS they were preparing to go out, the telephone rang again.
This was Bosco. He had lunched with his pals at the
<i>leiteria</i> and they had reported to him that a strange quiet
had lain on the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> all morning. Neither
Stengel nor the man Lee knew as Scarface had returned to the
hotel the night before, nor had either been seen there since.
Schoenhut was in the hotel as usual, and in a bad temper. He had
had several telephone talks with Stengel, and apparently had
caught hell, but the lift operator had not been able to hear
anything. Bosco had a date that night with the hotel chambermaid,
and hoped to have more to report in the morning.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p class="first">LEE and Luke entered the long hospital ward
guided by a black-robed sister of charity with a gentle
voice.</p>

<p>"He suffered much pain before they brought him here," she
said. "Forced to ride in a crowded motor-car for a hundred miles.
It was necessary to retract the broken leg before it could be put
in a cast." She smiled compassionately. "Naturally after such an
experience he is a bad patient. Nothing pleases him."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor fellow!" said Lee sympathetically. "How long will he
have to stay in hospital, sister?"</p>

<p>"Four weeks, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Has he had any other visitors to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, Senhor."</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can provide to relieve the tedium?"</p>

<p>"Ask him, Senhor. Ask him yourself."</p>

<p>They were passing between two rows of white beds, some with
dark heads lying quiet on the pillow; others with patients
sitting up. The more fortunate ones, clad in rough bathrobes and
slippers, were moving about and visiting from bed to bed. The
entrance of the plump little American gentleman in a white
waistcoat and his tall friend aroused a general interest. All
heads followed their passage through the ward, curious to
discover whom they had come to visit.</p>

<p>"Here he is," said the sister, stopping.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke saw at a glance that the patient was the man they
had christened Mustaches, for lack of a better name. His elevated
leg was being stretched in a contrivance with weighted ropes that
passed over a pulley at the foot of the bed. He was a black
German of about forty, with an ill-natured expression. The
salient feature of his face was the pair of handle-bars which
projected beyond his cheeks on either side. Such a magnificent
mustache Lee had rarely seen. The wearer had included some of the
hair of his beard to increase its volume. He was continually
stroking and pulling this ornament.</p>

<p>"These kind gentlemen have come to see you," said the
nurse.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Diehlmann," said Lee in German.</p>

<p>When his eyes fell on Lee, the German's face presented an
extraordinary study of amazement, anger, fear. "What do you
want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Only to pay you a little visit."</p>

<p>Diehlmann's face flushed darkly. "Go away!" he said. "I want
no visit from you. Where is Algadao? Where is Luiz Rosado and his
brother Antonio? You can't get hold of me! I'm safe from you
here! Go away! You won't get anything out of me!"</p>

<p>The sister shook her head sadly. Lee said to Luke:</p>

<p>"Explain to her that the poor fellow blames me for his
accident. He is not responsible for what he says. Pain has
unnerved him." Luke repeated this in Portuguese.</p>

<p>Diehlmann turned to the sister. In his excitement, he was
still speaking German. "Send this man away! Have I no protection
here? He's no friend of mine. He has only come here to see what
he can get out of me. He is an American! He is my country's
enemy!"</p>

<p>Lee said to Luke: "Tell her she needn't wait. I'll try to
soothe him. If my presence continues to excite him, I'll go."</p>

<p>She had many duties to perform and she softly moved away. Lee
sat on a chair beside the bed; Diehlmann turned away his head and
fell silent; Luke stood at the bed's foot.</p>

<p>After a while Lee asked mildly: "Is there anything you would
like?"</p>

<p>"I want smokes," said Diehlmann sullenly. "My money is in the
drawer of the stand behind you. You can get cigarettes in the
entrance lobby."</p>

<p>Lee pulled out the little drawer. "There's only some change
here," he said. "Is that all you had on you?"</p>

<p>"What is it to you?" growled Diehlmann.</p>

<p>"You will need many little things, smokes, fruit, wine. I will
leave a hundred escudos in the drawer."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," said Diehlmann gracelessly. "A hundred
escudos won't buy me, nor a thousand, nor ten thousand."</p>

<p>Luke departed to buy the cigarettes. Lee sat quietly beside
the bed, confident that he could bear the silence longer than
Diehlmann could. He was right. Diehlmann presently rolled his
head over and demanded.</p>

<p>"Who told you I was here?"</p>

<p>"A little bird," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Ahh! go to hell!" said Diehlmann in good American.</p>

<p>There was another long silence; then he came back: "If you
want me to talk, you tell me, where is Algadao? Where are the
Rosados?"</p>

<p>"That seems to bother you," said Lee. "They're
travelling&mdash;at my expense."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," said Diehlmann passionately, "we got the
better of you yesterday. You didn't succeed in rescuing the
German traitor. He is lying dead on the mountainside above Villa
Boim right now, and the Spanish boy beside him."</p>

<p>"I suspect you're lying," said Lee calmly. "At any rate, I'll
soon know."</p>

<p>Luke returned with cigarettes. Diehlmann's hand trembled with
eagerness as he lighted up. After filling his lungs with smoke a
few times and luxuriously blowing it out, he seemed to be in a
better humour.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I bet you'd like to know," he said to
Lee.</p>

<p>"Many things," said Lee.</p>

<p>"You'd like to know how we got the tip that Niebuhr was hidden
at the Spaniard's."</p>

<p>"That's one thing I do know," said Lee. "German agents in
Badajoz intercepted his letter to me, and after reading it,
remailed it."</p>

<p>"And wouldn't you like to know how we secured the code that
enabled us to read it?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't read it," said Lee calmly. "Only the address it
contained. The code is known to about ten men only. It does not
exist in writing."</p>

<p>"What good is your code to you when we can intercept your
letters?"</p>

<p>"I have taken measures to prevent a repetition of that."</p>

<p>Diehlmann laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>The black-robed sister appeared at the end of the ward,
bringing another visitor. Lee was the first to take note of the
tall, lanky figure with touselled head; the Stork, otherwise
Schoenhut. Lee smiled, anticipating further comedy.</p>

<p>When Schoenhut saw Lee, he jerked back as if he had stumbled
on a snake in his path. So comical was his look of dismay that
Lee and Luke laughed outright. Even Diehlmann was sufficiently
recovered from his discomfiture to be amused. Schoenhut demanded
in German:</p>

<p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

<p>Diehlmann answered: "Fishing; but he hasn't caught
anything...Remember, he understands German."</p>

<p>Schoenhut wiped his agitated face.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Lee affably. "Luke, fetch the chair from the
next bed for Herr Schoenhut. Nobody is using it...Sit down, sit
down, Herr Schoenhut, and let us continue our pleasant talk. We
don't have to bring our enmities to the bedside of an injured
friend."</p>

<p>Schoenhut dropped in the offered chair. Having less
self-possession than Diehlmann, he had difficulty in commanding his
features. With his eyes bolting this way and that, and his Adam's
apple working convulsively up and down, he was a ludicrous
figure.</p>

<p>"I was sorry to hear that you had trouble with the populace at
Arraiollos last night," said Lee politely.</p>

<p>"That was your work!" growled Schoenhut.</p>

<p>"Really! All I did was to tell the people that the Gestapo was
after us. Nobody loves the Gestapo!"</p>

<p>Schoenhut rose from his chair and cursed Lee thickly. His face
was convulsed with rage.</p>

<p>"Watch yourself!" growled Diehlmann. "He is only baiting
you."</p>

<p>Schoenhut dropped back on the chair. The men in the
neighbouring beds, suspecting that something humorous was going
on, strained their ears to hear, but the German baffled them.
They scowled and muttered.</p>

<p>"How is Fräulein the cigar-maker's daughter?" Lee asked
wickedly. "Pray give her my regards when you call."</p>

<p>Schoenhut could bear no more. He jumped up, and saying to
Diehlmann over his shoulder: "I'll see you later," marched
out.</p>

<p>"Too bad he is so easily discomposed," said Lee, shaking his
head. "As a leader of the dreaded Gestapo, he is a disappointment
to me."</p>

<p>"He's a fool!" growled Diehlmann. "Better not judge the
Gestapo by <i>him</i>, Herr Mappin."</p>

<p>After a little further sparring with Diehlmann, Lee said to
Luke: "We'd better go now. If we stay too long, Herr Schoenhut
may round up his friends to wait for us at the door."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Diehlmann, scowling, "why did you come here
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"You have already guessed why," said Lee, smiling. "It was to
pick up any ill-considered trifles of information that might
offer themselves."</p>

<p>"But you didn't get anything!"</p>

<p>Lee's smile broadened. "Oh, I wouldn't say that!...Come, Luke!
I'll be seeing you, Herr Diehlmann."</p>

<p>On the way out, they were followed by the scowls of the other
patients. "They think we're Germans, too," said Lee. Meeting the
black-robed sister at the door, Lee said to her with a shake of
the head:</p>

<p>"A hard customer, sister!" He pressed a donation for the poor
upon her.</p>

<p>In the taxicab on the way back, Luke asked: "Did you have a
special object in going there?"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "I told Diehlmann the truth. I just went
on the chance. You never can tell how a man will react to
pain."</p>

<p>"Well, it was amusing," said Luke, "but it didn't profit us
much."</p>

<p>"You're wrong," said Lee, smiling. "Look!" He thrust thumb and
forefinger in his vest pocket and, opening his hand, showed Luke
a pair of gold cuff links lying on his palm. They were of the
type that is set with a jewel on one side and has a curved, solid
shank ending in a gold button. One link was set with an oval
bloodstone. In the other, the setting was empty.</p>

<p>Luke whistled. "My God! where did you pick those up?"</p>

<p>"In the drawer of the bedstand among his change and other
little objects of value."</p>

<p>"This will convict him of being present that night!"</p>

<p>"Surely! This accounts for number six!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Lee and Luke entered the hotel, they found
Kate McDonald waiting in the lobby. There was a change in her
appearance; she was not so perfectly turned out as they were
accustomed to see her; the beautiful eyes were stormy, their lids
swollen as from weeping. At Lee's approach, she instinctively put
up a hand to cover her cheek.</p>

<p>"Here I am," she said falteringly. "I want to...you said to
come. I suppose you didn't expect to see me so soon..."</p>

<p>Lee gently drew down the hand from her face. There was a
bruise on her cheek bone that told its own story.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs," said Lee.</p>

<p>As soon as the door of the suite closed behind them she
dropped in a chair and broke into a quiet, piteous weeping. The
tears stole between her fingers. She struggled breathlessly to
apologise for the breakdown.</p>

<p>"Let it come! Let it come!" said Lee. "You'll feel better for
it."</p>

<p>She pointed blindly at Luke. "Send him away...please!"</p>

<p>At a glance from Lee, Luke went into the bedroom and closed
the door.</p>

<p>"You can trust him just the same as you would me," said
Lee.</p>

<p>"I know," she said brokenly. "He's a good, decent fellow. He's
a man! That's why. That's why. It shames me to have him see
me."</p>

<p>Lee waited for her to recover control.</p>

<p>"I haven't had any luck," she said piteously. "Ronnie Franklin
is a brute and a scoundrel. I've known it for a long time. But I
hadn't the strength to leave him. To-day he struck me. It was the
first time. That ends it! Oh, help me to have the courage not to
go crawling back!"</p>

<p>"I'll help you all I can," said Lee. "But in the end that
courage can come only from yourself."</p>

<p>"I know! I know! Oh, it's hell on earth to be fond of somebody
whom you know is bad. When I am away from him I can see him as he
is. I hate him then. But in his presence I am enslaved! When he
touches me I go to pieces. Why is that?"</p>

<p>"It's common enough," said Lee. "They call it
infatuation."</p>

<p>"Oh, help me, help me to get the better of it!"</p>

<p>"I think the cure has already begun," said Lee dryly.</p>

<p>She shook her head hopelessly. "No! Even now something is
drawing me back to him. Something stronger than I. I am
lost!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Lee. "You don't have to go back unless you
want to. Let's drag the whole matter out into the light. There is
no cure like letting in light. Have you told him you're
through?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, but he didn't believe me. He only laughed. I
have said it before. He is so absolutely sure of me he despises
me."</p>

<p>"Well, let's give him the shock of his life this time," said
Lee cheerfully. "Tell me about yourself and how it began."</p>

<p>"I am Italian," she said. "My father and mother are dead. For
many years before the war I worked in England. That is why I
speak the language without an accent. I was a governess in
different English families. I was treated like an upper servant.
It was an intolerable existence. I felt as if life was passing me
by.</p>

<p>"I met Ronnie in England before the war. He sought me out
because I worked in a Cabinet Minister's family, but I didn't
know that until long afterwards. I was a Fascist&mdash;at least,
I imagined I was. Anything to be different from the arrogant
English. I know better now. Little by little, Ronnie let me
understand that he was a German agent. I thought that was
wonderful. Such a charming fellow he seemed then, full of pluck
and kindness and laughter!</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about English Government affairs, but
I made believe I did, just to lead Ronnie on. I tried to find
things out for him, and I did to a certain extent. In the end I
was discovered and the English threatened to send me to prison.
Ronnie saved me from that. Don't ask me how. He had powerful
friends in England. Nobody suspected what he was. It was he who
got me the English passport.</p>

<p>"So I went with Ronnie. Day by day I became more infatuated.
The life he offered me was intoxicating; secrecy, excitement,
danger, continual travel. We have been all over the world
together, always travelling as strangers. Ronnie seemed to me
like a superman, the way he could fool everybody and get what he
wanted out of them. There was a hardness, a cruelty in him that
made a slave of me. But I welcomed it. Can you understand
that?"</p>

<p>"It is very understandable," said Lee.</p>

<p>Her tears had dried, leaving her white and exhausted-looking.
"That's my story," she said, spreading her hands. "He doesn't
trust me completely. I've always known that. I knew nothing about
a murder, but since you told me I have been putting two and two
together. I understand more now. Some of his associates here in
Lisbon are horrible men!" She shuddered.</p>

<p>"Did your quarrel to-day have anything to do with us?" asked
Lee.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Ever since <i>he</i> started to work for
you,"&mdash;she nodded towards the bedroom door&mdash;"Ronnie has
been after me to work on him, to lead him on, to get him in my
power." She hung her head. "I have done that for him before. I am
ashamed of it now! I didn't mind with the others, because they
were just as crooked as we were. But this one is different; he's
a decent, honest fellow, and somehow I couldn't do it!"</p>

<p>"I told you the cure had begun," said Lee.</p>

<p>"That's why I've been hanging around the hotel," she
continued. "Ronnie sent me here to-day to get you to ask me to
lunch with you and Mr. Tremaine. I didn't expect to find Ronnie
himself lunching with you..."</p>

<p>"He hadn't expected it either," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>"That upset me and made me self-conscious. I could scarcely
bring myself to look at Mr. Tremaine. I couldn't open my lips.
Ronnie was getting angrier with me every minute, and that made me
worse."</p>

<p>"And you quarrelled when you met afterwards?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Somehow I found the courage to talk back to
him&mdash;for the first time. I said too much. He struck me!"</p>

<p>"Where are you living?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"At the Victoria."</p>

<p>"Together?"</p>

<p>She hung her head. "We have rooms on the same corridor. We are
never seen together."</p>

<p>Lee began to pace the room. "Kate," he said,&mdash;"I suppose
I should continue to call you Kate?"</p>

<p>"That is my name, though my parents spelled it Caterina."</p>

<p>"I shall call you Kate. It comes naturally to an Anglo-Saxon
tongue...You can't shake off this obsession without making an
effort. Have you the courage to fight it, to fight Ronnie
Franklin?"</p>

<p>She paled. "You mean work to obtain evidence against him,
evidence of murder?"</p>

<p>"No. I shan't ask that. But to help me to convict the chief of
the murderers, Stengel. That is the one who looks like a
bulldog."</p>

<p>A shiver passed through her. "I have seen him."</p>

<p>"And another whose name I don't know. He has a scar down the
side of his face and we call him Scarface. I have reason to
believe that it was he who plunged a knife into my friend's
breast."</p>

<p>"I don't know him."</p>

<p>"Apparently I've thrown a scare into these two and they've
gone into hiding. I must find out where they are. Will you help
me?"</p>

<p>The girl said nothing.</p>

<p>"You say you have seen the folly and the falsity of Fascism;
do it for freedom's sake, Kate."</p>

<p>She still hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, if that leaves you cold, you have suffered; do it for
revenge!"</p>

<p>"I'll try," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Not good enough," said Lee coolly. "If you cannot do it with
your whole heart, better leave it alone. You would only be
defeated...But think, Kate, this is your chance to free yourself.
If you don't take it, a worse hell than any you have known is
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked, startled.</p>

<p>"This man will soon cast you aside."</p>

<p>She stared ahead of her as if there were a ghost there.
"You're right," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you going to wait like a tame woman until that
happens!"</p>

<p>She stood up suddenly. "No! I'll do what you want."</p>

<p>They shook hands on it.</p>

<p>"How should I begin?" she asked.</p>

<p>"By making up with Ronnie."</p>

<p>Her face fell.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be fun," suggested Lee, "to be the one who was
doing the fooling for a change?...Is there a tea-room in your
hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, take Luke and give him tea there. Let Ronnie see you
with him. You are obeying him, you are doing what he wants. That
will be sufficient without saying anything."</p>

<p>A slow smile spread across her pale face. "You're a devil!"
she said. "You know exactly how to get around a woman!"</p>

<p>"Only so far!" said Lee, with a rueful shake of the head.
"Only so far!"</p>

<p>"No man would be attracted to me with this," she said,
indicating the bruise.</p>

<p>"Tut!" said Lee. "A little liquid powder and rouge will soon
fix that up. Don't tell me you're not familiar with the
possibilities of make-up!"</p>

<p>She took a hasty survey of herself in a wall mirror. "I look
awful! What must he think of me? Ask Mr. Tremaine to meet me in
the foyer of the Victoria in half an hour. You explain everything
to him."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p class="first">AT dinner time Luke had not returned, and Lee
set out on foot alone for the <i>Macaco Branco</i>. He was not
followed. A strange boy was selling papers at Bosco's post on the
<i>Roçio</i>, and Lee smiled to himself, thinking of Bosco's
date.</p>

<p>Soon after he had ordered his dinner, Luke joined him.
"Everything went off all right," he said with a broad smile.</p>

<p>There was a brightness in his eye and a warmth in his voice
that caused Lee to look at him sharply. "Did Franklin see you
with the girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He came into the hotel while we were sitting in the
tea-room and took in the situation. It was all right with him. He
went upstairs."</p>

<p>"What did you talk about?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Luke laughed. "There was no lack of talk. She told me about
her childhood in Italy." The young man's eyes were
reminiscent.</p>

<p>"I didn't want you to go <i>too</i> far," said Lee,
frowning.</p>

<p>Luke was amused by his anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We...you know the situation."</p>

<p>"Certainly I know it. That's just it. It's the first time in
my life, I think, that I ever began with a girl on a perfectly
honest basis."</p>

<p>"Dangerous!" suggested Lee.</p>

<p>"I can't see it, Chief. My life has not been exactly a clean
page either. However far it may go, my eyes are open and so are
hers, so where's the danger?"</p>

<p>Lee, afraid of saying too much, let the subject drop.</p>

<p>Luke wouldn't let it drop. "And I haven't forgotten my job,
either," he added. "Nor has she. The only way we can win her over
is by being fond of her, Chief. You may not think so, but she's
very lovable. Well, I suppose every woman is lovable when she's
honest. And she thinks I'm a wonderful person, simply because I'm
honest with her. It's a big change for her. For me, too. I never
realised before what a satisfying feeling it gave you to be
honest with a woman."</p>

<p>"Damn it!" muttered Lee. "We fall from one situation right
smack into another."</p>

<p>Luke laughed. "Well, I don't care how it looks, or what an
outsider might say; judging from my own feelings, this is one of
the best situations I ever fell into!"</p>

<p>Their talk was interrupted by a slight commotion at the door
of the restaurant. A small, ragged and extremely dirty bootblack
came in with his blacking-box over his shoulder. He was scared
and trying to brazen it out. The Senhora flew at him like an
angry hen and shooed him out. He came in a second time, and again
she flew at him, crying: "You can't shine shoes in here!" The boy
was strangely persistent. A third time his grimy face appeared
around the door, and this time he stood his ground. He said
something to the Senhora that made her pause. Telling him to
stand by the door, she came back to Lee's table.</p>

<p>"This boy says he has a message for you, Senhor. Such
impudence! Shall I send him away?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Lee. "Bring him back."</p>

<p>She led the boy down the room at arm's length. Impudent,
grinning and triumphant, he said to Lee in his hoarse, gamin's
voice:</p>

<p>"Send her away, Senhor."</p>

<p>Lee said apologetically: "He says he must speak to me alone,
Senhora. Please to excuse us."</p>

<p>She flounced back to her desk.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"Johnny," said the bootblack, "like an American boy...Are you
Senhor Mappin, the patron of Bosco?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lee. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"Bosco needs help," said Johnny simply.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>Johnny named a humble eating-house in a nearby street. "He has
a girl with him. Two men are laying for him outside."</p>

<p>Lee threw down his napkin and got up. "Come on," he said to
Luke.</p>

<p>They left the restaurant. Turning out of the little square,
they entered a darker street leading east, and hastened along the
pavement.</p>

<p>Johnny chattered and Luke translated.</p>

<p>"He says Bosco told him he was going out to-night with the
girl who works in the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i>. Bosco told Johnny
to watch the hotel and if any of the men came out to try to find
out where they went. The girl came out shortly after six, and one
of the men followed her, unknown to her. So Johnny followed them
both."</p>

<p>"Tell him to describe the man."</p>

<p>"A long-legged guy, Johnny says, with a big nose and wears
glasses."</p>

<p>"Schoenhut," murmured Lee.</p>

<p>"The girl went home," Luke continued, "with the man following
her and Johnny following the man. The man waited outside the
house where she lives, and after a while she came out all dressed
up for the evening. Johnny doesn't think much of her looks. He
calls her a crow, just the same as us. Man and boy then followed
her to the eating-house in the <i>Rua Escova</i>, where Johnny is
taking us now. When the man saw that the boy and girl were going
to stay there, he went into a tobacconist's and telephoned, and
in a few minutes another man joined him."</p>

<p>"Describe the second man."</p>

<p>"A slick young fellow," Johnny says, "dressed fine like an
American."</p>

<p>"Franklin!"</p>

<p>"Johnny left the two of them watching the eating-house while
he came to get you. Johnny's slang is a little hard to follow.
He's telling me, I take it, that Bosco was giving the girl a
heavy line."</p>

<p>"I hope to God they're still in the place," said Lee
anxiously.</p>

<p>"If there are two men, shouldn't we have more help,
Chief?"</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "Our appearance on the scene will be
sufficient to prevent trouble."</p>

<p>They turned a corner into a little street of shops that Johnny
said was <i>Rua Escova</i>. The boy pointed out the eating-house,
and they eagerly peered through the windows. A rough interior,
hazy with tobacco smoke, with people sitting around plain tables,
a bar at the side. The birds had flown.</p>

<p>Lee swore helplessly under his breath. "We're stopped!" he
said.</p>

<p>Johnny spoke up. Luke said: "He says Bosco was going to take
the girl to his room afterwards. He knows that, because he heard
Bosco making a deal with the fellow he lives with to stay out
to-night." Luke laughed. "That's where your money goes!"</p>

<p>Lee clucked his tongue. "Lisbon boys are so precocious!"</p>

<p>"But he doesn't know where Bosco lives."</p>

<p>"I do," said Lee, fishing out his notebook, "it's at
<i>Calcado Poço 7</i>."</p>

<p>Luke and Johnny consulted. "Five minutes' walk from here,"
said Luke. "Johnny knows the way."</p>

<p>"Tell him to lead on!"</p>

<p>They started. Luke glanced anxiously down at the plump little
figure toddling beside him. "Ought to have more help!" he
grumbled.</p>

<p>"Can't stop for that now!" said Lee.</p>

<p>Continuing to the eastward, they struck into the maze of lanes
encircling the principal hill of Lisbon, crowned with its castle.
For a while they climbed a steep <i>calcado</i>, lined with
little shops and full of noise and movement; then Johnny led them
off to the left through a dark and unfrequented lane, and from
that to another and another lane, always darker and more
solitary. They lost all sense of direction. The boy finally
stopped before a door.</p>

<p>"This is it."</p>

<p>It was the basement entrance to a two-storey house. There were
a couple of half windows, flush with the sidewalk, tightly
shuttered. All the windows of the house above were dark. Lee
threw his flashlight on the door. Luke said in surprise:</p>

<p>"This door has already been forced!" He tried it softly.
"Seems to be barricaded inside." He laid his ear against the
crack. "There are people inside," he murmured. "Sounds like a
woman crying."</p>

<p>"See if you can force the door," said Lee.</p>

<p>Putting his shoulder to it, Luke launched his full weight
against the door. It gave way with a sound of rending wood. They
had a glimpse of a dimly lighted interior, then the light went
out. Luke started in.</p>

<p>From behind him came a warning cry from Bosco.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Lee sharply. "Take a look first!"</p>

<p>It was too late. Luke ran down half a dozen steps at the side.
There was a crash, a grunt, a heavy fall on the floor. Somebody
brushed past Lee and got the door closed again. The light went
on, and Lee found himself looking into the barrel of a gun in
Ronald Franklin's hand. Lee's hand was on his own gun, but the
other man had him covered. "Drop it!" said Franklin, and Lee
obeyed. He had no choice.</p>

<p>Luke lay unconscious on the floor beside Lee, bleeding from a
scalp wound. Beyond him a smashed chair showed how he was struck
down. Schoenhut, coming up behind, picked up Lee's gun with a
triumphant grin. The small boy had disappeared. At the other end
of the room there was a bed, with a woman lying on it, sobbing
pitifully. She raised her swollen, stained face for a moment, and
hid it again, weeping afresh. A dozen feet from the bed sat
Bosco, lashed to a chair. His young face was convulsed with rage;
he twisted in his bonds and cursed savagely.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Mappin, you walked right into it!" said Franklin.
"This is almost too good to be true! My cards are on the table
now. Are you surprised?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Search him!" said Franklin to Schoenhut. "Maybe he has
another gun."</p>

<p>Lee had no other gun. Schoenhut took his wallet and dropped it
in his own pocket.</p>

<p>"Take the gun from that guy on the floor," ordered
Franklin.</p>

<p>It was done.</p>

<p>Lee looked about him. A long, sparsely-furnished room, lighted
by a single, unshaded bulb hanging from a cord. There were two
half-windows high up on the street side, and two full-sized
windows on the opposite side with casements standing open.
Through these windows Lee could see lights sparkling below;
evidently the hill went down precipitously on that side. The
house was an ancient one; the floor worn and uneven; the low
beams overhead blackened with soot. At the far end, there was a
rude fireplace with some primitive cooking utensils scattered on
the hearth. A table and four rush-bottomed chairs completed the
furniture. From a line of wooden pegs hung the spare clothes of
the two youths who shared the room. Schoenhut had refastened the
door by bracing a chair against the stair rail.</p>

<p>Franklin was in high spirits. "Push up a chair for Mr.
Mappin," he cried. "There's no necessity for you to tire yourself
out, sir. There's nothing you can do about it. Better make the
best of things. I hope you're not going to make it necessary for
us to tie you up like young Lothario here. Cruel, wasn't it, to
interrupt love's young dream? However, we're not going to hurt
either of them. After we make our getaway, they can continue
their dalliance...How did you find this place?"</p>

<p>"I knew Bosco lived here," said Lee. He took the offered chair
and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"That's right!" said Franklin heartily. "Smoke up! You are a
philosopher! I am sorry that the war has separated us into
different camps. I should like to work under you. I have read
some of your books."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Lee. "If you don't mind," he went on politely,
"I should like to wash the wound on my friend's head, and bind it
up. I have a clean handkerchief that will serve."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, if it will make you feel better," said Franklin.
"Won't make any difference to him. He will never leave this room
again."</p>

<p>There was a bucket of water on the table. Lee carried it to
where Luke lay, and kneeling, washed the blood from his head and
face. Then, rinsing the handkerchief, he tied it around Luke's
head. The wounded man stirred at the touch of the cold water and
opened his eyes. Lee, keeping his body between Luke and the
watching Franklin, touched Luke's lips with his fingers. A look
of understanding came into the young man's eyes, and Lee, bending
closer over him, whispered: "Keep your eyes closed and don't move
until I give the word."</p>

<p>Luke nodded slightly.</p>

<p>Lee made the operation last as long as possible. They never
saw Johnny, he was thinking; if the boy has his wits about him
he'll bring the police.</p>

<p>Franklin finally became impatient. "That's all you can do for
him," he said. "Come and sit in this chair."</p>

<p>Lee obeyed. Franklin had placed a chair on the hearth with its
back towards the fireplace. He had a piece of rope in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I have to tie you up just for a moment," he said, grinning,
"so I can close the door after my friend. He's going out to
telephone for a car."</p>

<p>Lee allowed his hands to be tied behind him. "The grey car?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Franklin laughed. "Sure! the grey car. You know it, don't
you?"</p>

<p>When the two men went up the steps to the door, Lee whispered
to Bosco, who was now beside him:</p>

<p>"Keep your spirits up, Bosco!" He added the words 'Johnny' and
'policia.'"</p>

<p>Bosco shook his head gloomily and answered something which Lee
took to mean that Johnny would not dare apply to the police; that
the police had it in for Johnny, because he shined shoes without
taking out a licence.</p>

<p>The steps went up alongside the wall of the room. After
Schoenhut went out, Franklin again closed the door by jamming a
chair between the door and the rail of the landing.</p>

<p>He returned, stuck another cigarette in Lee's mouth, lighted
it and one for himself. "I'll untie your hands as soon as I let
him in again."</p>

<p>"Give the young fellow a cigarette," said Lee.</p>

<p>"The hell I will," said Franklin coolly. "I offered him one
and he spat in my face."</p>

<p>"So I am to be taken for a ride," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Sure. We've got a nice place in the country now," said
Franklin. "Herr Stengel will be delighted to have a talk with
you."</p>

<p>"You tried that before," said Lee. "What's the use?"</p>

<p>Franklin laughed evilly. "You don't know the half of it, Mr.
Mappin. We've got many other methods of persuasion."</p>

<p>"Let us go together," said Lee with a nod towards Luke.</p>

<p>Franklin shook his head. "He's no further use to us," he said.
"We are going to leave his body here. The kid can explain it as
best he can."</p>

<p>Bosco broke into shrill vituperation. The words were strange
to Lee. Obviously the boy was fishing up the dregs of language to
empty on Franklin's head. The latter got up coolly and slapped
the helpless boy's face, first with one hand, then the other.
Bosco's voice rose higher, and Franklin slapped him again,
harder.</p>

<p>Lee, sickened by the exhibition, cried:</p>

<p>"Stop it, Bosco! Stop it!"</p>

<p>Bosco fell silent and Franklin returned to his chair. The girl
on the bed broke into a renewed wailing, and he shut her up with
a coarse threat.</p>

<p>Presently there was a scratching at the door and Franklin went
and let Schoenhut in. The latter said:</p>

<p>"Car will be here in half an hour."</p>

<p>Franklin untied Lee's hands and he had a chance to stand up
and stamp his feet and swing his arms to restore the circulation.
He went to Luke and dropped beside him.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Luke nodded slightly.</p>

<p>"Whatever happens don't move until I give the word."</p>

<p>Franklin, suddenly suspicious, cried out: "What are you doing
there?" Jumping up, he thrust Lee aside with his knee and bent
over to examine the wounded man. He turned Luke's body over with
his foot, but Luke gave so successful a representation of an
unconscious man that he was satisfied and left him.</p>

<p>Lee, having returned to his chair, was amazed to see a
blackened face suddenly appear outside an open window and vanish
again. Then another face showed and disappeared. Franklin and
Schoenhut saw nothing. Bosco grinned. There was a heavy knocking
at the street door and a young voice crying:</p>

<p>"Bosco!"</p>

<p>"Come in!" shouted Bosco.</p>

<p>Franklin dealt him a savage backhanded blow. Bosco laughed and
continued to shout: "Come in! Come in!" The door was violently
shaken and Schoenhut instinctively ran towards the steps.
Franklin, saying to Lee: "If you move or speak, I'll shoot you,"
followed the other man.</p>

<p>An amazing sight followed. Lee could scarcely believe his
eyes. Figures began coming in over the sills of the two back
windows, one after another, landing silently on the floor, boys
with blackened faces and hands like commandos, each with a grin
that revealed his gleaming teeth. They were mostly well-grown
boys, fifteen or older, but little Johnny was among them, too.
They came too fast for Lee to count.</p>

<p>The two men at the door, hearing a sound, looked behind them.
Seeing what was happening, they ran down the steps, Franklin
pulling his gun. Bosco shouted a warning. Several boys dived
simultaneously for Franklin's legs and he crashed to the floor.
The gun was discharged harmlessly. A boy stamped on Franklin's
wrist; another snatched the gun from his hand. Schoenhut, less
quick-witted than his mate, gaped at the boys clownishly. He was
quickly borne down. Luke Tremaine rolled out of the way of the
melee and, scrambling to his feet, leaned against the wall. He
was fully conscious, but still weak and shaky.</p>

<p>One after another, the boys flung themselves on the heap in
the middle of the floor. There was a furious threshing of bodies
back and forth, arms and legs flying. The Gestapo men were at the
bottom of the heap. Cries, groans, curses and shouts arose from
it, ranging the scale from bass to treble. Along with other
sounds could be heard the hollow thudding of two skulls on the
floor boards. The girl on the bed sat up and watched with
starting eyes. Her hair was coming down, her dress torn at the
neck.</p>

<p>"Quiet! Quiet!" ordered Bosco without the slightest effect.
"Untie me!" he shouted.</p>

<p>A boy detached himself from the heap and, running to Bosco,
untied the knots that bound him to the chair. Snatching up the
rope that had lately bound Lee's hands, the two ran back to get
in the scrimmage, Bosco commanding and imploring his friends to
make less noise. Another boy ran up the steps and, lifting the
chair that held the door, admitted several more boys from the
street. The chair was then jammed back in place.</p>

<p>The heap of boys in the middle of the floor separated and fell
quiet and busy. Nothing but an occasional groan from the Gestapo
men could be heard now. Finally, Franklin and Schoenhut were
hoisted to their feet, half led, half carried to the two chairs
near the hearth, and dropped upon them. Both groggy from the
treatment they had received, their heads rolled on their breasts.
They were lashed to the chairs with their hands behind them. Lee
retrieved his wallet from Schoenhut's breast pocket. He also
recovered their guns. Bosco stood back and spat in Franklin's
face, then slapped him with all his might, first on one cheek,
then the other.</p>

<p>"Not when he's tied up!" remonstrated Lee.</p>

<p>Bosco turned around in pure surprise to protest. It was clear
that he was telling Lee this was what the man had done to him
when he was helpless.</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" said Lee. "But you don't have to act like
the Gestapo."</p>

<p>Bosco didn't get it. He continued passionately to justify
himself, indicating first himself, then the girl. Luke put in
dryly: "Chief, he's telling you what this swine did before we got
here."</p>

<p>Lee, seeing the uselessness of objecting, walked away to the
window while the boys continued to bat their prisoners around.
Certainly, it was no more than the Gestapo men deserved, but it
was a little too much for Lee's nerves. Moreover, he was afraid
the men might die if this was kept up long enough, and he
designed a different fate for them. After a bit, he had an idea
and said:</p>

<p>"Let Luke take the girl home now. This is no sight for a
woman. It will do Luke good to get a breath of fresh air."</p>

<p>Some of the bigger boys, with sly, sidelong glances at the
girl, were inclined to protest; but Bosco had assumed the
leadership and Bosco approved the suggestion. As Luke started to
lead her to the door, she hung back and held out her arms to
Bosco. She was an unattractive girl at the best, dull of face and
shapeless of body, and now in her torn finery she looked like a
caricature. The boys howled with laughter, and Bosco, flushing,
turned his back. Finally Luke and the girl were let out into the
street and the door fastened behind them.</p>

<p>The baiting of the two prisoners continued. Lee looked out of
the window and tried not to hear the sounds behind him. After the
boys had begun to tire of batting the Gestapo men around, Lee
heard a scratching at the door. Whirling around and holding up
his hands for silence, he said:</p>

<p>"Boy's, there's an automobile at the door. Seize it, and bring
the chauffeur inside."</p>

<p>Bosco had enough English to understand this. He translated it
and the mob started for the door, with wide grins in their
blackened faces. It was surprising how softly they could move
when they had an object in it.</p>

<p>The chair was lifted and the door opened. There was an
astonished cry, a brief scuffle, and the boys reappeared dragging
a helpless figure between them. His heels thudded down from step
to step. Bosco darted outside. He reappeared, and the door was
closed and fastened again. Bosco brought the key of the car to
Lee.</p>

<p>The chauffeur's face was new to Lee. He was a small man
wearing a suit that was too big for him; terror had reduced him
to a glibbering state. The boys planted him in a chair and lashed
him to it like the other two. When he saw the state Franklin and
Schoenhut were in, his pleas for mercy were pitiful. The boys
laughed at him and pulled his nose.</p>

<p>"Can you speak English?" demanded Lee.</p>

<p>He dumbly shook his head.</p>

<p>Lee said to Bosco: "I want to find out where this car is
stabled."</p>

<p>Bosco understood. "I make tell," he said, grinning.</p>

<p>Lee walked to the far end of the room, not anxious to witness
the means of persuasion. What they did to the little chauffeur he
never knew. He squealed like a pig, while the boys roared with
laughter. When Lee came back, Bosco had the address written for
him on a dirty scrap of paper. Bosco also handed Lee a key they
had taken from the chauffeur, which he said would open the
garage.</p>

<p>Since Bosco and his friends had no particular feeling against
the chauffeur, they then let him alone. A shrill discussion arose
as to what was to be done with the other two. Lee could not
understand a word of the rapid Portuguese argot. Finally, to his
astonishment, they began to untie the ropes that bound Franklin
to the chair. They laid him on his back on the floor and a boy
fetched the pail of water that was tinged with Luke's blood.
Franklin appeared to be half-conscious.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Lee demanded of Bosco.</p>

<p>Bosco grinned like a young fiend. "We give water cure," he
said. "Make feel better."</p>

<p>"No, by God!" said Lee. "I'm not going to stand for that! He's
a swine all right, but I'm not going to see him tortured! Put him
back on the chair, you devils, and let him alone!"</p>

<p>They couldn't understand Lee's words, but it was clear to all
that he was trying to stop their fun. They protested angrily and
volubly. One boy dipped a cup in the pail and, dropping to his
knees beside Franklin, prepared to administer it.</p>

<p>"Open his mouth," he said.</p>

<p>Lee sent the cup flying out of the boy's hand. "Stop it!" he
cried. "He's had enough."</p>

<p>For a moment, flat rebellion faced Lee. The half-savage young
creatures gathered in a group facing him, scowling and muttering
in an ugly fashion. There were close on twenty of them. Bosco's
face presented a study of conflicting emotions. He was
remembering that Lee was the source of all the good things he and
his pals had enjoyed during the past days.</p>

<p>Finally, Bosco made up his mind and, ranging himself alongside
Lee, started to harangue the boys. Presumably he was reminding
them of what Lee had done for them all. Lee breathed more freely.
He and Bosco lifted Franklin under the arms and, dragging him
back over the floor, dropped him in the chair and made him fast
to it.</p>

<p>The other boys looked on, silent and scowling. One of the
biggest tried to incite the others to rebel. Bosco singled him
out with a forefinger and silenced him with a curse. Lee had a
happy idea. Taking a bill from his wallet and handing it to
Bosco, he said:</p>

<p>"Send a couple of boys out for food and wine. <i>Vinho, Bosco,
pao, carne</i>."</p>

<p>It acted like a charm. Scowls turned into smiles; the tension
relaxed.</p>

<p>Two boys were sent out with the money. The others lay about
the floor singing and slanging each other. There must have been a
store close by, for the messengers soon returned, laden with
loaves of bread, bottles of wine, also meat, cheese and other
things. It was all spread out on the table and the boys gathered
around wolfing the food and passing the bottles from hand to
hand. In a twinkling Lee had become the prince of good fellows.
Lee glanced at his watch surreptitiously. It lacked a few minutes
of ten.</p>

<p>Lee was the first to hear the distant sound of the police
sirens. His heart began to beat fast. One by one the others heard
it, and mouths stopped chewing. All knew what that sound meant.
It drew closer and louder, and a look of fear appeared in the
boys' faces. The approach of the time-honoured enemy! The sirens
stopped a little way off, but presently, through the shutters on
the street side, they heard unmistakable sounds of a crowd
gathering outside. A whispered word went from mouth to mouth:
"<i>Policia</i>!"</p>

<p>There was a pounding on the door. Lee silently pointed to the
open windows. Pausing only to sweep the table bare, the boys went
out over the sills as silently as they had entered, clutching the
bread and the wine under their jackets. All one could hear was a
soft thudding as they dropped on the ground outside. It was as
silent and as swift as a flight of birds. In an instant they were
gone.</p>

<p>There was a renewed pounding on the door, and Luke's voice
calling: "Chief! Chief!"</p>

<p>"Coming!" said Lee blandly. He scampered up the steps and,
lifting the chair, let them in: four policemen, followed by Luke.
Lee shut the door in the faces of the populace, and dropped the
chair back in place.</p>

<p>Luke looked around him with a smile. He guessed what had
happened. "Inspector da Gama will follow shortly," he said dryly.
"He was attending a party at the Chinese Legation."</p>

<p>Lee, with Luke's assistance, described the situation briefly
to the officer. "This is the room of a young man who is employed
by me. He is known by the name of Bosco. These
men"&mdash;pointing to the helpless three&mdash;"are agents of
the Gestapo. They followed Bosco and his girl here, tied them up
and mistreated them. Another boy rounded up Bosco's friends,
brought them here and released Bosco and tied up the Gestapo men
in their places."</p>

<p>"What has become of these boys?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"When they heard the police approaching, Senhor, they went out
of the window."</p>

<p>The policemen laughed. "Can you identify the boys,
Senhor?"</p>

<p>"Only Bosco, the one employed by me."</p>

<p>"Where's the girl?"</p>

<p>"I sent her home."</p>

<p>"How did you get in this mess, Senhor?"</p>

<p>"I was on my way here with my secretary to warn Bosco that the
men were laying for him. But they got here first."</p>

<p>When the policeman's questions became too searching, Lee
merely suggested that they wait for the Inspector.</p>

<p>Inspector da Gama presently arrived, bringing a couple of
additional men, these two in plain clothes. Lee told him the
story in greater detail. In conclusion he said, pointing to
Schoenhut and Franklin:</p>

<p>"These two men are implicated in the murder of William Miller.
I can produce the evidence to prove it. I have no charge against
the third man, but as he is a chauffeur for the Gestapo, I
suggest that he had better be detained as a witness."</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded.</p>

<p>Lee continued: "You have said from the beginning that you
would act as soon as I could present you with a case. It is
almost complete."</p>

<p>"I stand by that," said the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Da Gama," Lee continued in a lower voice: "Schoenhut is the
local chief of the Gestapo. Are you man enough to lock him
up?"</p>

<p>The Inspector looked startled. "It will cause an uproar,
Senhor. The Embassy may force us to release him. High politics
are outside my department."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Lee. "If you are forced to release
him, that won't be your fault. All I ask is that you let me know
in advance, so he can't escape us altogether."</p>

<p>"Senhor, I give you my personal assurance that you shall be
notified in advance."</p>

<p>They shook hands on it. Lee handed the Inspector the address
of the Gestapo garage and the key to it. "It will help us both,
Inspector, if you will put seals on this building until I have a
chance to search it. I hope to find additional evidence of great
value there."</p>

<p>"I will not only seal it, Senhor, I will put a guard on the
building until to-morrow." The Inspector jerked his head toward
the three captives. "Take them out to the car," he ordered.</p>

<p>As Ronald Franklin was being led out, he held back in front of
Luke. "You think you're quite a fellow, don't you, Lady-Killer?"
he sneered. "Taking my girl and all that. She doesn't mean a
thing to me. She never did. She was nothing but a useful tool.
Now that her usefulness to me is ended, you're welcome to
her&mdash;<i>if you can find her</i>!" He went out laughing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p class="first">LEE and Luke were driven to the <i>Lisboa
Palace</i> in the Gestapo car by a policeman. Franklin's words
rankled in Luke's breast.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is just a bit of German frightfulness," suggested
Lee.</p>

<p>"It must be more than that," said Luke. "It is clear that he
knows she has betrayed him to us."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. He might have been trying a shot in the
dark. From your face, he knew that he had hit something. That's
why he laughed."</p>

<p>In order to allay Luke's anxiety, Lee had their driver stop
before a tobacconist's, and Luke went in to telephone the
<i>Victoria Hotel</i>. He returned gloomier than ever.</p>

<p>"Kate went out an hour ago and has not returned. A private car
called for her," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't despair!" said Lee.</p>

<p>When they entered their own hotel, the porter handed Lee a
note addressed in an angular feminine hand. Since it was on
<i>Lisboa Palace</i> paper, it must have been written right there
in the hotel.

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Mappin</span>:

<p class="letter">I cannot be sure whether or not Ronnie has
found me out. When he left me he was more than usually
affectionate and that has aroused my suspicions. A while ago he
called up to say I must carry a message to the Chief&mdash;he did
not name him. He said there was no telephone in the house where
the Chief was stopping, and that was why I must go to him. The
message was that Ronnie had received a call for help from "S" and
therefore he could not come out as expected. He expected to come
an hour or two later, and might perhaps bring guests. When I
asked Ronnie where the house was, he said he was sending a car to
take me there, and the driver knew the directions.</p>

<p class="letter">I realise that if Ronnie does smell a rat it is
dangerous for me to go this expedition; on the other hand, if I
defy him, it would end my usefulness to you. I don't want to risk
that. So I told him I would go, and shortly afterwards the car
called for me.</p>

<p class="letter">Luckily, the driver of this car is a stupid
fellow, and by making out that I was afraid he might lose his way
in the dark, I tricked him into telling me where he was taking
me. It's up the main north road and through Campo Grande to
Lumiar. Beyond the town we take the second road to the west (that
is second to the left) and after two miles a road to the north
(right-hand side) marked by a tall eucalyptus tree shattered at
the top by lightning. Half a mile up this road, at a spot where
there is a wayside shrine, a stony track leads off to the west
(left again) and the house we are seeking is at the end of this
track. It is an ancient villa in the Manoeline style, pretty
badly run down.</p>

<p class="letter">I hope you will approve of what I am doing.
Give my best to Luke.</p>

<p class="letter">In haste,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Kate</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>"Oh God!" groaned Luke, running his fingers through his
hair.</p>

<p>"Call up José at the garage," said Lee crisply. "Tell him to
pick up Affonso and to get here as quick as he can. Both men
should be armed and both bring flashlights."</p>

<p>Luke presently reported that José was starting
immediately.</p>

<p>"Now call up the Ministry of Police and tell da Gama what we
have learned."</p>

<p>Inspector da Gama, Luke was told, after having locked up his
prisoners, had returned to the party at the Chinese Legation.
Luke requested his clerk to get hold of him as quickly as
possible, and to say that Mr. Mappin had a matter of the utmost
importance to communicate, and would the Inspector please remain
within call until he heard from Mr. Mappin.</p>

<p>In a few minutes there was a call from the hotel bureau to say
that Mr. Mappin's car was waiting. Before setting out, they
called the Ministry of Police again. Inspector da Gama had not
returned.</p>

<p>The shabby little car with José and his three passengers sped
up the Avenida and on to the North out of the city. The taxi had
been overhauled at Lee's expense and was in first-rate mechanical
condition. Affonso supplied what conversation there was.</p>

<p>"We don't know how many men there may be waiting in this
house. It doesn't matter. I am ready. It is lucky that José found
me at home. The little fellow is brave but he lacks weight. I,
Affonso, am afraid of nothing!"</p>

<p>In Lumiar they stopped again to telephone, and Lee had the
satisfaction of getting da Gama on the wire. He quickly explained
the situation, and the Inspector said:</p>

<p>"I'll follow you as soon as I can get a few men together. I
shan't be more than half an hour behind you."</p>

<p>"A lot can happen in half an hour," said Lee grimly.</p>

<p>Owing to Kate's explicit directions they had no difficulty
with the road. Five minutes beyond the town they turned to the
left, and a couple of miles further the shattered eucalyptus tree
marked the road to the north. Opposite the roadside shrine, with
its bunch of faded flowers, they turned into a stony track which
climbed steeply. It was a clear, still night with a sky full of
stars. A dozen miles to the south glowed the lights of
Lisbon.</p>

<p>When the dark mass of the ancient villa rose above them
against the stars, Lee ordered José to stop. The track here ran
between low stone walls, and while José's car rested in the
middle, there was no room for another to pass.</p>

<p>"You stay with the car, José," said Lee. "They might give us
the slip. If they come this way, sound your horn and fire a shot
in the air."</p>

<p>Lee, Luke and Affonso continued to ascend the road. The
ornamental grounds of the villa, having been neglected for years,
had grown up like a jungle. Yet a tree which had fallen across
the road had been chopped in two and carried to one side, showing
that the road was used. The villa itself, a long, rectangular
building with a balustraded roof, was built on a terrace above.
As they drew closer, they saw that it was designed like a
fortress, having no entrances in the outer wall. The outside
windows were very small, and too high from the ground to be
reached without ladders. No spark of light showed anywhere. It
was like a palace of the dead.</p>

<p>The road brought them to an elaborately ornamented, arched
entrance leading to an interior patio or court. It was closed by
a massive iron grill, which let down from the top like a
portcullis. The three men surveyed this formidable barrier in
dismay. A big bell hung close to the gate with a rope dangling
from it.</p>

<p>"If we rang the bell, they would think it was their folks
coming back and come down and open up," suggested Affonso
hopefully.</p>

<p>Lee shook his head. "If they did come to the gate, they
wouldn't open it until they had identified us. All we would gain
would be the pleasure of looking at them through the bars."</p>

<p>Affonso cast his eyes upward. "It could be climbed," he said.
"There is room at the top for a man to squeeze through."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Luke, "but in that case we'd have to leave the
Chief outside."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," said Lee sharply. "If it can be
climbed, I can make shift to climb it, too."</p>

<p>Affonso climbed with no special difficulty and let himself
down on the other side. "There is a winch for hauling it up," he
reported in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Don't touch it!" warned Lee. "I'm sure it hasn't been oiled
in years. The screech of the iron would wake the dead."</p>

<p>"Chief, if you're determined to try it, you go before me,"
said Luke.</p>

<p>It was many a year since Lee had done any climbing. There were
plenty of protuberances on the ornamental grill to afford
footholds. He painfully hauled himself up a few inches at a time,
Luke close beside him, ready to lend a hand. Nobody ever knew
what the effort cost Lee. He made the top at last, and paused to
recover his breath. Going down on the inside was easier.</p>

<p>Presently the three of them were standing together in the
arched, tunnel-like passage leading to the interior court. Lee
curiously examined the rusty apparatus for raising the gate.</p>

<p>"It would take two men to work that," he said.</p>

<p>A small door opened off the passage with a window beside it.
Lee opened the door and cast his light around the small, bare
chamber within. It had no connection with the rest of the
house.</p>

<p>"Porter's lodge or guard room," said Lee. "Come on!"</p>

<p>Architects and sculptors had lavished their art on the inside
face of the building. There was a covered passage or arcade all
around the court. The main rooms, projecting overhead, were
carried on a series of slender arches, decorated with stone
carvings as delicate as lace. Every window, every balcony, seemed
to flower in stone. A strange, beautiful, silent place in the
starlight, the only sign of human occupancy was a dim light
showing behind the middle three of the tall windows looking down
on the court from the left.</p>

<p>"At any rate," murmured Lee, "there doesn't appear to be an
army quartered here."</p>

<p>In the middle of the court rose a fantastically decorated
fountain, dry now; the driveway encircled it. Some of the
convoluted balustrades were broken, the statues thrown down, the
planting was running riot; still it was obvious an effort had
been made to put this part of the villa in order. In all the
weird scene, the strangest object was a modern motor-car,
standing abandoned in the driveway.</p>

<p>Pointing to the car, Lee whispered to Luke: "If the key is in
the switch, bring it; if not, cut the wires."</p>

<p>Luke opened the car door noiselessly. He returned with the
key.</p>

<p>Under the arcade they searched for a means of entrance to the
villa. All the windows of the lower floor opening on the arcade
had shutters closed and barred from within. In the middle of this
side under the arcade, they came to a great door studded with
nails. This appeared to be the main entrance. It was locked. Near
the rear of the same side there was a smaller door, also locked.
A complete circuit of the arcade revealed that every door was
locked and every window shuttered.</p>

<p>Baffled for the moment, they backed into the driveway and
gazed up at the three dimly-lighted windows. One of the
elaborately carved stone balconies ran along outside these tall
casements, but the casements themselves were shut. While they
looked, they heard a muffled cry from the room within; a
dreadful, faint sound in the stillness.</p>

<p>"Oh God!" groaned Luke.</p>

<p>Lee clapped a hand over his mouth. "Quiet, for God's sake!" he
said in Luke's ear. "If they hear your voice, they'll kill
her!"</p>

<p>Luke shook as if seized by an ague. "The brutes! The brutes!"
he groaned.</p>

<p>"Keep your wits about you!" urged Lee. "Run to the gate and
stick your arm through, and ring the bell. Ring it twice, then
pause, then twice again, pause and twice more. That's their
signal."</p>

<p>Luke disappeared in the darkness. Presently the sound of the
bell clanged out; three measured double strokes. There were no
further cries from the house.</p>

<p>Luke returned. The three men pressed forward under the arcade
and flattened themselves against the wall beyond the door. They
heard the sounds of bolts being withdrawn inside. The door swung
in, letting out a shaft of light, and two men emerged. The light
revealed the broad, squat figures of Albrecht Stengel and the
tall, broad-shouldered Scarface. Lee pressed Luke's hand.</p>

<p>The two hastened away in the direction of the gate. When they
had passed out of hearing, Lee said: "They have no servants here
or they would not have gone to the gate themselves."</p>

<p>Lee, Luke and Affonso slipped through the open door and,
softly closing it, worked the great bolts across. They found
themselves in a monumental stair hall with stone floor, stone
walls and vaulted ceiling. Electric lights had been installed in
this part of the villa. A broad, curving stair led upward. They
ran up. Opening off the landing at the top was a great pair of
carved oaken doors to the left; another to the right. A line of
light showed under the left-hand doors; they were locked, but the
great key stood in the lock; they had only to turn it and
enter.</p>

<p>A long, nobly proportioned chamber faced them, empty except
for some temporary objects; several cots with tumbled bedding,
chairs, a folding table. Opposite the tall windows was a row of
smaller windows in the outside wall of the villa. Kate lay
stretched on the floor of the room with her face hidden. She
supposed it was her tormentors returning and did not look up.
Luke murmured her name.</p>

<p>"Kate!"</p>

<p>She jerked up her head and Lee saw such joy break as he had
never before seen in a human face. Luke ran and gathered her in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he demanded in an agonised voice.</p>

<p>Kate shook her head. "No! But I had given up all hope!"</p>

<p>Luke carried her to one of the cots, and sat holding her as if
he would never let her go.</p>

<p>Lee attempted to open one of the casements. He had to call on
Affonso for help before he could move the long-closed frame. He
stole out on the balcony to listen, taking care to keep below the
balustrade.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the two Gestapo men coming back under the
arcade. Stengel, in his hoarse, guttural voice, was scolding the
other. Suddenly the voice was cut off in the middle of a
sentence. They had come to the door and found it closed. Lee
smiled to himself. Stengel exploded in wrath; shook the door and
kicked it, shouted for Kate. Remembering that he had locked her
in above, he suddenly fell quiet, as if afraid.</p>

<p>"Hello, Herr Stengel," said Lee in German. It was imprudent
perhaps, but the temptation was too great.</p>

<p>Stengel apparently started to run out from under the arcade
and was dragged back by the other man. "He'll shoot!" warned
Scarface.</p>

<p>Stengel stood back out of sight and cursed Lee from a heart
that seemed about to burst with rage. Lee enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"I'm learning some new German words," he said.</p>

<p>At length Stengel succeeded in controlling his rage. "Well,
you've trapped yourself nicely," he said, attempting to laugh.
"How the hell do you think you're going to get out?"</p>

<p>"I can stand it if you can," said Lee.</p>

<p>"How many men have you got up there?"</p>

<p>"More than you have."</p>

<p>Stengel laughed again. "My friends will be here directly."</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Lee, "but the friends you are expecting are
lodged in jail. That is to say, Schoenhut and the man who calls
himself Ronald Franklin. The newsboy was too much for him."</p>

<p>"You're a liar!" said Stengel.</p>

<p>There was a silence from below. Lee pictured them with their
heads close together, whispering. Then Stengel's voice rose
again:</p>

<p>"Are you there, Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Right here."</p>

<p>A new and silkier note came into the German's voice. "Look
here, we've reached a deadlock. We can't get in and you can't get
out. Let us declare a truce."</p>

<p>Lee smiled to himself. "All right. What are your terms?"</p>

<p>"We're willing to let you leave without hindrance and take the
girl, if you'll return the key to our car."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Lee. "As an evidence of good faith, throw
your guns up in the balcony."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence below. "That would be too one-sided,"
objected Stengel. "You could shoot us on your way
out."</p>

<p>"Remove part of the firing mechanism, and we'll do the same
before we throw our guns down."</p>

<p>"Agreed! Wait there until I fix the guns."</p>

<p>Stengel's voice was as false as hell, and Lee knew that this
offer was preliminary to some trick. Stengel was playing for
time. Lee crept back through the window into the big room. He
said: "I'm satisfied they can't force that door at the foot of
the stairs, but there may be some way in at the rear. Come with
me, Affonso, and we'll explore. Luke, lock that door at the end
of the room and watch the balcony. If you get in a jam, fire your
gun."</p>

<p>Beyond the long room lay another of the same size. This was a
banqueting room; the long table was still in place, no other
furniture. They proceeded through the dark rooms, flashlights in
hand. Beyond lay a serving pantry. There were no locks on the
doors between these rooms. From the pantry a stairway led down to
an immense, stone-paved kitchen. There was another heavy, bolted
door from the kitchen to the arcade, and a row of shuttered
windows.</p>

<p>Lee opened a casement and laid an ear against the crack
between the shutters to listen. Outside he heard little sounds
like mice behind a wainscot, and smiled. He had guessed right.
Retreating a few steps, he flattened himself against the wall and
stood with searchlight and gun ready. In a few minutes, there was
a crash that splintered the shutters. Lee stood waiting while
they pulled away the pieces of broken wood. Then suddenly he
flashed his light alongside the wall just as a leg came over the
window sill. Lee fired, and the leg was jerked out of sight.</p>

<p>A long silence followed. Finally a round bull's-eye of light
was thrown into the room from outside. It searched around the
floor, but Lee and Affonso were safely out of its range. It was
shut off, and the silence and darkness closed in again, hard on
the nerves. Lee stole forward to the wrecked window and, without
exposing himself, cast his light outside. It did not succeed in
drawing their fire, and as the moments of silence accumulated,
Lee felt that the men were no longer there.</p>

<p>Far away two shots were fired, so close together they were
almost one. Lee ordered Affonso to keep watch across the window
with his light. He ran upstairs and back through the rooms as
fast as he could go. The great room where he had left Luke and
Kate was dark now. His heart sank. He could hear a suppressed
sobbing. He hesitated to switch on his light.</p>

<p>"Luke!" he said.</p>

<p>Luke's voice came to him, resonant and full, through the dark:
"All okay, Chief!"</p>

<p>Lee's heart rebounded with joy. Switching on his light, he saw
Luke lying on the floor looking around the open casement. Across
the room lay Kate, trying to stifle her hysterical sobs.</p>

<p>"I got one of them," said Luke.</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"Stengel."</p>

<p>"Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead as mutton."</p>

<p>"Well..." said Lee, "I had hoped to give him a more public
execution."</p>

<p>"They placed a ladder at the end of the balcony where I could
not see it," Luke went on. "And Stengel snaked along the balcony
to the open window. The first I knew of it was when his head and
arm appeared at the window. We fired almost simultaneously, but
he missed and my bullet found its mark. The ladder is still in
place. I couldn't push it over without exposing myself too much.
I have Stengel's gun."</p>

<p>Lee took Luke's place at the window. "Go to Kate," he
said.</p>

<p>"She's been through too much to-day," said Luke
apologetically. "Her nerves are completely shot."</p>

<p>"She's got reason enough," said Lee.</p>

<p>He flashed his light briefly out on the balcony. Stengel lay
sprawling on his back. Luke's bullet had caught him in the middle
of the forehead, and there was no doubt that he was dead. Death
revealed him with hideous clarity as the brute he was; bulldog;
butcher.</p>

<p>Lee switched off his light. There was a long silence in the
dark room, with faint starshine showing through the windows. No
sound of movement reached Lee's ears from below. Kate's sobbing
had quieted. Finally Luke said:</p>

<p>"What's the next move, Chief? I know you won't be satisfied
with just lying here waiting for Scarface to attack."</p>

<p>"No," said Lee. "And neither will Scarface sit still and wait
for us to make the first move...Scarface is the man who killed
William Miller, and we must take him alive. I have been trying to
dope out how his mind would work. Come and take my place here. I
have an idea."</p>

<p>Lee went to one of the smaller windows in the outside wall of
the villa and, opening the casement and the shutter outside, cast
his light on the ground below. "Eighteen feet, I should say," he
said. "At any rate, not more than twenty. There are plenty of
these thin blankets; let's knot them together and make a getaway
out of the window."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" breathed Kate.</p>

<p>"What about Scarface?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten him," said Lee, smiling. "...Come, Kate,
help me with the blankets."</p>

<p>The distraught girl was delighted to have work for her hands
to do. They laid the flashlight on the floor to give them light
and gathered up the blankets. Luke watched and listened at the
open window.</p>

<p>When the blankets were knotted together, corner to corner, and
the knots thoroughly tested, Lee hung his rope from the window.
It was long enough. He said:</p>

<p>"I will go now and fetch Affonso."</p>

<p>In the kitchen, Affonso reported that he had neither seen
anything nor heard anything since he had been left on watch. He
and Lee hastened back to the big room above.</p>

<p>They folded one of the cots, tied the end of the rope firmly
around the middle, and placed the cot across the window frame.
Lee was the first to descend. The night air was fragrant with
cedar; the cool, starry sky like a benediction. The rope was
hauled up again, and tied around the body of Stengel. Luke and
Affonso lowered him to Lee, who untied the rope and dragged the
body out of the way. Kate was then lowered into Lee's arms; Luke
and Affonso descended after her. Affonso, according to
instructions, had turned on the lights in the big room before
climbing out of the window.</p>

<p>When they were reunited on the ground, Luke and Affonso picked
up the body of Stengel to carry it towards the road. Kate, once
she was safe out of that house of terror, was herself again. She
accompanied the two men, and Lee was left to watch the dangling
rope.</p>

<p>Lee's instructions were: "It is time for Inspector da Gama to
get here. If you meet him, tell him to make a noise like the
police, sirens, horns, etc. Tell him to send his men to the gate
of the villa and jangle the bell. Luke and Affonso are to come
back to me as quick as they can."</p>

<p>Lee settled himself behind a thick clump of cedar to watch the
window above, and the dangling rope. After a while, the lights in
the big room went out, and his heart beat faster. Scarface was in
there. He thought a shadow darkened the open window, but could
not be sure. Then Scarface's light flashed on. It searched the
ground all around the foot of the rope. Lee was well hidden.</p>

<p>Scarface, still full of suspicion, would not trust himself to
the rope. He snapped off his light and withdrew inside the
window. Darkness again took possession of the scene.</p>

<p>After another lapse of time, Lee heard the welcome hooting of
sirens near by. Judging from the sounds, the police car had been
halted in the road by José's car. José then moved aside to let it
pass, for the sirens were next heard around at the gate.
Meanwhile, Luke and Affonso joined Lee behind the cedars. The
great bell at the gate of the villa clanged imperiously.</p>

<p>"That sound will put the fear of God into him," murmured
Lee.</p>

<p>Scarface came back to the window above and cast his light
down. But still he hesitated and went back. The bell set up a
renewed clangour, and the clumsy, knotted rope began to shake.
Scarface was climbing out of the window. They watched the dark,
swaying shadow slowly descend against the paler wall of the
villa.</p>

<p>The three men crept noiselessly to the foot of the rope. The
swaying Scarface, fully occupied in lowering himself, could not
see what was immediately under him. If he had seen, he could not
have drawn a gun. When he was near the ground, he sensed that
there was somebody below him; his hold of the rope loosened and
he dropped. Instantly they got him. Scarface was a powerful man,
but so were Luke and Affonso. Turning him over on his face, they
tied his wrists behind him with a handkerchief. Luke held a
light. Scarface's hands, as usual, were gloved. Commanded to get
up and walk, they marched him around to the gate of the
villa.</p>

<p>Da Gama's men stared. A couple of them had already gone over
the top of the gate and were busy hoisting it from within with a
screeching of rusty iron. Scarface was handed over to the care of
da Gama, and the handkerchief exchanged for handcuffs.</p>

<p>"There were only two members of the gang here," said Lee.
"You'll find the house empty."</p>

<p>Da Gama congratulated him. "I'll search the premises anyhow,"
he said. "There will be evidence."</p>

<p>"You can get in the house," said Lee, "by a ladder to the
balcony outside the main chamber, or by a smashed window in the
kitchen. Pull in the rope and lock the windows in the great room.
Take careful note of everything you see, as I shall need your
evidence to corroborate my story of what happened. Here's the
switch key to their car that is standing in the court...There's
only one more thing I want you to see, Inspector...Hold out your
hands!" Lee commanded Scarface.</p>

<p>Luke threw a light on the man's hands, and with his free hand
pulled off the left-hand glove. The end joint of Scarface's third
finger was missing.</p>

<p>Da Gama exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"Notice," said Lee, "that the glove finger is stuffed out to
hide the disfigurement. With your permission, I'll keep the
gloves for the moment...Number seven and last," said Lee to Luke.

<p><br>
LATE as it was, when they got back to Lisbon, Lee would not go
to bed until he had called up the United States Legation. He
insisted upon having his friend the Minister awakened, and gave
him a brief account of what had happened.</p>

<p>"Full particulars to-morrow," said Lee. "They are quite
amusing. Will you do me the kindness to cable Westerholm on the
island of Fayal to-night, and instruct him to turn Pedro Chavez
and his passengers back to Lisbon, the moment he arrives."</p>

<p>"Right!" said the Minister.</p>

<p>"Sorry to cause so much bother at this time of night," Lee
continued, "but a showdown cannot be delayed for long now. Will
you also request the British Ambassador to ask the authorities at
Gibraltar to return the prisoner Algadao to Lisbon at the
earliest possible moment."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it," said the Minister.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p class="first">A WEEK passed. Bosco reported that all members
of the Gestapo had abandoned the <i>Hotel Excelsior</i> and the
house was closed. In the course of the week, Algadao from one
direction was mysteriously set ashore in Lisbon, and from another
direction the Rosado brothers, Luiz and Antonio. Lee handed them
over to the police. Every day Inspector da Gama urged Lee to
bring charges against these and the other prisoners he was
holding.</p>

<p>"You can depend upon it," said da Gama, "the Embassy of a
certain country unfriendly to yours, is exceedingly busy in the
matter. Representations have been made to the chief persons in my
government, and I must take action of one sort or another."</p>

<p>Each day Lee begged for twenty-four hours more.

<p><br>
VERY late one night, when Lee was preparing for bed, the
telephone rang. Luke was already in bed, and Lee answered the
call. A fresh young male voice, speaking Portuguese with an
accent, asked:</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Mappin?"</p>

<p>"Si, Senhor," said Lee.</p>

<p>"This is Jaime Barreto. Do you remember the Spanish boy?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do!" cried Lee, forgetting his Portuguese. "Wait
a minute until I call my secretary. He will understand you
better."</p>

<p>Luke was quickly hauled to the telephone. Lee stood by.</p>

<p>Said Luke: "He apologises for disturbing you at such a late
hour. He says he couldn't set out from his father's house until
after dark, and must be back there before daylight. He wants to
see you on a matter of great importance."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"He asks if you will meet him at the north side of the
<i>Roçio</i> beyond the National Theatre. He will be waiting
there in his father's car."</p>

<p>"What does he want to see me about?"</p>

<p>"That he won't tell me because, he says, he is afraid somebody
might be listening in." Luke covered the transmitter with his
hand. "Is it safe, Chief?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Lee. "If it is really Jaime Barreto, I would
trust that boy anywhere. If it's a crook, he would hardly appoint
the <i>Roçio</i> for a meeting; the most brilliantly lighted spot
in town, with people passing back and forth all night."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Luke. "What shall I tell him?"</p>

<p>"Tell him we'll be there in ten minutes."</p>

<p>Jaime Barreto's little old car waited beside the curb beyond
the National Theatre, and the slim Spanish boy stood beside it,
looking for them. Lee and Luke shook his hand warmly. He opened
the rear door.</p>

<p>"There's a friend inside," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>The light revealed a figure on the back seat, a frank,
smiling, young face, an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Niebuhr!" breathed Lee in astonishment.</p>

<p>The young German laid a finger on his lips as he drew Lee in.
Luke climbed after. Niebuhr said to Jaime: "Drive around the
Square two or three times. We won't keep Heir Mappin more than
ten minutes. We must be getting back!"</p>

<p>"The danger is not so great to-night," said Lee. "You could
have driven right up to the hotel. Stengel is dead and most of
the local Gestapo's in jail!"</p>

<p>"Still, I must be careful," said Niebuhr, smiling. "Every Nazi
carries my picture in his wallet&mdash;not because he loves me,
but because he hopes to win the reward."</p>

<p>"They told us," said Lee, "that both you and the boy had been
shot on the mountainside."</p>

<p>"A typical Gestapo lie," said Niebuhr. "They never got near
us."</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"To Berlin and back."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Lee. "You have made that dangerous journey
twice more!"</p>

<p>"Each time I make it, it is a little easier, a little quicker.
I know the ropes. I find new friends to help me along."</p>

<p>The car was slowly encircling the <i>Roçio</i>. Taxis still
whisked here and there, groups moved along the sidewalks, the
sound of singing and the plucking of guitars was heard; Lisbon
never went to bed. The passing lights flashed on and off in
Niebuhr's fresh-coloured, handsome face. Lee, deeply moved by his
grave smile, was impelled to throw an arm around the young
fellow's shoulders.</p>

<p>"What brought you back to Lisbon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You!" said Niebuhr. "You told me that if I could secure
certain papers for you, it might have the effect of shortening
the war. What greater incentive could a man have than that? Even
to shorten it a single day! As soon as I arrived in Berlin, I
applied myself to getting what you wanted and I was
successful."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" cried Lee.</p>

<p>Niebuhr passed over a raincoat. "The papers are sewed inside
the lining of this coat," he said. "I couldn't carry away the
originals. It would have meant discovery and death for the friend
and fellow-worker who got them for me. These are photostat
copies."</p>

<p>"Just as good," said Lee.</p>

<p>"There was nobody in the world I could trust to carry them
across Europe," Niebuhr said simply, "so I brought them
myself."</p>

<p>"I hope that the use I make of them will justify you," said
Lee gravely.</p>

<p>"Now we must start back," said Niebuhr. "Let Mr. Mappin out at
the spot where we picked him up, Jaime."</p>

<p>"So soon!" said Lee. "Can't you stop and rest? Won't to-morrow
do as well for the return journey? Luke and I will hide you
close."</p>

<p>Niebuhr shook his head. "My time-table has been carefully
worked out. In Bajadoz a man is waiting with a car who will drive
me to the French border."</p>

<p>"You and the boy need food," protested Lee, "and a bottle of
wine to drink to victory."</p>

<p>"We have food and wine in the car. As soon as we get out of
town I will drive and the boy can sleep."</p>

<p>The car stopped; Luke and Lee got out. Lee clung to Niebuhr's
hand for a moment, hating to let him go.</p>

<p>"Well...good luck, my boy!"</p>

<p>"Good luck! Good luck!" answered Niebuhr. "The sky is already
beginning to lighten in the east."</p>

<p>The little car drove away.

<p><br>
NEXT morning, Inspector da Gama called Lee on the telephone.
"I am afraid you have waited too long," he said gloomily.
"Charges have now been made against you. I am sorry you didn't
bring your charges first. You are required to appear in the
office of the Minister of Police at half-past ten this morning. A
car will be sent to the hotel for you."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Lee. "I shall be ready."</p>

<p>Lee and Luke dressed with care for the occasion. Luke at the
best had a sort of rough and ready good looks, but Lee was turned
out like a little fashion-plate.</p>

<p>The private office of the Minister of Police was a much more
imposing chamber than that allotted to a mere inspector. Several
officers and gentlemen were in attendance, including da Gama and
various secretaries and amanuenses. The Minister, a handsome,
grave man in fashionable civilian costume, greeted Lee and Luke
courteously, waved them to chairs, offered them cigarettes,
started a polite conversation about the United States.</p>

<p>After this had continued for a little, Lee asked courteously:
"May we proceed to business, Your Excellency?"</p>

<p>"We are waiting for the complainant," answered the
Minister.</p>

<p>Very soon the doors were thrown open and an orderly sonorously
announced, "The Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash;" That personage strode
in as if he had swallowed a ramrod, monocle firmly screwed into
place. To-day he was attended by several stooges carrying stuffed
brief cases. The Prince bowed stiffly to the Minister, looked
over the heads of everybody else in the room, and condescended to
take the chair that was offered to him. His stooges sat in a row
behind him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lee noted that one of the Portuguese attendants
unobtrusively opened a door behind the Minister's chair, and left
it standing a few inches ajar. From that he judged that an even
more exalted personage than the Minister of Police was listening
to the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Senhor Mappin," said the Minister, "before we begin I should
inform you that this hearing is of a quasi-judicial nature, and
you are therefore entitled to be represented by an advocate if
you so desire."</p>

<p>"I thank Your Excellency," said Lee. "To me it does not appear
to be necessary at this juncture. As to the future, I will be
guided by what transpires here this morning."</p>

<p>"Very good, Senhor. Firstly, you are charged with being
responsible for the death of Albrecht Stengel, a subject of
Germany."</p>

<p>Lee looked at Luke, and Luke arose: "By your favour,
Excellency, may I say at once that it was I who shot Albrecht
Stengel; thus I may save time."</p>

<p>His Excellency was surprised by this prompt confession. "So!"
he said, stroking his chin. "Was it by the order of Senhor
Mappin?"</p>

<p>"No, Excellency. Senhor Mappin was not present. I shot Stengel
because he had a pistol levelled at my head. A second later he
fired. We have a witness to the actual shooting, Your Excellency.
Also, Senhor Mappin and another man, a citizen of Lisbon, were
within hearing and can testify that the two shots were fired
almost simultaneously. Senhor Mappin was provoked with me when he
found the man was dead."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Minister with undisguised curiosity.</p>

<p>"Because it was his wish to see Stengel brought to trial."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Minister, stroking his chin. "...Well, let that
go for the moment. There is another charge against Senhor Mappin.
He is accused of having brought about the death of William
Miller, also a subject of Germany."</p>

<p>Lee and Luke looked at each other in purest surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" murmured Lee. To the Minister he said:
"Is the man who makes this accusation present, your
Excellency?"</p>

<p>"He is not," said the Minister dryly&mdash;"for a very good
reason...A deposition will be read." He looked at the German
party. One of the stooges fished a paper out of his brief-case,
and rising, commenced to read. The Minister interrupted him.</p>

<p>"It is in German," he said to Lee. "Shall I have it translated
for you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I speak German," said Lee.</p>

<p>The German read:

<br>

<p class="typewriter">Albrecht Stengel, aged 43, a subject of
Germany, upon being sworn, deposes and says that:</p>

<p class="typewriter">William Miller was known to me for five
years past as a loyal subject of <i>der Führer</i> and for the
same length of time has been employed by me as agent of the
German Intelligence. I was his superior officer. In the United
States there is an organisation known as the Association for
Aiding Anti-Nazis, which is engaged in subversive activities in
Germany, and in neutral countries. Early in 1943, I sent William
Miller to the United States to investigate these people and to
supply me with information that would enable me to block their
underground work in my country. Miller was admitted to the
Association, he won the confidence of the officers, and when the
Association appointed Amos Lee Mappin as their general agent in
Europe with headquarters in Lisbon, William Miller came with him
as his secretary.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Immediately on his arrival in Lisbon,
Miller got in touch with me and with the local office of German
Intelligence, and thus, day by day, we were kept informed of
every move made by Mappin. In some manner unknown to deponent,
Mappin discovered that his secretary was an agent of German
Intelligence. He decoyed Miller to his office at <i>Rua Cachimbo,
23</i>, on the night of September 18th, and there with the
assistance of other persons, foully murdered him. Mappin is what
is called in America a criminologist of long experience. Ever
since the murder he has been engaged with devilish ingenuity in
manufacturing evidence tending to prove that it was other members
of German Intelligence in Lisbon who were guilty of the murder of
their friend and loyal fellow-worker, William Miller.</p>

<p class="typewriter">(Signed) Albrecht Stengel.</p>

<p><br>
Lee laughed a little when the man finished reading.</p>

<p>The Minister was affronted. "This is hardly an occasion for
levity, Senhor Mappin."</p>

<p>Lee apologised. "Stengel is dead, Your Excellency," he
added.</p>

<p>"I am aware of it, Senor. It is the contention of the
complainant that he was killed to prevent him from giving this
evidence. However, fearing such a fate, he had already made his
deposition."</p>

<p>"By your favour, Excellency, he furnishes no evidence, but
only an unsupported statement," said Lee.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to answer it now?" asked the Minister, "or will
you take legal advice?"</p>

<p>"I will answer it now, Excellency."</p>

<p>"I must warn you that anything you say can be used against you
later."</p>

<p>"I am prepared for that, Sir."</p>

<p>While Lee talked, an amanuensis took down his statements.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," he began, "I can easily show that the claim
that William Miller was a loyal agent of the Gestapo is
completely false. Soon after we arrived in Lisbon, I was engaged
in the delicate matter of bringing the famous anti-Nazi author,
Friedrich Erbelding and his family out of Germany, where they had
been persecuted, and in finding transportation for them to the
United States. William Miller assisted me at every step in this
matter. If he was in touch with the Gestapo, why did he not tell
them? The Erbeldings left Portugal on September 13th, five days
before William Miller was murdered. The Germans were making every
effort to stop the Erbeldings, as Inspector da Gama can testify.
As you have no doubt read in the dispatches, Herr Erbelding and
his family have now arrived safely in the United States."</p>

<p>The Minister nodded.</p>

<p>"As to the charge of murder," Lee continued, "that, if Your
Excellency will permit me, is what we call in America a red
herring drawn across the trail. I am prepared to describe to you
exactly how William Miller came to his end. And, furthermore,
every statement I make will be supported by legal evidence."</p>

<p>The Minister signed to Lee to proceed.</p>

<p>"My arrival here in Lisbon," Lee began, "was considered a
menace by the Gestapo. They had not much confidence in Schoenhut,
their local director, and Albrecht Stengel, the famous&mdash;or
infamous&mdash;Butcher of Paris, was sent to Lisbon to deal with
me. Within twenty-four hours of his arrival, he had perfected a
plot to liquidate William Miller, because, it was supposed, I
could not function without him. I was to be put out of the way
later, that is, as soon as they had secured from me information
vital to them concerning our friends in Spain, France,
Switzerland, Germany, also the code by which we communicated with
each other, and so on.</p>

<p>"In addition to Stengel, there were seven men concerned in
this plot, six of whom are now in the hands of the Lisbon police,
while the seventh, known to me as Diehlmann, is a patient in the
<i>Bon Secours Hospital</i> with a broken leg. Stengel's first
act was to plant one Algadao, your prisoner who bears a
Portuguese name but carries a German passport, in the hotel room
adjoining my suite. Algadao had a pass-key made by which he could
enter my room at his pleasure. Early in the evening of September
18th, he entered my suite in my absence and doctored the water
bottle beside my bed with a solution of Duotol, a powerful
soporific, also the water bottle beside William Miller's bed in
the adjoining room."</p>

<p>"What evidence have you against Algadao?" asked the
Minister.</p>

<p>Lee checked it off on his fingers: "(<i>a</i>) A chambermaid
in the <i>Lisboa Palace</i> Hotel will testify that he tricked
her into lending him her pass-key; (<i>b</i>) a respectable
locksmith in the vicinity of the hotel will identify Algadao as
the man for whom he made the pass-key; (<i>c</i>) he left
fingerprints on the necks of both water bottles; (<i>d</i>) his
fingerprints were also found in the room where William Miller was
killed; (<i>e</i>) a bottle containing Duotol tablets was found
in his suitcase subsequent to the murder."</p>

<p>"Proceed," said the Minister.</p>

<p>"The next step was to secure a small covered truck, such as
undertakers use for transporting bodies. The prisoner named
Ronald Franklin was assigned to this task. Franklin, I regret to
say, is a citizen of the United States. He carries a <i>bona
fide</i> United States passport. No doubt he has a German
passport also. If the government of Portugal desires to surrender
him, my government will try him for treason. On the night of
September 18th, he hired such a truck from Cavilho, the well-known
undertaker of West Lisbon, and returned it before morning.
He represented to Senhor Cavilho that it was required for an
innocent prank. Cavilho will testify to this effect. He has
identified Franklin.</p>

<p>"Thus, on the night of September 18th, having thrown Miller
and myself into a profound drugged sleep, the gang entered our
suite. Miller was bound and gagged (in case he should awaken too
soon), laid upon a stretcher, which came with the truck, and
covered with a blanket. Four men carried him out of the hotel by
way of a rear stairway and a service entrance. The watchman at
this entrance was either put out of the way or bribed. He has
disappeared. The truck was waiting to receive the body."</p>

<p>"How do you expect to prove these statements?" asked the
Minister.</p>

<p>"In this manner, Excellency. The stretcher was recovered in
Senhor Cavilho's garage. The truck has been positively
identified, owing to certain peculiarities in the tyres. A guest
in the hotel saw the body being carried through the corridor. He
very naturally supposed that a death had occurred in the hotel,
and that the body was being removed in this secret manner to
avoid distressing the other guests."</p>

<p>"Do you know the identity of the four men who carried the
stretcher?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Diehlmann, the two Rosados, and the prisoner who
was booked by the police under the name of Evart Stahl. Until I
learned his name, I called him Scarface. According to this guest
who saw them, a fifth man led the way through the corridor. This
must have been Algadao."</p>

<p>"Continue, Senhor."</p>

<p>"William Miller, then, was carried to the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i>.
A householder in that street saw the truck standing at the door
of number 23. But not for long. Franklin returned it to its
garage as soon as he could. There is no evidence that Franklin
was present at the scene of the murder. He may have returned to
the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> after returning the truck; in any case,
he is an accessory before the fact.</p>

<p>"They broke into that room in the <i>Rua Cachimbo</i> which I
rented for an office. In the effort to extract information from
William Miller, they cruelly tortured him with irons heated in a
sort of bucket of burning charcoal. This so-called bucket has
been recovered and has been identified by Luke Tremaine, who was
subsequently mistreated by the same gang. That is another story.
The bucket is now in the possession of the police.</p>

<p>"Stengel and Schoenhut were either waiting at the <i>Rua
Cachimbo</i> for the others or they joined them there..."</p>

<p>"You have proof of this, Senhor?"</p>

<p>"As to Schoenhut, absolute proof, Senhor. Although they were
seven against one, Miller succeeded in freeing himself partly and
put up a magnificent struggle. The room was wrecked. Schoenhut
lost his glasses in the melee and they were stepped on and
broken. He neglected to pick up the pieces of glass. I was able
to have them put together and so establish the oculist's
prescription from which they had been made. I am prepared to
prove that Schoenhut sent to an optician on the next day but one,
and ordered a pair of glasses from the same prescription."</p>

<p>"What about Stengel?"</p>

<p>"It is only by inference that I know he was present,
Excellency. He was always present at such scenes of questioning
and torture. That was his specialty."</p>

<p>"I suggest that you avoid drawing inferences, Senhor. Please
continue."</p>

<p>"In the end," said Lee, spreading out his hands, "my poor
friend was stabbed to the heart and left lying there. In the
morning a voice called me on the telephone to say he was waiting
for me in my office."</p>

<p>"Such evidence," said the Minister, "would directly connect
Algadao, Schoenhut and Franklin with the crime. What about the
others you have named?"</p>

<p>"Clutched between the dead man's thumb and forefinger," said
Lee, "I found certain hairs which have been identified under the
microscope as having been pulled from Luiz Rosado's beard.
Antonio Rosado, besides fingerprints, is connected with the crime
by the finding of the false pass-key among his effects. As to
Diehlmann, in the truck used to convey William Miller to the
place where he was killed, I found a jewel, specifically a
bloodstone, which had fallen from a pair of cuff-links that
Diehlmann was wearing."</p>

<p>"You mention fingerprints; what about them?"</p>

<p>"The Gestapo men were either very careless, your Excellency,
or they were unfamiliar with modern methods of detecting crime.
There were fingerprints everywhere about the room where William
Miller was killed. I collected and have preserved full sets and
partial sets, which have been identified as belonging to
Schoenhut, Algadao, the two Rosados, and Diehlmann."</p>

<p>"Not Stengel?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Stengel took no part in the dirty work."</p>

<p>"Not Evart Stahl, or Scarface as you called him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you are not prepared to say who struck the fatal
blow?"</p>

<p>"By your favour, Excellency, I am prepared to say."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Evart Stahl."</p>

<p>"What proof do you offer?"</p>

<p>"Stahl left no fingerprints because it is his habit at all
times to wear gloves, brown cotton gloves. An odd fancy for a man
in hot weather. The reason he does so is to conceal a
disfigurement. He has lost the top joint of the third finger of
his left hand. He keeps this glove finger stuffed out to the end
with cotton. When I examined the body of William Miller, I found
his teeth tightly clenched. Force was required to pry them apart.
Within his mouth I found a scrap of brown material with a seam in
it; in other words, the end of a finger of a cotton glove."</p>

<p>"This is proof that he was present, but not that he stabbed
Miller."</p>

<p>"No, Excellency. I should inform you that I had found the
print of other fingers on the dead man's breast. These were
bloody prints. I did not refer to them as fingerprints in the
usual sense, because they showed none of the lines to be found in
the skin of naked fingers. All revealed an identical texture; it
was that of a cotton material. The knife had been driven to the
hilt in the dead man's body, and considerable strength was
required to withdraw it. I figure that the killer had to place
the fingers of his left hand against the breast to obtain the
necessary leverage....I have the pair of gloves taken from
Stahl's hands the night he was arrested. It is the same pair.
Probably he could obtain no others, so he washed and mended them.
The mended place is apparent..."</p>

<p>The Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash; arose and screwed in his
monocle. "How much more of this nonsense am I expected to listen
to?" he demanded arrogantly. "It is not only false but frivolous!
A torn cotton glove, forsooth! some hairs from a man's beard! Mr.
Minister, I wonder that you are content to listen to such a
farrago. All it amounts to is a confession that the witness has
shamefully abused your country's neutrality. Please do me the
credit of remembering that I warned you that he was tricky and
ingenious. But really, I must say I expected something better!"
He turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>Lee was saying blandly: "I have not quite finished."</p>

<p>The Minister said very politely: "Your Highness, I beg of you,
let the witness finish his story."</p>

<p>Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash; remained standing with a scornful
air, his hand on the back of his chair. He glanced impatiently at
his watch, like a busy man detained against his will.</p>

<p>Lee drew a long envelope from his breast pocket. "These
papers," he said, "contain evidence going back of Albrecht
Stengel in establishing the responsibility for this murder. They
are photostat copies of confidential notes from His Highness,
Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash; to his principal, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs."</p>

<p>The monocle flew out of the Prince's eye. "What!" he cried
furiously.</p>

<p>"The earliest note speaks of my arrival in Lisbon," Lee
continued in a level voice, "complains of Schoenhut's incapacity
and requests that Albrecht Stengel be sent to Lisbon to deal with
the situation. A note of later date reports that William Miller
has been liquidated, and intimates that the Foreign Minister may
expect to hear soon that a similar fate has befallen me. In the
same communication, His Highness speaks of the great expense he
has been put to, and asks for a grant to cover it."</p>

<p>Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash;'s voice broke, rose almost to a
shriek.</p>

<p>"Outrageous! Impudent forgeries! No such notes were every
written!"</p>

<p>"They are written in the Prince's own hand," Lee persisted
without raising his voice. "I am sure there must be many
specimens of it in the Portuguese archives, and I invite
comparison."</p>

<p>The Prince was speechless now.</p>

<p>Lee went on, handing the envelope to the Minister.</p>

<p>"There are a number of other letters which reveal His
Highness' tender regard for the neutrality of the Republic of
Portugal."</p>

<p>The Prince, who had flushed a rusty colour, now paled in
ghastly fashion. He found his voice again. "Ask him where he got
these pretended letters of mine."</p>

<p>"From the archives of your Foreign Office," said Lee coolly.
"They were handed me by a special messenger from Berlin."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" cried the Prince. "I shall listen no longer to
this mountebank! As for you, Mr. Minister, you shall be taught
that Portugal is in no position so to insult the conqueror of
Europe! I will consult with the head of your government!" He
stalked out of the room, followed by his stooges.</p>

<p>Quiet followed. The Minister was studying the papers Lee had
handed him. Finally he lifted an amazed face. "My God, Senhor!
These papers, if <i>bona fide</i>, are of supreme
importance!"</p>

<p>"So I assumed," said Lee demurely.</p>

<p>"They must instantly be laid before a higher authority than
mine. I have your permission?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Lee blandly. "What is your pleasure as
regards myself, Senhor? Am I under arrest?"</p>

<p>"No! No! No!" said the Minister impatiently. "The men you have
charged shall be brought to trial immediately, and you will be
required to testify. All I ask, Senhor, is that you give me your
word not to leave Lisbon."</p>

<p>"No danger of that, Excellency," said Lee, smiling. "I give
you my word of honour that I will not leave Lisbon."</p>

<p>With hasty bows, the Minister of Police disappeared through
the door behind him.</p>

<p>Lee and Luke made their way out of the building.

<p><br>
NEXT morning, at the earliest hour that could be considered
diplomatically decent, Lee and Luke made their way to the United
States Legation to report. They found the Minister striding up
and down his study in a high state of excitement.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Mappin!" he cried. "Congratulations!"</p>

<p>"On what?" asked Lee, with make-believe innocence.</p>

<p>"The Prince zu L&mdash;&mdash; has been fired! Not in the
usual fashion by a polite note to his government, but escorted to
the railway station on twelve hours' notice! Fired! Fired! They
say that the note to Germany is a scorcher, but that has not been
given out. It has been intimated to me that this is the result of
your work."</p>

<p>"Well, fancy that!" said Lee.</p>

<p>"And there is better news, better news to heap on that!" the
Minister continued. "The British Ambassador has just telephoned
me that the Government of Portugal has graciously consented to
allow His Majesty's Government to establish naval bases in the
Azores Islands! There's a smack in the eye for the U-boat
campaign! As far as Portugal is concerned, it is the beginning of
the end, Mappin! Portugal will soon be in it on our side up to
the neck!"

<p><br>
"WELL," said Lee to Luke, when they had returned to their
hotel, "there will be another Ambassador from the enemy, and
another branch of the Gestapo established in Lisbon. So let us
make hay while the sun shines. Spain, too, even Spain, will be
greatly influenced by these happenings. We must proceed at once
to have that refugee family in Barcelona sent on to us. We can
tell Switzerland, too, that we are ready to receive
others..."</p>
