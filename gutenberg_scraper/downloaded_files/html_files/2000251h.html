  <h2 align="center"><b>Chapter 1</b></h2>
  <p>Sergius Kousmenski&nbsp;had unconsciously walked toward the Casino. What
    led him there that evening he never afterward could say. He was no gambler,
    never had been so, even in his younger days, and now that he was about to
    finally settle down in life he certainly felt no inclination for the card-table.
    He was so happy to-night! Olga Kriwenko had at last definitely allowed him
    to fix their wedding-day. Yes, he was going to marry Olga, the beautiful
    Pole&mdash;he, Sergius Kousmenski, Governor of Warsaw, whose severe rigor
    against the conquered race had been so much commented upon and so highly
    commended in St. Petersburg. No doubt, when his impending marriage would
    become known, he would be asked to resign the governorship. But what of that?
    Olga loved him; she was young, and would transform his gloomy castle, far
    out there beyond the steppes, into an enchanted palace of love and beauty.</p>
  <p>It was thus, dreaming, that His Excellency had wandered through the streets
    of Warsaw toward the gaily lighted Casino. The brilliancy of the place, mingled
    with lively music, heard faintly from within, seemed to harmonize with his
    pleasant frame of mind. Somebody, he forgot whom, had advised him in the
    morning to have a look at the gamblers, male and female, who nightly filled
    the rooms. Sergius Kousmenski went in. The porters and attendants bowed respectfully
    to His Excellency, and a good many astonished looks followed the dreaded
    governor as he ascended the wide, carpeted stairs.</p>
  <p>In the gaming-room at first all seemed noise, bustle, and agitation. A confusion
    of tongues greeted Sergius&rsquo; ears as he entered, while a military band
    stationed at one end was playing Russian patriotic songs. Men and women alike
    were crowding around the tables, where every description of games of chance
    was being carried on.</p>
  <p>Sergius Kousmenski watched the players nearest to him for some little time,
    then his attention was drawn toward the farther end of the room where &ldquo;va
    banque&rdquo; was being played.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Va banque&rdquo; is the simplest means of parting with money, and
    is much favored in Russia. The banquier merely deals to each player and to
    himself a card. Each player then stakes; the cards are turned up, and those
    whose cards are of lesser value than the banquier&rsquo;s lose their stakes
    to him, while he in his turn pays those whose cards turn out to be of greater
    value than his own.</p>
  <p>A flat-faced Russian was holding the bank. He seemed excited and anxious.
    Probably he was losing heavily, Sergius thought, for a lady, whose face he
    could not see (her back was turned toward him), had a large heap of gold
    and notes by her side, while the banquier&rsquo;s pile seemed sadly diminished.
    Sergius caught himself wondering who the lucky winner was. He saw very little
    of her, only an exquisitely gloved hand from time to time.</p>
  <p>The banquier had started a fresh deal, while Sergius, full of curiosity,
    endeavored to get a closer view of the lady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Six hundred roubles,&rdquo; she said in a melodious voice that made
    Sergius Kousmenski start, and set his pulses throbbing violently.</p>
  <p>It was Olga&rsquo;s voice! What was she doing here in this gambling den?
    His fianc&eacute;e, his would-be wife!</p>
  <p>He had turned very pale, and made strenuous efforts to get a nearer view
    of the woman over there, who was a gambler and yet had Olga&rsquo;s voice.
    He stood close behind her now, so close he might have touched her shoulder,
    and he could distinctly see the card she was holding, and the pile of gold,
    600 roubles, lying in front of her.</p>
  <p>It all seemed like a dream that the beautiful girl he loved, the one whose
    rigid devotions so often had caused him to smile, should be sitting in the
    Casino, gambling among the rou&eacute;s and demi-mondaines of Warsaw.</p>
  <p>The dealer now turned up an ace, the highest card possible; the players
    had lost, and all the piles of gold, Olga&rsquo;s included, were swept away
    in favor of the banquier. Sergius could not see her face, but the hand that
    once more put up the stake, a heavier one this time, trembled slightly. Every
    one had been very astonished when the unknown lady lost. &ldquo;She always
    wins,&rdquo; was whispered among the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always!&rdquo; She often came here, then, and her presence at the
    tables was a familiar one to this rabble!</p>
  <p>The game proceeded&mdash;Olga lost again. Sergius could not help being glad;
    perhaps if she lost all she would go away, and he would beg of her never
    to return again. Her manner had become a little more excited, and her hand
    was now trembling visibly as she again and again put up sum after sum of
    money, only to see it each time gathered up by the dealer&rsquo;s indiscriminating
    rake.</p>
  <p>Her luck had obviously turned&mdash;she was losing hard. The crowd was becoming
    deeply interested, and many a comment, not wholly sympathetic, was passed
    upon Olga&rsquo;s ill-luck. Sergius heard them, and it made his heart ache
    and his cheeks flush with shame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some luck in love,&rdquo; said one of the bystanders, laughingly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    why the cards are playing her false.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Olga had now only a pile of bank notes in front of her. Most of the other
    players had stopped; some were leaving the table, and she remained for the
    time almost isolated. One man&mdash;her immediate neighbor&mdash;had just
    risen, and as he did so, Sergius, whose very soul was in his eyes, caught
    sight of a card&mdash;the ace of hearts&mdash;lying just underneath her
    chair; it had dropped there, probably by accident. Sergius wondered that
    nobody else saw it; he wondered if Olga did. No! for she apparently did not,
    either, notice her handkerchief, which also at that moment dropped to the
    floor. She was evidently too excited and too much intent upon the game. She
    seemed to have resolved to place all the remnant of her wealth upon this
    last chance; after she had staked, she stood to lose or win some 90,000 roubles.
    Sergius did not take his eyes off her. She was very pale, and her eyes looked
    hard and set. He had noticed the card that had been dealt to her; it was
    a &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; a comparatively low one, and the chances of her winning
    seemed to Sergius very remote.</p>
  <p>The bystanders had transferred their attention to the dealer, only Sergius
    was looking with a certain amount of sympathy at Olga&rsquo;s hand, which
    was twitching nervously. She looked for her hand-kerchief, noticed she had
    dropped it, and stooped slightly to pick it up. The next moment the banquier
    turned up his card: it was a queen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pay king or ace,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You pay me,&rdquo; said Olga quietly, as she turned up her card&mdash;the
    ace of hearts.</p>
  <p>Sergius looked at her; she seemed ready to faint as the dealer, with a muttered
    curse, counted out 90,000 roubles to her. He did not at first understand
    it all, for he had distinctly seen that she held a &ldquo;seven;&rdquo; till
    presently he chanced to look upon the floor&mdash;the card from there had
    disappeared.</p>
  <p>When he looked up again, Olga had collected her money, her gloves, her handkerchief,
    and had risen to go. Then she turned and faced him, and their eyes met.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000251h-images/image02.jpg" width="729" height="750"></p>
  <p>She knew he had seen all; he met her look of terror with one of such unutterable
    contempt that she closed her eyes to shut out the fearful vision.</p>
  <p>When she opened them again he was gone.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Chapter 2</b></p>
  <p>Yes, he had gone, fled he knew not whither, to hide his desolation and shame
    even from those who knew it not. Instinctively he had directed his steps
    toward the outer gates of the city, and having passed them, he was walking
    through the fields that led to the Trappist monastery, yonder by the hillside.
    The small cemetery belonging to the convent was lying peaceably in the moonlight,
    and the little chapel stood quite close, with its stained-glass windows illumined
    from within by the perpetual lamp that is forever kept burning before the
    high altar.</p>
  <p>As Sergius looked before him, he suddenly saw Olga at the farther end of
    the field. She was walking very briskly, and a few moments afterward had
    disappeared into the chapel.</p>
  <p>Sergius hesitated a moment. Should he follow her? Ah, yes, and speak to
    her, and perhaps dispel this horrid dream, and wake up to find reality, to
    find her once more pure, true, and honorable.</p>
  <p>He ran across the field, and pushed open the heavy, panelled oak door. All
    within the chapel seemed love and peace. A monk in his quaint, pointed hood
    and gown was absorbed in devotions before the high altar, and another figure&mdash;a
    woman&rsquo;s&mdash;was there, on her knees, laying bare her soul before
    God and sobbing bitterly. Ah, how Sergius&rsquo; heart went out to her then!
    How he longed the next moment to take her in his arms! But she rose, and
    touched the kneeling monk on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>He walked up to the small sacristy door, and beckoned to an unknown person
    within, who then stepped out, while the monk, waiting, stood like one of
    the statues carved in stone upon the altar.</p>
  <p>The newcomer appeared to be a young man. He held out both his hands to Olga,
    who took them in both hers.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000251h-images/image03.jpg" width="563" height="750"></p>
  <p>Forgotten seemed her grief, her remorse. She talked excitedly to him for
    a few moments, then she poured into his hand the bag of gold and notes she
    had won at the gaming table.</p>
  <p>The young man kissed her affectionately, whilst the monk&rsquo;s hand was
    placed on her head in token of a blessing.</p>
  <p>Sergius saw it all. He tottered as if intoxicated. He would have rushed
    forward and killed them all on the spot, but his feet refused to move and
    red clouds rolled before his eves.</p>
  <p>The next moment all three had disappeared within the sacristy, and he found
    his way out and across the fields toward the city&mdash;the city of Warsaw,
    of which he was the governor. His Excellency, Sergius Kousmenski!&mdash;bah!
    what a mockery!&mdash;he, a broken-hearted man who had given his life to
    a wanton and a cheat!</p>
  <p>He waited about in the fields. Was it in the hope of seeing her again? If
    so, what would he say to her&mdash;what questions would he ask?</p>
  <p>She came out of the chapel some two or three hours later, the hooded monk
    closing the heavy doors after her, and walked rapidly in the direction of
    the city. It was almost broad daylight, and presently from the monastery
    chapel a soft-toned bell began to toll the Angelus.</p>
  <p>Olga paused; like all Poles, she was a devout Catholic, and she stood in
    the middle of the field to say her morning prayer to the Virgin Mary, while,
    from within the chapel, now distant, came faintly the monotonous chant of
    the monks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hail, Mary, full of grace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Olga,&rdquo; said Sergius Kousmenski. He had walked rapidly up to
    her. He would speak to her just this once, find out the truth, and then,
    if she be unworthy, strive to blot out her image from his memory.</p>
  <p>She did not move; perhaps she had not heard his heart-breaking appeal; she
    stood with her hands clasped, a rosary between her fingers.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000251h-images/image04.jpg" width="530" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,&rdquo; she murmured
    devoutly. He might have been miles away for aught she heeded, her superstitious
    devotions seemed of so much greater moment to her than this heart-broken
    man, who only longed to forgive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Olga,&rdquo; he begged once more, &ldquo;have you nothing to say
    to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face was hard and set; she would not look at him; she would have fled
    only he held her hands tightly, so tightly that the beads of the rosary made
    deep impressions into her flesh.</p>
  <p>One moment he almost hoped she would speak, and a look of entreaty&mdash;an
    entreaty for faith and trust&mdash;for an instant softened the set expression
    in her eyes. She seemed to listen in the distance to the monks still chanting
    and praying to her who never sinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it would be best if
    you would leave me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Sergius let go her hand and walked away.</p>
  <p>But she, now left alone, for a while watched his retreating figure.</p>
  <p>She had forgotten her devotions; the rosary had dropped from between her
    fingers. Far away in the convent chapel the monks were chanting the last &ldquo;Ave
    Maria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray for us sinners,&rdquo; they sang, and the little bell had ceased
    tolling, the sound of the organ was dying away&mdash;a look of unutterable,
    hopeless despair softened the lonely woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Now and at
    the hour of death,&rdquo; she prayed; and, falling on her knees, she sobbed
    bitterly.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
  <p>How&nbsp;Sergius Kousmenski spent the remainder of that day he scarcely
    knew. He found his servants anxious about him, wondering where His Excellency
    could thus have spent a whole night.</p>
  <p>His harsh severity against the inhabitants had rendered him an object of
    fear and almost hatred in the Polish city, and it was a very likely thing,
    if he chanced to be out alone at night, that some desperate patriot might
    succeed in ridding Poland of her dreaded governor.</p>
  <p>But, even with an aching heart and a throbbing brain, duty must be gone
    through, and Sergius lived through that weary day&mdash;and waited for the
    night. The Trappist monastery lay two or three miles distant from the governor&rsquo;s
    palace, and yet in Sergius&rsquo; ears, during that long day, there incessantly
    tolled the soft-toned bell of the Angelus.</p>
  <p>When all was dark and quiet again within the city walls, Sergius Kousmenski
    went out&mdash;out through the gates, across the fields beyond which lay
    that convent chapel bathed in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>The night was far advanced, and it was with a thrill of satisfaction that
    Sergius saw that the stained-glass windows were lighted up from within.</p>
  <p>He pushed open the heavy panelled door, which was never closed on those
    who wished to enter for rest, meditation, or prayer. The little chapel at
    first seemed quite deserted, and Sergius paused, wondering, till presently
    at the foot of the altar to the Virgin he spied the Trappist kneeling.</p>
  <p>He was a middle-aged man, his face worn, thin, and pale from long fasts
    and vigils. Sergius looked at him long; at him who must know all. Would he
    speak?</p>
  <p>The convent rules are rigid, Sergius knew. From the day that the final vows
    are taken, the Trappist monks&rsquo; lips are sealed forever; complete silence
    shuts them out from all intercourse with man-kind, and that silence may only
    be broken in order to give the prescribed greeting to each other as they
    pass: &ldquo;Memento mori.&rdquo; All other words may only be addressed to
    God or his saints, in prayer.</p>
  <p>Sergius knew this, and yet he crossed the chapel aisle, and touching the
    kneeling monk on the shoulder he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, I would speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The monk looked toward him, and for an instant a look of wonder crossed
    his impassive features; but it was a mere flash; he turned his eyes again
    heavenward, and continued counting his beads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, a broken-hearted man seeks comfort at your hands; won&rsquo;t
    you speak to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Memento mori,&rdquo; muttered the monk half audibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! I remember!&rdquo; said Sergius, drearily.  &ldquo;But before
    I die I will know the truth. Is it wrong to seek for truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The monk seemed to have forgotten his presence; he was saying his beads
    devoutly, all absorbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; again said Sergius, &ldquo;I wish to speak about Olga
    Kriwenko. What was she doing in this chapel last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The monk once more turned toward Sergius. There was a wistful tenderness
    in his sunken eyes, but he was still fingering his beads, and his lips still
    murmured endless Ave Marias.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monk, whoever thou art,&rdquo; said Sergius,  &ldquo;if thou art
    a man, answer me. What dost thou know of Olga?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He might as well have been talking to one of the stone images round the
    chapel walls. The monk remained silent and prayed.</p>
  <p>Then the untamed Tartar blood rushed wildly to Sergius&rsquo; head. He looked
    with eyes of hatred at the fanatic monk, and, drawing a short dagger from
    his belt, he let it glimmer in the low lamp-light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did Olga do in this chapel last night?&rdquo; he hissed in the
    monk&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Remember, man, thy life is in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The monk looked at the knife with contempt, at Sergius with pity. &ldquo;Memento
    mori,&rdquo; was his sole answer.</p>
  <p>He made no attempt to defend his life, but, when he felt the stab and felt
    his blood beginning to flow, with his hands and his robe he tried to staunch
    the wound, so that he should not pollute the Virgin&rsquo;s altar. But his
    lips remained sealed to the end. To the end the Trappist had kept his vow.</p>
  <p>Sergius took him up in his arms, horror-struck at what he had done, and
    carried him out of the chapel to the little cemetery beyond. He laid the
    monk in one of the graves, and, being a devout Catholic, he knelt by its
    side and recited some prayers for the dead. Then he left him, and walked
    away across the fields.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Chapter 4</b></p>
  <p>It&nbsp;was a cruel time that now followed. A fresh Polish conspiracy had
    been discovered, and His Excellency, Sergius Kousmenski, the governor, was
    more pitiless than ever toward those that fell into the clutches of the Russian
    police.</p>
  <p>A woman, one Olga Kriwenko by name, was implicated in the plot. The governor
    heard that she was young and beautiful, and that she even succeeded in softening
    the hearts of her jailers. Many an influential person pleaded for her life,
    but the governor refused to listen, and ordered that she should be shot the
    next morning, along with the others; and he also ordered that the Angelus
    should be rung from the Trappist convent chapel at the hour of their death.</p>
  <p>People heard this curious decision, and wondered if His Excellency was really
    sane. He hardly knew himself, but he thought that if he once heard the Angelus
    sound together with that volley of musketry it would cease to haunt him as
    it had done for all these long days.</p>
  <p>And when night came he wandered once more toward the convent chapel. Nothing
    seemed altered in the peaceful little house of God. A monk&mdash;was it the
    same?&mdash;was kneeling before the altar. Sergius sat in the chapel he knew
    not how long. The hours seemed so wearying. Would dawn never come? Dawn,
    when she would die, she who had broken his heart while quietly telling her
    beads.</p>
  <p>The chapel seemed oppressive. He wandered out and into the little cemetery
    toward the spot where that open grave had been that night, which now held
    the body of the Trappist who would not speak. Sergius had some difficulty
    in finding the exact spot; it had been levelled in this short while, and
    no crosses or stones mark the graves of the Trappists. Suddenly he paused;
    at his feet, over some newly trodden earth, something white was gleaming;
    it was a piece of paper pinned to the earth by a dagger. Sergius stooped
    to look. He could read the words, stained by mud and rain though they were:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To His Excellency, the Governor of Warsaw, if he should chance to
    pass this way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Feverishly Sergius pulled out the knife and unfolded the paper. It contained
    a few scribbled lines written by a feeble hand:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sergius Kousmenski. I could not speak to thee in life, let me speak
    in death. My moments are numbered; thy dagger did its work well, but not
    quite so well as thou hadst thought. I forgive thee my death. Forgive Olga
    Kriwenko; her sins were not against thee. Poland needed money; she undertook
    to find it. She alone knows how she succeeded. The man she saw here was her
    brother. To him she gave the money. Go thou, and on thy knees ask her pardon
    for having suspected her purity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The paper dropped from Sergius&rsquo; hand. A look of joy and hope illumined
    his face. All was not yet lost. Thank God! Thank God! She still lived.</p>
  <p>At that moment the first sound of the Angelus came from within the convent
    chapel, and the monks once more began to chant &ldquo;Ave Maria!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Stop! stop! in the name of God, wait!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wait! Who should wait? Time or eternity?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And a distant volley of musketry rent the still night air.</p>
  <p>Sergius Kousmenski fell forward on his face, and buried his head in the
    dust.</p>
