  <h2 align="center"><b>Act 1</b></h2>
  <p>The&nbsp;Mugginses had owned the local carrier&rsquo;s business between
    Ockley and Leith Hill for several generations, but  &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins
    had never been much of a favourite. Very little was known of him except that
    he delivered parcels punctually and regularly.</p>
  <p>Now, &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins had been quite another sort, and had been
    ready for a chat with anyone who was willing to listen to his wonderful tales.
    And &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins could spin yarns, and no mistake, of press-gang
    and buccaneering, of Nelson, or of Waterloo, for all the world as if he had
    seen everything with his own eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And we did rush at them, I can tell you,&rdquo;  he would say; &ldquo;we
    saw Bony&rsquo;s white charger straight before us, and heard the Iron Duke&rsquo;s
    cheering voice ringing above the din of musketry and cannon, and I, in the
    foremost rank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point of the thrilling narrative Timothy Hooker, who kept the grocery
    store, remarked drily that the battle of Waterloo had been fought eighteen
    years ago, and that &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins, who was not twenty, must
    have been a very precocious soldier. But then Coldharbour and Ockley always
    had asserted that Timothy Hooker was jealous of &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins&rsquo;  popularity,
    and his oracles were not always held to be infallible.</p>
  <p>One&nbsp;day &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins was not in his accustomed place
    at the Abinger Hatch, nor was he there the next day, nor the day after that.
    Where he had gone to, no one could conjecture, and Mat Hookins remarked over
    his glass of ale: &ldquo;I wonder now where be that young Muggins?&rdquo;  Then
    other matters cropped up, the death of Jane Kelsall&rsquo;s cow, the fire
    at Upcher&rsquo;s barn, and &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins was speedily forgotten.</p>
  <p>One fine day a parcel addressed to &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins was handed
    to the old man by the Dorking carrier; the parcel was wrapped in a shabby
    brown coat; it had tiny feet and a fair, very curly head. It had come all
    the way from London, and did not seem altogether unexpected.</p>
  <p>After that, when anyone happened to pass  &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins&rsquo; cart,
    there was no longer silence beneath the hood as of old; an excited little
    voice would be heard shouting: &ldquo;Whoa! Jemima! Whoa! Steady, old girl!&rdquo; accompanied
    with such merry peals of laughter as did one&rsquo;s heart good to hear.</p>
  <p>Once, when Timothy Hooker was talking to  &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins about
    the little lad, the latter said in an awed whisper: &ldquo;What did he say,
    grandpa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From which remark it was necessarily concluded that the &ldquo;little &rsquo;un&rdquo; was &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins&rsquo; grandson.</p>
  <p>No one thought of calling the new member of the Muggins family &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins.
    That name belonged to a vanished hero; but for seventeen years he was called &ldquo;the
    little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; though by that time he was close on six feet high.
    At the end of that time &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins went to the land where
    there are no carriers and no parcels, and &ldquo;the little &rsquo;un,&rdquo; whose
    name happened to be Pete, carried on the business after him.</p>
  <p>He was then a fine-grown lad, not quite twenty-one, a little foolish, perhaps,
    and shy, but very steady and punctual in business. With the advent of the
    railway came one or two visitors to the village, artists mostly, and with
    them had come a great increase in business.  &ldquo;Pete Muggins must be
    doing well,&rdquo; said one or two of the old oracles. &ldquo;Milly Hooker
    might do worse,&rdquo; added the women.</p>
  <p>Milly Hooker, the pretty, fair-haired daughter of Timothy, the grocer, was
    then a very prepossessing young woman, and no one knew better how to take
    a parcel from the carrier than she did, with those nice dimpled hands of
    hers.</p>
  <p>One&nbsp;day Pete met Miss Milly in the pretty beech lane outside Coldharbour.
    She had a basket on her arm, and was walking fast, for it was very cold.
    It was within a week of Christmas Day, and the great branches of the beech
    trees glistened with the frost, while cheeky robins, with bright red breasts,
    hopped merrily on the great gnarled roots, and cocked their little heads
    on one side as they watched Pete Muggins&rsquo; mare walking leisurely along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me put that basket in the cart, Miss Milly; it&rsquo;s too heavy
    for you,&rdquo; said Pete awkwardly.</p>
  <p>The snow, crisp and hard, crackled beneath the wheels and the hoofs of the
    nag. Milly laughed, such a pretty, chirpy laugh, as made all the robins&rsquo; breasts
    pale with envy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Pete,&rdquo; she said archly, &ldquo;I must tell you that
    I am a wee bit tired myself; perhaps Jemima won&rsquo;t mind taking me part
    of the way along, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Milly!&rdquo; was all that poor Pete could say.</p>
  <p>He jumped down from his cart and helped to make her comfortable on the narrow
    seat. It was obviously not his fault that, whenever Jemima gave a feeble
    jerk to the reins his right arm brushed against her left one, which sent
    a rush of blood to his head, and made him feel as if he could scream for
    very joy.</p>
  <p>It was wonderful how well Jemima understood things. It seemed as if nothing
    on earth that was alive could get along so slowly as that knowing old mare.
    She eyed the passing snails in a sleepy fashion, as much as to say: &ldquo;Sorry
    to see you are in such a hurry; I have got to kill time in this here road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jemima managed to cover two miles in half-an-hour, during which time Miss
    Milly spoke of the coming Christmas and the approaching New Year; whilst
    poor Pete could only contrive to say a few  &ldquo;Oh, Miss Millys&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,
    Miss Millys,&rdquo; for which he could have laid his whip across his own
    back, so foolish and clumsy did he feel.</p>
  <p>But Jemima was a knowing old mare, who had seen a thing or two in her day,
    and no doubt she thought that matters were progressing even more slowly than
    her own clumsy gait.</p>
  <p>As it was close on three o&rsquo;clock, there was every palpable excuse
    for her, and she really was not accustomed to seeing stoats darting across
    the road in front of her.</p>
  <p>She shied, and with dexterous cunning contrived to throw Miss Milly violently
    against her neighbor. Pete put out one arm, the left one, to save her from
    falling out of the cart; and his right arm, heedless of the Scriptures, immediately
    followed its example. So that Miss Milly found herself very tightly pinioned,
    and, wonderful to relate, she seemed in no hurry to extricate herself.</p>
  <p>Jemima, satisfied with her performance, allowed a couple of snails to pass
    her; then she stopped altogether.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Milly! Miss Milly!&rdquo; was all poor Pete could say.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000271h-images/image02.jpg" width="543" height="750"></p>
  <p>Strangely enough, Miss Milly&rsquo;s eloquence also seemed to desert her,
    for she merely sighed &ldquo;Oh, Pete!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A robin hopped into the hood and peeped down beneath it.</p>
  <p>What he saw was evidently perfectly intelligible to him, for he winked a
    bright, knowing little eye, and went home for the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Milly! Milly, darling! I had no idea. I couldn&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you&mdash;that you&mdash;would care for me at all&mdash;that
    is&mdash;you do care for me, then, just a little, Milly&mdash;Miss Milly,
    I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Pete,&rdquo; said Miss Milly, burying a very red face on the
    broad shoulder of the carrier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; thought Jemima, as she started off
    again at a very slow trot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious me! and here&rsquo;s Ockley Post-office, I must
    get down Mr.&mdash;I mean Pete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet, Milly&mdash;wait a bit, do. Whoa! Jemima, whoa! Milly, it
    seems wonderful, I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t quite believe it; tell me that this
    is all real, Milly, and that you have actually said that you care for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all real, Pete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you care for me enough, Milly, to&mdash;to marry me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will marry you, Pete, if you wish it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I wish it? Oh, Milly! Jemima, old girl, do you hear that? Why,
    Milly, for years and years, there hasn&rsquo;t been a day when I haven&rsquo;t
    thought of you, and talked to Jemima of you, but I didn&rsquo;t hope&mdash;how
    could I? When shall we get married, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must ask father, Pete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep you in luxury, Milly; though I have got &pound;30
    put by for furnishing and that. We would hire Mrs. Elms&rsquo;  cottage,
    it has a nice stable for Jemima and I have earned as much as &pound;1 a week
    during the summer, when visitors are about. Can we get married on that, do
    you think, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, Pete; you see, we could let two of the rooms off to visitors
    during August and September. But, goodness me, here&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock
    just striking, and you won&rsquo;t get home by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milly, I want it to be night soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to sit in the dark and think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Pete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jemima looked round in astonishment. She had never seen anything like it
    in all her life. There was that big, hulking fellow standing there, holding
    Miss Milly&rsquo;s hand, and no one in sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may kiss me if you like!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much better,&rdquo; thought Jemima, as she discreetly
    looked another way.</p>
  <p>How&nbsp;Pete Muggins ever got home that night he really never could have
    explained. That Milly should agree to marry him, make a home for him bright
    and lovely with her merry laugh and her pretty, dimpled face, was a vision
    of happiness of which honest Pete had never allowed himself even to dream
    too often. And now it was real&mdash;she had said so. God is good and the
    world is beautiful.</p>
  <p>It was only when, having seen to Jemima&rsquo;s comforts, he was alone in
    the little room which he hired from Mrs. Brown at The Camp, that he remembered
    a letter addressed to himself which had been handed to him at the Ockley
    Post-office. He had recognised the writing and put it in his pocket.</p>
  <p>But now he snuffed the candle, drew a chair close to the table, and broke
    open the envelope. &ldquo;From the dad!&rdquo; he murmured quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young&rdquo; Muggins had not been translated to a better sphere,
    as his admirers in the village had supposed. He had merely at twenty-two
    years of age sought a wider field for his talents.</p>
  <p>Apprenticed to a London builder, he soon learnt the business, and then married
    the daughter of his master. Four years later saw him a widower, father of
    a pretty boy not four years old. Remembering his home in the Surrey Hills,
    he sent the child to its grandfather, and continued to build houses, together
    with a fairly substantial fortune. From time to time Pete heard from his
    father; the letters never contained money, and were never prepaid, but they
    helped to keep father and son in close touch with one another. This one was
    very short, and it began:</p>
  <p class="note">My Dear Son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have gone with me from bad to worse, this terrible
  war in the Crimea has been the ruin of trade. It has been my ruin, my boy!
  and at the close of my laborious, independent life I now stand, poor, ruined,
  a miserable creature, dependent on others for daily subsistence. What am I
  to do, my boy? I am too proud to beg; I am, they tell me, too old to work.
  I would not appeal to you but that I am starving. I have not tasted food for
  two days.</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your despairing father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Peter
  Muggins</p>
  <p>Long&nbsp;did Pete sit there, with the letter in his hand, the candle smoky
    and snuffy, flickering faintly in the tiny room. Then, with a heavy sigh,
    he blew out the light, took off his clothes, and threw himself on the bed.</p>
  <p>The next morning at ten o&rsquo;clock, he was outside Mr. Hooker&rsquo;s
    shop in Ockley. From the whole length of the street Pete could see a bright
    bit of colour in the doorway, and his beating heart told him that Milly was
    watching for him.</p>
  <p>He threw the reins across Jemima&rsquo;s back; his feet seemed like lead
    when he wanted to jump off the cart.</p>
  <p>He took Milly&rsquo;s little hand in his rough brown one, and looked at
    her as one looks at a cherished picture which is about to fade away. He could
    not speak then as his throat felt swollen and stiff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you, Pete?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>He wouldn&rsquo;t break down before her, in the open street; he took his
    father&rsquo;s letter out of his pocket and gave it to her.</p>
  <p>When she had read it, she asked very quietly: &ldquo;What are you going
    to do, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was going to ask you, Milly, what I should do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? You wouldn&rsquo;t see your father want, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Milly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can you do for him, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Milly, I am only earning twelve shillings a week in the
    winter and a sovereign, perhaps, in the summer, and if I have father to live
    with me then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Milly quietly.</p>
  <p>She seemed suddenly to have grown a great deal older. She stood there before
    him, so serious and so still, with an infinity of sadness in her blue eyes.
    He passed the back of his rough hand across his eyes, and in a minute, womanlike,
    she placed her small, podgy hand on his sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must wait, Pete,&rdquo; she said cheerfully.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! wait a few years. We are both very young. Who knows? the next
    few years might make a lot of difference, and you could afford to think of
    your father and not to forget me&mdash;that is,&rdquo; she added with the
    sweetest of arch smiles, &ldquo;if you still wished not to forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, Milly darling! Do you mean to say that you would wait for a
    fellow like me, and&mdash;&rdquo; Pete had spoken in the fulness of his heart,
    but here he checked himself, drew his great, gawky figure bolt upright, and
    added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Milly. I would not be such a wretched coward as to spoil your
    life for you. But, Milly, whatever may befall, I shall never marry now, for
    I shall never love anyone as I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall always love you, Pete,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;and
    whenever you come to claim me for your wife I shall be ready and waiting
    for you!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>Act 2</b></h2>
  <p>Strangely&nbsp;enough, the return of &ldquo;young&rdquo;  Muggins to his
    old, familiar haunts was not greeted with that overwhelming joy which his
    heroic reputation should have insured for him. On the whole, the little group
    of villagers resented more than enjoyed the home-coming of their hero. In
    their sleepy way, they preferred to think of him as translated to a brighter
    sphere; they had hugged the belief that he had only left them to consort
    with dukes and princes, and to give forth his world-wide wisdom in the halls
    of the great.</p>
  <p>To think that that ill-clothed, ill-fed, unwashed creature, who was seen
    one Christmas Eve, wearily lifting his shrivelled body into &ldquo;Pete&rdquo; Muggins&rsquo; cart,
    to think that that was &ldquo;young&rdquo;  Muggins who had fought at Waterloo
    and held dying Nelson in his arms, was a shock from which the inhabitants
    of Coldharbour and Ockley never quite recovered.</p>
  <p>As for Leith Hill, it looked on with a sleepy eye at the preparations Pete
    Huggins made for his father&rsquo;s comfort. He hired Mrs. Elms&rsquo; cottage,
    furnished two rooms and a kitchen comfortably, and got Susie Elms to &ldquo;do&rdquo; for
    him and for his father, for all the world as if the latter were an artist
    who came to spend the summer in the hills.</p>
  <p>Leith Hill shrugged its shoulders, and communicated its views to Ockley,
    and at Ockley Mr. Timothy Hooker was an oracle, possessed of certain indisputable
    rights to mind other people&rsquo;s business. He met Pete in the Coldharbour
    lane one day, when the first tiny green buds peeped out on the graceful branches
    of the beech, and the first swallow had been spotted making for the eaves
    of the little village church.</p>
  <p>Pete looked old; his tall figure seemed more gawky than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pete Muggins,&rdquo; said Mr. Hooker, &ldquo;I hear you and your
    father are living like gentlemen up there at Mrs. Elms&rsquo;. Do you think
    you are wise to spend every penny of your earnings and not be putting by
    against a rainy day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Hooker,&rdquo; said Pete cheerfully,  &ldquo;my father
    has lived all his life as a gentleman. It would not do for him not to have
    all the comforts he has been used to, not now that he is giving me, as it
    were, the pleasure of living with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t right that your father should live on your earnings,
    and prevent you getting married and settled yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Business is getting very brisk, Mr. Hooker,&rdquo; said Pete evasively.</p>
  <p>Business certainly seemed brisk with Pete. Coldharbour was beginning to
    be a noted place, and visitors had begun to book rooms weeks in advance.</p>
  <p>One&nbsp;Christmas Day Pete walked home with Molly from church. She was
    no longer the fresh young girl of eighteen. Her complexion was not quite
    so rosy as it was, and her figure had lost a little of its roundness. Still,
    she was a good-looking girl, and had had one or two offers of marriage in
    the past few years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; said Pete cheerfully, &ldquo;another couple of years
    like the one I have just had, and I shall have another &pound;30 put by and
    be making my &pound;1 a week quite regular.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall only be thirty next birthday, Pete,&rdquo; replied Milly,
    with some of her old archness. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think me too old a
    bride, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; said Pete, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t, for goodness&rsquo;  sake,
    talk like that or I shall make an ass of myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you still care for me, Pete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than earth or Heaven, Molly,&rdquo; he replied, with simple
    earnestness.</p>
  <p>The&nbsp;following autumn Ockley was much surprised one morning to see Pete
    Muggins knocking at six o&rsquo;clock at Dr. Jones&rsquo;  door, and a quarter
    of an hour later the latter worthy hastily mounting into Pete&rsquo;s cart
    and driving away with him in the direction of Leith Hill.</p>
  <p>Leith Hill was the first to know that  &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins was very
    ill. Some spoke of &ldquo;rheumatiz,&rdquo; others of &ldquo;failin&rsquo;  &rsquo;ealth.&rdquo; Dr.
    Jones called twice in one day at Mrs. Elms&rsquo; cottage, and Pete looked
    pale and anxious.</p>
  <p>Then Dr. Jones&rsquo; visits became less and less frequent, and finally
    ceased altogether, and one day a bundle of rags&mdash;a pallid shred of humanity&mdash;sat
    outside the cottage door, shivering beneath the still warm rays of a beautiful
    October sun.</p>
  <p>There were many kind inquiries for Pete about his father whenever the carrier
    delivered his daily load of parcels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is still ailing a bit,&rdquo; was Pete&rsquo;s uniform quiet comment.</p>
  <p>And day after day, from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, that same
    pallid shred of humanity sat, a hopeless invalid, wrapped up in shawls, outside
    the cottage door. Dr. Jones came at times frequently, at others he stayed
    away for weeks on end, but from Dorking regularly there was a bottle of medicine,
    or perhaps a box of powder or pills, or even a jar of potted meat, waiting
    for Pete Muggins at Ockley railway station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must cost him five shillings a week in drugs alone,&rdquo; said Mr.
    Hooker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Heaven only knows what the doctor&rsquo;s bills will come to
    at the end of the year,&rdquo; added Mat Kelsall sententiously.</p>
  <p>Pete still walked home from church with Milly Hooker, who now wore a bonnet
    at morning service with strings tied under her chin, and who did not curl
    her hair any more since she had discovered a grey one in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milly, the last of the &pound;30 went yesterday, and I owe twenty-five
    shillings to the Dorking chemist, and I have put nothing by for two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, Pete, you are a good son. How is your father to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just the same, Milly, just the same. The doctor says that with good
    food and proper care he may last for years. Good food is very expensive,
    but I do what I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then for the first time he spoke that which had gradually eaten into
    his heart, and made him lose all joy in life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Milly, not a bit of use. You are young yet. Can&rsquo;t
    you think of some nice fellow you could make happy, Milly? It&rsquo;s no
    use with me; I am getting old. I can never manage it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am getting old, too, Pete, and I cannot think of some nice fellow.
    I know it&rsquo;s no use, but I should never marry anyone else, and I don&rsquo;t
    mind being an old maid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sometimes &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins was ever so much better, but at others
    age seemed to creep very rapidly over him, still more shrivelling up his
    wretched body; but Dr. Jones&rsquo; verdict remained the same&mdash;&ldquo;With
    good food and care he can last for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pete Muggins, too, was ageing fast. One day Jim Hooker, Milly&rsquo;s brother,
    who was carrying on his father&rsquo;s business, referred to the local carrier
    as &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins. After that &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins stuck
    to him. He was &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins to the young generation of Coldharbour
    and Ockley, as his grandfather had been before him. Silent and taciturn now,
    he would sit smoking all the day beneath the hood of his cart. Every seven
    or eight years he bought a new mare, which he invariably called &ldquo;Jemima.&rdquo; He
    had had four new mares since the day when he had first driven Dr. Jones from
    Ockley to Leith Hill, and it was the fourth mare which took the simple deal
    coffin which contained all that was left of the once heroic &ldquo;young&rdquo; Muggins
    to its final resting place in Ockley churchyard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old&rdquo; Muggins stood beside his father&rsquo;s coffin, and among
    the crowd there was a pleasant-looking old woman dressed all in black, with
    a neat bonnet tied over her snow-white hair.</p>
  <p>That afternoon, when Pete returned to his little cottage on Leith Hill,
    he found a large sealed packet on the table in his parlour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I found this in Mr. Muggins&rsquo; old coat pocket,&rdquo; said Susie
    Elms. &ldquo;You know, Mr. Pete, the one he always used to wear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Pete turned the packet over, fumbled for his spectacles, and at last
    managed to slowly spell out the superscription:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;To my son Pete, when I am dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Puzzled, but strangely excited, the old man with trembling fingers broke
    open the many seals, and from out the packet there fell a letter and a bundle
    of something crisp and white which made old Pete&rsquo;s heart stop beating.
    He opened the bundle first. It contained Bank of England notes, of a date
    nearly half-a-century ago. There were a hundred and fifty of them, for Pete
    counted them, and they were for &pound;10 each.</p>
  <p>Half dazed, not understanding, the old fellow gazed at the bits of paper,
    not taking in quite what they meant. They seemed to mock him with their crisp
    crackling, as he fingered each one in turn.</p>
  <p>Then he thought of the letter; mechanically he unfolded it and began to
    read. It was dated thirty years previously, and began:</p>
  <p class="note">My Dear Son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the inclosed will console you a little for your
  father&rsquo;s death. I know it will come unexpectedly, and therefore you will
  enjoy it all the more. At first, when I came to live with you, my boy, I wanted
  to know if you would be a good son to me. If you had turned me away when I
  told you I was starving, this money would never have become yours. I had meant
  to let you know I had it, and then, perhaps, you and I might have lived comfortably
  together, but to-day, when you thought I was asleep, I heard you and Dr. Jones
  talking together, and he said to you &ldquo;With care and good food he may
  last for years.&rdquo; And then the thought came to me, that though you are
  a good son, all men are liable to temptation. Who knows, perhaps, if you expected
  to finger &pound;1500 after my death, you might not always have given me that
  care which the doctor says is necessary in order that I should live for years.</p>
  <p class="note">But when I am gone you shall have the money. It may be to-morrow, it may
    be ten years hence, that is, if you continue to be the good son to me, and
    give me all the doctor prescribes for me.</p>
  <p class="note">May you make good use of this money, my boy.</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your affectionate father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Peter
  Muggins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October
  18th, 1869</p>
  <p>The&nbsp;letter fell from &ldquo;old&rdquo; Muggins&rsquo;  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be to-morrow, it may be ten years hence,&rdquo; he repeated,
    and a great sob broke from his shrivelled old throat, while a tear began
    to glisten beneath the spectacles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty years ago,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Milly was so pretty
    then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;visitors who were at Ockley that summer, artists mostly, said they
    had never seen such a quaint wedding. The little church was decorated with
    heather, and there was a triumphal arch outside the porch.</p>
  <p>An artist afterwards painted a picture of the scene as the bride and bridegroom
    advanced hand in hand through the little churchyard. The bridegroom was a
    tall, gawky old fellow, with iron-grey hair and a face furrowed by years,
    by wind, and by weather. The bride&rsquo;s hair was snow-white, and her old
    face was rendered quite beautiful by the look of peaceful, serene happiness.
    Milly Hooker had waited for Pete, and when he came, grey-headed and old,
    to claim the promise she made him long ago, she had quietly placed her hand
    in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ready, Pete,&rdquo; she said.</p>
