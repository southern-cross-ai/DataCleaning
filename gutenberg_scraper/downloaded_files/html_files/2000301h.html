  A Farewell Banquet</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;Aumont!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? d&rsquo;Aumont!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice, that of a man still in the prime of life, but already raucous
  in its tone, thickened through constant mirthless laughter, rendered querulous
  too from long vigils kept at the shrine of pleasure, rose above the incessant
  babel of women&rsquo;s chatter, the din of silver, china and glasses passing
  to and fro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your commands, sire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, Marshal of France, prime and sole responsible
  Minister of Louis the Well-beloved, leant slightly forward, with elbows resting
  on the table, and delicate hands, with fingers interlaced, white and carefully
  tended as those of a pretty woman, supporting his round and somewhat fleshy
  chin.</p>
  <p>A handsome man M. le Duc, still on the right side of fifty, courtly and
  pleasant-mannered to all. Has not Boucher immortalized the good-natured,
  rather weak face, with that perpetual smile of unruffled amiability forever
  lurking round the corners of the full-lipped mouth?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your commands, sire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes&mdash;gray and prominent&mdash;roamed with a rapid movement of
  enquiry from the face of the king to that of a young man with fair, curly
  hair, worn free from powder, and eyes restless and blue, which stared moodily
  into a goblet full of wine.</p>
  <p>There was a momentary silence in the vast and magnificent dining hall, that
  sudden hush which&mdash;so the superstitious aver&mdash;descends three times
  on every assembly, however gay, however brilliant or thoughtless: the hush
  which to the imaginative mind suggests the flutter of unseen wings.</p>
  <p>Then the silence was broken by loud laughter from the King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are mad, these English, my friend! What?&rdquo; said Louis the
  Well-beloved with a knowing wink directed at the fair-haired young man who
  sat not far from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad, indeed, sire?&rdquo; replied the Duke. &ldquo;But surely not
  more conspicuously so to-night than at any other time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, a hundred thousand times more so,&rdquo; here interposed
  a somewhat shrill feminine voice&mdash;&ldquo;and that by the most rigid
  rules of brain-splitting arithmetic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone listened. Conversations were interrupted; glasses were put down;
  eager, attentive faces turned toward the speaker; this was no less a personage
  than Jeanne Poisson now Marquise de Pompadour; and when she opened her pretty
  mouth Louis the Well-beloved, descendant of Saint Louis, King of France and
  of all her dominions beyond the seas, hung breathless upon those well-rouged
  lips, whilst France sat silent and listened, eager for a share of that smile
  which enslaved a King and ruined a nation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us have that rigid rule of arithmetic, fair one,&rdquo; said
  Louis gaily, &ldquo;by which you can demonstrate to us that M. le Chevalier
  here is a hundred thousand times more mad than any of his accursed countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, sire, &rsquo;tis simple enough,&rdquo; rejoined the lady. &ldquo;M.
  le Chevalier hath need of a hundred thousand others in order to make his
  insanity complete, a hundred thousand Englishmen as mad as April fishes,
  to help him conquer a kingdom of rain and fogs. Therefore I say he is a hundred
  thousand times more mad than most!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Loud laughter greeted this sally. Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour, so little
  while ago simply Jeanne Poisson or Mme. d&rsquo;&Eacute;tioles, was not yet <i>blas&eacute;e</i> to
  so much adulation and such fulsome flattery; she looked a veritable heaven
  of angelic smiles; her eyes blue&mdash;so her dithyrambic chroniclers aver&mdash;as
  the dark-toned myosotis, wandered from face to face along the length of that
  gorgeously spread supper table, round which was congregated the flower of
  the old aristocracy of France.</p>
  <p>She gleaned an admiring glance here, an unspoken murmur of flattery there,
  even the women&mdash;and there were many&mdash;tried to look approvingly
  at her who ruled the King and France. One face alone remained inscrutable
  and almost severe, the face of a woman&mdash;a mere girl&mdash;with straight
  brow and low, square forehead, crowned with a wealth of soft brown hair,
  the rich tones of which peeped daringly through the conventional mist of
  powder.</p>
  <p>Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s sunny smile disappeared momentarily when her eyes
  rested on this girl&rsquo;s face; a frown&mdash;oh! hardly that; but a shadow,
  shall we say?&mdash;marred the perfect purity of her brow. The next moment
  she had yielded her much-beringed hand to her royal worshipper&rsquo;s eager
  grasp and he was pressing a kiss on each rose-tipped finger, whilst she shrugged
  her pretty shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brrr!&rdquo; she said, with a mock shiver, &ldquo;here is Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont
  frowning stern disapproval at me. Surely, Chevalier,&rdquo; she asked, turning
  to the young man beside her, &ldquo;a comfortable armchair in your beautiful
  palace of St. Germain is worth a throne in mist-bound London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not when that throne is his by right,&rdquo; here interposed Mlle.
  d&rsquo;Aumont quietly. &ldquo;The palace of St. Germain is but a gift to
  the King of England, for which he owes gratitude to the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A quick blush now suffused the cheeks of the young man, who up to now had
  seemed quite unconscious of Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s sallies or of the hilarity
  directed against himself. He gave a rapid glance at Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s
  haughty, somewhat imperious face and at the delicate mouth, round which an
  almost imperceptible curl of contempt seemed still to linger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La! Mademoiselle,&rdquo; rejoined the Marquise, with some acerbity, &ldquo;do
  we not all hold gifts at the hands of the King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have no sovereignty of our own, Madame,&rdquo; replied the young
  girl drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; quoth King Louis, hastily interposing in this feminine
  passage of arms, &ldquo;I drink to our gallant Chevalier de St. George, His
  Majesty King Charles Edward Stuart of England, Scotland, Wales, and of the
  whole of that fog-ridden kingdom. Success to your cause, Chevalier,&rdquo; he
  added, settling his fat body complacently in the cushions of his chair; and
  raising his glass, he nodded benignly toward the young Pretender.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To King Charles Edward of England!&rdquo; rejoined Mme. de Pompadour
  gaily.</p>
  <p>And &ldquo;To King Charles Edward of England!&rdquo; went echoing all around
  the vast banqueting-hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you all,&rdquo; said the young man, whose sullen mood seemed
  in no way dissipated at these expressions of graciousness and friendship. &ldquo;Success
  to my cause is assured if France will lend me the aid she promised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What right have you to doubt the word of France, Monseigneur?&rdquo; retorted
  Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce! a truce! I entreat,&rdquo; here broke in King Louis with
  mock concern. &ldquo;<i>Par Dieu</i>, this is a banquet and not a Council
  Chamber! Joy of my life,&rdquo; he added, turning eyes replete with admiration
  on the beautiful woman beside him, &ldquo;do not allow politics to mar this
  pleasant entertainment. M. le Duc, you are our host, I pray you direct conversation
  into more pleasing channels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing loth, the brilliant company there present quickly resumed the irresponsible
  chatter which was far more to its liking than talk of thrones and doubtful
  causes. The flunkeys in gorgeous liveries made the round of the table, filling
  the crystal glasses with wine. The atmosphere was heavy with the fumes of
  past good cheer, and the scent of a thousand roses fading beneath the glare
  of innumerable wax-candles. An odour of perfume, of powder and cosmetics
  hovered in the air; the men&rsquo;s faces looked red and heated; on one or
  two heads the wig stood awry, whilst trembling fingers began fidgeting with
  the lace-cravats at the throat.</p>
  <p>Charles Edward&rsquo;s restless blue eyes searched keenly and feverishly
  the faces around him; morose, gloomy, he was still reckoning in his mind
  how far he could trust these irresponsible pleasure-lovers, that descendant
  of the great Louis over there, fat of body and heavy of mind, lost to all
  sense of kingly dignity whilst squandering the nation&rsquo;s money on the
  whims and caprices of the ex-wife of a Parisian victualler, whom he had created
  Marquise de Pompadour.</p>
  <p>These men who lived only for good cheer, for heady wines, games of dice
  and hazard, nights of debauch and illicit pleasures, what help would they
  be to him in the hour of need? What support in case of failure?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What right have you to doubt the word of France?&rdquo; was asked
  of him by one pair of proud lips&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s, only a girl&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>Charles Edward looked across the table at Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont. Like himself,
  she sat silent in the midst of the noisy throng, obviously lending a very
  inattentive ear to the whisperings of the handsome cavalier beside her.</p>
  <p>Ah! if they were all like her, if she were a representative of the whole
  nation of France, the young adventurer would have gone to his hazardous expedition
  with a stauncher and a lighter heart. But, as matters stood, what could he
  expect? What had he got as a serious asset in this gamble for life and a
  throne? A few vague promises from that flabby, weak-kneed creature over there
  on whom the crown of Saint Louis sat so strangely and so ill; a few smiles
  from that frivolous and vain woman, who drained the very heart&rsquo;s blood
  of an impoverished nation to its last drop, in order to satisfy her costly
  whims or chase away the frowns of ennui from the brow of an effete monarch.</p>
  <p>And what besides?</p>
  <p>A farewell supper, ringing toasts, good wine, expensive food offered by
  M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, the Prime Minister of France&mdash;a thousand roses,
  now fading, which had cost a small fortune to coax into bloom; a handshake
  from his friends in France; a &ldquo;God-speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Dieu
  vous garde</i>, Chevalier!&rdquo; and a few words of stern encouragement
  from a girl.</p>
  <p>With all that in hand, Chevalier St. George, go and conquer your kingdom
  beyond the sea!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Rulers Of France</b></h2>
  <p>Great activity reigned in the corridors and kitchens of the old ch&acirc;teau.
  M. le Chef&mdash;the only true rival the immortal Vatel ever had&mdash;in
  white cap and apron, calm and self-possessed as a field-marshal in the hour
  of victory, and surrounded by an army of scullions and wenches, was directing
  the operations of dishing-up&mdash;the crowning glory of his arduous labours.
  Pies and patties, haunches of venison, trout and carp from the Rhine were
  placed on gold and silver dishes and adorned with tasteful ornaments of truly
  architectural beauty and monumental proportions. These were then handed over
  to the footmen, who, resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure,
  hurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of culinary art
  to the banqueting-hall beyond, whilst the butlers, more sedate and dignified
  in sober garb of puce or brown, stalked along in stately repose bearing the
  huge tankards and crystal jugs.</p>
  <p>All of the best that the fine old Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Aumont could provide
  was being requisitioned to-night, since M. le Duc and Mlle. Lydie, his daughter,
  were giving a farewell banquet to Charles Edward Stuart by the grace of God&mdash;if
  not by the will of the people&mdash;King of Great Britain and Ireland and
  all her dependencies beyond the seas.</p>
  <p>For him speeches were made, toasts drunk and glasses raised; for him the
  ducal veneries had been ransacked, the ducal cellars shorn of their most
  ancient possessions; for him M. le Chef had raged and stormed for five hours,
  had expended the sweat of his brow and the intricacies of his brain; for
  him the scullions&rsquo; backs had smarted, the wenches&rsquo; cheeks had
  glowed, all to do honour to the only rightful King of England about to quit
  the hospitable land of France in order to conquer that island kingdom which
  his grandfather had lost.</p>
  <p>But in the noble <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i>, on the other hand, there reigned
  a pompous and dignified silence, in strange contrast to the bustle and agitation
  of the kitchens and the noise of loud voices and laughter that issued from
  the banqueting hall whenever a door was opened and quickly shut again.</p>
  <p>Here perfumed candles flickered in massive candelabra, shedding dim circles
  of golden light on carved woodwork, marble floor, and dull-toned tapestries.
  The majestic lions of D&rsquo;Aumont frowned stolidly from their high pedestals
  on this serene abode of peace and dignity, one foot resting on the gilded
  shield with the elaborate coat-of-arms blazoned thereon in scarlet and azure,
  the other poised aloft as if in solemn benediction.</p>
  <p>M. Joseph, own body servant to M. le Duc, in magnificent D&rsquo;Aumont
  livery, his cravat a marvel of costly simplicity, his elegant, well-turned
  calves&mdash;encased in fine silk stockings&mdash;stretched lazily before
  him, was sprawling on the brocade-covered divan in the centre of the room.</p>
  <p>M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict, equally resplendent in a garb of motley that
  recalled the heraldic colours of the Comte de Stainville, stood before him,
  not in an attitude of deference of course, but in one of easy friendship;
  whilst M. Achille&mdash;a blaze of scarlet and gold&mdash;was holding out
  an elegant silver snuff-box to M. Joseph, who, without any superfluous motion
  of his dignified person, condescended to take a pinch.</p>
  <p>With arm and elbow held at a graceful angle, M. Joseph paused in the very
  act of conveying the snuff to his delicate nostrils. He seemed to think that
  the occasion called for a remark from himself, but evidently nothing very
  appropriate occurred to him for the moment, so after a few seconds of impressive
  silence he finally partook of the snuff, and then flicked off the grains
  of dust from his immaculate azure waistcoat with a lace-edged handkerchief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does your Marquis get his snuff?&rdquo; he asked with an easy
  graciousness of manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We get it direct from London,&rdquo; replied M. Achille sententiously. &ldquo;I
  am personally acquainted with Mme. V&eacute;ronique, who is cook to Mme.
  de la Beaume and the sweetheart of Jean Laurent, own body-servant to General
  de Puisieux. The old General is Chief of Customs at Havre, so you see we
  pay no duty and get the best of snuff at a ridiculous price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s lucky for you, my good Eglinton,&rdquo; said M.
  B&eacute;n&eacute;dict, with a sigh. &ldquo;Your Marquis is a good sort,
  and as he is not personally acquainted with Mme. V&eacute;ronique, I doubt
  not but he pays full price for his snuff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One has to live, friend Stainville,&rdquo; quoth Achille solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;and
  I am not a fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly so; and with an English milor your life is an easy one, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Comme-ci! comme-&ccedil;a!&rdquo; nodded Achille deprecatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Le petit Anglais is very rich?&rdquo; suggested B&eacute;n&eacute;dict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boundlessly so!&rdquo; quoth the other, with conscious pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, if perchance you could see your way to introducing me to Mme.
  V&eacute;ronique. Eh? I have to pay full price for my Count&rsquo;s snuff,
  and he will have none but the best; but if I could get Mme. V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s
  protection&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Achille&rsquo;s manner immediately changed at this suggestion, made with
  becoming diffidence; he drew back a few steps as if to emphasize the distance
  which must of necessity lie between supplicant and patron. He took a pinch
  of snuff, he blew his nose with stately deliberation&mdash;all in order to
  keep the petitioner waiting on tenterhooks.</p>
  <p>Finally he drew up his scarlet and gold shoulders until they almost touched
  his ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be difficult, very, very difficult my good Stainville,&rdquo; he
  said at last, speaking in measured tones. &ldquo;You see, Mme. V&eacute;ronique
  is in a very delicate position; she has a great deal of influence of course,
  and it is not easy to obtain her protection. Still, I will see what I can
  do, and you can place your petition before her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not worry yourself, my good Eglinton,&rdquo; here interposed M.
  B&eacute;n&eacute;dict with becoming hauteur. &ldquo;I thought as you had
  asked me yesterday to use my influence with our Mlle. Mariette, the fianc&eacute;e
  of Colonel Jauffroy&rsquo;s third footman, with regard to your nephew&rsquo;s
  advancement in his regiment, that perhaps&mdash; But no matter&mdash;no
  matter!&rdquo; he added, with a deprecatory wave of the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You completely misunderstood me, my dear Stainville,&rdquo; broke
  in M. Achille, eagerly. &ldquo;I said that the matter was difficult; I did
  not say that it was impossible. Mme. V&eacute;ronique is beset with petitions,
  but you may rely on my friendship. I will obtain the necessary introduction
  for you if you, on the other hand, will bear my nephew&rsquo;s interests
  in mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say no more about it, my good Eglinton,&rdquo; said B&eacute;n&eacute;dict,
  with easy condescension; &ldquo;your nephew will get his promotion on the
  word of a Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peace and amity being once more restored between the two friends, M. Joseph
  thought that he had now remained silent far longer than was compatible with
  his own importance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very difficult, of course, in our position,&rdquo; he said
  pompously, &ldquo;to do justice to the many demands which are made on our
  influence and patronage. Take my own case, for instance&mdash;my Duke leaves
  all appointments in my hands. In the morning, whilst I shave him, I have
  but to mention a name to him in connection with any post under Government
  that happens to be vacant, and immediately the favoured one, thus named by
  me, receives attention, nearly always followed by a nomination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hem! hem!&rdquo; came very discreetly from the lips of M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said?&rdquo; queried Joseph, with a slight lifting of the right
  eyebrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing&mdash;nothing! I pray you continue; the matter is vastly
  entertaining.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the present moment,&rdquo; continued M. Joseph, keeping a suspicious
  eye on the other man, &ldquo;I am deeply worried by this proposal which comes
  from the Parliaments of Rennes and Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A new Ministry of Finance to be formed,&rdquo; quoth M. Achille. &ldquo;We
  know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With direct control of the nation&rsquo;s money and responsible to
  the Parliaments alone,&rdquo; assented Joseph. &ldquo;The Parliaments! Bah!&rdquo; he
  added in tones of supreme contempt, &ldquo;<i>bourgeois</i> the lot of them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their demands are preposterous, so says my milor. &rsquo;Tis a marvel
  His Majesty has given his consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have advised my Duke not to listen to the rabble,&rdquo; said Joseph,
  as he readjusted the set of his cravat. &ldquo;A Ministry responsible to
  the Parliaments! Ridiculous, I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand, though,&rdquo; here interposed M. Achille, &ldquo;that
  the Parliaments, out of deference for His Majesty are willing that the King
  himself shall appoint this new Comptroller of Finance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King, my good Eglinton,&rdquo; calmly retorted M. Joseph&mdash;&ldquo;the
  King will leave this matter to us. You may take it from me that we shall
  appoint this new Minister, and an extremely pleasant post it will be. Comptroller
  of Finance! All the taxes to pass through the Minister&rsquo;s hands! Par
  Dieu! does it not open out a wide field for an ambitious man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hem! hem!&rdquo; coughed M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be suffering from a cold, sir,&rdquo; said M. Joseph
  irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; rejoined B&eacute;n&eacute;dict hastily&mdash;&ldquo;a
  slight tickling in the throat. You were saying, M. Joseph, that you hoped
  this new appointment would fall within your sphere of influence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! If you doubt me, my good Stainville&mdash;&rdquo; And
  M. Joseph rose with slow and solemn majesty from the divan, where he had
  been reclining, and walking across the room with a measured step, he reached
  an escritoire whereon ink and pens, letters tied up in bundles, loose papers,
  and all the usual paraphernalia commonly found on the desk of a busy man.
  M. Joseph sat down at the table and rang a handbell.</p>
  <p>The next moment a young footman entered, silent and deferential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is any one in the ante-room, Paul?&rdquo; asked Joseph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, M. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About thirty persons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go tell them, then, that M. Joseph is not receiving to-night. He
  is entertaining a circle of friends. Bring me all written petitions. I shall
  be visible in my dressing room to those who have a personal introduction
  at eleven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow. You may go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silently as he had entered, the young man bowed and withdrew.</p>
  <p>M. Joseph wheeled round in his chair and turned to his friends with a look
  of becoming triumph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty persons!&rdquo; he remarked simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All after this appointment?&rdquo; queried Achille.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their representatives, you see,&rdquo; explained M. Joseph airily. &ldquo;Oh!
  my ante-chamber is always full&mdash;You understand? I shave my Duke every
  morning; and every one, it seems to me, is wanting to control the finances
  of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Might one inquire who is your special <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>?&rdquo; asked
  the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; came with cryptic vagueness from the lips
  of M. Joseph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hem! hem!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In addition to a slight tickling of the throat, M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict
  seemed to be suffering from an affection of the left eye which caused him
  to wink with somewhat persistent emphasis:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is the third time you have made that remark, Stainville,&rdquo; said
  Joseph severely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not remark, my dear D&rsquo;Aumont,&rdquo; rejoined B&eacute;n&eacute;dict
  pleasantly&mdash;&ldquo;that is, I merely said &lsquo;Hem! hem!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so, I heard you,&rdquo; said Joseph, with some acerbity; &ldquo;and
  I would wish to know precisely what you meant when you said &lsquo;Hem! hem!&rsquo; like
  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking of Mlle. Lucienne,&rdquo; said B&eacute;n&eacute;dict,
  with a sentimental sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I am one of her sweethearts&mdash;the fourth in point of favour.
  Mlle. Lucienne has your young lady&rsquo;s ear, my good D&rsquo;Aumont, and
  we all know that your Duke governs the whole of France exactly as his daughter
  wishes him to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you hope through Mlle. Lucienne&rsquo;s influence to obtain the
  new post of Comptroller for your own Count?&rdquo; asked M. Joseph, with
  assumed carelessness, as he drummed a devil&rsquo;s tattoo on the table before
  him.</p>
  <p>A slight expression of fatuity crept into the countenance of M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict.
  He did not wish to irritate the great man; at the same time he felt confident
  in his own powers of blandishments where Mlle. Lucienne was concerned, even
  though he only stood fourth in point of favour in that influential lady&rsquo;s
  heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. Lucienne has promised us her support,&rdquo; he said, with
  a complacent smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me that will be of little avail,&rdquo; here interposed M.
  Achille. &ldquo;We have on our side, the influence of Mme. Auguste Baillon,
  who is housekeeper to M. le Docteur Dubois, consulting physician to Mlle.
  d&rsquo;Aumont. M. le Docteur is very fond of haricots cooked in lard&mdash;a
  dish in the preparation of which Mme. Baillon excels&mdash;whilst, on the
  other hand, that lady&rsquo;s son is perruquier to my Eglinton. I think there
  is no doubt that ours is the stronger influence, and that if this Ministry
  of Finance comes into being, we shall be the Chief Comptroller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it will come into being, without any doubt,&rdquo; said B&eacute;n&eacute;dict. &ldquo;I
  have it from my cousin Fran&ccedil;ois, who is one of the sweethearts of
  Mlle. Duprez, confidential maid to Mme. Aremberg, the jeweller&rsquo;s wife,
  that the merchants of Paris and Lyons are not at all pleased with the amount
  of money which the King and Mme. de Pompadour are spending.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly! People of that sort are a veritable pestilence. They want
  us to pay some of the taxes&mdash;the <i>corv&eacute;e</i> or the <i>taille</i>.
  As if a Duke or a Minister is going to pay taxes! Ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ridiculous, I say,&rdquo; assented Achille, &ldquo;though my Marquis
  says that in England even noblemen pay taxes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll not go to England, friend Eglinton. Imagine shaving
  a Duke or a Marquis who had paid taxes like a shopkeeper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A chorus of indignation from the three gentleman rose at the suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Preposterous indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all know that England is a nation of shopkeepers. M. de Voltaire,
  who has been there, said so to us on his return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Achille, in view of the fact that he represented the Marquis of Eglinton,
  commonly styled &ldquo;le petit Anglais,&rdquo; was not quite sure whether
  his dignity demanded that he should resent this remark of M. de Voltaire&rsquo;s
  or not.</p>
  <p>Fortunately he was saved from having to decide this delicate question immediately
  by the re&euml;ntry of Paul into the room.</p>
  <p>The young footman was carrying a bundle of papers, which he respectfully
  presented to M. Joseph on a silver tray. The great man looked at Paul somewhat
  puzzled, rubbed his chin, and contemplated the papers with a thoughtful eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The petitions, M. Joseph,&rdquo; replied the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah, yes!&rdquo; quoth the other airily. &ldquo;Quite so; but&mdash;I
  have no time to read them now. You may glance through them, Paul, and let
  me know if any are worthy of my consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Joseph was born in an epoch when reading was not considered an indispensable
  factor in a gentleman&rsquo;s education. Whether the petitions of the thirty
  aspirants to the new post of Comptroller of Finance would subsequently be
  read by M. Paul or not it were impossible to say; for the present he merely
  took up the papers again, saying quite respectfully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, M. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay! you may take cards, dice, and two flagons of Bordeaux into
  my boudoir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, M. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you dismissed every one from the ante-chamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All except an old man, who refuses to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know; he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Further explanation was interrupted by a timid voice issuing from the open
  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only desire five minutes&rsquo; conversation with M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And a wizened little figure dressed in seedy black, with lean shanks encased
  in coarse woollen stockings, shuffled into the room. He seemed to be carrying
  a great number of papers and books under both arms, and as he stepped timidly
  forward some of these tumbled in a heap at his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only five minutes&rsquo; conversation with M. le Duc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes were very pale, and very watery, and his hair was of a pale straw
  colour. He stooped to pick up his papers, and dropped others in the process.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Duc is not visible,&rdquo; said M. Joseph majestically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps a little later&mdash;&rdquo; suggested the lean individual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke will not be visible later either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then to-morrow perhaps; I can wait&mdash;I have plenty of time on
  my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may have, but the Duke hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the wizened little man had succeeded in once more collecting
  his papers together. With trembling eager hands he now selected a folded
  note, which evidently had suffered somewhat through frequent falls on dusty
  floors; this he held out toward M. Joseph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a letter to Monsieur le valet de chambre of the Duke,&rdquo; he
  said humbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A letter of introduction?&mdash;to me?&rdquo; queried Joseph, with
  a distinct change in his manner and tone. &ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter Agathe, who brings Monsieur&rsquo;s chocolate in to him
  every morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you are Mlle. Agathe&rsquo;s father!&rdquo; exclaimed Joseph
  with pleasant condescension, as he took the letter of introduction, and,
  without glancing at it, slipped it into the pocket of his magnificent coat.
  Perhaps a thought subsequently crossed his mind that the timorous person
  before him was not quite so simple-minded as his watery blue eyes suggested,
  and that the dusty and crumpled little note might be a daring fraud practised
  on his own influential personality, for he added with stern emphasis: &ldquo;I
  will see Mlle. Agathe to-morrow, and will discuss your affair with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as the little man did not wince under the suggestion, M. Joseph said
  more urbanely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, what is your affair? These gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;and
  with a graceful gesture he indicated his two friends&mdash;&ldquo;these gentlemen
  will pardon the liberty you are taking in discussing it before them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Monsieur; thank you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the wizened
  individual humbly; &ldquo;it is a matter of&mdash;er&mdash;figures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Figures!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! This new Ministry of Finance&mdash;there will be an auditor
  of accounts wanted&mdash;several auditors, I presume&mdash;and&mdash;and
  I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; nodded M. Joseph graciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter does bring you in your chocolate nice and hot, M. Joseph,
  does she not?&mdash;and&mdash;and I do know a lot about figures. I studied
  mathematics with the late M. Descartes; I audited the books of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des
  Comptables of Lyons for several years; and&mdash;and I have diplomas and
  testimonials&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, carried away by another wave of anxiety, he began to fumble among his
  papers and books, which with irritating perversity immediately tumbled pell-mell
  on to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name is the good of testimonials and diplomas
  to us, my good man?&rdquo; said M. Joseph haughtily. &ldquo;If, on giving
  the matter my serious consideration, I come to the conclusion that you will
  be a suitable accountant in the new Ministerial Department, <i>ma foi</i>!
  my good man, your affair is settled. No thanks, I pray!&rdquo; he added,
  with a gracious flourish of the arm; &ldquo;I have been pleased with Mlle.
  Agathe, and I may mention your name whilst I shave M. le Duc to-morrow. Er&mdash;by
  the way, what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Durand, if you please, M. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The meagre little person with the watery blue eyes tried to express his
  gratitude by word and gesture, but his books and papers encumbered his movements,
  and he was rendered doubly nervous by the presence of these gorgeous and
  stately gentlemen, and by the wave of voices and laughter which suddenly
  rose from the distance, suggesting that perhaps a brilliant company might
  be coming this way.</p>
  <p>The very thought seemed to completely terrify him; with both arms he hugged
  his various written treasures, and with many sideway bows and murmurs of
  thanks he finally succeeded in shuffling his lean figure out of the room,
  closely followed by M. Paul.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Pompadour&rsquo;s Choice</b></h2>
  <p>M. Durand&rsquo;s retreat had fortunately occurred just in time; men&rsquo;s
  voices and women&rsquo;s laughter sounded more and more distinct, as if approaching
  toward the <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i>.</p>
  <p>In a moment, with the swiftness born of long usage, the demeanour of the
  three gentlemen underwent a quick and sudden change. They seemed to pull
  their gorgeous figures together; with practised fingers each readjusted the
  lace of his cravat, re&euml;stablished the correct set of his waistcoat,
  and flickered the last grain of dust or snuff from the satin-like surface
  of his coat.</p>
  <p>Ten seconds later the great doors at the east end of the hall were thrown
  open, and through the embrasure and beyond the intervening marble corridor
  could be seen the brilliantly lighted supper-room, with its glittering company
  broken up into groups.</p>
  <p>Silent, swift and deferential, MM. Joseph, B&eacute;n&eacute;dict, and Achille
  glided on flat-heeled shoes along the slippery floors, making as little noise
  as possible, effacing their gorgeous persons in window recesses or carved
  ornaments whenever a knot of gentlemen or ladies happened to pass by.</p>
  <p>Quite a different trio now, MM. Joseph, B&eacute;n&eacute;dict, and Achille&mdash;just
  three automatons intent on their duties.</p>
  <p>From the supper-room there came an incessant buzz of talk and laughter.
  M. Joseph sought his master&rsquo;s eye, but M. le Duc was busy with the
  King of England and wanted no service; M. Achille found his English milor, &ldquo;le
  petit Anglais,&rdquo; engaged in conversation with his portly and somewhat
  overdressed mamma; whilst M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict&rsquo;s master was nowhere
  to be found.</p>
  <p>The older ladies were beginning to look wearied and hot, smothering yawns
  behind their painted fans. Paniers assumed a tired and crumpled appearance,
  and feathered aigrettes nodded dismally above the high coiffures.</p>
  <p>Not a few of the guests had taken the opportunity of bringing cards or dice
  from a silken pocket, whilst others in smaller groups, younger and not yet
  wearied of desultory talk, strolled toward the <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i> or
  the smaller boudoirs which opened out of the corridor.</p>
  <p>One or two gentlemen had succumbed to M. le Duc&rsquo;s lavish hospitality;
  the many toasts had proved too exacting, the copious draughts altogether
  too heady, and they had, somewhat involuntarily, exchanged their chairs for
  the more reliable solidity of the floor, where their faithful attendants,
  stationed under the table for the purpose, deftly untied a cravat which might
  be too tight or administered such cooling antidotes as might be desirable.</p>
  <p>The hot air vibrated with the constant babel of voices, the frou-frou of
  silk paniers, and brocaded skirts, mingled with the clink of swords and the
  rattle of dice in satinwood boxes.</p>
  <p>The atmosphere, surcharged with perfumes, had become overpoweringly close.</p>
  <p>His Majesty, flushed with wine, and with drowsy lids drooping over his dulled
  eyes, had pushed his chair away from the table and was lounging lazily toward
  Mme. de Pompadour, his idle fingers toying with the jewelled girdle of her
  fan. She amused him; she had quaint sayings which were sometimes witty, always
  daring, but which succeeded in dissipating momentarily that mortal ennui
  of which he suffered.</p>
  <p>Even now her whispered conversation, interspersed with profuse giggles,
  brought an occasional smile to the lips of the sleepy monarch. She chatted
  and laughed, flirting her fan, humouring the effeminate creature beside her
  by yielding her hand and wrist to his flabby kisses. But her eyes did not
  rest on him for many seconds at a time; she talked to Louis, but her mind
  had gone a-wandering about the room trying to read thoughts, to search motives
  or divine hidden hatreds and envy as they concerned herself.</p>
  <p>This glitter was still new to her; the power which she wielded seemed as
  yet a brittle toy which a hasty movement might suddenly break. It was but
  a very little while ago that she had been an insignificant unit in a third-rate
  social circle of Paris&mdash;always beautiful, but lost in the midst of a
  drabby crowd, her charms, like those of a precious stone, unperceived for
  want of proper setting. Her ambition was smothered in her heart, which at
  times it almost threatened to consume. But it was always there, ever since
  she had learnt to understand the power which beauty gives.</p>
  <p>An approving smile from the King of France, and the world wore a different
  aspect for Jeanne Poisson. Her whims and caprices became the reins with which
  she drove France and the King. Why place a limit to her own desires, since
  the mightiest monarch in Europe was ready to gratify them?</p>
  <p>Money became her god.</p>
  <p>Spend! spend! spend! Why not? The nation, the bourgeoisie&mdash;of which
  she had once been that little insignificant unit&mdash;was now the well-spring
  whence she drew the means of satisfying her ever-increasing lust for splendour.</p>
  <p>Jewels, dresses, palaces, gardens&mdash;all and everything that was rich,
  beautiful, costly, she longed for it all!</p>
  <p>Pictures and statuary; music, and of the best; constant noise around her,
  gaiety, festivities, laughter; the wit of France and the science of the world
  all had been her helpmeets these past two years in this wild chase after
  pleasure, this constant desire to kill her Royal patron&rsquo;s incurable
  ennui.</p>
  <p>Two years, and already the nation grumbled! A check was to be put on her
  extravagance&mdash;hers and that of King Louis! The parliaments demanded
  that some control be exercised over Royal munificence. Fewer jewels for Madame!
  And that palace at Fontainebleau not yet completed, the Parc aux Cerfs so
  magnificently planned and not even begun! Would the new Comptroller put a
  check on that?</p>
  <p>At first she marvelled that Louis should consent. It was a humiliation for
  him as well as for her. The weakness in him which had served her own ends
  seemed monstrous when it yielded to pressure from others.</p>
  <p>He had assured her that she should not suffer; jewels, palaces, gardens,
  she should have all as heretofore. Let Parliament insist and grumble, but
  the Comptroller would be appointed by D&rsquo;Aumont, and D&rsquo;Aumont
  was her slave.</p>
  <p>D&rsquo;Aumont, yes! but not his daughter&mdash;that arrogant girl with
  the severe eyes, unwomanly and dictatorial, who ruled her father just as
  she herself, Pompadour, ruled the King.</p>
  <p>An enemy, that Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont! Mme. la Marquise, whilst framing a
  witticism at which the King smiled, frowned because in a distant alcove she
  spied the haughty figure of Lydie.</p>
  <p>And there were others! The friends of the Queen and her clique, of course;
  they were not here to-night; at least not in great numbers; still, even the
  present brilliant company, though smiling and obsequious in the presence
  of the King, was not by any means a close phalanx of friends.</p>
  <p>M. d&rsquo;Argenson, for instance&mdash;he was an avowed enemy; and Marshal
  de Noailles, too&mdash;oh! and there were others.</p>
  <p>One of them, fortunately, was going away; Charles Edward Stuart, aspiring
  King of England; he had been no friend of Pompadour. Even now, as he stood
  close by, lending an obviously inattentive ear to M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont,
  she could see that he still looked gloomy and out of humour, and that whenever
  his eyes rested upon her and the King he frowned with wrathful impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are distraite, ma mie!&rdquo; said Louis, with a yawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking, sire,&rdquo; she replied, smiling into his drowsy
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, I entreat, do not think!&rdquo; exclaimed the
  King, with mock alarm. &ldquo;Thought produces wrinkles, and your perfect
  mouth was only fashioned for smiles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I frame a suggestion?&rdquo; she queried archly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, only a command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This Comptroller of Finance, your future master, Louis, and mine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your slave,&rdquo; he interrupted lazily, &ldquo;and he values his
  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not milor Eglinton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Le petit Anglais?&rdquo; and Louis&rsquo;s fat body was shaken with
  sudden immoderate laughter. &ldquo;Par Dieu, ma mie! Of all your witty sallies
  this one hath pleased us most.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked seriously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Le petit Anglais!&rdquo; again laughed the King. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  as soon give the appointment to your lapdog, Marquise. Fido would have as
  much capacity for the post as the ornamental cypher that hangs on his mother&rsquo;s
  skirts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor Eglinton is very rich,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inordinately so, curse him! I could do with half his revenue and
  be a satisfied man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being a cypher he would not trouble us much; being very rich he would
  need no bribe for doing as we wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His lady mother would trouble us, ma mie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! we would find him a wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I entreat you do not worry your dainty head with these matters,&rdquo; said
  the King, somewhat irritably. &ldquo;The appointment rests with D&rsquo;Aumont;
  an you desire the post for your prot&eacute;g&eacute;, turn your bright eyes
  on the Duke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pompadour would have wished to pursue the subject, to get something of a
  promise from Louis, to turn his inveterate weakness then and there to her
  own account, but Louis the Well-beloved yawned, a calamity which the fair
  lady dared not risk again. Witty and brilliant, forever gay and unfatigued,
  she knew that her power over the monarch would only last whilst she could
  amuse him.</p>
  <p>Therefore now with swift transition she turned the conversation to more
  piquant channels. An anecdote at the expense of the old Duchesse de Pontchartrain
  brought life once more into the eyes of the King. She was once more untiring
  in her efforts, her cheeks glowed even through the powder and the rouge,
  her lips smiled without intermission, but her thoughts drifted back to the
  root idea, the burden of that control to be imposed on her caprices.</p>
  <p>She would not have minded Milor Eglinton, the courteous, amiable gentleman,
  who had no will save that expressed by any woman who happened to catch his
  ear. She felt that she could, with but very little trouble, twist him round
  her little finger. His dictatorial mamma would either have to be got out
  of the way, or won over to Mme. la Marquise&rsquo;s own views of life, whilst
  Milor could remain a bachelor, lest another feminine influence prove antagonistic.</p>
  <p>Pompadour&rsquo;s bright eyes, whilst she chatted to the King, sought amidst
  the glittering throng the slim figure of &ldquo;le petit Anglais.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes, he would suit her purpose admirably! She could see his handsome profile
  clearly outlined against the delicate tones of the wall; handsome, yes! clear-cut
  and firm, with straight nose and the low, square brow of the Anglo-Saxon
  race, but obviously weak and yielding; a perfect tool in the hands of a clever
  woman.</p>
  <p>Elegant too, always immaculately, nay daintily dressed, he wore with that
  somewhat stiff grace peculiar to the English gentleman the showy and effeminate
  costume of the time. But there was weakness expressed in his very attitude
  as he stood now talking to Charles Edward Stuart: the kindly, pleasant expression
  of his good-looking face in strange contrast to the glowering moodiness of
  his princely friend.</p>
  <p>One Lord Eglinton had followed the deposed James II into exile. His son
  had risked life and fortune for the restoration of the old Pretender, and
  having managed by sheer good luck to save both, he felt that he had done
  more than enough for a cause which he knew was doomed to disaster. But he
  hated the thought of a German monarch in England, and in his turn preferred
  exile to serving a foreigner for whom he had scant sympathy.</p>
  <p>Immensely wealthy, a brilliant conversationalist, a perfect gentleman, he
  soon won the heart of one of the daughters of France. Mlle. de Maille brought
  him, in addition to her own elaborate trousseau and a dowry of three thousand
  francs yearly pin-money, the historic and gorgeous chateau of Beaufort which
  Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s fortune rescued from the hands of the bailiffs.</p>
  <p>Vaguely he thought that some day he would return to his own ancestral home
  in Sussex, when England would have become English once again; in the meanwhile
  he was content to drift on the placid waters of life, his luxurious craft
  guided by the domineering hand of his wife. Independent owing to his nationality
  and his wealth, a friend alike of the King of France and the Stuart Pretender,
  he neither took up arms in any cause, nor sides in any political intrigue.</p>
  <p>Lady Eglinton brought up her son in affluence and luxury, but detached from
  all partisanship. Her strong personality imposed something of her own national
  characteristics on the boy, but she could not break the friendship that existed
  between the royal Stuarts and her husband&rsquo;s family. Although Charles
  Edward was her son&rsquo;s playmate in the gardens and castle of Beaufort,
  she nevertheless succeeded in instilling into the latter a slight measure
  of disdain for the hazardous attempts at snatching the English crown which
  invariably resulted in the betrayal of friends, the wholesale slaughter of
  adherents, and the ignominious flight of the Pretender.</p>
  <p>No doubt it was this dual nationality in the present Lord Eglinton, this
  detachment from political conflicts, that was the real cause of that inherent
  weakness of character which Mme. de Pompadour now wished to use for her own
  ends. She was glad, therefore, to note that whilst Charles Edward talked
  earnestly to him, the eyes of &ldquo;le petit Anglais&rdquo; roamed restlessly
  about the room, as if seeking for support in an argument, or help from a
  personality stronger than his own.</p>
  <p>Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s voice, harsh and domineering, often rose above the
  general hum of talk. Just now she had succeeded in engaging the Prime Minister
  in serious conversation.</p>
  <p>The King in the meanwhile had quietly dropped asleep, lulled by the even
  ripple of talk of the beautiful Marquise and the heavily scented atmosphere
  of the room. Pompadour rose from her chair as noiselessly as her stiff brocaded
  skirt would allow; she crossed the room and joined Lady Eglinton and M. le
  Duc d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>She was going to take King Louis&rsquo;s advice and add the weighty influence
  of her own bright eyes to that of my lady&rsquo;s voluble talk in favour
  of the appointment of Lord Eglinton to the newly created Ministry of Finance.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  A Woman&rsquo;s Surrender</b></h2>
  <p>In a small alcove, which was raised above the level of the rest of the floor
  by a couple of steps and divided from the main banqueting hall by a heavy
  damask curtain now partially drawn aside, Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont sat in close
  conversation with M. le Comte de Stainville.</p>
  <p>From this secluded spot these two dominated the entire length and breadth
  of the room; the dazzling scene was displayed before them in a gorgeous kaleidoscope
  of moving figures, in an ever-developing panorama of vividly coloured groups,
  that came and went, divided and reunited; now forming soft harmonies of delicate
  tones that suggested the subtle blending on the palette of a master, anon
  throwing on to the canvas daring patches of rich magentas or deep purples,
  that set off with cunning artfulness the masses of pale primrose and gold.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville, however, did not seem impressed with the picturesqueness
  of the scene. He sat with his broad back turned toward the brilliant company,
  one elbow propped on a small table beside him, his hand shielding his face
  against the glare of the candles. But Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s searching
  eyes roamed ceaselessly over the gaily plumaged birds that fluttered uninterruptedly
  before her gaze.</p>
  <p>With one delicate hand holding back the rich damask curtain, the other lying
  idly in her lap, her white brocaded gown standing out in stiff folds round
  her girlish figure, she was a picture well worth looking at.</p>
  <p>Lydie was scarcely twenty-one then, but already there was a certain something
  in the poise of her head, in every movement of her graceful body, that suggested
  the woman accustomed to dominate, the woman of thought and action, rather
  than of sentiment and tender emotions.</p>
  <p>Those of her own sex said at that time that in Lydie&rsquo;s haughty eyes
  there was the look of the girl who has been deprived early in life of a mother&rsquo;s
  gentle influence, and who has never felt the gentle yet firm curb of a mother&rsquo;s
  authority on her childish whims and caprices.</p>
  <p>M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, who had lost his young wife after five years of
  an exceptionally happy married life, had lavished all the affection of his
  mature years on the girl, who was the sole representative of his name. The
  child had always been headstrong and self-willed from the cradle; her nurses
  could not cope with her babyish tempers; her governesses dreaded her domineering
  ways. M. le Duc was deaf to all complaints; he would not have the child thwarted,
  and as she grew up lovable in the main, she found her father&rsquo;s subordinates
  ready enough to bend to her yoke.</p>
  <p>From the age of ten she had been the acknowledged queen of all her playmates,
  and the autocrat of her father&rsquo;s house. Little by little she obtained
  an extraordinary ascendancy over the fond parent, who admired almost as much
  as he loved her.</p>
  <p>He was deeply touched when, scarce out of the school room, she tried to
  help him in the composition of his letters, and more than astonished to see
  how quick was her intelligence and how sharp her intuition. Instinctively,
  at first he took to explaining to her the various political questions of
  the day, listening with paternal good-humour, to her acute and sensitive
  remarks on several important questions.</p>
  <p>Then gradually his confidence in her widened. Many chroniclers aver that
  it was Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont who wrote her father&rsquo;s celebrated memoirs,
  and those who at that time had the privilege of knowing her intimately could
  easily trace her influence in most of her father&rsquo;s political moves.
  There is no doubt that the Duc himself, when he finally became Prime Minister
  of France, did very little without consulting his daughter, and even l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; d&rsquo;Alivet,
  in his &ldquo;Chroniques de Louis XV,&rdquo; admits that the hot partisanship
  of France for the Young Pretender&rsquo;s ill-conceived expeditions was mainly
  due to Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s influence.</p>
  <p>When Vanloo painted her a little later on, he rendered with consummate and
  delicate skill the haughty look of command which many of Lydie&rsquo;s most
  ardent admirers felt to be a blemish on the exquisite purity and charm of
  her face.</p>
  <p>The artist, too, emphasized the depth and earnestness of her dark eyes,
  and that somewhat too severe and self-reliant expression which marked the
  straight young brow.</p>
  <p>Perhaps it was this same masterful trait in the dainty form before him that
  Gaston de Stainville studied so attentively just now; there had been silence
  for some time between the elegant cavalier and the idolized daughter of the
  Prime Minister of France. She seemed restless and anxious, even absent-minded,
  when he spoke. She was studying the various groups of men and women as they
  passed, frowning when she looked on some faces, smiling abstractedly when
  she encountered a pair of friendly eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not know that you were such a partisan of that young adventurer,&rdquo; said
  Gaston de Stainville at last, as if in answer to her thoughts, noting that
  her gaze now rested with stern intentness on Charles Edward Stuart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must be on the side of a just cause,&rdquo; she rejoined quietly,
  as with a very characteristic movement of hers she turned her head slowly
  round and looked M. de Stainville full in the face.</p>
  <p>She could not see him very well, for his head was silhouetted against the
  dazzling light beyond, and she frowned a little as she tried to distinguish
  his features more clearly in the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do believe, Gaston, that his cause is just?&rdquo; she asked
  earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he replied lightly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe in the justice
  of any cause to which you give your support.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a slightly contemptuous curl appeared
  at the corner of her mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How like a man!&rdquo; she said impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is like a man?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;To love&mdash;as I
  love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had whispered this, hardly above his breath lest he should be overheard
  by some one in that gay and giddy throng who passed laughingly by. The stern
  expression in her eyes softened a little as they met his eager gaze, but
  the good-humoured contempt was still apparent, even in her smile; she saw
  that as he spoke he looked through the outspread fingers of his hand to see
  if he was being watched, and noted that one pair of eyes, distant the whole
  length of the room, caught the movement, then was instantly averted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. de Saint Romans is watching you,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
  <p>He seemed surprised and not a little vexed that she had noticed, and for
  a moment looked confused; then he said carelessly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should she not? Why should not the whole world look on, and see
  that I adore you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems you protest over-much, Gaston,&rdquo; she said, with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk of love too lightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am in earnest, Lydie. Why should you doubt? Are you not beautiful
  enough to satisfy any man&rsquo;s ardour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not influential enough, you mean,&rdquo; she said, with a slight
  tremor in her rich young voice, &ldquo;to satisfy any man&rsquo;s ambition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is ambition a crime in your eyes, Lydie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ambitious; you cannot condemn me for that,&rdquo; he said, now
  speaking in more impressive tone. &ldquo;When we were playmates together,
  years ago, you remember? in the gardens at Cluny, if other lads were there,
  was I not always eager to be first in the race, first in the field&mdash;first
  always, everywhere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even at the cost of sorrow and humiliation to the weaker ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders with easy unconcern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no success in life for the strong,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;save
  at the cost of sorrow and humiliation for the weak. Lydie,&rdquo; he added
  more earnestly, &ldquo;if I am ambitious it is because my love for you has
  made me humble. I do not feel that as I am, I am worthy of you; I want to
  be rich, to be influential, to be great. Is that wrong? I want your pride
  in me, almost as much as your love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were rich once, Gaston,&rdquo; she said, a little coldly. &ldquo;Your
  father was rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it my fault if I am poor now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They tell me it is; they say that you are over-fond of cards, and
  of other pleasures which are less avowable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you believe them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have ceased to love me, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gaston!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There as a tone of tender reproach there, which the young man was swift
  enough to note; the beautiful face before him was in full light; he could
  see well that a rosy blush had chased away the usual matt pallor of her cheeks,
  and that the full red lips trembled a little now, whilst the severe expression
  of the eyes was veiled in delicate moisture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your face has betrayed you, Lydie!&rdquo; he said, with sudden vehemence,
  though his voice even now hardly rose above a whisper. &ldquo;If you have
  not forgotten your promises made to me at Cluny&mdash;in the shadow of those
  beech trees, do you remember? You were only thirteen&mdash;a mere child&mdash;yet
  already a woman, the soft breath of spring fanned your glowing cheeks, your
  loose hair blew about your face, framing your proud little head in a halo
  of gold&mdash;you remember, Lydie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your hand was in mine&mdash;a child&rsquo;s hand, Lydie, but yours
  for all that&mdash;and you promised&mdash;you remember? And if you have not
  forgotten&mdash;if you do love me, not, Heaven help me! as I love you, but
  only just a little better than any one else in the world; well, then, Lydie,
  why these bickerings, why these reproaches? I am poor now, but soon I will
  be rich! I have no power, but soon I will rule France, with you to help me
  if you will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had grown more and more vehement as he spoke, carried along by the torrent
  of his own eloquence. But he had not moved; he still sat with his back to
  the company, and his face shaded by his hand; his voice was still low, impressive
  in its ardour. Then, as the young girl&rsquo;s graceful head drooped beneath
  the passionate expression of his gaze, bending, as it were, to the intensity
  of his earnest will, his eyes flashed a look of triumph, a premonition of
  victory close at hand. Lydie&rsquo;s strong personality was momentarily weakened
  by the fatigue of a long and arduous evening, by the heavy atmosphere of
  the room; her senses were dulled by the penetrating odours of wine and perfumes
  which fought with those of cosmetics.</p>
  <p>She seemed to be yielding to the softer emotions, less watchful of her own
  dignity, less jealous of her own power. The young man felt that at this moment
  he held her just as he wished; did he stretch out his hand she would place
  hers in it. The recollections of her childhood had smothered all thoughts
  of present conflicts and of political intrigues. Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont, the
  influential daughter of an all-powerful Minister, had momentarily disappeared,
  giving way to madcap little Lydie, with short skirts and flying chestnut
  curls, the comrade of the handsome boy in the old gardens at Cluny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie, if you loved me!&rdquo; whispered Stainville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I loved you!&rdquo; and there was a world of pathos in that girlish &ldquo;if.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would help me instead of reproaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do, Gaston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your word is law with your father,&rdquo; he said persuasively. &ldquo;He
  denies you nothing. You said I was ambitious; one word from you&mdash;this
  new Ministry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He realized his danger, bit his lip lest he had been too precipitate. Lydie
  was headstrong, she was also very shrewd; the master-mind that guided the
  destinies of France through the weak indulgence of a father was not likely
  to be caught in a snare like any love-sick maid. Her woman&rsquo;s instinct&mdash;he
  knew that&mdash;was keen to detect self-interest; and if he aroused the suspicions
  of the wealthy and influential woman before he had wholly subjugated her
  heart, he knew that he would lose the biggest stake of his life.</p>
  <p>Lately she had held aloof from him, the playmates had become somewhat estranged;
  the echoes of his reckless life must, he thought, have reached her ears,
  and he himself had not been over-eager for the companionship of this woman,
  who seemed to have thrown off all the light-heartedness of her sex for the
  sake of a life of activity and domination.</p>
  <p>She was known to be cold and unapproachable, rigidly conscientious in transacting
  the business of the State, which her father with easy carelessness gradually
  left on her young shoulders, since she seemed to find pleasure in it.</p>
  <p>But her influence, of which she was fully conscious, had rendered her suspicious.
  Even now, when the call of her youth, of her beauty, of the happy and tender
  recollections of her childhood loudly demanded to be heard, she cast a swift,
  inquiring glance at Gaston.</p>
  <p>He caught the glance, and, with an involuntary movement of impatience, his
  hand, which up to now had so carefully masked the expression of his face,
  came crashing down upon the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie,&rdquo; he said impetuously, &ldquo;in the name of God throw
  aside your armour for one moment! Is life so long that you can afford to
  waste it? Have you learned the secret of perpetual youth that you deliberately
  fritter away its golden moments in order to rush after the Dead Sea fruit
  of domination and power? Lydie!&rdquo; he whispered with passionate tenderness; &ldquo;my
  little Lydie of the crisp chestnut hair, of the fragrant woods around Cluny,
  leave those giddy heights of ambition; come down to earth, where my arms
  await you! I will tell you of things, my little Lydie, which are far more
  beautiful, far more desirable, than the sceptre and kingdom of France; and
  when I press you close to my heart you will taste a joy far sweeter than
  that which a crown of glory can give. Will you not listen to me, Lydie? Will
  you not share with me that joy which renders men the equal of God?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His hand had wandered up the damask curtain, gently drawing its heavy folds
  from out her clinging fingers. The rich brocade fell behind him with a soft
  and lingering sound like the murmured &ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; of
  angels&rsquo; wings shutting out the noise and glare beyond, isolating them
  both from the world and its conflicts, its passions, and its ceaseless strife.</p>
  <p>Secure from prying eyes, Gaston de Stainville threw all reserve from him
  with a laugh of pride and of joy. Half kneeling, wholly leaning toward her,
  his arms encircled her young figure, almost pathetic now in its sudden and
  complete abandonment. With his right hand he drew that imperious little head
  down until his lips had reached her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you have me otherwise, my beautiful proud queen?&rdquo; he
  whispered softly. &ldquo;Should I be worthy of the cleverest woman in France
  if my ambition and hopes were not at least as great as hers? Lydie,&rdquo; he
  added, looking straight into her eyes, &ldquo;if you asked me for a kingdom
  in the moon, I swear to God that I would make a start in order to conquer
  it for you! Did you, from sheer caprice, ask to see my life&rsquo;s blood
  ebbing out of my body, I would thrust this dagger without hesitation into
  my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; she said earnestly; &ldquo;that is extravagant
  talk, Gaston. Do not desecrate love by such folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not folly, Lydie. Give me your lips and you, too, will
  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She closed her eyes. It was so strange to feel this great gladness in her
  heart, this abasement of all her being; she, who had so loved to dictate
  and to rule, she savoured the inexpressible delight of yielding.</p>
  <p>He demanded a kiss and she gave it because he had asked it of her, shyly
  wondering in her own mind how she came to submit so easily, and why submission
  should be so sweet.</p>
  <p>Up to now she had only tasted the delights of power; now she felt that if
  Gaston willed she would deem it joy to obey. There was infinite happiness,
  infinite peace in that kiss, the first her vestal lips had ever granted to
  any man. He was again whispering to her now with that same eager impetuosity
  which had subjugated her. She was glad to listen, for he talked much of his
  love, of the beautiful days at Cluny, which she had feared that he had wholly
  forgotten.</p>
  <p>It was sweet to think that he remembered them. During the past year or two
  when evil tongues spoke of him before her, of his recklessness, his dissipations,
  his servility to the growing influence of the Pompadour, she had not altogether
  believed, but her heart, faithful to the child-lover, had ached and rebelled
  against his growing neglect.</p>
  <p>Now he was whispering explanations&mdash;not excuses, for he needed none,
  since he had always loved her and only jealousies and intrigues had kept
  him from her side. As he protested, she still did not altogether believe&mdash;oh,
  the folly of it all! the mad, glad folly!&mdash;but he said that with a kiss
  she would understand.</p>
  <p>He was right. She did understand.</p>
  <p>And he talked much of his ambitions. Was it not natural? Men were so different
  to women! He, proud of his love for her, was longing to show her his power,
  to rule and to command; she, half-shy of her love for him, felt her pride
  in submitting to his wish, in laying down at his feet the crown and sceptre
  of domination which she had wielded up to now with so proud and secure a
  hand.</p>
  <p>Men were so different. That, too, she understood with the first touch of
  a man&rsquo;s kiss on her lips.</p>
  <p>She chided herself for her mistrust of him; was it not natural that he should
  wish to rule? How proud was she now that her last act of absolute power should
  be the satisfaction of his desire.</p>
  <p>That new Ministry? Well, he should have it as he wished. One word from her,
  and her father would grant it. Her husband must be the most powerful man
  in France; she would make him that, since she could: and then pillow her
  head on his breast and forget that she ever had other ambitions save to see
  him great.</p>
  <p>Smiling through her tears, she begged his forgiveness for her mistrust of
  him, her doubts of the true worth of his love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was because I knew so little,&rdquo; she said shyly as her trembling
  fingers toyed nervously with the lace of his cravat; &ldquo;no man has ever
  loved me, Gaston&mdash;you understand? There were flatterers round me and
  sycophants&mdash;but love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head with a kind of joyous sadness for the past. It was so
  much better to be totally ignorant of love, and then to learn it&mdash;like
  this!</p>
  <p>Then she became grave again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father shall arrange everything this evening,&rdquo; she said,
  with a proud toss of her head. &ldquo;To-morrow you may command, but to-night
  you shall remain a suppliant; grant me, I pray you, this fond little gratification
  of my overburdened vanity. Ask me again to grant your request, to be the
  means of satisfying your ambition. Put it into words, Gaston, tell me what
  it is you want!&rdquo; she insisted, with a pretty touch of obstinacy; &ldquo;it
  is my whim, and remember I am still the arbiter of your fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On my knees, my queen,&rdquo; he said, curbing his impatience at
  her childish caprice; and, striving to hide the note of triumph in his voice,
  he put both knees to the ground and bent his head in supplication. &ldquo;I
  crave of your bountiful graciousness to accord me the power to rule France
  by virtue of my office as Chief Comptroller of her revenues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your desire is granted, sir,&rdquo; she said with a final assumption
  of pride; &ldquo;the last favour I shall have the power to bestow I now confer
  on you. To-morrow I abdicate,&rdquo; she continued, with a strange little
  sigh, half-tearful, half-joyous, &ldquo;to-morrow I shall own a master.
  M. le Comte de Stainville, Minister of the Exchequer of France, behold your
  slave, Lydie, bought this night with the priceless currency of your love!
  Oh, Gaston, my lord, my husband!&rdquo; she said, with a sudden uncontrollable
  outburst of tears, &ldquo;be a kind master to your slave&mdash;she gives
  up so much for your dear sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  The First Trick</b></h2>
  <p>A shrill laugh suddenly broke on their ears. So absorbed had Lydie been
  in her dream that she had completely forgotten the other world, the one that
  laughed and talked, that fought and bickered on the other side of the damask
  curtain which was the boundary of her own universe.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville, we may assume, was not quite so unprepared for interruption
  as the young girl, for even before the shrill laugh had expended itself,
  he was already on his feet, and had drawn the damask curtain back again,
  interposing the while his broad figure between Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont and the
  unwelcome intruder on their privacy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! at last you are tracked to earth, <i>mauvais sujet</i>,&rdquo; said
  Mme. de Pompadour, as soon as the Comte de Stainville stood fully revealed
  before her. &ldquo;Faith! I have had a severe task. His Majesty demanded
  your presence a while ago, sir, and hath gone to sleep in the interval of
  waiting. Nay! nay! you need make neither haste nor excuses. The King sleeps,
  Monsieur, else I were not here to remind you of duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood at the bottom of the steps looking up with keen, malicious eyes
  at Gaston&rsquo;s figure framed in the opening of the alcove, and peering
  inquisitively into the sombre recesses, wherein already she had caught a
  glimpse of a white satin skirt and the scintillation of many diamonds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What say you, milady?&rdquo; she added, turning to the florid, somewhat
  over-dressed woman who stood by her side. &ldquo;Shall we listen to the excuses
  M. de Stainville seems anxious to make; meseems they are clad in white satin
  and show a remarkably well-turned ankle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But before Lady Eglinton could frame a reply, Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont had risen,
  and placing her hand on Stainville&rsquo;s shoulder, she thrust him gently
  aside and now stood smiling beside him, perfectly self-possessed, a trifle
  haughty, looking down on Jeanne de Pompadour&rsquo;s pert face and on the
  older lady&rsquo;s obviously ill-humoured countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; she said, in her own quiet way, &ldquo;M.
  le Comte de Stainville&rsquo;s only excuse for his neglect of courtly duties
  stands before you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>, Mademoiselle!&rdquo; retorted the Marquise somewhat
  testily. &ldquo;His Majesty, being over-gallant, would perhaps be ready
  enough to accept it, and so, no doubt, would the guests of M. le Duc, your
  father&mdash;always excepting Mlle, de St. Romans,&rdquo; she added, with
  more than a point of malice, &ldquo;and she is not like to prove indulgent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Lydie was far too proud, far too conscious also of her own worth, to
  heed the petty pinpricks which the ladies of the Court of Louis XV were wont
  to deal so lavishly to one another. She knew quite well that Gaston&rsquo;s
  name had oft been coupled with that of Mlle. de St. Romans&mdash;&ldquo;<i>la
  belle brune de Bordeaux</i>,&rdquo; as she was universally called&mdash;daughter
  of the gallant Mar&eacute;chal just home from Flanders. This gossip was part
  and parcel of that multifarious scandal to which she had just assured her
  lover that she no longer would lend an ear.</p>
  <p>Therefore she met Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s malicious look with one of complete
  indifference, and ignoring the remark altogether, she said calmly, without
  the slightest tremor in her voice or hint of annoyance in her face:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say, Madame, that His Majesty was tired and
  desired to leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Marquise looked vexed, conscious of the snub; she threw a quick look
  of intelligence to Lady Eglinton, which Lydie no doubt would have caught
  had she not at that moment turned to her lover in order to give him a smile
  of assurance and trust.</p>
  <p>He, however, seemed self-absorbed just now, equally intent in avoiding her
  loving glance and Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s mocking gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King certainly asked for M. de Stainville a while ago,&rdquo; here
  interposed Lady Eglinton, &ldquo;and M. le Chevalier de Saint George has
  begun to make his adieux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not detain Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont, then,&rdquo; said Mme.
  de Pompadour. &ldquo;She will wish to bid our young Pretender an encouraging
  farewell! Come, M. de Stainville,&rdquo; she added authoritatively, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
  to His Majesty, but only for two short minutes, then you shall be released
  man, have no fear, in order to make your peace with <i>la belle brune de
  Bordeaux</i>. Brrr! I vow I am quite frightened; the minx&rsquo;s black eyes
  anon shot daggers in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She beckoned imperiously to Gaston, who still seemed ill at ease, and ready
  enough to follow her. Lydie could not help noting with a slight tightening
  of her heartstrings with what alacrity he obeyed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men are so different!&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>She would have allowed the whole world to look on and to sneer whilst she
  spent the rest of the evening beside her lover, talking foolish nonsense,
  planning out the future, or sitting in happy silence, heedless of sarcasm,
  mockery, or jests.</p>
  <p>Her eyes followed him somewhat wistfully as he descended the two steps with
  easy grace, and with a flourishing bow and a &ldquo;<i>Mille gr&acirc;ces</i>,
  Mlle. Lydie!&rdquo; he turned away without another backward look, and became
  merged with the crowd.</p>
  <p>Her master and future lord, the man whose lips had touched her own! How
  strange!</p>
  <p>She herself could not thus have become one of the throng. Not just yet.
  She could not have detached herself from him so readily. For some few seconds&mdash;minutes
  perhaps&mdash;her earnest eyes tried to distinguish the pale mauve of his
  coat in the midst of that ever-changing kaleidoscope of dazzling colours.
  But the search made her eyes burn, and she closed them with the pain.</p>
  <p>Men were so different!</p>
  <p>And though she had learned much, understood much, with that first kiss,
  she was still very ignorant, very inexperienced, and quite at sea in those
  tortuous paths wherein Gaston and Mme. de Pompadour and all the others moved
  with such perfect ease.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile, M. de Stainville and the Marquise had reached the corridor.
  From where they now stood they could no longer see the alcove whence Lydie&rsquo;s
  aching eyes still searched for them in vain; with a merry little laugh Madame
  drew her dainty hand away from her cavalier&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There! am I not the beneficent fairy, you rogue?&rdquo; she said,
  giving him a playful tap with her fan. &ldquo;Fie! Will you drive in double
  harness? You&rsquo;ll come to grief, fair sir, and meseems &rsquo;twere not
  good to trifle with either filly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame, I entreat!&rdquo; he protested feebly, wearied of the jest.
  But he tried not to scowl or to seem impatient, for he was loth to lose the
  good graces of a lady whose power and influence were unequalled even by Lydie
  d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>Pompadour had favoured him from the very day of her first entry in the brilliant
  Court of Versailles. His handsome face, his elegant manners, and, above all,
  his reputation as a consummate <i>mauvais sujet</i> had pleased Mme. la Marquise.
  Gaston de Stainville was never so occupied with pleasures or amours, but
  he was ready to pay homage to one more beautiful woman who was willing to
  smile upon him.</p>
  <p>But though she flirted with Gaston, the wily Marquise had no wish to see
  him at the head of affairs, the State-appointed controller of her caprices
  and of the King&rsquo;s munificence. He was pleasant enough as an admirer,
  unscrupulous and daring; but as a master? No.</p>
  <p>The thought of a marriage between Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont and M. de Stainville,
  with its obvious consequences on her own future plans, was not to be tolerated
  for a moment; and Madame wondered greatly how far matters had gone between
  these two, prior to her own timely interference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, pointing to an arched doorway close at hand; &ldquo;go
  and make your peace whilst I endeavour to divert His Majesty&rsquo;s thoughts
  from your own wicked person; and remember,&rdquo; she added coquettishly
  as she bobbed him a short, mocking curtsey, &ldquo;when you have reached
  the blissful stage of complete reconciliation, that you owe your happiness
  to Jeanne de Pompadour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Etiquette demanded that he should kiss the hand which she now held extended
  toward him; this he did with as good a grace as he could muster. In his heart
  of hearts he was wishing the interfering lady back in the victualler&rsquo;s
  shop of Paris; he was not at all prepared at this moment to encounter the
  jealous wrath of &ldquo;la Belle <i>brune de Bordeaux</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vaguely he thought of flight, but Mme. de Pompadour would not let him off
  quite so easily. With her own jewelled hand she pushed aside the curtain
  which masked the doorway, and with a nod of her dainty head she hinted to
  Gaston to walk into the boudoir.</p>
  <p>There was nothing for it but to obey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. de Saint Romans,&rdquo; said the Marquise, peeping into the
  room in order to reassure herself that the lady was there and alone, &ldquo;see,
  I bring the truant back to you. Do not be too severe on him; his indiscretion
  has been slight, and he will soon forget all about it, if you will allow
  him to make full confession and to do penance at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she dropped the curtain behind Gaston de Stainville, and, as an additional
  precaution, lest those two in there should be interrupted too soon, she closed
  the heavy folding doors which further divided the boudoir from the corridor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, if milady plays her cards cleverly,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;she
  and I will have done a useful evening&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  A False Position</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Gaston!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. de Stainville shook off his moodiness. The vision of la belle Ir&egrave;ne
  standing there in the satin-hung boudoir, the soft glow of well-shaded candles
  shedding an elusive, rosy light on the exquisite figure, with head thrown
  back and arms stretched out in a gesture of passionate appeal, was too captivating
  to permit of any other thought having sway over his brain, for the next second
  or two at any rate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you had completely forgotten me to-night,&rdquo; she said
  as he came rapidly toward her, &ldquo;and that I should not even get speech
  of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took his hand and led him gently to a low divan; forcing him to sit
  down beside her, she studied his face intently for a moment or two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it necessary?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know it was, Ir&egrave;ne,&rdquo; he said, divining her thoughts,
  plunging readily enough now into the discussion which he knew was inevitable.
  His whole nature rebelled against this situation; he felt a distinct lowering
  of his manly pride; his masterful spirit chafed at the thought of an explanation
  which Ir&egrave;ne claimed the right to demand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you, Ir&egrave;ne,&rdquo; he continued impatiently, &ldquo;that
  I would speak to Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont to-night, and if possible obtain a
  definite promise from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And have you obtained that definite promise?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont promised you that you should be the new State-appointed
  Minister of Finance?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I have her word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;what was the cost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the cost,&rdquo; she said, with what was obviously enforced
  calm. &ldquo;Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont did not give you that promise for nothing;
  you gave her or promised her something in return. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her lips were trembling, and she had some difficulty in preventing her nervous
  fingers from breaking into pieces the delicate mother-of-pearl fan which
  they held. But she was determined to appear perfectly calm, and that he should
  in no way suspect her of working up to a vulgar scene of jealousy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are foolish, Ir&egrave;ne!&rdquo; he said, with his characteristic
  nonchalant shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foolish?&rdquo; she repeated, still keeping her temper well under
  control, though it was her voice which was shaking now. &ldquo;Foolish? Ma
  foi! when my husband obtains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sh! &lsquo;sh! &lsquo;sh!&rdquo; he said quickly, as with
  rough gesture he grasped her wrist, and gave it a warning pressure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;no one can hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The walls have ears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if they have? I cannot keep up this deception for ever, Gaston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tere worse than foolish to founder within sight of port.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You trust Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s word then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will do nothing to spoil the situation!&rdquo; he retorted
  grimly. &ldquo;Another word such as you said just now, too long a prolongation
  of this charming <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont
  will make a fresh promise to some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was right, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right in what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont promised you the appointment because you made
  love to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ir&egrave;ne!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; she said with passionate vehemence. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
  you see that I have been torturing myself with jealous fears? I am jealous&mdash;can
  I help it? I suffered martyrdom when I saw you there with her! I could not
  hear your words, but I could see the earnestness of your attitude. Do I not
  know every line of your figure, every gesture of your hand? Then the curtain
  fell at your touch, and I could no longer see&mdash;only divine&mdash;only
  tremble and fear. Mon Dieu! did I not love you as I do, were my love merely
  foolish passion, would I not then have screamed out the truth to all that
  jabbering crowd that stood between me and you, seeming to mock me with its
  prattle, and its irresponsible laughter? I am unnerved, Gaston,&rdquo; she
  added, with a sudden breakdown of her self-control, her voice trembling with
  sobs, the tears welling to her eyes, and her hands beating against one another
  with a movement of petulant nervosity. &ldquo;I could bear it, you know,
  but for this secrecy, this false position; it is humiliating to me, and&mdash;Oh,
  be kind to me&mdash;be kind to me!&rdquo; she sobbed, giving finally way
  to a fit of weeping. &ldquo;I have spent such a miserable evening, all alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stainville&rsquo;s expressive lips curled into a smile. &ldquo;Be kind to
  me!&rdquo;&mdash;the same pathetic prayer spoken to him by Lydie a very short
  while ago. Bah! how little women understood ambition! Even Lydie! Even Ir&egrave;ne!</p>
  <p>And these two women were nothing to him. Lydie herself was only a stepping-stone;
  the statuesque and headstrong girl made no appeal to the essentially masculine
  side of his nature, and he had little love left now for the beautiful passionate
  woman beside him, whom in a moment of unreasoning impulse he had bound irrevocably
  to him.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville aspired to military honours a couple of years ago;
  the Mar&eacute;chal de Saint Romans, friend and mentor of the Dauphin, confidant
  of the Queen, seemed all-powerful then. Unable to win the father&rsquo;s
  consent to his union with Ir&egrave;ne&mdash;for the Mar&eacute;chal had
  more ambitious views for his only daughter and looked with ill-favour on
  the young gallant who had little to offer but his own handsome person, an
  ancient name, and a passionate desire for advancement&mdash;Gaston, who had
  succeeded in enchaining the young girl&rsquo;s affections, had no difficulty
  in persuading her to agree to a secret marriage.</p>
  <p>But the wheel of fate proved as erratic in its movements as the flights
  of Stainville&rsquo;s ambition. With the appearance of Jeanne Poisson d&rsquo;&Eacute;tioles
  at the Court of Versailles, the Queen&rsquo;s gentle influence over Louis
  XV waned, and her friends fell into disfavour and obscurity. The Mar&eacute;chal
  de Saint Romans was given an unimportant command in Flanders; there was nothing
  to be gained for the moment from an open alliance with his daughter. Gaston
  de Stainville, an avowed opportunist, paid his court to the newly risen star
  and was received with smiles, but he could not shake himself from the matrimonial
  fetters which he himself had forged.</p>
  <p>The rapid rise of the Duc d&rsquo;Aumont to power and the overwhelming ascendancy
  of Lydie in the affairs of State had made the young man chafe bitterly against
  the indestructible barrier which he himself had erected between his desires
  and their fulfilment. His passion for Ir&egrave;ne did not yield to the early
  love of his childhood&rsquo;s days; it was drowned in the newly risen flood
  of more boundless ambition. It was merely the casting aside of one stepping-stone
  for another more firm and more prominent.</p>
  <p>Just now in the secluded alcove, when the proud, reserved girl had laid
  bare before him the secrets of her virginal soul, when with pathetic abandonment
  she laid the sceptre of her influence and power at his feet, he had felt
  neither compunction nor remorse; now, when the woman who had trusted and
  blindly obeyed him asked for his help and support in a moral crisis, he was
  conscious only of a sense of irritation and even of contempt, which he tried
  vainly to disguise.</p>
  <p>At the same time he knew well that it is never wise to tax a woman&rsquo;s
  submission too heavily. Ir&egrave;ne had yielded to his wish that their marriage
  be kept a secret for the present only because she, too, was tainted with
  a touch of that unscrupulous ambition which was the chief characteristic
  of the epoch. She was shrewd enough to know that her husband would have but
  little chance in elbowing his way up the ladder of power&mdash;&ldquo;each
  rung of which was wrapped in a petticoat,&rdquo; as M. de Voltaire had pertinently
  put it&mdash;if he was known to be dragging a wife at his heels; Gaston had
  had no difficulty in making her understand that his personality as a gay
  and irresponsible butterfly, as a man of fashion, and a squire of dames,
  was the most important factor in the coming fight for the virtual dominion
  of France.</p>
  <p>She had accepted the position at first with an easy grace; she knew her
  Gaston, and knew that he must not be handled with too tight a curb; moreover,
  her secret status pleased her, whilst he remained avowedly faithful to her
  she liked to see him court and smile, a <i>preux chevalier</i> with the ladies;
  she relished the thought of being the jailer to that gaily-plumaged bird,
  whom bright eyes and smiling lips tried to entice and enchain.</p>
  <p>But to-night a crisis had come; something in Gaston&rsquo;s attitude toward
  Lydie had irritated her beyond what she was prepared to endure. His love
  for her had begun to wane long ago; she knew that, but she was not inclined
  to see it bestowed on another. Stainville feared that she was losing self-control,
  and that she might betray all and lose all if he did not succeed in laying
  her jealous wrath to rest. He was past master in the art of dealing with
  a woman&rsquo;s tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ir&egrave;ne,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I have far too much
  respect for you to look upon this childish outburst of tears as representing
  the true state of your feelings. You are unnerved&mdash;you own it yourself.
  Will you allow me to hold your hand?&rdquo; he said with abrupt transition.</p>
  <p>Then as she yielded her trembling hand to him he pressed a lingering kiss
  in the icy cold palm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not accept with this kiss the assurance of my unswerving
  faith and loyalty?&rdquo; he said, speaking in that low, deep-toned voice
  of his which he knew so well how to make tender and appealing to the heart
  of women. &ldquo;Ir&egrave;ne, if I have committed an indiscretion to-night,
  if I allowed my ambition to soar beyond the bounds of prudence, will you
  not believe that with my ambition my thoughts flew up to you and only came
  down to earth in order to rest at your feet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had drawn her close to him, ready to whisper in her ear, as he had whispered
  half an hour ago in those of Lydie. He wanted this woman&rsquo;s trust and
  confidence just a very little while longer, and he found words readily enough
  with which to hoodwink and to cajole. Ir&egrave;ne was an easier prey than
  Lydie. She was his wife and her ambitions were bound up with his; her mistrust
  only came from jealousy, and jealousy in a woman is so easily conquered momentarily,
  if she be beautiful and young and the man ardent and unscrupulous.</p>
  <p>Gaston as yet had no difficult task; but every day would increase those
  difficulties, until he had finally grasped the aim of his ambitious desires
  and had rid himself of Lydie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ir&egrave;ne!&rdquo; he whispered now, for he felt that she was consoled,
  and being consoled, she was ready to yield. &ldquo;Ir&egrave;ne, my wife,
  a little more patience, a little more trust. Two days&mdash;a week&mdash;what
  matter? Shut your eyes to all save this one moment to-night, when your husband
  is at your feet and when his soul goes out to yours in one long, and tender
  kiss. Your lips, ma mie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent her head to him. Womanlike, she could not resist. Memory came to
  his aid as he pleaded, the memory of those early days on the vine-clad hills
  near Bordeaux, when he had wooed and won her with the savour of his kiss.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  The Young Pretender</b></h2>
  <p>And Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s eyes had watched his disappearing figure
  through the crowd, until she could bear the sight no longer, and closed them
  with the pain.</p>
  <p>An even, pleasant, very courteous voice roused her from her reverie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are tired, Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont. May I&mdash;that is, I should
  be very proud if you would allow me to&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She opened her eyes and saw the handsome face of &ldquo;le petit Anglais&rdquo; turned
  up to her with a look of humility, a deprecatory offer of service, and withal
  a strange mingling of compassion which somehow at this moment, in her sensitive
  and nervous state, seemed to wound and sting her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the least tired,&rdquo; she said coldly; &ldquo;I thank
  you, milor. The colours and the light were so dazzling for the moment, my
  eyes closed involuntarily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I humbly beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Eglinton with nervous haste; &ldquo;I
  thought that perhaps a glass of wine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush child!&rdquo; interposed Lady Eglinton in her harsh dry voice; &ldquo;have
  you not heard that Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont is not fatigued. Offer her the support
  of your arm and take her to see the Chevalier de Saint George, who is waiting
  to bid her &lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I assure you I can walk alone,&rdquo; rejoined Lydie, taking
  no heed to the proffered arm which Lord Eglinton, in obedience to his mother&rsquo;s
  suggestion, was holding out toward her. &ldquo;Where is His Majesty the King
  of England?&rdquo; emphasizing the title with marked reproof, and looking
  with somewhat good-natured contempt at the young Englishman who, with a crestfallen
  air, had already dropped the arm which she had disdained and stepped quickly
  out of her way, whilst a sudden blush spread over his good-looking face.</p>
  <p>He looked so confused and sheepish, so like a chidden child, that she was
  instantly seized with remorse, as if she had teased a defenseless animal,
  and though the touch of contempt was still apparent in her attitude, she
  said more kindly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you forgive me, milor. I am loth to think that perhaps our
  gallant Chevalier will never bear his rightful title in his own country.
  I feel that it cheers him to hear us&mdash;who are in true sympathy with
  him&mdash;calling him by that name. Shall we go find the King of England
  and wish him &lsquo;God-speed&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She beckoned to Lord Eglinton, but he had probably not yet sufficiently
  recovered from the snub administered to him to realize that the encouraging
  glance was intended for him, and he hung back, not daring to follow, instinctively
  appealing to his mother for guidance as to what he should do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is modest,&rdquo; said Lady Eglinton, with the air of a proud
  mother lauding her young offspring. &ldquo;A heart of gold, my dear Mlle.
  d&rsquo;Aumont!&rdquo; she whispered behind her fan, &ldquo;under a simple
  exterior.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie shrugged her shoulders with impatience. She knew whither Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s
  praises of her son would drift presently. The pompous lady looked for all
  the world like a fussy hen, her stiff brocaded gown and voluminous paniers
  standing out in stiff folds each side of her portly figure like a pair of
  wings, and to Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s proud spirit it seemed more than
  humiliating for a man, rich, young, apparently in perfect health, to allow
  himself to be domineered over by so vapid a personality as was milady Eglinton.</p>
  <p>Instinctively her thoughts flew back to Gaston; very different physically
  to &ldquo;le petit Anglais;&rdquo; undoubtedly not so attractive from the
  point of view of manly grace and bearing, but a man for all that! with a
  man&rsquo;s weaknesses and failings, and just that spice of devilry and uncertainty
  in him which was pleasing to a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So unreliable, my dear Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont,&rdquo; came in insinuating
  accents from Lady Eglinton. &ldquo;Look at his lengthy entanglement with
  Mlle. de Saint Romans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie gave a start sudden; had she spoken her thoughts out loudly whilst
  her own mind was buried in happy retrospect? She must have been dreaming
  momentarily certainly, and must have been strangely absent-minded, for she
  was quite unconscious of having descended the alcove steps until she found
  herself walking between Lord Eglinton and his odious mother, in the direction
  of the corridors, whilst milady went prattling on with irritating monotony:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would find such support in my son. The Chevalier de Saint George&mdash;er&mdash;I
  mean the King of England&mdash;trusts him absolutely, you understand&mdash;they
  have been friends since boyhood. Harry would do more for him if he could,
  but he has not the power. Now as Comptroller of Finance&mdash;you understand?
  You have such sympathy with the Stuart pretensions, Mademoiselle, and a union
  of sympathies would do much towards furthering the success of so just a cause;
  and if my son&mdash;you understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie&rsquo;s ears were buzzing with the incessant chatter. Had she not
  been so absorbed in her thoughts she would have laughed at the absurdity
  of the whole thing. This insignificant nonentity beside her, with the strength
  and character of a chicken, pushed into a place of influence and power by
  that hen-like mother, and she&mdash;Lydie&mdash;lending a hand to this installation
  of a backboneless weakling to the highest position of France!</p>
  <p>The situation would have been supremely ridiculous were it not for the element
  of pathos in it&mdash;the pathos of a young life which might have been so
  brilliant, so full of activity and interest, now tied to the apron-strings
  of an interfering mother.</p>
  <p>Lydie herself, though accustomed to rule in one of the widest spheres that
  ever fell to woman&rsquo;s lot, wielded her sceptre with discretion and tact.
  In these days when the King was ruled by Pompadour, when Mme. du Ch&acirc;telet
  swayed the mind of Voltaire, and Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se subjugated the
  Hungarians, there was nothing of the blatant petticoat government in Lydie&rsquo;s
  influence over her father. The obtrusive domination of a woman like milady
  was obnoxious and abhorrent to her mind, proud of its feminity, gentle in
  the consciousness of its strength.</p>
  <p>Now she feared that, forgetful of courtly manners, she might say or do something
  which would offend the redoubtable lady. There was still the whole length
  of the banqueting-hall to traverse, also the corridor, before she could hope
  to be released from so unwelcome a companionship.</p>
  <p>Apparently unconscious of having roused Lydie&rsquo;s disapproval, milady
  continued to prattle. Her subject of conversation was still her son, and
  noting that his attention seemed to be wandering, she called to him in her
  imperious voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Harry! Harry!&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;Am I to to be your
  spokesman from first to last? Ah!&rdquo; she added, with a sigh, &ldquo;men
  are not what they were when I was wooed and won. What say you, my dear Mlle.
  Lydie? The age of chivalry, of doughty deeds and bold adventures, is indeed
  past and gone, else a young man of Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s advantages would
  not depute his own mother to do his courting for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shriek of laughter which threatened to be hysterical rose to Lydie&rsquo;s
  throat. How gladly would she have beaten a precipitate retreat. Unfortunately
  the room was crowded with people, who unconsciously impeded progress. She
  turned and looked at &ldquo;le petit Anglais,&rdquo; the sorry hero of this
  prosaic wooing, wondering what was his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in this silly, childish
  intrigue. She met his gentle eyes fixed upon hers with a look which somehow
  reminded her of a St. Bernard dog that she had once possessed; there was
  such a fund of self-deprecation, such abject apology in the look, that she
  felt quite unaccountably sorry for him, and the laughter died before it reached
  her lips.</p>
  <p>Something prompted her to try and reassure him; the same feeling would have
  caused her to pat the head of her dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I feel sure,&rdquo; she said kindly, &ldquo;that Lord Eglinton will
  have no need of a proxy once he sets his mind on serious wooing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is serious!&rdquo; retorted Lady Eglinton testily. Lydie
  shook her head:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As little serious as his lordship&rsquo;s desire to control the finances
  of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! but who better fitted for the post than my son. He is so rich&mdash;the
  richest man in France, and in these days of bribery and corruption&mdash;you
  understand, and&mdash;and being partly English&mdash;not wholly, I am thankful
  to say&mdash;for I abominate the English myself; but we must own that they
  are very shrewd where money is concerned&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, milady,&rdquo; said Lydie irritably, &ldquo;will
  you not allow your son to know his own mind? If he has a request to place
  before M. le Duc my father or before me, let him do so for himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont is right,&rdquo; here
  interposed Lord Eglinton gently. &ldquo;You will&mdash;er&mdash;I hope, excuse
  my mother, Mademoiselle; she is so used to my consulting her in everything
  that perhaps&mdash; You see,&rdquo; he continued in his nervous halting,
  way, &ldquo;I&mdash;I am rather stupid and I am very lazy; she thinks I should
  understand finance, because I&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t believe I should; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her earnest eyes, fixed with good-humoured indulgence upon his anxious face,
  seemed to upset him altogether. His throat was dry, and his tongue felt as
  if it were several sizes too large for his parched mouth. For the moment
  it looked as if the small modicum of courage which he possessed would completely
  give out, but noting that just for the moment his mother was engaged in exchanging
  hasty greetings with a friend, he seemed to make a violent and sudden effort,
  and with the audacity which sometimes assails the preternaturally weak, he
  plunged wildly into his subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no desire for positions which I am too stupid to fill,&rdquo; he
  said, speaking so rapidly that Lydie could hardly follow him; &ldquo;but,
  Mademoiselle, I entreat you do not believe that my admiration for you is
  not serious. I know I am quite unworthy to be even your lacquey, though I
  wouldn&rsquo;t mind being that, since it would bring me sometimes near you.
  Please, please, don&rsquo;t look at me&mdash;I am such a clumsy fool, and
  I daresay I am putting things all wrong! My mother says,&rdquo; he added,
  with a pathetic little sigh, &ldquo;that I shall spoil everything if I open
  my mouth, and now I have done it, and you are angry, and I wish to God somebody
  would come and give me a kick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, flushed, panting and excited, having come to the end of his courage,
  whilst Lydie did not know if she should be angry or sorry. A smile hovered
  round her lips, yet she would gladly have seen some manlike creature administer
  chastisement to this foolish weakling. Her keenly analytical mind flew at
  once to comparisons.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville&mdash;and now this poor specimen of manhood! She had
  twice been wooed in this self-same room within half an hour; but how different
  had been the methods of courting. A look of indulgence for the weak, a flash
  of pride for the strong, quickly lit up her statuesque face. It was the strong
  who had won, though womanlike, she felt a kindly pity for him who did not
  even dare to ask for that which the other had so boldly claimed as his right&mdash;her
  love.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, which was rapidly
  becoming embarrassing&mdash;for she really did not know how to reply to this
  strange and halting profession of love&mdash;was at last drawing to a close.
  At the end of the corridor Charles Edward Stuart, surrounded by a group of
  friends, had caught sight of her, and with gracious courtesy he advanced
  to meet her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! the gods do indeed favour us,&rdquo; he said gallantly in answer
  to her respectful salute, and nodding casually to Lady Eglinton, who had
  bobbed him a grudging curtsey, &ldquo;We feared that our enemy, Time, treading
  hard on our heels, would force us to depart ere we had greeted our Muse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty is leaving us?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! the hour is late. We start to-morrow at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God speed you, Sire!&rdquo; she said fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To my death,&rdquo; he rejoined gloomily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To victory, Sire, and your Majesty&rsquo;s own kingdom!&rdquo; she
  retorted cheerily. &ldquo;Nay! I, your humble, yet most faithful adherent,
  refuse to be cast down to-night. See,&rdquo; she added, pointing to the group
  of gentlemen who had remained discreetly in the distance, &ldquo;you have
  brave hearts to cheer you, brave swords to help you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would I were sure of a brave ship to rescue me and them if I fail!&rdquo; he
  murmured.</p>
  <p>She tossed her head with a characteristic movement of impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I was determined not to speak of failure to-night, Sire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet must I think of it,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;since the lives
  of my friends are dependent on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They give their lives gladly for your cause.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would prefer to think that a good ship from France was ready to
  take them aboard if evil luck force us to flee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;France has promised you that ship, Monseigneur,&rdquo; she said earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If France meant you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;I
  would believe in her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She almost means Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont!&rdquo; retorted the young
  girl, with conscious pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for a moment,&rdquo; broke in Lady Eglinton spitefully; &ldquo;but
  girls marry,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and every husband may not be willing
  to be held under the sway of satin petticoats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If France fails you, Monseigneur,&rdquo; here interposed a gentle
  voice, &ldquo;I have already had the honour of assuring you that there is
  enough Eglinton money still in the country to fit out a ship for your safety;
  and&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as if ashamed of this outburst, the second of which he had been guilty
  to-night, &ldquo;le petit Anglais&rdquo; once more relapsed into silence.
  But Lydie threw him a look of encouragement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well spoken, milor!&rdquo; she said approvingly.</p>
  <p>With her quick intuition she had already perceived that milady was displeased,
  and she took a malicious pleasure in dragging Lord Eglinton further into
  the conversation. She knew quite well that milady cared naught about the
  Stuarts or their fate. From the day of her marriage she had dissociated herself
  from the cause, for the furtherance of which her husband&rsquo;s father had
  given up home and country.</p>
  <p>It was her influence which had detached the late Lord Eglinton from the
  fortunes of the two Pretenders; justly, perhaps, since the expeditions were
  foredoomed to failure, and Protestant England rightly or wrongly mistrusted
  all the Stuarts. But Lydie&rsquo;s romantic instincts could not imagine an
  Englishman in any other capacity save as the champion of the forlorn cause;
  one of the principal reasons why she had always disliked the Eglintons was
  because they held themselves aloof from the knot of friends who gathered
  round Charles Edward.</p>
  <p>She was, therefore, not a little surprised to hear &ldquo;le petit Anglais&rdquo; promising
  at least loyal aid and succour in case of disaster, since he could not give
  active support to the proposed expedition. That he had made no idle boast
  when he spoke of Eglinton money she knew quite well, nor was it said in vain
  arrogance, merely as a statement of fact. Milady&rsquo;s vexation proved
  that it was true.</p>
  <p>Delighted and eager, she threw herself with all the ardour of her romantic
  impulses into this new train of thought suggested by Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s
  halting speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, milor,&rdquo; she said joyously, and not heeding Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s
  scowl, &ldquo;now that I have an ally in you my dream can become a reality.
  Nay, Sire, you shall start for England with every hope, every assurance of
  success, but if you fail, you and those you care for shall be safe. Will
  you listen to my plan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Willingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Eglinton is your friend&mdash;at least, you trust him, do you
  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trust absolutely in the loyalty of his house toward mine,&rdquo; replied
  Charles Edward unhesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do you agree with him, and with him alone, on a spot in England
  or Scotland where a ship would find you in case of failure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That has been done already,&rdquo; said Eglinton simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if ill-luck pursues us, we will make straight for that spot and
  await salvation from France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie said no more; she was conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment
  that her own plan should have been forestalled. She had fondled the notion,
  born but a moment ago, that if her own influence were not sufficiently great
  in the near future to induce King Louis to send a rescue ship for the Young
  Pretender if necessary, she could then, with Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s money,
  fit out a private expedition and snatch the last of the Stuarts from the
  vengeance of his enemies. The romantic idea had appealed to her, and she
  had been forestalled. She tried to read the thoughts of those around her.
  Lady Eglinton was evidently ignorant of the details of the plan; she seemed
  surprised and vastly disapproving. Charles Edward was whispering a few hasty
  words in the ear of his friend, whom obviously he trusted more than he did
  the word of France or the enthusiasm of Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Le petit Anglais&rdquo; had relapsed into his usual state of nervousness,
  and his eyes wandered uneasily from Lydie&rsquo;s face to that of his royal
  companion, whilst with restless fingers he fidgeted the signet ring which
  adorned his left hand. Suddenly he slipped the ring off and Charles Edward
  Stuart examined it very attentively, then returned it to its owner with a
  keen look of intelligence and a nod of approval.</p>
  <p>Lydie was indeed too late with her romantic plan; these two men had thought
  it all out before her in every detail&mdash;even to the ring. She, too, had
  thought of a token which would be an assurance to the fugitives that they
  might trust the bearer thereof. She felt quite childishly vexed at all this.
  It was an unusual thing in France these days to transact serious business
  without consulting Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are taking it for granted, Sire, that France will fail you?&rdquo; she
  said somewhat testily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! why should you say that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! the ring&mdash;the obvious understanding between you and milor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it not your wish, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! a mere suggestion&mdash;in case France failed you, and I were
  powerless to remind her of her promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pa ma foi,&rdquo; he rejoined gallantly, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll
  command me, I&rsquo;ll believe that contingency to be impossible. The whole
  matter of the ring is a whim of Eglinton&rsquo;s, and I swear that I&rsquo;ll
  only trust to France and to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she said quickly, her own sound common sense coming
  to the rescue just in time to rout the unreasoning petulance of a while ago,
  which truly had been unworthy of her. &ldquo;It was foolish of me to taunt,
  and I pray your Majesty&rsquo;s forgiveness. It would have been joy and pride
  to me to feel that the plans for your Majesty&rsquo;s safety had been devised
  by me, but I gladly recognize that milor Eglinton hath in this matter the
  prior claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her little speech was delivered so simply and with such a noble air of self-effacement
  that it is small wonder that Charles Edward could but stand in speechless
  admiration before her. She looked such an exquisite picture of proud and
  self-reliant womanhood, as she stood there, tall and erect, the stiff folds
  of her white satin gown surrounding her like a frame of ivory round a dainty
  miniature. Tears of enthusiasm were in her eyes, her lips were parted with
  a smile of encouragement, her graceful head, thrown slightly back and crowned
  with the burnished gold of her hair, stood out in perfect relief against
  the soft-toned gold and veined marble of the walls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the Young Pretender at last, &ldquo;do
  not render my departure too difficult by showing me so plainly all that I
  relinquish when I quit the fair shores of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty leaves many faithful hearts in Versailles, none the
  less true because they cannot follow you. Nay! but methinks Lord Eglinton
  and I will have to make a pact of friendship, so that when your Majesty hath
  gone we might often speak of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak of me often and to the King,&rdquo; rejoined Charles Edward,
  with a quick return to his former mood. &ldquo;I have a premonition that
  I shall have need of his help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he bowed before her, and she curtsyed very low until her young head
  was almost down to the level of his knees. He took her hand and kissed it
  with the respect due to an equal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Farewell, Sire, and God speed you!&rdquo; she murmured. He seemed
  quite reluctant to go. Gloom had once more completely settled over his spirits,
  and Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont, clad all in white like some graceful statue carved
  in marble, seemed to him the figure of Hope on which a relentless fate forced
  him to turn his back.</p>
  <p>His friends now approached and surrounded him. Some were leaving Versailles
  and France with him on the morrow, others accompanied him in spirit only
  with good wishes and anxious sighs. Charles Edward Stuart, the unfortunate
  descendant of an unfortunate race, turned with a final appealing look to
  the man he trusted most.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be not a broken reed to me, Eglinton,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;Try
  and prevent France from altogether forgetting me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie averted her head in order to hide the tears of pity which had risen
  to her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, unfortunate Prince! if thine only prop is this poor weakling
  whose dog-like affection has no moral strength to give it support!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When she turned once more toward him, ready to bid him a final adieu, he
  was walking rapidly away from her down the long narrow corridor, leaning
  on Eglinton&rsquo;s arm and closely surrounded by his friends. In the far
  distance King Louis the Well-beloved strolled leisurely toward his departing
  guest, leaning lightly on the arm of Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Last Trick</b></h2>
  <p>The noise of talk and laughter still filled the old ch&acirc;teau from end
  to end. Though the special guest of the evening had departed and royalty
  no longer graced the proceedings, since His Majesty had driven away to Versailles
  after having bidden adieu to the Chevalier de Saint George, M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s
  less important visitors showed no signs as yet of wishing to break up this
  convivial night.</p>
  <p>The sound of dance music filled the air, and from the <i>salle d&rsquo;armes</i> the
  merry strains of the gavotte, the tripping of innumerable feet, the incessant
  buzz of young voices, reached the more distant corridor like an echo from
  fairyland.</p>
  <p>Lydie had remained quite a little while leaning against the cool marble
  wall, watching with eager intentness the group of gallant English and Scotch
  gentlemen congregated round their young Prince. Louis the Well-beloved, with
  that graciousness peculiar to all the Bourbons, had, severally and individually
  bidden &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to all. Each in turn had kissed the podgy
  white hand of the King of France, who had been so benignant a host to them
  all. None understood better than Louis XV, the art of leaving a pleasing
  impression on the mind of a departing friend. He had a smile, a jest, a word
  of encouragement for each whilst Jeanne de Pompadour, with one dainty hand
  on the King&rsquo;s shoulder, the other flirting her fan, emphasized each
  token of royal goodwill and of royal favour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! milor Dunkeld, a pleasing journey to you. M. le Marquis de Perth,
  I pray you do not, amidst the fogs of England, forget the sunshine of France.
  Sir Andr&eacute; Seafield, your absence will bring many tears to a pair of
  blue eyes I wot of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pronounced the foreign names with dainty affectation, and Louis had
  much ado to keep his eyes away from that bright, smiling face, and those
  ever-recurring dimples. Lydie felt a strange nausea at sight of these noble,
  high-born gentlemen paying such reverential homage to the low-born adventuress,
  and a deep frown appeared between her eyes when she saw Charles Edward Stuart
  bending as low before Jeanne Poisson as he had done just now before her&mdash;Lydie,
  daughter of the Duc d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>Bah! what did it matter, after all? This world of irresponsible butterflies,
  of petty machinations and self-seeking intrigues: would she not quit it to-morrow
  for a land of poetry and romance, where women wield no sceptre save that
  of beauty, and where but one ruler is acknowledged and his name is Love?</p>
  <p>She made a strenuous attempt to detach herself mentally from her surroundings;
  with a great effort of her will she succeeded in losing sight of the individuality
  of all these people round her. Lady Eglinton still talking at random beside
  her, Mme. de Pompadour yielding her hand to the kiss of a Stuart Prince,
  that fat and pompous man, whom duty bade her call &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; all
  became mere puppets&mdash;dolls that laughed and chatted and danced, hanging
  on invisible strings, which the mighty hand of some grim giant was dangling
  for the amusement of his kind.</p>
  <p>How paltry it seemed all at once! What did it matter if France was ruled
  by that vapid King or by that brainless, overdressed woman beside him? What
  did it matter if that young man with the shifty blue eyes and the fair, curly
  hair succeeded in ousting another man from the English throne?</p>
  <p>What did matter was that Gaston was not faithless, that he loved her, and
  that she had felt the sweetness of a first kiss!</p>
  <p>Happily back in dreamland now, she could once more afford to play her part
  amongst the marionettes. She was willing to yield the string which made her
  dance and talk and move into the hands of the fiercely humorous giant up
  aloft. No doubt it was he who pulled her along the corridor, made her join
  the group that congregated round departing royalty.</p>
  <p>M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont&mdash;the perfect courtier and gentleman&mdash;was
  already formulating his adieux. His Majesty the King of France would, by
  the rigid rule of etiquette, be the first to leave. Accompanied by Mme. de
  Pompadour and followed by M. le Duc, he was commencing his progress down
  the monumental staircase which led to the great entrance hall below.</p>
  <p>Lydie, still made to move no doubt by that invisible giant hand, found it
  quite simple and easy to mingle with the crowd, to take the King&rsquo;s
  arm, being his hostess, whilst M. le Duc her father and Mme. de Pompadour
  followed close behind.</p>
  <p>With her spirit wandering in dreamland, she was naturally somewhat distraite&mdash;not
  too much so, only sufficiently to cause Louis XV to make comparisons betwixt
  his sprightly Jeanne and this animated statue, whose cold little hand rested
  so impassively on the satin of his coat.</p>
  <p>At the foot of the perron the King&rsquo;s Flemish horses, as round of body
  and heavy of gait as himself, were impatiently pawing the ground. The opening
  of the great gates sent a wave of sweet-scented air into the overheated ch&acirc;teau.
  Lydie was glad that her duty demanded that she should accompany the King
  down the steps to the door of his coach. The cool night breeze fanned her
  cheeks most pleasingly, the scent of June roses and of clove carnations filled
  the air, and from below the terraced gardens there came the softly-murmuring
  ripple of the Seine, winding her graceful curves toward the mighty city of
  Paris beyond.</p>
  <p>Far away to the east, beyond the grim outline of cedar and poplar trees,
  a fair crescent moon appeared, chaste and cold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An emblem of our fair hostess to-night,&rdquo; said Louis with clumsy
  gallantry and pointing up to the sky, as Lydie bent her tall figure and kissed
  the royal hand.</p>
  <p>Then she stood aside, having made a cold bow to Mme. de Pompadour; the fair
  Marquise was accompanying His Majesty to Versailles; she stepped into the
  coach beside him, surrounded by murmurs of flattery and adulation. Even Charles
  Edward made her a final speech of somewhat forced gallantry; he was the last
  to kiss her hand, and Lydie could almost hear the softly whispered words
  of entreaty with which he bade her not to forget.</p>
  <p>And Jeanne Poisson&mdash;daughter of a kitchen wench&mdash;was condescendingly
  gracious to a Stuart Prince; then she calmly waved him aside, whilst the
  King apparently was content to wait, and called Lady Eglinton to the door
  of the coach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are wasting too much time,&rdquo; she whispered quickly; &ldquo;an
  you don&rsquo;t hurry now, you will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At last the departure was effected; the crowd, with backbone bent and tricornes
  sweeping the ground, waited in that uncomfortable position until the gilded
  coach and the men in gorgeous blue and gold liveries were swallowed in the
  gloom of the chestnut avenue; then it broke up into isolated groups. Lydie
  had done her duty as hostess; she had taken such leave as etiquette demanded
  from Charles Edward Stuart and his friends. Coaches and chairs came up to
  the perron in quick succession now, bearing the adventurers away on this,
  the first stage of their hazardous expedition. When would they sup again
  in such luxury? when would the frou-frou of silk, the flutter of fans, the
  sound of dance music once more pleasantly tickle their ears? To-morrow, and
  for many a long day to come it would be hurried meals in out-of-the-way places,
  the call to horse, the clink of arms.</p>
  <p>Puppets! puppets all! for what did it matter?</p>
  <p>Lydie would have loved to have lingered out on the terrace awhile longer.
  The oak-leaved geraniums down at the foot of the terrace steps threw an intoxicating
  lemon-scented fragrance in the air, the row of stunted orange trees still
  bore a few tardy blossoms, and in the copse yonder, away from the din and
  the bustle made by the marionettes, it must be delicious to wander on the
  carpet of moss and perchance to hear the melancholy note of a nightingale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think not, Mademoiselle, that this night air is treacherous?&rdquo; said
  Lord Eglinton, with his accustomed diffidence. &ldquo;You seem to be shivering;
  will you allow me the honour of bringing your cloak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thanked him quite kindly. Somehow his gentle voice did not jar on her
  mood. Since Gaston was not there, she felt that she would sooner have this
  unobtrusive, pleasant man beside her than any one else. He seemed to have
  something womanish and tender in his feeble nature which his mother lacked.
  Perhaps milady had divested herself of her natural attributes in order to
  grace her son with them, since she had been unable to instil more manly qualities
  into him.</p>
  <p>But Lydie&rsquo;s heart ached for a sight of Gaston. The clock in the tower
  of the old ch&acirc;teau chimed the hour before midnight. It was but half
  an hour since she had parted from him on the steps of the alcove; she remembered
  quite distinctly hearing the bracket clock close by strike half-past ten,
  at the same moment as Pompadour&rsquo;s shrill laugh broke upon her ear.</p>
  <p>Half an hour? Why, it seemed a lifetime since then; and while she had made
  her bow to the Stuart Prince and then to King Louis, while she had allowed
  the unseen giant to move her from place to place on a string, perhaps Gaston
  had been seeking for her, perhaps his heart had longed for her too, and a
  sting of jealousy of her multifarious social duties was even now marring
  the glory of happy memories.</p>
  <p>Without another moment&rsquo;s hesitation she turned her back on the peaceful
  gloom of the night, on the silver crescent moon, the fragrance of carnations
  and orange-blossoms, and walked quickly up the perron steps with a hasty: &ldquo;You
  are right, milor, the night air is somewhat chilling and my guests will be
  awaiting me,&rdquo; thrown over her shoulder at her bashful cavalier.</p>
  <p>Beyond the noble entrance doors the vast hall was now practically deserted,
  save for a group of flunkeys, gorgeous and solemn, who stood awaiting the
  departure of their respective masters. At the farther end which led to the
  main corridor, Lydie, to her chagrin, caught sight of Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s
  brobdingnagian back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What an obsession!&rdquo; she sighed, and hoped that milady would
  fail to notice her. Already she was planning hasty flight along a narrow
  passage, when a question authoritatively put by her ladyship to a magnificent
  person clad in a purple livery with broad white facings arrested her attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is your master still in the boudoir, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;I
  have not seen M. le Comte since half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The purple livery with broad white facings was that of the Comte de Stainville.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a message for M. le Comte from Mme. de Pompadour,&rdquo; said
  Lady Eglinton carelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she turned into the great corridor.</p>
  <p>Lydie no longer thought of flight; an unexplainable impulse caught her to
  change her mind, and to follow in Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s wake. She could not
  then have said if &ldquo;le petit Anglais&rdquo; was still near her not.
  She had for the moment forgotten his insignificant existence.</p>
  <p>There was an extraordinary feeling of unreality about herself and her movements,
  about the voluminous person ahead clad in large-flowered azure brocade and
  closely followed by a stiff automaton in purple and white; they seemed to
  be leading her along some strange and unexpected paths, at the end of which
  Lydie somehow felt sure that grinning apes would be awaiting her.</p>
  <p>Anon Lady Eglinton paused, with her hand on the handle of a door; she caught
  sight of Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont and seemed much surprised to see her there.
  She called to her by name, in that harsh voice which Lydie detested, whilst
  the obsequious automaton came forward and relieved her from the trouble of
  turning that handle herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow me, milady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door flew open, the flunkey at the same moment also drew a heavy curtain
  aside.</p>
  <p>Lydie had just come up quite close, in answer to Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s call.
  She was standing facing the door when B&eacute;n&eacute;dict threw it open,
  announcing with mechanical correctness of attitude:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton, M. le Comte!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first Lydie only saw Gaston as he turned to face the intruders. His face
  was flushed, and he muttered a quickly-suppressed oath. But already she had
  guessed, even before Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s strident voice had set her every
  nerve a-tingling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. de Saint Romans!&rdquo; said milady, with a shrill laugh, &ldquo;a
  thousand pardons! I had a message from Mme. de Pompadour for M. le Comte
  de Stainville, and thought to find him alone. A thousand pardons, I beg&mdash;the
  intrusion was involuntary&mdash;and the message unimportant&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
  deliver it when Monsieur is less pleasantly engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie at that moment could not have stirred one limb, if her very life had
  depended on a movement from her. The feeling of unreality had gone. It was
  no longer that. It was a grim, hideous, awful reality. That beautiful woman
  there was reality, and real, too, were the glowing eyes that flashed defiance
  at milady, the lips parted for that last kiss which the flunkey&rsquo;s voice
  had interrupted, the stray black curls which had escaped from the trammels
  of the elaborate coiffure and lay matted on the damp forehead.</p>
  <p>And those roses, too, which had adorned her corsage, now lying broken and
  trampled on the floor, the candles burning dimly in their sockets, and Gaston&rsquo;s
  look of wrath, quickly followed by one of fear&mdash;all&mdash;all that was
  real!</p>
  <p>Real to the awful shame of it all&mdash;milady&rsquo;s sneer of triumph,
  the oath which had risen to Gaston&rsquo;s lips, the wooden figure of the
  lacquey standing impassive at the door!</p>
  <p>Instinctively Lydie&rsquo;s hand flew to her lips; oh, that she could have
  wiped out the last, lingering memory of that kiss. She, the proud and reserved
  vestal, a Diana chaste and cold, with lips now for ever polluted by contact
  with those of a liar. A liar, a traitor, a sycophant! She lashed her haughty
  spirit into fury, the better to feel the utter degradation of her own abasement.</p>
  <p>She did not speak. What could she say! One look at Gaston&rsquo;s face and
  she understood that her humiliation was complete; his eyes did not even seek
  her pardon, they expressed neither sorrow nor shame, only impotent wrath
  and fear of baffled ambition. Not before all these people would she betray
  herself, before that beautiful rival, or that vulgar <i>intrigante</i>, not
  before Gaston or his lacquey, and beyond that mechanical movement of hand
  to lips, beyond one short flash of unutterable pride and contempt, she remained
  silent and rigid, whilst her quick eyes took in a complete mental vision
  of that never to-be-forgotten picture&mdash;the dimly-lighted boudoir, the
  defiant figure of Ir&egrave;ne de Saint Romans, the crushed roses on the
  floor.</p>
  <p>Then with a heart-broken sigh unheard by the other actors in this moving
  tableaux, and covering her face with her hands, she began to walk rapidly
  down the corridor.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  The Winning Hand</b></h2>
  <p>But Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont had not gone five paces before she heard a quick,
  sharp call, followed by the rustle of silk on the marble floor.</p>
  <p>The next moment she felt a firm, hot grip on her wrist, and her left hand
  was forcibly drawn away from her face, whilst an eager voice spoke quick,
  vehement words, the purport of which failed at first to reach her brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall not go, Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont,&rdquo; were the first coherent
  words which she seemed to understand&mdash;&ldquo;you cannot&mdash;it is
  not just, not fair until you have heard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing which I need hear,&rdquo; interrupted Lydie coldly,
  the moment she realized that it was Ir&egrave;ne de Saint Romans who was
  addressing her; &ldquo;and I pray you to let me go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but you shall hear, you must!&rdquo; rejoined the other without
  releasing her grasp on the young girl&rsquo;s wrist. Her hand was hot, and
  her fingers had the strength of intense excitement. Lydie could not free
  herself, strive how she might.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you not see that this is most unfair?&rdquo; continued Ir&egrave;ne
  with great volubility. &ldquo;Am I to be snubbed like some kitchen wench
  caught kissing behind doorways? Look at milady Eglinton and her ill-natured
  sneer. I&rsquo;ll not tolerate it, nor your looks of proud contempt! I&rsquo;ll
  not&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not! Gaston! Gaston!&rdquo; she now exclaimed, turning
  to de Stainville, who was standing, silent and sullen, whilst he saw his
  wife gradually lashing herself into wrathful agitation at his own indifference
  and Lydie&rsquo;s cold disdain. &ldquo;If you have a spark of courage left
  in you, tell that malicious <i>intrigante</i> and this scornful minx that
  if I were to spend the whole evening in the boudoir <i>en t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
  you, aye! and behind closed doors if I chose who shall have a word to say,
  when I am in the company of my own husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ejaculation came from Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s astonished lips. Lydie had
  not stirred. She did not seem to have heard, and certainly Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s
  triumphant announcement left her as cold, as impassive as before. What did
  it matter, after all, what special form Gaston&rsquo;s lies to her had assumed?
  Nothing that he or Ir&egrave;ne said or did could add to his baseness and
  infamy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, my husband, milady!&rdquo; continued the other more calmly,
  as she finally released Lydie&rsquo;s wrist and cast it, laughing, from her. &ldquo;I
  am called Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, and will be called so in the future
  openly. Now you may rejoin your guests, Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont; my reputation
  stands as far beyond reproach as did your own before you spent a mysterious
  half hour with my husband behind the curtains of an alcove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned to de Stainville, who, in spite of his wife&rsquo;s provocative
  attitude, had remained silent, cursing the evil fate which had played him
  this trick, cursing the three women who were both the cause and the witnesses
  of his discomfiture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your arm, Gaston!&rdquo; she said peremptorily; &ldquo;and you, Benedict,
  call your master&rsquo;s coach and my chair. Mlle. d&rsquo;Aumont, your servant.
  If I have been the means of dissipating a happy illusion, you may curse me
  now, but you will bless me to-morrow. Gaston has been false to you&mdash;he
  is not over true to me&mdash;but he is my husband, and as such I must claim
  him. For the sake of his schemes, of his ambitions, I kept our marriage a
  secret so that he might rise to higher places than I had the power to give
  him. When your disdainful looks classed me with a flirty kitchen-wench I
  rebelled at last. I trust that you are proud enough not to vent your disappointment
  on Gaston; but if you do, &rsquo;tis no matter; I&rsquo;ll find means of
  consoling him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made the young girl a low and sweeping curtesy in the most approved
  style demanded by the elabourate etiquette of the time. There was a gleam
  of mocking triumph in her eyes, which she did not attempt to conceal, and
  which suddenly stung Lydie&rsquo;s pride to the quick.</p>
  <p>It is strange indeed that often at a moment when a woman&rsquo;s whole happiness
  is destroyed with one blow, when a gigantic cataclysm revolutionises with
  one fell swoop her entire mode of thought, dispels all her dreams and shatters
  her illusions, it is always the tiny final pin-prick which causes her the
  most acute pain and influences the whole of her subsequent conduct.</p>
  <p>It was Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s mocking curtsey which roused Lydie from her
  mental torpor, because it brought her&mdash;as it were&mdash;in actual physical
  contact with all that she would have to endure openly in the future, as apart
  from the hidden misery of her heart.</p>
  <p>Gaston&rsquo;s shamed face was no longer the only image which seared her
  eyes and brain. The world, her own social world, seemed all at once to reawaken
  before her. That world would sneer even as Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville sneered;
  it would laugh at and enjoy her own discomfiture. She&mdash;Lydie d&rsquo;Aumont&mdash;the
  proud and influential daughter of the Prime Minister of France, whom flatterers
  and sycophants approached mentally on bended knees, for whom suitors hardly
  dared even to sigh, she had been tricked and fooled like any silly country
  mouse whose vanity had led to her own abasement.</p>
  <p>Half an hour ago in the fullness of her newly-found happiness she had flaunted
  her pride and her love before those who hated and envied her. To-morrow&mdash;nay,
  within an hour&mdash;this humiliating scene would be the talk of Paris and
  Versailles. Lydie&rsquo;s burning ears seemed even now to hear the Pompadour
  retailing it with many embellishments, which would bring a coarse laugh to
  the lips of the King and an ill-natured jest to those of her admirers; she
  could hear the jabbering crowd, could feel the looks of compassion or sarcasm
  aimed at her as soon at this tit-bit of society scandal had been bruited
  abroad.</p>
  <p>The scene itself had become real and vivid to her; the marble corridor,
  the flickering candles, the flunkey&rsquo;s impassive face; she understood
  that the beautiful woman before her was in fact and deed the wife of Gaston
  de Stainville. She even contrived to perceive the humour of Lady Eglinton&rsquo;s
  completely bewildered expression, the blank astonishment of her round, bulgy
  eyes, and close to her she saw &ldquo;le petit Anglais,&rdquo; self-effaced
  as usual, and looking almost as guilty, as shamefaced as Gaston.</p>
  <p>Lydie turned to him and placed a cool, steady hand upon his sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse de Stainville,&rdquo; she then said with perfect
  calm, &ldquo;I fear me I must beg of your courtesy to tarry awhile longer,
  whilst I offer you an explanation to which I feel you are entitled. Just
  now I was somewhat surprised because your news was sudden&mdash;and it is
  my turn to ask your pardon, although my fault&mdash;if fault there be&mdash;rests
  on a misapprehension. M. le Comte de Stainville&rsquo;s amours or his marriage
  are no concern of mine. True, he begged for my influence and fawned upon
  my favour just now, for his ambition soared to the post of High Controller
  of the Finances of France. That appointment rests with the Duc, my father,
  who no doubt will bestow it on him whom he thinks most worthy. But it were
  not fair to me, if you left me now thinking that the announcement of your
  union with a gentleman whose father was the friend of mine could give me
  aught but pleasure. Permit me to congratulate you, Madame, on the choice
  of a lord and master, a helpmeet no doubt. You are indeed well matched. I
  am all the more eager to offer you my good wishes as I have been honoured
  to-night with a proposal which has greatly flattered me. My lord the Marquis
  of Eglinton has asked me to be his wife!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more she turned her head toward the young Englishman and challenged
  a straight look from his eyes. He did not waver and she was satisfied. Her
  instinct had not misled her, for he expressed no astonishment, only a sort
  of dog-like gratitude and joy as, having returned her gaze quite firmly,
  he now slowly raised his arm bringing her hand on a level with his lips.</p>
  <p>Lady Eglinton also displayed sufficient presence of mind not to show any
  surprise. She perhaps alone of all those present fully realized that Lydie
  had been wounded to the innermost depths of her heart, and that she herself
  owed her own and her son&rsquo;s present triumph to the revolt of mortified
  pride.</p>
  <p>What Gaston thought and felt exactly it were difficult to say. He held women
  in such slight esteem, and his own vanity was receiving so severe a blow,
  that, no doubt, he preferred to think that Lydie, like himself, had no power
  of affection and merely bestowed her heart there where self-interest called.</p>
  <p>Ir&egrave;ne, on the other hand, heaved a sigh of relief; the jealous suspicions
  which had embittered the last few days were at last dispelled. Hers was a
  simple, shallow nature that did not care to look beyond the obvious. She
  certainly appeared quite pleased at Lydie&rsquo;s announcement, and if remorse
  at her precipitancy did for one brief second mar the fullness of her joy,
  she quickly cast it from her, not having yet had time to understand the future
  and more serious consequences of her impulsive avowal.</p>
  <p>She wanted to go up to Lydie and to offer her vapid expressions of goodwill,
  but Gaston, heartily tired of the prolongation of this scene, dragged her
  somewhat roughly away.</p>
  <p>From the far distance there came the cry of the flunkeys.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The chair of Mlle. de Saint Romans!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coach of M. le Comte de Stainville!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. B&eacute;n&eacute;dict, resplendent in purple and white, reappeared at
  the end of the corridor, with Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s hood and cloak. Gaston,
  with his wife on his arm, turned on his heel and quickly walked down the
  corridor.</p>
  <p>Milady, puzzled, bewildered, boundlessly overjoyed yet fearing to trust
  her luck too far, had just a sufficient modicum of tact left in her to retire
  discreetly within the boudoir.</p>
  <p>Lydie suddenly found herself alone in this wide corridor with the man whom
  she had so impulsively dragged into her life. She looked round her somewhat
  helplessly, and her eyes encountered those of her future lord fixed upon
  hers with that same air of dog-like gentleness which she knew so well and
  which always irritated her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; she said very coldly, &ldquo;I must thank you for your
  kind co&ouml;peration just now. That you expressed neither surprise nor resentment
  does infinite credit to your chivalry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I was a little surprised, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, haltingly, &ldquo;I
  was too overjoyed to show it, and&mdash;and I certainly felt no resentment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He came a step nearer to her. But for this she was not prepared, and drew
  back with a quick movement and a sudden stiffening of her figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you quite understood milor, that there is no desire on my
  part to hold you to this bond,&rdquo; she said icily. &ldquo;I am infinitely
  grateful to you for the kind way in which you humoured my impulse to-night,
  and if you will have patience with me but a very little while, I promise
  you that I will find an opportunity for breaking, without too great a loss
  of dignity, these bonds which already must be very irksome to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;you are under a
  misapprehension. Believe me, you would find it well-nigh impossible to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;to
  alter your plans now without loss of dignity, and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;I
  assure you that the bonds are not irksome to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would hold me to this bargain, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For your sake, Mademoiselle, as well as mine, we must now both be
  held to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems unfair on you, milor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On me, Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, on you,&rdquo; she repeated, with a thought more gentleness
  in her voice; &ldquo;you are young, milor; you are rich&mdash;soon you will
  regret the sense of honour which ties you to a woman who has only yielded
  her hand to you out of pique! Nay, I&rsquo;ll not deceive you,&rdquo; she
  added quickly, noting the sudden quiver of the kind little face at her stinging
  words. &ldquo;I have no love for you, milor&mdash;all that was young and
  fresh, womanly and tender in my heart was buried just here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a mournful look she glanced round at the cold marble of the walls,
  the open door to that boudoir beyond, the gilded sconces which supported
  the dimly-burning candles. Then, smitten with sudden remorse, she said eagerly,
  with one of those girlish impulses which rendered her domineering nature
  so peculiarly attractive:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But if I can give you no love, milor, Heaven and my father&rsquo;s
  indulgence have given me something which I know men hold far greater of importance
  than a woman&rsquo;s heart. I have influence, boundless influence, as you
  know&mdash;the State appointed Controller of Finance will be the virtual
  ruler of France, his position will give him power beyond the dreams of any
  man&rsquo;s ambition. My father will gladly give the post to my husband and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But here a somewhat trembling hand was held deprecatingly toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle, I entreat you,&rdquo; said Lord Eglinton softly, &ldquo;for
  the sake of your own dignity and&mdash;and mine, do not allow your mind to
  dwell on such matters. Believe me, I am fully conscious of the honour which
  you did me just now in deigning to place your trust in me. That I have&mdash;have
  loved you, Mlle. Lydie,&rdquo; he added, with a nervous quiver in his young
  voice, &ldquo;ever since I first saw you at this Court I&mdash;I cannot deny;
  but&rdquo;&mdash;and here he spoke more firmly, seeing that once again she
  seemed to draw away from him, to stiffen at his approach, &ldquo;but that
  simple and natural fact need not trouble you. I could not help loving you,
  for you are more beautiful than anything on earth, and you cannot deem my
  adoration an offence, though you are as cold and pure as the goddess of chastity
  herself. I have seen Catholics kneeling at the shrine of the Virgin Mary;
  their eyes were fixed up to her radiant image, their lips murmured an invocation
  or sometimes a hymn of praise. But their hands were clasped together; they
  never even raised them once toward that shrine which they had built for her,
  and from which she smiled whilst listening coldly to their prayers. Mlle.
  d&rsquo;Aumont, you need have no mistrust of my deep respect for you; you
  are the Madonna and I the humblest of your worshippers. I am proud to think
  that the name I bear will be the shrine wherein your pride will remain enthroned.
  If you have need of me in the future you must command me, but though the
  law of France will call me your husband and your lord, I will be your bondsman
  and serve you on my knees; and though my very soul aches for the mere touch
  of your hand, my lips will never pollute even the hem of your gown.&rdquo; His
  trembling voice had sunk down to a whisper. If she heard or not he could
  not say. From far away there came to his ears the tender melancholy drone
  of the instruments playing the slow movement of the gavotte. His Madonna
  had not stirred, only her hand which he so longed to touch trembled a little
  as she toyed with her fan.</p>
  <p>And, like the worshippers at the Virgin&rsquo;s shrine, he bent his knee
  and knelt at her feet.</p>

  The Statesman</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Beggar On Horseback</b></h2>
  <p>Monsieur le Marquis d&rsquo;Eglinton, Comptroller-General of Finance, Chevalier
  of the Order of St. Louis, Peer of England and of France, occupied the west
  wing of the Ch&acirc;teau of Versailles. His Majesty the King had frequent
  and urgent need of him; Mme. de Pompadour could scarce exist a day without
  an interview behind closed doors with the most powerful man in France: with
  him, who at the bidding of the nation, was set up as a bar to the extravagances
  of her own caprice.</p>
  <p>And <i>le petit lever</i> of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur was certainly more largely
  attended than that of M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, or even&mdash;softly be it
  whispered&mdash;than that of His Majesty himself. For although every one
  knew that M. le Marquis was but a figurehead, and that all graces and favours
  emanated direct from the hand of Mme. la Marquise Lydie, yet every one waited
  upon his good pleasure, for very much the same reason that those who expected
  or hoped something from the King invariably kissed the hand of Mme. de Pompadour.</p>
  <p>M. le Contr&ocirc;leur very much enjoyed these <i>petits levers</i> of his,
  which were considered the most important social events in Versailles. He
  was very fond of chocolate in the morning, and M. Achille&mdash;that prince
  of valets&mdash;brought it to his bedside with such inimitable grace and
  withal the beverage itself so aromatic and so hot, that this hour between
  ten and eleven each day had become extremely pleasant.</p>
  <p>He had no idea that being Comptroller-General of Finance was quite so easy
  and agreeable an occupation, else he had not been so diffident in accepting
  the post. But in reality it was very simple. He governed France from the
  depths of his extremely comfortable bed, draped all round with rich satin
  hangings of a soft azure colour, embroidered with <i>motifs</i> of dull gold,
  which were vastly pleasing to the eye. Here he was conscious of naught save
  fine linen of a remarkably silken texture, of a lace coverlet priceless in
  value, of the scent of his steaming chocolate, and incidentally of a good
  many pleasant faces, and some unamiable ones, and of a subdued hive-like
  buzz of talk, which went on at the further end of the room, whilst M. Achille
  administered to his comforts and Mme. de Pompadour or Mme. la Comtesse de
  Stainville told him piquant anecdotes.</p>
  <p>Yes, it was all very pleasant, and not at all difficult. A wave of the hand
  in the direction of Mme. la Marquise, his wife, who usually sat in a window
  embrasure overlooking the park, was all that was needed when petitioners
  were irksome or subjects too abstruse.</p>
  <p>Lydie was so clever with all that sort of thing. She had the mind of a politician
  and the astuteness of an attorney, and she liked to govern France in an energetic
  way of her own which left milor free of all responsibility if anything happened
  to go wrong.</p>
  <p>But then nothing ever did go wrong. France went on just the same as she
  had done before some of her more meddlesome Parliaments insisted on having
  a Comptroller of Finance at the head of affairs. Mme. de Pompadour still
  spent a great deal of money, and the King still invariably paid her debts;
  whereupon, his pockets being empty, he applied to M. le Contr&ocirc;leur
  for something with which to replenish them. M. le Contr&ocirc;leur thereupon
  ordered M. Achille to bring one more cup of aromatic chocolate for Mme. de
  Pompadour, whilst His Majesty the King spent an uncomfortable quarter of
  an hour with Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton.</p>
  <p>The usual result of this quarter of an hour was that His Majesty was excessively
  wrathful against Mme. Lydie for quite a fortnight; but no one could be angry
  with &ldquo;le petit Anglais,&rdquo; for he was so very amiable and dispensed
  such exceedingly good chocolate.</p>
  <p>Par ma foi! it is remarkably easy to govern a country if one happen to have
  a wife&mdash;that, at least, had been milor&rsquo;s experience&mdash;a wife
  and a perfect valet-de-chambre.</p>
  <p>M. Achille, since his Marquis&rsquo;s elevation to the most important position
  in France, had quite surpassed himself in his demeanour. He stood on guard
  beside the azure and gold hangings of his master&rsquo;s bed like a veritable
  gorgon, turning the most importunate petitioners to stone at sight of his
  severe and repressive visage.</p>
  <p>Oh! Achille was an invaluable asset in the governing of this kingdom of
  France. Achille knew the reason of each and every individual&rsquo;s presence
  at the <i>petit lever</i> of milor. He knew who was the most likely and most
  worthy person to fill any post in the country that happened to be vacant,
  from that of examiner of stars and planets to His Majesty the King down to
  that of under-scullion in the kitchen of Versailles.</p>
  <p>Had he not been the means of introducing Baptiste Durand to the special
  notice of M. le Marquis? Durand&rsquo;s daughter being girl-in-waiting to
  M. Joseph, valet-de-chambre to M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, and personal friend
  of M. Achille, what more natural than, when milor wanted a secretary to make
  notes for him, and to&mdash;well, to be present if he happened to be wanted&mdash;that
  the worthy Baptiste should with perfect ease slip into the vacant post?</p>
  <p>And Baptiste Durand was remarkably useful.</p>
  <p>A small ante-chamber had been allotted for his occupation, through which
  all those who were on their way to the <i>petit lever</i> held in milor&rsquo;s
  own bedchamber had of necessity to pass; and Baptiste knew exactly who should
  be allowed to pass and who should not. Without venturing even to refer to
  His Majesty, to Mme. de Pompadour, to Monseigneur le Dauphin, or persons
  of equally exalted rank, the faithful chroniclers of the time tell us that
  no gentleman was allowed a private audience with M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  if his valet-de-chambre was not a personal friend of Monsieur Durand.</p>
  <p>There sat the worthy Baptiste enthroned behind a secretaire which was always
  littered with papers, petitions, letters, the usual paraphernalia that pertains
  to a man of influence. His meagre person was encased in a coat and breeches
  of fine scarlet cloth, whereon a tiny fillet of gold suggested without unduly
  flaunting the heraldic colours of the house of Eglinton. He wore silk stockings&mdash;always;
  and shoes with cut-steel buckles, whilst frills of broidered lawn encircled
  his wrists and cascaded above his waistcoat.</p>
  <p>He invariably partook of snuff when an unknown and unrecommended applicant
  presented himself in his sanctum. &ldquo;My good friend, it is impossible,&rdquo; he
  was saying on this very morning of August 13, 1746, with quiet determination
  to a petitioner who was becoming too insistent. &ldquo;Milor&rsquo;s chamber
  is overcrowded as it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call again&mdash;another day perhaps; my master is anxious
  for a personal interview with yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon M. Durand&rsquo;s eyebrows were lifted upward until they almost
  came in contact with his perruque; he fetched out a voluminous handkerchief
  from his pocket and carefully removed a few grains of dust from his cravat.
  Then he said, without raising his voice in the slightest degree or showing
  impatience in any way at the man&rsquo;s ignorance and stupidity&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good&mdash; What is your name? I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Hypolite Fran&ccedil;ois, confidential valet to M. le Mar&eacute;chal
  de Coigni and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Durand&rsquo;s thin and delicately veined hand went up in gentle deprecation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma foi! my worthy Coigni, &rsquo;tis all the same to me if you are
  a mar&eacute;chal or a simple lieutenant. As for me, young man,&rdquo; he
  added, with dignified severity, &ldquo;remember in future that I serve no
  one. I assist M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Finances to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;he
  paused a second, waving his hand and turning the phrase over in his mouth,
  whilst seeking for its most appropriate conclusion&mdash;&ldquo;to, in fact,
  make a worthy selection amidst the hundreds and thousands of petitions which
  are presented to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a vague gesture he indicated the papers which lay in a disordered
  heap on his secretaire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the rest, my good Coigni,&rdquo; he added, with the same impressive
  dignity, &ldquo;let me assure you once again that M. le Marquis&rsquo;s bedchamber
  is overcrowded, that he is busily engaged at the present moment, and is likely
  to be so for some considerable time to come. What is it your mar&eacute;chal
  wants?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His pension,&rdquo; replied Hypolite curtly, &ldquo;and the vacant
  post in the Ministry of War.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible! We have fourteen likely applicants already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal is sure that if he could speak with M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Contr&ocirc;leur is busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow he will be even more busy than to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. Durand!&rdquo; pleaded Hypolite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible! You are wasting my time, my good Coigni; I have hundreds
  to see to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not for your daughter&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; didn&rsquo;t you know? You remember Henriette, her great friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;little Henriette Dessy, the milliner,&rdquo; assented
  M. Durand with vast condescension. &ldquo;A pretty wench; she was at the
  Ursulines convent school with my daughter; they have remained great friends
  ever since. What about little Henriette?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mlle. Henriette is my <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>,&rdquo; quoth the other
  eagerly, &ldquo;and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>? Little Henriette Dessy?&rdquo; said M.
  Durand gaily. &ldquo;Pardieu my good Coigni, why did you not tell me so
  before? My daughter is very fond of Henriette&mdash;a pretty minx, par ma
  foi! H&eacute;! h&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind, M. Durand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mais non, mais non,&rdquo; said the great man, with much affability; &ldquo;one
  is always ready to oblige a friend. H&eacute;, now! give me your hand, friend
  Coigni. Shoot your rubbish along&mdash;quoi!&mdash;your Mar&eacute;chal;
  he may pass this way. Anything one can do to oblige a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With the affairs of M. le Mar&eacute;chal de Coigni the present chronicle
  hath no further concern; but we know that some ten minutes later on this
  same August 13, 1746, he succeeded in being present at the <i>petit lever</i> of
  M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Finances. Once within the
  secret precincts of the bedchamber he, like so many other petitioners and
  courtiers, was duly confronted by the stony stare of M. Achille, and found
  himself face to face with an enormous bedstead of delicately painted satinwood
  and ormulu mounts, draped with heavy azure silk curtains which hung down
  from a gilded baldachin, the whole a masterpiece of the furniture-maker&rsquo;s
  art.</p>
  <p>The scent of chocolate filled his nostrils, and he vaguely saw a good-looking
  young man reclining under a coverlet of magnificent Venetian lace, and listening
  placidly to what was obviously a very amusing tale related to him by well-rouged
  lips. From the billowy satins and laces of the couch a delicate hand was
  waved toward him as he attempted to pay his respects to the most powerful
  man in France; the next moment the same stony-faced gorgon clad in scarlet
  and gold beckoned to him to follow, and he found himself being led through
  the brilliantly dressed crowd toward a compact group of backs, which formed
  a sort of living wall, painted in delicate colours of green and mauve and
  gray, and duly filled up the approach to the main window embrasure.</p>
  <p>It is interesting to note from the memoirs of M. le Comte d&rsquo;Argenson
  that the Mar&eacute;chal de Coigni duly filled the post of State Secretary
  to the Minister of War from the year 1746 onward. We may, therefore, presume
  that he succeeded in piercing that wall of respectful backs and in reaching
  sufficiently far within the charmed circle to attract the personal attention
  of Mme. la Marquise Lydie d&rsquo;Eglinton <i>n&eacute;e</i> d&rsquo;Aumont.</p>
  <p>He had, therefore, cause to bless the day when his valet-de-chambre became
  the <i>fianc&eacute;</i> of Mlle. Henriette Dessy, the intimate friend of
  M. Baptiste Durand&rsquo;s dearly beloved daughter.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
La Belle Ir&egrave;ne</b></h2>
  <p>Monsieur Durand had indeed not exaggerated when he spoke of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  bedchamber being overcrowded this same eventful morning.</p>
  <p>All that France possessed of nobility, of wit and of valour, seemed to have
  found its way on this beautiful day in August past the magic portal guarded
  by Baptiste, the dragon, to the privileged enclosure beyond, where milor
  in elegant <i>robe de chambre</i> reclined upon his gorgeous couch, whilst
  Madame, clad in hooped skirt and panniers of dove-gray silk, directed the
  affairs of France from the embrasure of a window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Achille, my shoes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We must surmise that his lordship had been eagerly awaiting the striking
  of the bracket clock which immediately faced the bed, for the moment the
  musical chimes had ceased to echo in the crowded room he had thrown aside
  the lace coverlet which had lain across his legs and called peremptorily
  for his valet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only half-past ten, milor!&rdquo; came in reproachful accents from
  a pair of rosy lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma foi, so it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Lord Eglinton, with well-feigned
  surprise, as he once more glanced up at the clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were you then so bored in my company,&rdquo; rejoined the lady, with
  a pout, &ldquo;that you thought the hour later?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bored!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Bored, did you say, Madame? Perish
  the very thought of boredom in the presence of Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But in spite of this gallant assertion, M. le Contr&ocirc;leur seemed in
  a vast hurry to quit the luxuriance of his azure-hung throne. M. Achille&mdash;that
  paragon among flunkeys&mdash;looked solemnly reproachful. Surely milor should
  have known by now that etiquette demanded that he should stay in bed until
  he had received every person of high rank who desired an intimate audience.</p>
  <p>There were still some high-born, exalted, and much beribboned gentlemen
  who had not succeeded in reaching the inner precincts of that temple and
  fount of honours and riches&mdash;the bedside of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur.
  But Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai was there&mdash;he in whose veins
  flowed royal blood, and who spent a strenuous life in endeavouring to make
  France recognize this obvious fact. He sat in an arm-chair at the foot of
  the bed, discussing the unfortunate events of June 16th at Piacenza and young
  Comte de Maillebois&rsquo;s subsequent masterly retreat on Tortone, with
  Christian Louis de Montmorenci, Duc de Luxembourg, the worthy son of an able
  father and newly created Marshal of France.</p>
  <p>Close to them, Monsieur le Comte de Vermandois, Grand Admiral of France,
  was intent on explaining to M. le Chancelier d&rsquo;Aguesseau why England
  just now was supreme mistress of the seas. M. d&rsquo;Isenghien talked poetry
  to Jolyot Cr&eacute;billon, and M. le Duc d&rsquo;Harcourt discussed Voltaire&rsquo;s
  latest play with ex-comedian and ex-ambassador N&eacute;ricault-Destouche,
  whilst Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, still called &ldquo;la belle brune
  de Bordeaux&rdquo; by her many admirers, had been endeavouring to divert
  M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s attention from this multiplicity of abstruse
  subjects.</p>
  <p>Outside this magic circle there was a gap, a barrier of parquet flooring
  which no one would dare to traverse without a distinct look of encouragement
  from M. Achille. His Majesty had not yet arrived, and tongues wagged freely
  in the vast and gorgeous room, with its row of tall windows which gave on
  the great slopes of the Park of Versailles. Through them came the pleasing
  sound of the perpetual drip from the monumental fountains, the twitter of
  sparrows, the scent of lingering roses and of belated lilies. No other sound
  from that outside world, no other life save the occasional footstep of a
  gardener along the sanded walks. But within all was chatter and bustle; women
  talked, men laughed and argued, society scandals were commented upon and
  the newest fashions in coiffures discussed. The men wore cloth coats of sober
  hues, but the women had donned light-coloured dresses, for the summer was
  at its height and this August morning was aglow with sunshine.</p>
  <p>Mme. de Stainville&rsquo;s rose-coloured gown was the one vivid patch of
  colour in the picture of delicate hues. She stood close to M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  bedside and unceremoniously turned her back on the rest of the company; we
  must presume that she was a very privileged visitor, for no one&mdash;not
  even Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai&mdash;ventured to approach within
  earshot. It was understood that in milor&rsquo;s immediate entourage la belle
  Ir&egrave;ne alone was allowed to be frivolous, and we are told that she
  took full advantage of this permission.</p>
  <p>All chroniclers of the period distinctly aver that the lady was vastly entertaining;
  even M. de Voltaire mentions her as one of the sprightliest women of that
  light-hearted and vivacious Court. Beautiful, too, beyond cavil, her position
  as the wife of one of the most brilliant cavaliers that e&rsquo;er graced
  the entourage of Mme. de Pompadour gave her a certain dignity of bearing,
  a self-conscious gait and proud carriage of the head which had considerably
  added to the charms which she already possessed. The stiff, ungainly mode
  of the period suited her somewhat full figure to perfection; the tight corslet
  bodice, the wide panniers, the ridiculous hooped skirt&mdash;all seemed to
  have been specially designed to suit the voluptuous beauty of Ir&egrave;ne
  de Stainville.</p>
  <p>M. d&rsquo;Argenson when speaking of her has described her very fully. He
  speaks of her abnormally small waist, which seemed to challenge the support
  of a masculine arm, and of her creamy skin which she knew so well how to
  veil in transparent folds of filmy lace. She made of dress a special study,
  and her taste, though daring, was always sure. Even during these early morning
  receptions, when soft-toned mauves, tender drabs or grays were mostly in
  evidence, Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville usually appeared in brocade of brilliant
  rosy-red, turquoise blue, or emerald green; she knew that these somewhat
  garish tones, mellowed only through the richness of the material, set off
  to perfection the matt ivory tint of her complexion, and detached her entire
  person from the rest of the picture.</p>
  <p>Yet even her most ardent admirers tell us that Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville&rsquo;s
  vanity went almost beyond the bounds of reason in its avidity for fulsome
  adulation. Consciousness of her own beauty was not sufficient; she desired
  its acknowledgment from others. She seemed to feed on flattery, breathing
  it in with every pore of her delicate skin, drooping like a parched flower
  when full measure was denied to her. Many aver that she marred her undoubted
  gifts of wit through this insatiable desire for one sole topic of conversation&mdash;her
  own beauty and its due meed of praise. At the same time her love of direct
  and obsequious compliments was so ingenuous, and she herself so undeniably
  fascinating, that, in the hey-day of her youth and attractions, she had no
  difficulty in obtaining ready response to her wishes from the highly susceptible
  masculine element at the Court of Louis XV.</p>
  <p>M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral&mdash;whom she specially honoured
  with her smiles&mdash;had certainly no intention of shirking the pleasing
  duty attached to this distinction, and, though he was never counted a brilliant
  conversationalist, he never seemed at a loss for the exact word of praise
  which would tickle la belle Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s ears most pleasantly.</p>
  <p>And truly no man&rsquo;s heart could be sufficiently adamant to deny to
  that brilliantly-plumaged bird the tit-bits which it loved the best. Milor
  himself had all the sensitiveness of his race where charms&mdash;such as
  Ir&egrave;ne freely displayed before him&mdash;were concerned, and when her
  smiling lips demanded acknowledgment of her beauty from him he was ready
  enough to give it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let them settle the grave affairs of State over there,&rdquo; she
  had said to him this morning, when first she made her curtsey before him.
  And with a provocative smile she pointed to the serious-looking group of
  grave gentlemen that surrounded his bedside, and also to the compact row
  of backs which stood in serried ranks round Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton
  in the embrasure of the central window. &ldquo;Life is too short for such
  insignificant trifles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We only seem to last long enough to make love thoroughly to half
  a dozen pretty women in a lifetime,&rdquo; replied M. le Contr&ocirc;leur,
  as he gallantly raised her fingers to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half a dozen!&rdquo; she retorted, with a pout. &ldquo;Ah, milor,
  I see that your countrymen are not maligned! The English have such a reputation
  for perfidy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I have become so entirely French!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;England
  would scarce know me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a whimsical gesture he pointed to the satin hangings of his bed,
  the rich point lace coverlet, and to his own very elaborate and elegant <i>robe
  de chambre</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that said in regret?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;there is no more place for regret
  than there is for boredom in sight of smiles from those perfect lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She blushed, and allowed her hands&mdash;which were particularly beautiful&mdash;to
  finger idly the silks and laces which were draped so tastefully about his
  person. As her eyes were downcast in dainty and becoming confusion, she failed
  to notice that M. le Contr&ocirc;leur was somewhat absent-minded this morning,
  and that, had he dared, he would at this juncture undoubtedly have yawned.
  But of this she was obviously unconscious, else she had not now murmured
  so persuasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a question!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The most beautiful woman here present?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Par ma foi!&rdquo; he protested gaily. &ldquo;Was ever married man
  put in so awkward a predicament?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Married man? Bah!&rdquo; and she shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a married man, fair lady, and the law forbids me to answer so
  provoking a question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is cowardly evasion,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Mme. la Marquise,
  your wife, only acknowledges one supremacy&mdash;that of the mind. She would
  scorn to be called the most beautiful woman in the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And M. le Comte de Stainville, your lord, would put a hole right
  through my body were I now to speak the unvarnished truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ir&egrave;ne apparently chose to interpret milor&rsquo;s equivocal speech
  in the manner most pleasing to her self-love. She looked over her shoulder
  toward the window embrasure. She saw that Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton&rsquo;s
  court was momentarily dismissed, and that M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont had just
  joined his daughter. She also saw that Lydie looked troubled, and that she
  threw across the room a look of haughty reproof.</p>
  <p>Nothing could have pleased Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville more.</p>
  <p>Apart from the satisfaction which her own inordinate vanity felt at the
  present moment by enchaining milor&rsquo;s attention and receiving his undivided
  homage in full sight of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of aristocratic Versailles,
  there was the additional pleasure of dealing a pin-prick or so to a woman
  who had once been her rival, and who was undoubtedly now the most distinguished
  as she was the most adulated personality in France.</p>
  <p>Ir&egrave;ne had never forgiven Lydie Gaston&rsquo;s defalcations on that
  memorable night, when a humiliating exposure and subsequent scene led to
  the disclosure of her own secret marriage, and thus put a momentary check
  on her husband&rsquo;s ambitious schemes.</p>
  <p>From that check he had since then partially recovered. Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s
  good graces which she never wholly withdrew from him had given him a certain
  position of influence and power, from which his lack of wealth would otherwise
  have debarred him. But even with the uncertain and fickle Marquise&rsquo;s
  help Gaston de Stainville was far from attaining a position such as his alliance
  with Lydie would literally have thrown into his lap, such, of course, as
  fell to the share of the amiable milor, who had succeeded in capturing the
  golden prey. In these days of petticoat government feminine protection was
  the chief leverage for advancement; Ir&egrave;ne, however, could do nothing
  for her husband without outside help; conscious of her own powers of fascination,
  she had cast about for the most likely prop on which she could lean gracefully
  whilst helping Gaston to climb upward.</p>
  <p>The King himself was too deeply in the toils of his fair Jeanne to have
  eyes for any one save for her. M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, Prime Minister of
  France, was his daughter&rsquo;s slave; there remained M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  himself&mdash;a figure-head as far as the affairs of State were concerned,
  but wielding a great deal of personal power through the vastness of his wealth
  which Lydie rather affected to despise.</p>
  <p>Ir&egrave;ne, therefore&mdash;<i>faute de mieux</i>&mdash;turned her languishing
  eyes upon M. le Contr&ocirc;leur. Her triumph was pleasing to herself, and
  might in due course prove useful to Gaston, if she succeeded presently in
  counterbalancing Lydie&rsquo;s domineering influence over milor. For the
  moment her vanity was agreeably soothed, although &ldquo;la belle brune
  de Bordeaux&rdquo; herself was fully alive to the fact that, while her whispered
  conversations at milor&rsquo;s <i>petits levers</i>, her sidelong glances
  and conscious blushes called forth enough mischievous oglings and equivocal
  jests from the more frivolous section of society butterflies, Lydie only
  viewed her and her machinations with cold and somewhat humiliating indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; as M. d&rsquo;Argenson very pertinently remarked that
  self-same morning, &ldquo;would any beautiful woman care to engage the attentions
  of a man unless she aroused at the same time the jealousy or at least the
  annoyance of a rival?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  The Promises Of France</b></h2>
  <p>Indeed, if Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville had possessed more penetration, or
  had at any rate studied Lydie&rsquo;s face more closely, she would never
  have imagined for a moment that thoughts of petty spite or of feminine pique
  could find place in the busiest brain that ever toiled for the welfare of
  France.</p>
  <p>History has no doubt said the last word on the subject of that brief interregnum,
  when a woman&rsquo;s masterful hand tried to check the extravagances of a
  King and the ruinous caprices of a wanton, and when a woman&rsquo;s will
  tried to restrain a nation in its formidable onrush down the steep incline
  which led to the abyss of the Revolution.</p>
  <p>Many historians have sneered&mdash;perhaps justly so&mdash;at this apotheosis
  of feminity, and pointed to the fact that, while that special era of petticoat
  government lasted, Louis XV in no way stopped his excesses nor did Pompadour
  deny herself the satisfaction of a single whim, whilst France continued uninterruptedly
  to groan under the yoke of oppressive taxation, of bribery and injustice,
  and to suffer from the arrogance of her nobles and the corruption of her
  magistrates.</p>
  <p>The avowed partisans of Lydie d&rsquo;Eglinton contend on the other hand
  that her rule lasted too short a time to be of real service to the country,
  and that those who immediately succeeded her were either too weak or too
  self-seeking to continue this new system of government instituted by her,
  and based on loftiness of ideals and purity of motives, a system totally
  unknown hitherto. They also insist on the fact that while she virtually held
  the reins of government over the heads of her indolent lord and her over-indulgent
  father, she brought about many highly beneficent social reforms which would
  have become firmly established had she remained several years in power; there
  is no doubt that she exercised a wholesome influence over the existing administration
  of justice and the distribution of the country&rsquo;s money; and this in
  spite of endless cabals and the petty intrigues and jealousies of numberless
  enemies.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, the present chronicler is bound to put it on record that,
  at the moment when Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville vaguely wondered whether Madame
  la Marquise was looking reprovingly at her, when she hoped that she had at
  last succeeded in rousing the other woman&rsquo;s jealousy, the latter&rsquo;s
  mind was dwelling with more than usual anxiousness on the sad events of the
  past few months.</p>
  <p>Her severe expression was only the outcome of a more than normal sense of
  responsibility. The flattering courtiers and meddlesome women who surrounded
  her seemed to Lydie this morning more than usually brainless and vapid. Her
  own father, to whose integrity and keen sense of honour she always felt that
  she could make appeal, was unusually absent and morose to-day; and she felt
  unspeakably lonely here in the midst of her immediate <i>entourage</i>&mdash;lonely
  and oppressed. She wanted to mix more with the general throng, the men and
  women of France, arrogant nobles or obsequious churls, merchants, attorneys,
  physicians, savants, she cared not which; the nation, in fact, the people
  who had sympathy and high ideals, and a keener sense of the dignity of France.</p>
  <p>While these sycophants were for ever wanting, wanting, wanting, standing
  before her, as it were, with hands outstretched ready to receive bribes,
  commissions, places of influence or affluence, Charles Edward Stuart, lately
  the guest of the nation, the friend of many, whom France herself little more
  than a year ago had feasted and toasted, to whom she had wished &ldquo;God-speed!&rdquo; was
  now a miserable fugitive, hiding in peasants&rsquo; huts, beneath overhanging
  crags on the deserted shores of Scotland, a price put upon his head, and
  the devotion of a few helpless enthusiasts, a girl, an old retainer, as sole
  barrier &rsquo;twixt him and death.</p>
  <p>And France had promised that she would help him. She promised that she would
  succour him if he failed, that she would not abandon him in his distress&mdash;neither
  him nor his friends.</p>
  <p>And now disaster had come&mdash;disaster so overwhelming, so appalling,
  that France at first had scarce liked to believe. Every one was so astonished;
  had they not thought that England, Scotland and Ireland were clamouring for
  a Stuart? That the entire British nation was wanting him, waiting for him,
  ready to acclaim him with open arms? The first successes&mdash;Falkirk, Prestonpans&mdash;had
  surprised no one. The young Pretender&rsquo;s expedition was bound to be
  nothing but a triumphal procession through crowded streets, decorated towns
  and beflagged villages, with church bells ringing, people shouting, deputations,
  both civic and military, waiting hat in hand, with sheaves of loyal addresses.</p>
  <p>Instead of this, Culloden, Derby, the hasty retreat, treachery, and the
  horrible reprisals. All that was common property now.</p>
  <p>France knew that the young prince whom she had <i>f&eacute;ted</i> was perhaps
  at this moment dying of want, and yet these hands which had grasped his were
  not stretched out to help him, the lips which had encouraged and cheered
  him, which had even gently mocked his gloomy mood, still smiled and chatted
  as irresponsibly as of yore, and spoke the fugitive&rsquo;s name at careless
  moments &rsquo;twixt a laugh and a jest.</p>
  <p>And this in spite of promises.</p>
  <p>She had dismissed her <i>entourage</i> with a curt nod just now, when her
  father first joined her circle. At any rate, her position of splendid isolation
  should give her the right this morning to be alone with him, since she so
  wished it. At first glance she saw that he was troubled, and her anxious
  eyes closely scanned his face. But he seemed determined not to return her
  scrutinizing glance, and anon, when one by one M. de Coigni, the Count de
  Bailleul, and others who had been talking to Lydie, discreetly stepped aside,
  he seemed anxious to detain them, eager not to be left quite alone with his
  daughter.</p>
  <p>Seeing his man&oelig;uvres, Lydie&rsquo;s every suspicion was aroused; something
  had occurred to disturb her father this morning, something which he did not
  intend to tell her. She drew him further back into the window embrasure and
  made room for him close to her on the settee. She looked up impatiently at
  the Dowager Lady Eglinton, who had calmly stood her ground whilst the other
  intimates were being so summarily dismissed. Miladi appeared determined to
  ignore her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s desire to be alone with her father, and
  it even seemed to Lydie as if a look of understanding had passed between
  the Duke and the old lady when first they met.</p>
  <p>She felt her nervous system on the jar. Thoroughly frank and open in all
  political dealings herself, she loathed the very hint of a secret understanding.
  Yet she trusted her father, even though she feared his weakness.</p>
  <p>She talked of Charles Edward Stuart, for that was her chief preoccupation.
  She lauded him and pitied him in turn, spoke of his predicament, his flight,
  the devotion of his Scotch adherents, and finally of France&rsquo;s promise
  to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant,&rdquo; she said fervently, &ldquo;that France may not
  be too late in doing her duty by that ill-starred prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear child, it is sheer madness to think of such a thing,&rdquo; said
  the Duke, speaking in tones of gentle reproof and soothingly, as if to a
  wilful child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&eacute;! pardieu!&rdquo; broke in miladi&rsquo;s sharp, high-pitched
  voice: &ldquo;that is precisely what I have been trying to explain to Lydie
  these past two weeks, but she will not listen and is not even to be spoken
  to on that subject now. Do you scold her well, M. le Duc, for I have done
  my best&mdash;and her obstinacy will lead my son into dire disgrace with
  His Majesty, who doth not favour her plans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miladi is right, Lydie,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;and if I thought
  that your husband&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear father!&rdquo; interrupted Lydie calmly; &ldquo;I pray
  you do not vent your displeasure on Lord Eglinton. As you see, Mme. la Comtesse
  de Stainville is doing her best to prevent his thoughts from dwelling on
  the fate of his unfortunate friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was the Duke&rsquo;s turn to scrutinize his daughter&rsquo;s face, vaguely
  wondering if she had spoken in bitterness, not altogether sorry if this new
  train of thought were to divert her mind from that eternal subject of the
  moribund Stuart cause, which seemed to have become an obsession with her.
  He half-turned in the direction where Lydie&rsquo;s eyes were still fixed,
  and saw a patch of bright rose colour, clear and vivid against the dull hangings
  of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s couch, whilst the elegant outline of a
  woman&rsquo;s stately form stood between his line of vision and the face
  of his son-in-law.</p>
  <p>The Duc d&rsquo;Aumont dearly loved his daughter, but he also vastly admired
  her intellectual power, therefore at sight of that graceful, rose-clad figure
  he shrugged his shoulders in amiable contempt. Bah! Lydie was far too clever
  to dwell on such foolish matters as the vapid flirtations of a brainless
  doll, even if the object of such flirtations was the subjugation of milor.</p>
  <p>Lady Eglinton had also perceived Lydie&rsquo;s fixity of expression just
  now when she spoke of Ir&egrave;ne, but whilst M. le Duc carelessly shrugged
  his shoulders and dismissed the matter from his mind, miladi boldly threw
  herself across her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s new trend of thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son for once shows sound common sense,&rdquo; she said decisively; &ldquo;why
  should France be led into further extravagance and entangle herself, perhaps,
  in the meshes of a hopeless cause by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By fulfilling a solemn promise,&rdquo; interrupted Lydie quietly,
  whilst she turned her earnest eyes on her mother-in-law in the manner so
  characteristic of her&mdash;&ldquo;a promise which the very hopelessness
  of which you speak has rendered doubly sacred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty is not of that opinion,&rdquo; retorted the older woman
  testily, &ldquo;and we must concede that he is the best judge of what France
  owes to her own honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this challenge it was obviously impossible to reply in the negative,
  and if Lydie&rsquo;s heart whispered &ldquo;Not always!&rdquo; her lips certainly
  did not move.</p>
  <p>She looked appealingly at her father; she wanted more than ever to be alone
  with him, to question him, to reassure herself as to certain vague suspicions
  which troubled her and which would not be stilled. She longed, above all,
  to be rid of her mother-in-law&rsquo;s interfering tongue, of the platitudes,
  which she uttered, and which had the knack of still further jarring on Lydie&rsquo;s
  over-sensitive nerves.</p>
  <p>But the Duke did not help her. Usually he, too, was careful to avoid direct
  discussions with Lady Eglinton, whose rasping voice was wont to irritate
  him, but this morning he seemed disinclined to meet Lydie&rsquo;s appealing
  eyes. He fidgeted in his chair, and anon he crossed one shapely leg over
  the other and thoughtfully stroked his well-turned calf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are moments in diplomacy, my dear child&mdash;&rdquo; he
  began, after a moment of oppressive silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; interrupted Lydie, with grave determination, &ldquo;let
  me tell you once for all that over this matter my mind is fully made up.
  While I have a voice in the administration of this Kingdom of France, I will
  not allow her to sully her fair name by such monstrous treachery as the abandonment
  of a friend who trusted in her honour and the promises she made him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice had shaken somewhat as she spoke. Altogether she seemed unlike
  herself, less sure, less obstinately dominant. That look of understanding
  between her father and Lady Eglinton had troubled her in a way for which
  she could not account. Yet she knew that the whole matter rested in her own
  hands. No one&mdash;not even His Majesty&mdash;had ever questioned her right
  to deal with Treasury money. And money was all that was needed. Though the
  final word nominally rested with milor, he left her perfectly free, and she
  could act as she thought right, without let or hindrance.</p>
  <p>Yet, strangely enough, she felt as if she wanted support in this matter.
  It was a purely personal feeling, and one she did not care to analyse. She
  had no doubt whatever as to the justice and righteousness of her desire,
  but in this one solitary instance of her masterful administration she seemed
  to require the initiative, or at least the approval, of her father or of
  the King.</p>
  <p>Instead of this approval she vaguely scented intrigue.</p>
  <p>She rose from the settee and went to the window behind it. The atmosphere
  of the room had suddenly become stifling. Fortunately the tall casements
  were unlatched. They yielded to a gentle push, and Lydie stepped out on to
  the balcony. Already the air was hot, and the sun shone glaringly on the
  marble fountains, and drew sparks of fire from the dome of the conservatories.
  The acrid, pungent smell of cannas and of asters rose to her nostrils, drowning
  the subtler aroma of tea roses and of lilies; the monotonous drip of the
  fountains was a soothing contrast in her ear to the babel of voices within.</p>
  <p>At her feet the well-sanded walks of the park stretched out like ribbons
  of pale gold to the dim, vast distance beyond; the curly heads of Athenian
  athletes peeped from among the well-trimmed bosquets, showing the immaculate
  whiteness of the polished marble in the sun. A couple of gardeners clad in
  shirts of vivid blue linen were stooping over a bed of monthly roses, picking
  off dead leaves and twigs that spoilt the perfect symmetry of the shrubs,
  whilst two more a few paces away were perfecting the smoothness of a box
  hedge, lest a tiny leaflet were out of place.</p>
  <p>Lydie sighed impatiently. Even in this vastness and this peace, man brought
  his artificiality to curb the freedom of nature. Everything in this magnificent
  park was affected, stilted and forced; every tree was fashioned to a shape
  not its own, every flower made to be a counterpart of its fellow.</p>
  <p>This sense of unreality, of fighting nature in its every aspect, was what
  had always oppressed her, even when she worked at first in perfect harmony
  with her father, when she still had those utopian hopes of a regenerate France,
  with a wise and beneficent monarch, an era of truth and of fraternity, every
  one toiling hand-in-hand for the good of the nation.</p>
  <p>What a child she had been in those days! How little she had understood this
  hydra-headed monster of self-seeking ambition, of political wire-pulling,
  of petty cabals and personal animosities which fought and crushed and trampled
  on every lofty ideal, on every clean thought and high-minded aspiration.</p>
  <p>She knew and understood better now. She had outgrown her childish ideals:
  those she now kept were a woman&rsquo;s ideals, no less pure, no less high
  or noble, but lacking just one great quality&mdash;that of hope. She had
  continued to work and to do her best for this country which she loved&mdash;her
  own beautiful France. She had&mdash;with no uncertain hand&mdash;seized the
  reins of government from the diffident fingers of her lord, she still strove
  to fight corruption, to curb excesses and to check arrogance, and made vain
  endeavours to close her eyes to the futility of her noblest efforts.</p>
  <p>This attitude of King Louis toward the Young Pretender had brought it all
  home to her; the intrigues, the lying, the falseness of everything, the treachery
  which lurked in every corner of this sumptuous palace, the egoism which was
  the sole moving power of those overdressed dolls.</p>
  <p>Perhaps for the first time since&mdash;in all the glory and pride of her
  young womanhood&mdash;she became conscious of its power over the weaker and
  sterner vessel, she felt a sense of discouragement, the utter hopelessness
  of her desires. Her heart even suggested contempt of herself, of her weak-minded
  foolishness in imagining that all those empty heads in the room yonder could
  bring forth one single serious thought from beneath their powdered perruques,
  one single wholly selfless aspiration for the good of France; any more than
  that stultified rose-tree could produce a bloom of splendid perfection or
  that stunted acacia intoxicate the air with the fragrance of its bloom.</p>
  <p>Solitude had taken hold of Lydie&rsquo;s fancy. She had allowed her mind
  to go roaming, fancy-free. Her thoughts were melancholy and anxious, and
  she sighed or frowned more than once. The air was becoming hotter and hotter
  every moment, and a gigantic bed of scarlet geraniums sent a curious acrid
  scent to her nostrils, which she found refreshing. Anon she succeeded in
  shutting out from her eyes the picture of those gardeners maiming the rose-trees
  and bosquets, and in seeing only that distant horizon with the vague, tiny
  fleecy clouds which were hurrying quite gaily and freely to some unknown
  destination, far, no doubt, from this world of craft and affectation. She
  shut her ears to the sound of miladi&rsquo;s shrill laugh and the chatter
  of senseless fools behind her, and only tried to hear the rippling murmur
  of the water in the fountains, the merry chirrup of the sparrows, and far,
  very far away, the sweet, sad note of a lark soaring upward to the serene
  morning sky.</p>
  <p>The sound of a footstep on the flag-stones of the balcony broke in on her
  meditations. Her father, still wearing that troubled look, was coming out
  to join her. Fortunately miladi had chosen to remain indoors.</p>
  <p>Impulsively now, for her nerves were still quivering with the tension of
  recent introspection, she went straight up to this man whom she most fully
  trusted in all the world, and took his hands in both hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear, dear father,&rdquo; she pleaded, with her wonted earnestness, &ldquo;you <i>will</i> help
  me, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked more troubled than ever at her words, almost pathetic in his obvious
  helplessness, as he ejaculated feebly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what can we do, my dear child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send <i>Le Monarque</i> to meet Prince Charles Edward,&rdquo; she
  urged; &ldquo;it is so simple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very hazardous, and would cost a vast amount of money. In the
  present state of the Treasury&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear father, France can afford the luxury of not selling her honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the English will be furious with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The English cannot do more than fight us, and they are doing that
  already!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The risks, my dear child, the risks!&rdquo; he protested again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What risks, father dear?&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;Tell me,
  what do we risk by sending <i>Le Monarque</i> with secret orders to the Scottish
  coast, to a spot known to no one save to Lord Eglinton and myself, confided
  to my husband by the unfortunate young Prince before he started on this miserable
  expedition? Captain Barre will carry nothing that can in any way betray the
  secret of his destination nor the object of his journey&mdash;my husband&rsquo;s
  seal-ring on his finger, nothing more; this token he will take on shore himself&mdash;not
  even the ship&rsquo;s crew will know aught that would be fatal if betrayed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the English can intercept <i>Le Monarque</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must run that risk,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Once past the
  coast of England, Scotland is lonely enough. <i>Le Monarque</i> will meet
  no other craft, and Captain Barre knows the secrets of his own calling&mdash;he
  has run a cargo before now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is childish obstinacy, Lydie, and I do not recognize the statesman
  in this sentimental chit, who prates nonsense like a schoolgirl imbued with
  novel-reading,&rdquo; said the Duke now with marked impatience; &ldquo;and
  pray, if His Majesty should put a veto on your using one of his ships for
  this privateering expedition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I propose sending <i>Le Monarque</i> to-morrow,&rdquo; rejoined Lydie
  quietly. &ldquo;Captain Barre will have his orders direct from the Ministry
  of Finance; and then we&rsquo;ll obtain His Majesty&rsquo;s sanction on the
  following day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is madness, my child!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke. &ldquo;You
  cannot openly set at defiance the wishes of the King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wishes of the King?&rdquo; she cried, with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;Surely,
  surely, my dear, dear father, you cannot mean what you suggest! Think! oh,
  think just for one moment! That poor young man, who was our guest, whom we
  all liked&mdash;he broke bread with us in our own house, our beautiful ch&acirc;teau
  de la Tour d&rsquo;Aumont, which has never yet been defiled by treachery.
  And you talk of leaving him there in that far-off land which has proved so
  inhospitable to him? Of leaving him there either to perish miserably of want
  and starvation or to fall into the hands of that Hanoverian butcher whose
  name has become a by-word for unparalleled atrocities?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She checked herself, and then resumed more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear father, I pray you let us cease this argument; for once
  in the history of our happy life together you and I look at honour from opposite
  points of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I see that, too,&rdquo; he rejoined, speaking now with
  some hesitation. &ldquo;I wish I could persuade you to abandon the idea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To abandon the unfortunate young Prince, you mean, to break every
  promise we ever made to him&mdash;to become the by-word in our turn for treachery
  and cowardice in every country in Europe&mdash;and why?&rdquo; she added,
  with helpless impatience, trying to understand, dreading almost to question. &ldquo;Why?
  Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as her father remained silent, with eyes persistently fixed on some
  vague object in the remote distance, she said, as if acting on a sudden decisive
  thought:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, dear, is it solely a question of cost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; he replied, with marked hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly? Well, then, dear, we will remove one cause of your unexplainable
  opposition. You may assure His Majesty in my name that the voyage of <i>Le
  Monarque</i> shall cost the Treasury nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as her father made no comment, she continued more eagerly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Eglinton will not deny me, as you know; he is rich and Charles
  Edward Stuart is his friend. What <i>Le Monarque</i> has cost for provisioning,
  that we will immediately replace. For the moment we will borrow this ship
  from His Majesty&rsquo;s navy. <i>That</i> he <i>cannot</i> refuse! and I
  give you and His Majesty my word of honour that <i>Le Monarque</i> shall
  not cost the Treasury one single sou&mdash;even the pay of her crew shall
  be defrayed by us from the moment that she sails out of Le Havre until the
  happy moment when she returns home with Prince Charles Edward Stuart and
  his friends safe and sound aboard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence between them for awhile. The Duc d&rsquo;Aumont&rsquo;s
  eyes were fixed steadily on a distant point on the horizon, but Lydie&rsquo;s
  eyes never for a second strayed away from her father&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will <i>Le Monarque</i> have a long journey to make?&rdquo; asked
  the Duke lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the coast of Scotland?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The west coast, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should you ask, dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She asked him this question quite casually, then, as he did not reply, she
  asked it again, this time with a terrible tightening of her heart-strings.
  Suddenly she remembered her suspicions, when first she caught the glance
  of intelligence which passed swiftly from him to miladi.</p>
  <p>With a quick gesture of intense agitation she placed a hand on his wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she said in a scarce audible murmur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I have been much troubled of late. I
  do not think that my perceptions are perhaps as keen as they were&mdash;and
  as you say, this matter of the Stuart Prince has weighed heavily on my mind.
  Therefore, will you forgive me, dear, if&mdash;if I ask you a question which
  may sound undutiful, disloyal to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will forgive you, dear,&rdquo; he said, after a slight
  moment of hesitation. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had pulled himself together, and now met his daughter&rsquo;s glance
  with sufficient firmness, apparently to reassure her somewhat, for she said
  more quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you give me your word of honour that you personally know of
  no act of treachery which may be in contemplation against the man who trusts
  in the honour of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her glowing eyes rested upon his; they seemed desirous of penetrating to
  the innermost recesses of his soul. M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont tried to bear
  the scrutiny without flinching but he was no great actor, nor was he in the
  main a dishonourable man, but he thought his daughter unduly chivalrous,
  and he held that political considerations were outside the ordinary standards
  of honour and morality.</p>
  <p>Anyway he could not bring himself to give her a definite reply; her hand
  still grasped his wrist&mdash;he took it in his own and raised it to his
  lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; she pleaded, her voice trembling, her eyes still
  fixed upon him, &ldquo;will you not answer my question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is answered, my dear,&rdquo; he replied evasively. &ldquo;Do you
  think it worthy of me&mdash;your father&mdash;to protest mine honesty before
  my own child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him no longer, and gently withdrew her hand from his grasp.
  She understood that, indeed, he had answered her question.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  The Weight Of Etiquette</b></h2>
  <p>Perhaps certain characteristics which milor the Marquis of Eglinton had
  inherited from his English grandfather caused him to assume a more elaborate
  costume for his <i>petit lever</i> than the rigid court etiquette of the
  time had prescribed.</p>
  <p>According to every mandate of usage and fashion, when, at exactly half-past
  ten o&rsquo;clock, he had asked M. Achille so peremptorily for his shoes
  and then sat on the edge of his bed, with legs dangling over its sides, he
  should have been attired in a flowered dressing gown over a lace-ruffled <i>chemise
  de nuit</i>, and a high-peaked <i>bonnet-de-coton</i> with the regulation
  tassel should have taken the place of the still absent perruque.</p>
  <p>Then all the distinguished gentlemen who stood nearest to him would have
  known what to do. They had all attended <i>petits levers</i> of kings, courtisanes,
  and Ministers, ever since their rank and dignities entitled them so to do.
  Mme. la Comtesse de Stainville, for instance, would have stepped aside at
  this precise juncture with a deep curtsey and mayhap a giggle or a smirk&mdash;since
  she was privileged to be frivolous&mdash;whereupon M. Achille would with
  the proper decorum due to so solemn a function have handed M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  day shirt to the visitor of highest rank there present, who was privileged
  to pass it over milor&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>That important formality accomplished, the great man&rsquo;s toilet could
  be completed by <i>M. le valet-de-chambre</i> himself. But who had ever heard
  of a Minister&rsquo;s <i>petit-lever</i> being brought to a close without
  the ceremony of his being helped on with his shirt by a prince of the blood,
  or at least a marshal of France?</p>
  <p>However, <i>le petit Anglais</i> had apparently some funny notions of his
  own&mdash;heirlooms, no doubt, from that fog-ridden land beyond the seas,
  the home of his ancestors&mdash;and vainly had Monsieur Achille, that paragon
  among flunkeys, tried to persuade his Marquis not to set the hitherto inviolate
  etiquette of the Court of France quite so flagrantly at defiance.</p>
  <p>All his efforts had been in vain.</p>
  <p>Monsieur d&rsquo;Argenson, who was present on this 13th of August, 1746,
  tells us that when milor did call for his shoes at least ten minutes too
  soon, and was thereupon tenderly reproached by Madame la Comtesse de Stainville
  for this ungallant haste, he was already more than half dressed.</p>
  <p>True, the flowered <i>robe-de-chambre</i> was there&mdash;and vastly becoming,
  too, with its braided motifs and downy lining of a contrasting hue&mdash;but
  when milor threw off the coverlet with a boyish gesture of impatience, he
  appeared clad in a daintily frilled day-shirt, breeches of fine faced cloth,
  whilst a pair of white silk stockings covered his well-shaped calves.</p>
  <p>True, the perruque was still absent, but so was the regulation cotton night-cap;
  instead of these, milor, with that eccentricity peculiar to the entire British
  race, wore his own hair slightly powdered and tied at the nape of the neck
  with a wide black silk bow.</p>
  <p>Monsieur Achille looked extremely perturbed, and, had his rigorous features
  ventured to show any expression at all, they would undoubtedly have displayed
  one of respectful apology to all the high-born gentlemen who witnessed this
  unedifying spectacle. As it was, the face of <i>Monsieur le valet-de-chambre</i> was
  set in marble-like rigidity; perhaps only the slightest suspicion of a sigh
  escaped his lips as he noted milor&rsquo;s complete unconsciousness of the
  enormity of his offense.</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Contr&ocirc;leur had been in the very midst of an animated argument
  with Madame de Stainville anent the respective merits of rose red and turquoise
  blue as a foil to a mellow complexion. This argument he had broken off abruptly
  by calling for his shoes. No wonder Ir&egrave;ne pouted, her pout being singularly
  becoming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had I been fortunate enough in pleasing your lordship with my poor
  wit,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you had not been in so great a hurry to rid
  yourself of my company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, madame, permit me to explain,&rdquo; he protested gently. &ldquo;I
  pray you try and remember that for the last half-hour I have been the happy
  yet feeble target for the shafts aimed at me by your beauty and your wit.
  Now I always feel singularly helpless without my waistcoat and my shoes.
  I feel like a miserable combatant who, when brought face to face with a powerful
  enemy, hath been prevented from arming himself for the fray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But etiquette&mdash;&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Etiquette is a jade, madame,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;shall not
  you and I turn our backs on her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meantime M. Achille had, with becoming reverence, taken M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  coat and waistcoat in his august hands, and stood there holding them with
  just that awed expression of countenance which a village cur&eacute; would
  wear when handling a reliquary.</p>
  <p>With that same disregard for ceremony which had characterized him all along,
  Lord Eglinton rescued his waistcoat from those insistent hands, and, heedless
  of Achille&rsquo;s look of horror, he slipped it on and buttoned it himself
  with quick, dexterous fingers, as if he had never done anything else in all
  his life.</p>
  <p>For a moment Achille was speechless. For the first time perhaps in the history
  of France a Minister of Finance had put his waistcoat on himself, and this
  under his&mdash;Achille&rsquo;s&mdash;administration. The very foundations
  of his belief were tottering before his eyes; desperately now he clung to
  the coat, ready to fight for its possession and shed his blood if need be
  for the upkeep of the ancient traditions of the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will milor take his coat from the hands of Monseigneur le Prince
  de Courtenai&mdash;prince of the blood?&rdquo; he asked, with a final supreme
  effort for the re&euml;stablishment of those traditions, which were being
  so wantonly flouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty will be here directly,&rdquo; interposed Ir&egrave;ne
  hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty never comes later than half-past ten,&rdquo; protested
  milor feebly, &ldquo;and he has not the vaguest idea how to help a man on
  with his coat. He has had no experience and I feel that mine would become
  a heap of crumpled misery if his gracious hands were to insinuate it over
  my unworthy shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a desperate effort to gain possession of his coat, but this time
  M. Achille was obdurate. It seemed as if he would not yield that coat to
  any one save at the cost of his own life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it is the privilege of Monseigneur le Prince de Courtenai,&rdquo; he
  said firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But M. de Courtenai has gone to flirt with my wife!&rdquo; ejaculated
  Lord Eglinton in despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In that case no doubt M. le Duc de Luxembourg will claim the right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mais comment donc?</i>&rdquo; said the Duke with great alacrity,
  as, in spite of milor&rsquo;s still continued feeble protests, he took the
  coat from the hands of M. Achille.</p>
  <p>M. de Luxembourg was very pompous and very slow, and there was nothing that
  Lord Eglinton hated worse than what he called amateur valeting. But now there
  was nothing for it but forbearance and resignation; patience, too, of which <i>le
  petit Anglais</i> had no more than a just share. He gathered the frills of
  his shirt sleeves in his hands and tried not to look as if he wished M. de
  Luxembourg at the bottom of the nearest pond; but at this very moment Monseigneur
  le Prince de Courtenai, who, it appeared, had not gone to flirt with Madame
  la Marquise, since the latter was very much engaged elsewhere, but had merely
  been absorbed in political discussions with M. de Vermandois, suddenly realized
  that one of his numerous privileges was being encroached upon.</p>
  <p>Not that he had any special desire to help M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  on with his coat, but because he was ever anxious that his proper precedence
  as quasi prince of the blood should always be fully recognized. So he gave
  a discreet cough just sufficiently loud to attract M. Achille&rsquo;s notice,
  and to warn M. le Duc de Luxembourg that he was being presumptuous.</p>
  <p>Without another word the coat was transferred from the hands of the Mar&eacute;chal
  to those of the quasi-royal Prince, whilst Eglinton, wearing an air of resigned
  martyrdom, still waited for his coat, the frills of his shirt sleeves gripped
  tightly in his hands.</p>
  <p>Monseigneur advanced. His movements were always sedate, and he felt pleased
  that every one who stood close by had noticed that the rank and precedence,
  which were rightfully his, had been duly accorded him, even in so small a
  matter, by no less a personage than M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  des Finances.</p>
  <p>He now held the coat in perfect position, and Lord Eglinton gave a sigh
  of relief, when suddenly the great doors at the end of the long room were
  thrown wide open, and the stentorian voices of the royal flunkeys announced:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messieurs, Mesdames! His Majesty the King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The buzz of talk died down, giving place to respectful murmurs. There was
  a great rustle of silks and brocades, a clink of dress swords against the
  parquet floor, as the crowd parted to make way for Louis XV. The various
  groups of political disputants broke up, as if scattered by a fairy wand;
  soon all the butterflies that had hovered in the further corners of the room
  fluttered toward the magic centre.</p>
  <p>Here an avenue seemed suddenly to form itself of silken gowns, of brocaded
  panniers, of gaily embroidered coats, topped by rows of powdered perruques
  that bent very low to the ground as, fat, smiling, pompous, and not a little
  bored, His Majesty King Louis XV made slow progress along the full length
  of the room, leaning lightly on the arm of the inevitable Marquise de Pompadour,
  and nodding with great condescension to the perruqued heads as he passed.</p>
  <p>Near the window embrasure he met la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton and M. le
  Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, her father. To Lydie he extended a gracious hand, and
  engaged her in conversation with a few trivial words. This gave Mme. de Pompadour
  the opportunity of darting a quick glance, that implied an anxious query,
  at the Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, to which he responded with an almost imperceptible
  shake of the head.</p>
  <p>All the while M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Finances
  was still standing, shirt frills in hand, his face a picture of resigned
  despair, his eyes longingly fixed on his own coat, which Monseigneur de Courtenai
  no longer held up for him.</p>
  <p>Indeed, Monseigneur, a rigid stickler for etiquette himself, would never
  so far have forgotten what was due to the house of Bourbon as to indulge
  in any pursuit&mdash;such as helping a Minister on with his coat&mdash;at
  the moment when His Majesty entered a room.</p>
  <p>He bowed with the rest of them, and thus Louis XV at the end of his progress,
  found the group around milor&rsquo;s bedside; his cousin de Courtenai bowing,
  Monsieur Achille with his nose almost touching his knees, and milor Eglinton
  in shirt sleeves looking supremely uncomfortable, and not a little sheepish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! ce cher milor!&rdquo; said the King with charming bonhomie, as
  he took the situation in at a glance. &ldquo;Nay, cousin, I claim an ancient
  privilege! Monsieur le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, have you ever
  been waited on by a King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never to my knowledge, Sire,&rdquo; stammered <i>le petit Anglais</i>.</p>
  <p>Louis XV was quite delightful to-day; so fresh and boyish in his movements,
  and with an inimitable <i>laisser aller</i> and friendliness in his manner
  which caused many pairs of eyes to stare, and many hearts to ponder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let this be an epoch-making experience in your life, then,&rdquo; he
  said gaily. &ldquo;Is this your coat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without more ado he took that much-travelled garment from Monseigneur
  de Courtenai&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>Such condescension, such easy graciousness had not been witnessed for years!
  And His Majesty was not overfond of that State-appointed Ministry of Finance
  of which milor was the nominal head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty must be sorely in need of money!&rdquo; was a whispered
  comment which ran freely enough round the room.</p>
  <p>Withal the King himself seemed quite unconscious of the wave of interest
  to which his gracious behaviour was giving rise. He was holding up the coat,
  smiling benevolently at M. le Contr&ocirc;leur, who appeared to be more than
  usually nervous, and now made no movement toward that much-desired portion
  of his attire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allons, milor, I am waiting,&rdquo; said King Louis at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;that is,&rdquo; murmured Lord Eglinton pitiably, &ldquo;could
  I have my coat right side out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oh&eacute;! par ma foi!</i>&rdquo; quoth the King with easy familiarity, &ldquo;your
  pardon, milor, but &rsquo;tis seldom I hold such an article in my hands,
  and I believe, by all the saints in the calendar, that I was holding it upside
  down, wrong side out, sleeves foremost, and collar awry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed till his fat sides ached, and tears streamed from his eyes; then,
  amidst discreet murmurs of admiration at so much condescension, such gracious
  good humour, the ceremony of putting on M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s coat
  was at last performed by the King of France, and milor, now fully clothed
  and apparently much relieved in his mind, was able to present his respects
  to Madame de Pompadour.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Royal Favours</b></h2>
  <p>Apparently there was to be no end to royal graciousness this morning, as
  every one who looked could see. Hardly was the coat on M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  shoulders than the King engaged him in conversation, whilst Mme. de Pompadour
  dropped into the armchair lately vacated by Monseigneur de Courtenai. The
  well-drilled circle of courtiers and ladies, including la belle Ir&egrave;ne
  herself, retired discreetly. Once more there was a barrier of emptiness and
  parquet flooring round the inner group, now composed of His Majesty, of M.
  le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, and of Mme. de Pompadour. Into
  these sacred precincts no one would have dared to step. Lydie, having paid
  her respects to His Majesty, had not joined that intimate circle, and it
  seemed as if Louis XV had noted her absence, and was duly relieved thereat.</p>
  <p>Anon M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont approached the King, offering him a chair.
  Louis took it, and in the act of so doing he contrived to whisper four quick
  words in his Prime Minister&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh bien! Your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Eglinton just then was busy trying to find a suitable place whereon
  to deposit his own insignificant person, and blushing violently because Mme.
  de Pompadour had laughingly waved her fan in the direction of his monumental
  bed; M. le Duc, therefore, whilst adjusting a cushion behind the King&rsquo;s
  back, was able to reply hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, Sire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And l&rsquo;Anglais?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not yet tried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! ah! ah!&rdquo; laughed Pompadour merrily. &ldquo;M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  des Finances, are all Englishmen as modest as you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, Madame. I don&rsquo;t know very many,&rdquo; he
  replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here is M. le Contr&ocirc;leur too bashful to sit on the edge of
  his own bed in my presence,&rdquo; she continued, still laughing. &ldquo;Nay,
  milor, I&rsquo;ll wager that you were reclining on those downy cushions when
  you were flirting with Mme. de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only under the compulsion of my valet-de-chambre, Madame,&rdquo; he
  protested, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;d have got up hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is he such a tyrant, then?&rdquo; asked Louis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terrible, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are afraid of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tremble at his look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! it is well M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Finances
  should tremble sometimes, even if only before his valet-de-chambre,&rdquo; sighed
  Louis XV with comic pathos.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Sire, I tremble very often!&rdquo; protested Lord Eglinton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo; faith he speaks truly,&rdquo; laughed Mme. de Pompadour, &ldquo;since
  he trembles before his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And we tremble before M. le Contr&ocirc;leur,&rdquo; concluded the
  King gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before me, Sire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, indeed, since our Parliaments have made you our dragon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good-tempered, meek sort of dragon, Sire, you&rsquo;ll graciously
  admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we will, milor, and gladly!&rdquo; said Louis XV, now with somewhat
  too exuberant good-humour; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll not have cause to regret
  that meekness, for your King hath remained your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Lord Eglinton seemed either too much overcome by the amazing condescension,
  or too bashful to respond, his Majesty continued more sedately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are about to prove our friendship, milor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty&mdash;finds me&mdash;er&mdash;quite unprepared&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; stammered
  milor, who in verity appeared distinctly confused, for his eyes roamed round
  the room as if in search of help or support in this interesting crisis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay!&rdquo; rejoined the King benignly, &ldquo;this we understand,
  milor. It is not often the King of France chooses a friend amongst his subjects.
  For we look upon you as our subject now, M. le Contr&ocirc;leur, since we
  have accepted your oath of allegiance. You have only just enough English
  blood left in your veins to make you doubly loyal and true to your King.
  Nay! nay! no thanks&mdash;we speak as our royal heart moves us. Just now
  we spoke of proofs of our friendship. Milor, tell us frankly, are you so
  very rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The question came so abruptly at the end of the sentimental peroration that
  Lord Eglinton was completely thrown off his balance. He was not used to private
  and intimate conversations with King Louis; his wife saw to all affairs of
  State, and the present emergency found him unprepared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I believe so, Sire,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely not <i>so</i> rich,&rdquo; insisted the King, &ldquo;that
  a million or so livres would come amiss? H&eacute;!&rdquo;?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, Sire; it a little depends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the provenance of the million.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than one, good milor&mdash;two, mayhap,&rdquo; said the King
  exultantly.</p>
  <p>Then he drew his chair in somewhat closer. Lord Eglinton had taken Mme.
  de Pompadour&rsquo;s advice and was sitting on the edge of the bed. We may
  presume that that edge was very hard and uncomfortable, for milor fidgeted
  and looked supremely unhappy. Anon the King&rsquo;s knees were close to his
  own, and Madame&rsquo;s brocaded skirt got entangled with his feet. The buzz
  of talk in the large room drowned the King&rsquo;s whispers effectually,
  the wide barrier of empty floor was an effectual check on eavesdropping.
  Obviously no one would hear what Louis was about to confide to his Minister;
  he leaned forward and dropped his voice so that Eglinton himself could scarcely
  hear, and had to bend his head so that he got Louis&rsquo;s hot, excited
  breath full on the cheek. Being General Comptroller of Finance and receiving
  the confidences of a King had its drawbacks at times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; whispered his Majesty, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a good affair
  we would propose, one which we could carry through without your help, but
  in which we would wish to initiate you, seeing that you are our friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I listen, Sire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Cumberland&mdash;you know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has quelled the rebellion and humbled the standard of that arrogant
  Stuart Pretender.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s friend&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Eglinton innocently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! our friend!&rdquo; and Louis XV shrugged his shoulders, whilst
  Mme. de Pompadour gave a short contemptuous laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I am sorry! I thought&mdash;&rdquo; said milor gently. &ldquo;I
  pray your Majesty to continue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Charles Edward Stuart was no friend to us, milor,&rdquo; resumed
  Louis decisively: &ldquo;observe, I pray you, the trouble which he hath
  brought about our ears. We had had peace with England ere now, but for that
  accursed adventurer and his pretensions; and now that he has come to disaster
  and ruin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Eglinton, with a little sigh of sympathy. &ldquo;It
  is indeed awkward for your Majesty; the solemn promise you gave him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah, man! prate not to me of promises,&rdquo; interrupted Louis irritably. &ldquo;I
  promised him nothing; he knows that well enough&mdash;the young fool!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not let us think of him, Sire; it seems to upset your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does, milor, it does; for even my worst enemies concede that Louis
  the Well-beloved is a creature of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A heart of gold, Sire&mdash;a heart of gold&mdash;er&mdash;shall
  we join the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; said the King abruptly, putting a firm hand on Eglinton&rsquo;s
  wrist, &ldquo;we must not allow that young fool to thwart the external politics
  of France any longer. The Duke of Cumberland, though our own enemy on the
  field of battle, has shown that England trusts in our honour and loyalty
  even in the midst of war, but she wants a proof from us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, let us give it, Sire, by all means. Prince Charles Edward Stuart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly, milor,&rdquo; said Louis XV quietly; &ldquo;that is the
  proof which England wants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said Lord Eglinton,
  a little bewildered. &ldquo;You see, I am very stupid; and&mdash;and perhaps
  my wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as King Louis gave a sharp ejaculation of impatience, Mme. de Pompadour
  broke in, in tones which she knew how to render velvety and soothing to the
  ear, whilst her delicate fingers rested lightly on M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is quite simple, milor,&rdquo; she whispered just as confidentially
  as the King had done. &ldquo;This Charles Edward Stuart is a perpetual worry
  to England. His Grace, the Duke of Cumberland has been accused of unnecessary
  cruelty because he has been forced to take severe measures for the suppression
  of that spirit of rebellion, which is only being fostered in Scotland because
  of that young Pretender&rsquo;s perpetual presence there. He fans smouldering
  revolt into flame, he incites passions, and creates misguided enthusiasms
  which lead to endless trouble to all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she paused, somewhat breathless and eager, her bright myosotis-coloured
  eyes anxiously scanning his face he said mildly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How beautifully you put things, Mme. la Marquise. I vow I have never
  heard such a perfect flood of eloquence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a matter of Madame&rsquo;s eloquence,&rdquo; interposed
  Louis, with impatience, &ldquo;though she hath grasped the subject with
  marvellous clearness of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis a matter of what, Sire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Cumberland has appealed to our loyalty. Though we are
  at war with England we bear no animus toward her reigning house, and have
  no wish to see King George&rsquo;s crown snatched from him by that beardless
  young adventurer, who has no more right to the throne of England than you,
  milor, to that of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his Grace of Cumberland has asked his Majesty&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; added
  Mme. de Pompadour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How strange! Just as Prince Charles Edward himself hath done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Cumberland desires the person of the Pretender,&rdquo; she
  said, without heeding the interruption, &ldquo;so that he may no longer incite
  misguided enthusiasts to rebellion, and cease to plunge Scotland and England
  into the throes of civil war.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Grace asks but little, methinks!&rdquo; said Lord Eglinton slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, England is always ready to pay for what she wants,&rdquo; said
  the Marquise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on this occasion?&rdquo; asked milor mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Grace hath offered us, as man to man, fifteen millions livres
  for the person of the Pretender,&rdquo; said the King, with sudden decision,
  and looking M. le Contr&ocirc;leur straight in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! as man to man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis XV and Mme. la Marquise de Pompadour both drew a quick sigh of relief.
  M. le Contr&ocirc;leur had taken the proposal with perfect quietude. He had
  not seemed startled, and his kindly face expressed nothing but gentle amazement,
  very natural under the circumstances, whilst his voice&mdash;even and placid
  as usual&mdash;was not above a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As man to man,&rdquo; he repeated, and nodded his head several times,
  as if pondering over the meaning of this phrase.</p>
  <p>How extremely fortunate! Milor had raised no objection! What a pity to have
  wasted quite so much thought, anxiety, and a wealth of eloquence over a matter
  which was so easily disposed of! Jeanne de Pompadour gave her royal patron
  an encouraging nod.</p>
  <p>There was a world of wisdom in that nod and in the look which accompanied
  it. &ldquo;He takes it so easily,&rdquo; that look seemed to say; &ldquo;he
  thinks it quite natural. We must have his help, since we do not know where
  the fugitive Prince is in hiding. This little milor alone can tell us that,
  and give us a token by which Charles Edward would trustingly fall into the
  little ambush which we have prepared for him. But he thinks the affair quite
  simple. We need not offer him quite so large a share in the pleasant millions
  as we originally had intended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this and more Mme. de Pompadour&rsquo;s nod conveyed to the mind of
  Louis the Well-beloved, and he too nodded in response before he continued,
  speaking now more casually, in a calmer, more business-like tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a fair offer,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;though the
  affair will not be quite so easy to conduct as his Grace supposes. He suggests
  our sending a ship to the coast of Scotland to meet the young adventurer
  and his friends, take them on board and convey them to an English port, where
  they will be handed over to the proper authorities. &rsquo;Tis fairly simple,
  methinks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remarkably simple, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, we need a little help from you, milor. Oh, nothing much&mdash;advice
  as to the spot where our good ship will be most like to find Charles Edward
  Stuart&mdash;a token which if shown to that young firebrand will induce him
  to trust its bearer, and come on board himself with at least some of his
  friends. You follow me, milor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The question seemed necessary, for Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s face wore such
  a look of indifference as to astonish even the King, who had been prepared
  for some measure of protest, at any rate from this man who was being asked
  to betray his friend. Although Louis was at this period of his life quite
  deaf to every call of honour and loyalty through that constant, ever-present
  and exasperating want of money for the satisfaction of his extravagant caprices,
  nevertheless, there was Bourbon blood in him, and this cried out loudly now,
  that he was suggesting&mdash;nay, more, contemplating&mdash;a deed which
  would have put any of his subjects to shame, and which would have caused
  some of his most unscrupulous ancestors in medi&aelig;val times to writhe
  with humiliation in their graves. Therefore he had expected loud protest
  from Lord Eglinton, arguments more or less easy to combat, indignation of
  course; but this ready acceptance of this ignoble bargain&mdash;so strange
  is human nature!&mdash;for the moment quite horrified Louis. Milor took the
  selling of his friend as calmly as he would that of a horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You follow me, milor?&rdquo; reiterated the King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Sire,&rdquo; replied Eglinton readily enough. &ldquo;I
  follow you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You understand the service we ask of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For these services, milor, you shall be amply rewarded. We would
  deem one million livres a fair amount to fall to your share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty is generous,&rdquo; said Eglinton quite passively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are just, milor,&rdquo; said the King, with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
  <p>M. le Contr&ocirc;leur seemed satisfied, and there was little else to say.
  Louis XV began to regret that he had offered him quite so much. Apparently
  five hundred thousand would have been enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll call that settled,&rdquo; concluded his Majesty,
  pushing back his chair preparatory to ending this conversation, which he
  had so dreaded and which had turned out so highly satisfactory. Pity about
  that million livres, of course! five hundred thousand might have done, certainly
  seven! Nathless, M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s private fortune was not so
  large as popular rumour had it, or did Mme. Lydie actually hold the purse
  strings?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est entendu</i>, milor,&rdquo; repeated Louis once more. &ldquo;We
  will see to commissioning the ship and to her secret orders. As you see,
  there is no risk&mdash;and we shall be glad to be in the good graces of M.
  le Duc de Cumberland. To oblige an enemy, eh, milor? an act of peace and
  good-will in the midst of war. Chivalry, what?&mdash;worthy of our ancestor
  Henri of Navarre! Methinks it will make history.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, too, Sire,&rdquo; said Eglinton, with obvious conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! then we&rsquo;ll see to the completion of the affair; we&mdash;the
  King and M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont. You are lucky, milor, your share of the
  work is so simple; as soon as the ship is ready to sail we&rsquo;ll call
  on you for the necessary instructions. Par ma foi! &rsquo;tis a fine business
  for us all, milor; one million in your pocket for a word and a token, the
  residue of the fifteen millions in our royal coffers, and the thanks of his
  Grace of Cumberland to boot, not to mention the moral satisfaction of having
  helped to quell an unpleasant rebellion, and of placing one&rsquo;s enemy
  under lasting obligation. All for the good of France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis the Well-beloved had risen; he was more than contented; an unctuous
  smile, a beaming graciousness of expression pervaded his entire countenance.
  He groped in the wide pocket of his coat, bringing forth a letter which bore
  a large red seal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Grace&rsquo;s letter, milor,&rdquo; he said with final supreme
  condescension, and holding the document out to M. le Contr&ocirc;leur, who
  took it without a word. &ldquo;Do you glance through it, and see that we
  have not been mistaken, that the whole thing is clear, straightforward and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a damned, accursed, dirty piece of business, Sire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was undoubtedly Lord Eglinton who had spoken, for his right hand, as
  if in response to his thoughts, was even now crushing the paper which it
  held, whilst the left was raised preparatory to tearing the infamous proposal
  to pieces. Yes, it had been milor&rsquo;s even, gentle voice which had uttered
  this sudden decisive condemnation in the same impassive tones, and still
  scarce audible even to these two people near him, without passion, without
  tremor, seemingly without emotion. Just a statement of an undisputable fact,
  a personal opinion in answer to a question put to him.</p>
  <p>Louis, completely thrown off his balance, stared at milor as if he had been
  suddenly shaken out of a dream; for the moment he thought that his ears must
  have played him a trick, that he must have misunderstood the words so calmly
  uttered; instinctively his hand sought the support of the chair which he
  had just vacated. It seemed as if he needed a solid, a materialistic prop,
  else his body would have reeled as his brain was doing now. Mme. de Pompadour,
  too, had jumped to her feet, pushing her chair away with an angry, impatient
  movement. The disappointment was so keen and sudden, coming just at the moment
  when triumph seemed so complete. But whilst Louis stared somewhat blankly,
  at M. le Contr&ocirc;leur, she, the woman, flashed rage, contempt, vengeance
  upon him.</p>
  <p>He had tricked and fooled her, her as well as the King, leading them on
  to believe that he approved, the better to laugh at them both in his sleeve.</p>
  <p>The contemptible, arrogant wretch!</p>
  <p>He was still half sitting, half leaning against the edge of his bed, and
  staring straight out before him through the big bay window which gave on
  to the park, passively, gently, as if the matter had ceased to concern him,
  as if he were quite unconscious of the enormity of his action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a damned&mdash;what?&mdash;accursed!&mdash;what?&mdash;&rdquo; stammered
  the King; &ldquo;but, milor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Sire, I pray you!&rdquo; broke in a grave voice suddenly; &ldquo;my
  lord seems to have angered your Majesty. Will you deign to explain?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Diplomacy</b></h2>
  <p>The buzz of talk was going on as loudly and incessantly as before. The whispered
  conversation around M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s bedside had excited no
  violent curiosity. The first surprise occasioned by His Majesty&rsquo;s unparalleled
  condescension soon gave way to indifference; it was obvious that the King&rsquo;s
  assiduity beside the Minister of Finance was solely due to a more than normal
  desire for money, and these royal demands for renewed funds were too numerous
  to cause more than passing interest.</p>
  <p>Eavesdropping was impossible without gross disrespect, the latter far more
  unpardonable than the most insatiable curiosity. Lydie alone, privileged
  above all, had apparently not heeded the barrier which isolated Louis XV,
  Pompadour and milor from the rest of the vast apartment, for she now stood
  at the foot of the bed&mdash;a graceful, imposing figure dressed in somewhat
  conventual gray, with one hand resting on the delicate panelling, her grave,
  luminous eyes fixed on the King&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>Louis shook himself free from the stupor in which milor&rsquo;s unexpected
  words had plunged him. Surprise yielded now to vexation. Lydie&rsquo;s appearance,
  her interference in this matter, would be the final death-blow to his hopes.
  Those tantalizing millions had dangled close before his eyes, his royal hands
  had almost grasped them, his ears heard their delicious clink; milor&rsquo;s
  original attitude had brought them seemingly within his grasp. Now everything
  was changed. The whole affair would have to be argued out again at full length,
  and though <i>le petit Anglais</i> might prove amenable, Mme. Lydie was sure
  to be obdurate.</p>
  <p>Louis XV scowled at the picture of youth and beauty presented by that elegant
  figure in dove-gray silk, with the proud head carried high, the unconscious
  look of power and of strength in the large gray eyes, so grave and so fixed.
  In his mind there had already flashed the thought that milor&rsquo;s sudden
  change of attitude&mdash;for it was a change, of that his Majesty had no
  doubt&mdash;was due to a subtle sense of fear which had made him conscious
  of his wife&rsquo;s presence, although from her position and his own he could
  not possibly have seen her approach.</p>
  <p>This made him still more vexed with Lydie, and as she seemed calmly to be
  waiting for an explanation, he replied quite gruffly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, madame, you mistake; I assure you milor and ourselves are perfectly
  at one&mdash;we were so until a few moments ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until I came,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I am glad of that,
  for &rsquo;twill be easy enough, I hope, to convince your Majesty that my
  presence can have made no difference to M. le Contr&ocirc;leur&rsquo;s attitude
  of deep respect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi, we hope not!&rdquo; interposed Mme. de Pompadour acidly; &ldquo;but
  we hope milor hath found his tongue at last and will do the convincing himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Louis XV was not prepared to reopen the discussion in the presence of
  Mme. Lydie. He knew, quite as well as M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont himself, that
  she would have nothing but contempt and horror for that infamous proposal,
  which he was more determined than ever to accept.</p>
  <p>It was tiresome of course not to have the co&ouml;peration of Lord Eglinton;
  that weak fool now would, no doubt, be overruled by his wife. At the same
  time&mdash;and Louis hugged the thought as it sprang to his mind&mdash;there
  were other ways of obtaining possession of Charles Edward Stuart&rsquo;s
  person than the direct one which he had proposed to milor just now. The young
  Pretender was bound sooner or later to leave the shores of Scotland. Unbeknown
  to King Louis a ship might be sent by private friends to rescue the fugitive,
  but that ship could be intercepted on her way home, and, after all, Charles
  Edward was bound to land in France some day!&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>And there were other means besides of earning the tempting millions. But
  these would have to be thought out, planned and arranged; they would be difficult
  and not nearly so expeditious, which was a drawback when royal coffers were
  clamouring to be filled. Still, it would be distinctly unadvisable to broach
  the subject with Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton, and unnecessarily humiliating,
  since a rebuff was sure to be the result.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when&mdash;as if in placid defiance of Pompadour&rsquo;s challenge&mdash;Lord
  Eglinton handed the Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s letter silently back to the
  King, the latter slipped it into his pocket with a gesture of ostentatious
  indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! we need not trouble Mme. la Marquise with the discussion now,&rdquo; he
  said; &ldquo;she is unacquainted with the subject of our present conversation,
  and it would be tedious to reiterate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I crave your pardon, Sire,&rdquo; rejoined Lydie, &ldquo;if I have
  transgressed, but my zeal in the service of France and in that of your Majesty
  has rendered my senses preternaturally acute. My eyes see in the gloom, my
  ears hear across vast spaces.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a word, Mme. la Marquise has been listening!&rdquo; said Pompadour,
  with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not listen,&rdquo; said Lydie quietly. &ldquo;I only heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you know?&rdquo; said Louis, with well-assumed indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled at him as she replied. This was apparently a day of surprises,
  for the smile seemed distinctly encouraging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and what do you say?&rdquo; asked his Majesty somewhat
  anxiously, yet emboldened by that encouraging smile.</p>
  <p>Of a truth! was he about to find an ally there, where he expected most bitter
  opposition?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems that milor was somewhat hasty,&rdquo; replied Lydie quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a sigh of intense, deep, heartfelt, satisfaction breathed by Louis
  the Well-beloved, and unrestrainedly echoed by Mme. de Pompadour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This proposal, Sire,&rdquo; continued Lydie; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis from
  England, I understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From his Grace of Cumberland himself, Madame,&rdquo; assented the
  King, once more drawing the letter from out his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I be permitted to see it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>For a moment Louis hesitated, then he gave her the letter. There was no
  risk in this, since she practically owned to knowing its contents.</p>
  <p>And the whole affair would be so much easier, so much more expeditious with
  the co&ouml;peration of the Eglintons.</p>
  <p>Lydie read the letter through, seemingly deeply engrossed in its contents.
  She never once raised her eyes to see how she was being watched. She knew
  quite well that the King&rsquo;s eyes were fixed eagerly upon her face, that
  Pompadour&rsquo;s cupidity and greed for the proposed millions were plainly
  writ upon her face. But she had not once looked at her husband. She did not
  look at him now. He had not spoken since that sudden burst of indignation,
  when his slender hand crushed the infamous document which she now studied
  so carefully, crushed it and would have torn it to ribbons in loathing and
  contempt.</p>
  <p>When first she interposed he had turned and faced her. Since then she knew
  that his eyes had remained fixed on her face. She felt the gaze, yet cared
  not to return it. He was too weak, too simple to understand, and of her own
  actions she would be sole mistress; that had been the chief clause in the
  contract when she placed her hand in his.</p>
  <p>Her intuitive knowledge of this Court in which she moved, her suspicions
  of this feeble monarch, whose extravagant caprices had led him to deeds at
  which in his earlier days he had been the first to blush, her dread of intrigues
  and treachery, all had whispered in her ear the word of prudence&mdash;&ldquo;Temporize.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The whole infamous plan had been revealed to her through those same supernaturally
  keen senses, which her strong domineering nature had coerced, until they
  became the slaves of her will. Mingling with the crowd, her graceful body
  present in the chattering throng, her mind had remained fixed on that group
  beside the bed. She had noticed the King&rsquo;s expression of face when
  he engaged milor in conversation, his extraordinary <i>bonhomie</i>, his
  confidential attitude, his whispers, all backed and seconded by Pompadour.
  Gradually she man&oelig;uvred and, still forming a unit with the rest of
  the crowd, she had by degrees drawn nearer and nearer, until she saw her
  husband&rsquo;s movement, his almost imperceptible change of expression,
  as he clutched the letter which was handed him by the King.</p>
  <p>Then she boldly entered the inner precincts; being privileged, she could
  do even that, without creating attention. Milor&rsquo;s words of contempt,
  the royal arms of England on the seal of the letter, coupled with her father&rsquo;s
  attitude with her just now, and his veiled suggestions, told her all she
  wanted to know. And quick as flashes of summer lightning her woman&rsquo;s
  intuition whispered words of wisdom in her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know everything first&mdash;then temporize! Diplomacy will do more
  than defiance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having read the letter through, she of course knew all. It was simple enough&mdash;a
  monstrous proposal which the King of France was ready to adopt. She felt
  real physical nausea at contact with so much infamy.</p>
  <p>But she folded the document neatly and carefully, then looked quietly at
  the King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Cumberland is generous,&rdquo; she said, forcing herself
  to smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heu, heu!&rdquo; assented Louis lightly, with a return of his wonted <i>bonhomie</i>.
  Matters were shaping themselves to a truly satisfactory end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do I understand that your Majesty would desire us to accept his Grace&rsquo;s
  proposal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What think you yourself, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is worth considering,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Parbleu! And you are a true woman!&rdquo; exclaimed Louis XV, beaming
  with delight. &ldquo;Full of wisdom as a statesman should be. To think that
  we could ever have mistrusted so clear a head and so sound a judgment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty, I hope, will always remember that my sole desire is
  to serve France and her King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Par ma foi! We&rsquo;ll not forget your help in this, Madame,&rdquo; he
  exclaimed whole-heartedly. &ldquo;Then we may rely on your help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does your Majesty desire me to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He came quite close to her, and she forced herself not to draw back one
  inch. For the sake of the fugitive prince and his friends, who had trusted
  in the honour of France; for the sake of that honour which, in her peculiar
  position, was as dear to her as her own, she would not flinch now; she would
  show no repulsion, no fear, though her whole being rose in revolt at contact
  with this man.</p>
  <p>A man, not a king! Par Dieu, not a King of France!</p>
  <p>His face to her looked hideous, the eyes seemed to leer, and there was lust
  for money, and ignoble treachery writ on every feature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have explained it all to milor,&rdquo; whispered Louis under his
  breath; &ldquo;a ship to be commissioned and sent to meet the Stuart. She
  will have secret orders&mdash;no one shall know but her captain&mdash;and
  he will be a man whom we can trust&mdash;a man whom we shall have to pay&mdash;you
  understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then from you we want to know the place in Scotland where we will
  find Charles Edward&mdash;eh? And also a token&mdash;a ring, a word perhaps,
  by which that young adventurer will be made to trust his own person and that
  of his friends to our good ship. It is very simple, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite simple, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s orders will be that once the Stuart and his faction
  are on board, she shall make straight for the first English port&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;that
  is all!&rdquo; he added complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is all, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on the day that Charles Edward Stuart is handed over to the English
  authorities, there will be fifteen millions for your King, Madame, and a
  million livres pin money for the most able statesman in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with consummate gallantry, Louis bowed very low and took her hand in
  his. It rested cold and inert between his hot fingers, but he was far too
  eager, far too triumphant to notice anything beyond the fact that he had
  succeeded in enlisting the help of Lydie d&rsquo;Eglinton, without whom his
  project was bound to have been considerably delayed, if not completely frustrated.
  He had indeed not wasted this glorious morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am eternally your debtor, Madame!&rdquo; he said gaily; &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis
  well, believe me, to serve the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have done nothing as yet, Sire,&rdquo; she rejoined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, but you will,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>
  <p>She bowed her head and he interpreted the movement according to his will.
  But he was impatient, longing to see this matter finally settled to his entire
  satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not give me a definite answer now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the midst of so much chatter, Sire?&rdquo; she said, forcing herself
  to smile gaily. &ldquo;Nay, but &rsquo;tis a serious matter&mdash;and I must
  consult with my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis smiled contentedly. M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont was at one with him in
  this. The letter had been originally sent to the Prime Minister, and the
  Duke, who was weak, who was a slave to the Bourbon dynasty, and who, alas!
  was also tainted with that horrible canker which was gradually affecting
  the whole of the aristocracy of France, the insatiable greed for money, had
  been bribed to agree with the King.</p>
  <p>Therefore Louis was content. It was as well that Lydie should speak with
  the Duke. The worthy D&rsquo;Aumont would dissipate her last lingering scruples.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your husband?&rdquo; he added, casting a quick glance over his
  shoulder at milor, and smiling with good-natured sarcasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my husband will think as I do,&rdquo; she replied evasively.</p>
  <p>At thought of her father and the King&rsquo;s complacent smile, Lydie had
  winced. For a moment her outward calm threatened to forsake her. She felt
  as if she could not keep up this hideous comedy any longer. She would have
  screamed aloud with horror or contempt, aye! and deep sorrow, too, to think
  that her father wallowed in this mire.</p>
  <p>She too cast a quick glance at milor. His eyes were no longer fixed on her
  face. He stood quietly beside Madame de Pompadour, who, leaving the King
  to settle with Lydie, had engaged Lord Eglinton in frivolous conversation.
  He was quite placid again, and in his face, gentle and diffident as usual,
  there was no longer the faintest trace of that sudden outburst of withering
  contempt.</p>
  <p>The Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s letter was still in her hand. It seemed to
  scorch her fingers with its loathsome pollution. But she clung to it, and
  after a violent effort at self control, she contrived to look Louis straight
  in the face and to give him a reassuring smile, as she slipped the letter
  into the bosom of her gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will consult with my father, Sire,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and
  will read the letter when I am alone and undisturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will give me a final answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not sooner?&rdquo; he urged impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow,&rdquo; she reiterated with a smile. &ldquo;I
  have much to think about, and&mdash;the only token which Charles Edward would
  trust without demur must come from Lord Eglinton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the King knowingly. &ldquo;Par ma foi!
  But we shall want patience. Two whole days! In the meanwhile we&rsquo;ll
  busy ourselves with preparations for the expedition. We had thought of <i>Le
  Monarque</i>. What say you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Le Levantin</i> would be swifter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! <i>Le Levantin</i>&mdash;and we can trust her captain. He
  is under deep obligation to Madame de Pompadour. And M. de Lugeac, Madame&rsquo;s
  nephew, you know&mdash;we had thought of him to carry the secret orders to
  Brest to the captain of <i>Le Levantin</i> directly she is ready to sail.
  Methinks we could trust him. His interests are bound up with ours. And there
  is another, too; but more of that anon. The secret orders will bear our own
  royal signature, and you might place them yourself, with the token, in our
  chosen messenger&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more he gave her a gracious nod, and she curtseyed with all the deference,
  all the formality which the elaborate etiquette of the time demanded. Louis
  looked at her long and searchingly, but apparently there was nothing in the
  calm, serene face to disturb his present mood of complacent satisfaction.
  He put out his podgy hand to her; the short, thick fingers were covered with
  rings up to their first joint, and Lydie contrived to kiss the large signet&mdash;an
  emblem of that kingship to which she was true and loyal&mdash;without letting
  her lips come in contact with his flesh.</p>
  <p>What happened during the next ten minutes she could not afterward have said.
  Her whole mind was in a turmoil of thought, and every time the infamous letter
  crackled beneath her corselet, she shuddered as with fear. Quite mechanically
  she saw the King&rsquo;s departure, and apparently she acted with perfect
  decorum and correctness. Equally, mechanically she saw the chattering throng
  gradually disperse. The vast room became more and more empty, the buzz less
  and less loud. She saw milor as through a mist, mostly with back bent, receiving
  the <i>adieux</i> of sycophants; she heard various murmurs in her own ears,
  mostly requests that she should remember and be ready to give, or at least
  to promise. She saw the procession of courtiers, of flatterers, of friends
  and enemies pass slowly before her; in the midst of them she vaguely distinguished
  Mme. de Stainville&rsquo;s brightly coloured gown.</p>
  <p>La belle Ir&egrave;ne lingered a long time beside milor. She was one of
  the last to leave, and though Lydie forced herself not to look in that direction,
  she could not help hearing the other woman&rsquo;s irritating giggle, and
  Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s even, pleasant voice framing compliments, that pandered
  to that brainless doll&rsquo;s insatiable vanity.</p>
  <p>And this when he knew that his friend was about to be betrayed.</p>
  <p>The taint! The horror! The pollution of it all!</p>
  <p>Fortunately she had not seen her father, for her fortitude might have broken
  down if she read that same awful thought of treachery in his face that had
  so disgusted her when Louis stood beside her.</p>
  <p>The last of that senseless, indifferent crowd had gone. The vast room was
  empty. Milor had accompanied Mme. de Stainville as far as the door. The murmur
  of talk and laughter came now only as a faint and lingering echo. Anon it
  died away in the distant corridors.</p>
  <p>Lydie shivered as if with cold.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Strangers</b></h2>
  <p>And now she was alone.</p>
  <p>Torpor had left her; even that intensity of loathing had gone, which for
  the past half-hour had numbed her very senses and caused her to move and
  speak like an irresponsible automaton. She felt as if she had indeed seen
  and touched a filthy, evil reptile, but that for the moment it had gone out
  of her sight. Presently it would creep out of its lair again, but by that
  time she would be prepared.</p>
  <p>She must be prepared; therefore she no longer shuddered at the horror of
  it, but called her wits to her aid, her cool judgment and habitual quick
  mode of action, to combat the monster and render it powerless.</p>
  <p>She knew of course that the King would not allow himself to be put off with
  vague promises. Within the two days&rsquo; delay which she had asked of him
  he would begin to realize that she had only meant to temporise, and never
  had any intention of helping him in his nefarious schemes. Then he would
  begin to act for himself.</p>
  <p>Having understood that she meant to circumvent him if she could, he was
  quite shrewd enough to devise some means of preventing those tempting millions
  from eluding his grasp. Though he did not know at the present moment where
  or how to lay his hands on Prince Charles Edward and his friends, he knew
  that they would of necessity seek the loneliness of the west coast of Scotland.</p>
  <p>Vaguely that particular shore had always been spoken of in connection with
  any expedition for the succour of the unfortunate prince, and although the
  commissioning of ships was under the direct administration of the Comptr&ocirc;lleur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  of Finance, Louis, with the prospective millions dangling before him, could
  easily enough equip <i>Le Levantin</i>, and send her on a searching expedition
  without having recourse to State funds; whilst it was more than likely that
  Charles Edward, wearied of waiting, and in hourly fear of detection and capture,
  would be quite ready to trust himself and his friends to any French ship
  that happened to come on his track, whether her captain brought him a token
  from his friend or not.</p>
  <p>All this and more would occur to King Louis, of course, in the event of
  her finally refusing him co&ouml;peration, or trying to put him off longer
  than a few days. Just as she had thought it all out, visualized his mind,
  as it were, so these various plans would present themselves to him sooner
  of later. It was a great thing to have gained two days. Forty-eight hours&rsquo; start
  of that ignoble scheme would, she hoped, enable her to counteract it yet.</p>
  <p>So much for King Louis and his probable schemes! Now her own plans.</p>
  <p>To circumvent this awful treachery, to forestall it, that of course had
  become her task, and it should not be so difficult, given that two days&rsquo; start
  and some one whom she could trust.</p>
  <p>Plans now became a little clearer in her head; they seemed gradually to
  disentangle themselves from a maze of irrelevant thoughts.</p>
  <p><i>Le Monarque</i> was ready to start at any moment. Captain Barre, her
  commander, was the soul of honour. A messenger swift and sure and trustworthy
  must ride to Le Havre forthwith with orders to the captain to set sail at
  once, to reach that lonely spot on the west coast of Scotland known only
  to herself and to her husband, where Charles Edward Stuart and his friends
  were even now waiting for succour.</p>
  <p>The signet-ring&mdash;Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s&mdash;entrusted to Captain Barre
  should ensure the fugitives&rsquo; immediate confidence. There need be no
  delay, and with favourable wind and weather <i>Le Monarque</i> should have
  the Prince and his friends on board her before <i>Le Levantin</i> had been
  got ready to start.</p>
  <p>Then <i>Le Monarque</i> should not return home direct; she should skirt
  the Irish coast and make for Brittany by a circuitous route; a grave delay
  perhaps, but still the risks of being intercepted must be minimised at all
  costs.</p>
  <p>A lonely village inland would afford shelter to the Young Pretender and
  his adherents for a while, until arrangements could be made for the final
  stage of their journey into safety&mdash;Austria, Spain, or any country in
  fact where Louis&rsquo; treachery could not overtake them.</p>
  <p>It was a big comprehensive scheme, of course; one which must be carried
  to its completion in defiance of King Louis. It was never good to incur the
  wrath of a Bourbon, and, unless the nation and the parliaments ranged themselves
  unequivocally on her side, it would probably mean the sudden ending of her
  own and her husband&rsquo;s career, the finality of all her dreams. But to
  this she hardly gave a thought.</p>
  <p>The project itself was not difficult of execution, provided she had the
  co&ouml;peration of a man whom she could absolutely trust. This was the most
  important detail in connection with her plans, and it alone could ensure
  their success.</p>
  <p>Her ally, whoever he might be, would have to start this very afternoon for
  Le Havre, taking with him the orders for Captain Barre and the signet ring
  which she would give him.</p>
  <p>There were one hundred and fifty leagues between Versailles and Le Havre
  as the crow flies, and Lydie was fully aware of the measure of strength and
  endurance which a forced ride across country and without drawing rein would
  entail.</p>
  <p>It would mean long gallops at breakneck speed, whilst slowly the summer&rsquo;s
  day yielded to the embrace of evening, and anon the glowing dusk paled and
  swooned into the arms of night. It would mean a swift and secret start at
  the hour when the scorching afternoon sun had not yet lifted its numbing
  weight from the journeyman&rsquo;s limbs and still lulled the brain of the
  student to drowsiness and the siesta; the hour when the luxurious idler was
  just waking from sleep, and the labourer out in the field stretched himself
  after the noonday rest.</p>
  <p>It would mean above all youth and enthusiasm; for Le Havre must be reached
  ere the rising sun brought the first blush of dawn on cliffs, and crags,
  and sea; <i>Le Monarque</i> must set sail for Scotland ere France woke from
  her sleep.</p>
  <p>Twelve hours in the saddle, a good mount, the strength of a young bullock,
  and the astuteness of a fox!</p>
  <p>Lydie still sat in the window embrasure, her eyes closed, her graceful head
  with its wealth of chestnut hair resting against the delicate coloured cushions
  of her chair, her perfectly modelled arms bared to the elbow lying listlessly
  in her lap, one hand holding the infamous letter, written by the Duke of
  Cumberland to King Louis. She herself a picture of thoughtful repose, statuesque
  and cool.</p>
  <p>It was characteristic of her whole personality that she sat thus quite calmly,
  thinking out the details of her plan, apparently neither flustered nor excited.
  The excitement was within, the desire to be up and doing, but she would have
  despised herself if she had been unable to conquer the outward expressions
  of her agitation, the longing to walk up and down, to tear up that ignoble
  letter, or to smash some inoffensive article that happened to be lying by.</p>
  <p>Her thoughts then could not have been so clear. She could not have visualized
  the immediate future; the departure of <i>Le Monarque</i> at dawn&mdash;Captain
  Barre receiving the signet-ring&mdash;that breakneck ride to Le Havre.</p>
  <p>Then gradually from out the rest of the picture one figure detached itself
  from her mind&mdash;her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Le petit Anglais,&rdquo; the friend of Charles Edward Stuart; weak,
  luxurious, tactless, but surely loyal.</p>
  <p>Lydie half smiled when the thought first took shape. She knew so little
  of her husband. Just now, when she heard him condemn the King&rsquo;s treacherous
  proposals with such unequivocal words of contempt, she had half despised
  him for this blundering want of diplomatic art. Manlike he had been unable
  to disguise his loathing for Louis&rsquo; perfidy, and by trying to proclaim
  his loyalty to his friend, all but precipitated the catastrophe that would
  have delivered Charles Edward Stuart into the hands of the English. But for
  Lydie&rsquo;s timely interference the King, angered and huffed, would have
  departed then and there and matured his own schemes before anything could
  be done to foil them.</p>
  <p>But with her feeling of good-natured disdain, there had even then mingled
  a sensation of trust; this she recalled now when her mind went in search
  of the man in whom she could confide. She would in any case have to ask her
  husband for the token agreed on between him and the Stuart Prince, and also
  for final directions as to the exact spot where the fugitives would be most
  surely found by Captain Barre.</p>
  <p>Then why should he not himself take both to Le Havre?</p>
  <p>Again she smiled at the thought. The idea had occurred to her that she did
  not even know if milor could ride. And if perchance he did sit a horse well,
  had he the physical strength, the necessary endurance, for that flight across
  country, without a halt, with scarce a morsel of food on the way?</p>
  <p>She knew so little about him. Their lives had been spent apart. One brief
  year of wedded life, and they were more strange to one another than even
  they had been before their marriage. He no doubt thought her hard and unfeminine,
  she of a truth deemed him weak and unmanly.</p>
  <p>Still there was no one else, and with her usual determination she forced
  her well-schooled mind to dismiss all those thoughts of her husband which
  were disparaging to him. She tried not to see him as she had done a little
  while ago, giving himself over so readily to the artificial life of this
  Court of Versailles and its enervating etiquette, yielding to the whispered
  flatteries of Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville, pandering to her vanity, admiring
  her femininity no doubt in direct contrast to his wife&rsquo;s more robust
  individuality.</p>
  <p>Afterward, whenever she thought the whole matter over, she never could describe
  accurately the succession of events just as they occurred on that morning.
  She seemed after a while to have roused herself from her meditations, having
  fully made up her mind to carry her project through from beginning to end,
  and with that infamous letter still in her hand she rose from her chair and
  walked across the vast audience chamber, with the intention of going to her
  own study, there to think out quietly the final details of her plans.</p>
  <p>Her mind was of course intent on the Stuart Prince and his friends: on <i>Le
   Monarque</i> and Captain Barre, and also very much now on her husband;
   but she could never recollect subsequently at what precise moment the actual
   voice of Lord Eglinton became mingled with her thoughts of him.</p>
  <p>Certain it is that, when in crossing the room she passed close to the thronelike
  bedstead, whereupon her strangely perturbed imagination wilfully conjured
  up the picture of milor holding his court, with la belle Ir&egrave;ne in
  a brilliant rose-coloured gown complacently receiving his marked attentions,
  she suddenly heard him speak:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One second, I entreat you, Madame, if you can spare it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her own hand at the moment was on that gilded knob of the door, through
  which she had been about to pass. His voice came from somewhere close behind
  her.</p>
  <p>She turned slightly toward him, and saw him standing there, looking very
  fixedly at her, with a gaze which had something of entreaty in it, and also
  an unexplainable subtle something which at first she could not quite understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was going to my study, milor,&rdquo; she said, a little taken aback,
  for she certainly had not thought him in the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore I must crave your indulgence if I intrude,&rdquo; he said
  simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I serve you in any way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your ladyship is pleased to be gracious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was accustomed to his diffident manner and to his halting speech, which
  usually had the knack of irritating her. But just now she seemed inclined
  to be kind. She felt distinctly pleased that he was here. To her keenly sensitive
  nature it seemed as if it had been her thoughts which had called to him,
  and that something in him responded to her wish that he should be the man
  to take her confidential message to the commander of <i>Le Monarque</i>.</p>
  <p>Now his eyes dropped from her face and fixed themselves on the hand which
  had fallen loosely to her side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That paper which you hold, Madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To you? Why?&rdquo; she asked, as the encouraging smile suddenly
  vanished from her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I cannot bear the sight of Mme. la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton,
  my wife, sullying her fingers one second longer by contact with this infamy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke very quietly, in that even, gentle, diffident voice of his, whilst
  his eyes once more riveted themselves on her face.</p>
  <p>Instinctively she clutched the letter tighter, and her whole figure seemed
  to stiffen as she looked at him full now, a deep frown between her eyes,
  her whole attitude suggestive of haughty surprise and of lofty contempt.
  There was dead silence in the vast room save for the crackling of that paper,
  which to a keenly sensitive ear would have suggested the idea that the dainty
  hand which held it was not as steady as its owner would have wished.</p>
  <p>It seemed suddenly as if with the speaking of a few words these two people,
  who had been almost strangers, had by a subtle process become antagonists,
  and were unconsciously measuring one another&rsquo;s strength, mistrustful
  of one another&rsquo;s hidden weapons. But already the woman was prepared
  for a conflict of will, a contest for that hitherto undisputed mastery, which
  she vaguely feared was being attacked, and which she would not give up, be
  the cost of defence what it may, whilst the man was still diffident, still
  vaguely hopeful that she would not fight, for his armour was vulnerable where
  hers was not, and she owned certain weapons which he knew himself too weak
  to combat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore I proffer my request again, Madame,&rdquo; he said after
  a pause. &ldquo;That paper&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A strong request, milor,&rdquo; said Lydie coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is more than a request, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A command perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not reply; obviously he had noted the sneer, for a very slight blush
  rose to his pale cheeks. Lydie, satisfied that the shaft had gone home, paused
  awhile, just long enough to let the subtle poison of her last words sink
  well in, then she resumed with calm indifference:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will forgive me, milor, when I venture to call your attention
  to the fact that hitherto I have considered myself to be the sole judge and
  mentor of my own conduct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly this has worked very well in all matters, Madame,&rdquo; he
  replied, quite unruffled by her sarcasm, &ldquo;but in this instance you
  see me compelled to ask you&mdash;reluctantly I admit&mdash;to give me that
  letter and then to vouchsafe me an explanation as to what you mean to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will receive it in due course, milor,&rdquo; she said haughtily; &ldquo;for
  the moment I must ask you to excuse me. I am busy, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was conscious of an overwhelming feeling of irritation at his interference
  and, fearing to betray it beyond the bounds of courtesy, she wished to go
  away. But now he deliberately placed his hand on the knob, and stood between
  her and the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor!&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid I am very clumsy, Madame,&rdquo; he said quite gently. &ldquo;Let
  us suppose that French good manners have never quite succeeded in getting
  the best of my English boorishness. I know it is against every rule of etiquette
  that I should stand between you and the door through which you desire to
  pass, but I have humbly asked for an explanation and also for that letter,
  and I cannot allow your ladyship to go until I have had it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow?&rdquo; she said, with a short mocking laugh. &ldquo;Surely,
  milor, you will not force me to refer to the compact to which you willingly
  subscribed when you asked me to be your wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not necessary, Madame, for I well remember it. I gave
  you a promise not to interfere with your life, such as you had chosen to
  organize it. I promised to leave you free in thought, action, and conduct,
  just as you had been before you honoured me by consenting to bear my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, milor?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a different matter, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; he replied calmly, &ldquo;since
  it concerns mine own honour and that of my name. Of that honour I claim to
  be the principal guardian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she seemed disinclined to vouchsafe a rejoinder he continued, with
  just a shade more vehemence in his tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The proposal which His Majesty placed before me awhile ago, that
  same letter which you still hold in your hand, are such vile and noisome
  things that actual contact with them is pollution. As I see you now with
  that infamous document between those fingers which I have had the honour
  to kiss, it seems to me as if you were clutching a hideous and venomous reptile,
  the very sight of which should have been loathsome to you, and from which
  I should have wished to see you turn as you would from a slimy toad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you did yourself, milor?&rdquo; she said with a contemptuous shrug
  of the shoulders, thinking of his blunder, of the catastrophe which he all
  but precipitated, and which her more calm diplomacy had perhaps averted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I did, though no doubt very clumsily,&rdquo; he admitted simply, &ldquo;the
  moment I grasped its purport to the full. To see you, my wife&mdash;yes,
  my wife,&rdquo; he repeated with unusual firmness in answer to a subtle,
  indefinable expression which at his words had lit up her face, &ldquo;to
  see you pause if only for one brief half hour with that infamy before your
  eyes, with that vile suggestion reaching and dwelling in your brain the man
  who made it&mdash;be he King of France, I care not&mdash;kissing those same
  fingers which held the abominable thing, was unspeakably horrible in my sight;
  it brought real physical agony to every one of my senses. I endured it only
  for so long as etiquette demanded, hoping against hope that every second
  which went by would witness your cry of indignation, your contempt for that
  vile and execrable letter which, had you not interposed, I myself would have
  flung in the lying face of that kingly traitor. But you smiled at him in
  response; you took the letter from him! My God, I saw you put it in the bosom
  of your gown!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment, as if ashamed of this outburst of passion, so different
  to his usual impassiveness. It seemed as if her haughty look, her ill-concealed
  contempt, was goading him on, beyond the bounds of restraint which he had
  meant to impose on himself. She no longer now made an attempt to go. She
  was standing straight before him, leaning slightly back against the porti&egrave;re&mdash;a
  curtain of rich, heavy silk of that subtle brilliant shade, &rsquo;twixt
  a scarlet and a crimson, which is only met with in certain species of geranium.</p>
  <p>Against this glowing background her slim, erect figure, stiff with unbendable
  pride, stood out in vivid relief. The red of the silk cast ardent reflections
  into her chestnut hair, and against the creamy whiteness of her neck and
  ear. The sober, almost conventual gray of her gown, the primly folded kerchief
  at her throat, the billows of lace around the graceful arm formed an exquisite
  note of tender colour against that glaring geranium red. In one hand she
  still held the letter, the other rested firmly against the curtain. The head
  was thrown back, the lips slightly parted and curled in disdain, the eyes&mdash;half
  veiled&mdash;looked at him through long fringed lashes.</p>
  <p>A picture worthy to inflame the passion of any man. Lord Eglinton, with
  a mechanical movement of the hand across his forehead, seemed to brush away
  some painful and persistent thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, do not pause, milor,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Believe
  me, you interest me vastly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He frowned and bit his lip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Madame,&rdquo; he rejoined more calmly now. &ldquo;I
  was forgetting the limits of courtly manners. I have little more to say.
  I would not have troubled you with so much talk, knowing that my feeling
  in such matters can have no interest for your ladyship. When awhile ago this
  great bare room was at last free from the bent-backed, mouthing flatterers
  that surround you, I waited patiently for a spontaneous word from you, something
  to tell me that the honour of my name, one of the oldest in England, was
  not like to be stained by contact with the diplomatic by-ways of France.
  I had not then thought of asking for an explanation; I waited for you to
  speak. Instead of which I saw you take that miserable letter once more in
  your hand, sit and ponder over it without a thought or look for me. I saw
  your face, serene and placid, your attitude one of statesmanlike calm, as
  without a word or nod you prepared to pass out of my sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you thought fit to demand from me an explanation of my conduct
  in a matter in which you swore most solemnly a year ago that you would never
  interfere?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Demand is a great word, Madame,&rdquo; he said, now quite gently. &ldquo;I
  do not demand; I ask for an explanation on my knees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And just as he had done a year ago when first she laid her hand in his and
  he made his profession of faith, he dropped on one knee and bent his head,
  until his aching brow almost touched her gown.</p>
  <p>She looked down on him from the altitude of her domineering pride; she saw
  his broad shoulders, bent in perfect humility, his chestnut hair free from
  the conventional powder, the slender hands linked together now in a strangely
  nervous clasp, and she drew back because her skirt seemed perilously near
  his fingers.</p>
  <p>Will the gods ever reveal the secret of a woman&rsquo;s heart? Lydie loathed
  the King&rsquo;s proposal, the letter which she held, just as much as Lord
  Eglinton did himself. Awhile ago she had hardly been able to think or to
  act coherently while she felt the contact of that noisome paper against her
  flesh. If she had smiled on Louis, if she had taken the letter away from
  him with vague promises that she would think the matter over, it had been
  solely because she knew the man with whom she had to deal better than did
  milor Eglinton, who had but little experience of the Court of Versailles,
  since he had kept away from it during the major part of his life. She had
  only meant to temporize with the King, because she felt sure that that was
  the only way to serve the Stuart Prince and to avert the treachery.</p>
  <p>Nay, more, in her heart she felt that milor was right; she knew that when
  a thing is so vile and so abominable as Louis&rsquo; proposed scheme, all
  contact with it <i>is</i> a pollution, and that it is impossible to finger
  slimy mud without some of it clinging to flesh or gown.</p>
  <p>Yet with all that in her mind, a subtle perversity seemed suddenly to have
  crept into her heart, a perversity and also a bitter sense of injustice.
  She and her husband had been utter strangers since the day of their marriage,
  she had excluded him from her counsels, just as she had done from her heart
  and mind. She had never tried to understand him, and merely fostered that
  mild contempt which his diffidence and his meekness had originally roused
  in her. Yet at this moment when he so obviously misunderstood her, when he
  thought that her attitude with regard to the King&rsquo;s proposals was one
  of acceptance, or at least not of complete condemnation, her pride rose in
  violent revolt.</p>
  <p>He had no right to think her so base. He had invaded her thoughts at the
  very moment when they dwelt on his friend and the best mode to save him;
  nay, more, was she not proposing to associate him, who now accused her so
  groundlessly, with her work of devotion and loyalty?</p>
  <p>He should have known, he should have guessed, and now she hated him for
  his thoughts of her; she who had kept herself untainted in the midst of the
  worst corruption that ever infested a Court, whose purity of motives, whose
  upright judgments had procured her countless enemies amongst the imbecile
  and the infamous, she to be asked and begged to be loyal and to despise treachery!</p>
  <p>Nay, she was too proud now to explain. An explanation would seem like a
  surrender, an acknowledgment&mdash;<i>par Dieu</i> of what? and certainly
  a humiliation.</p>
  <p>According to milor, her husband, was there not one single upright and loyal
  soul in France except his own? No honour save that of his own name?</p>
  <p>She laughed suddenly, laughed loudly and long. Manlike, he did not notice
  the forced ring of that merriment. He had blundered, of course, but this
  he did not know. In the simplicity of his heart he thought that she would
  have been ready to understand, that she would have explained and then agreed
  with him as to the best means of throwing the nefarious proposal back into
  the King&rsquo;s teeth.</p>
  <p>At her laugh he sprang to his feet; every drop of blood seemed to have left
  his cheeks, which were now ashy pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, milor,&rdquo; she said with biting sarcasm, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis
  a mountain full of surprises that you display before my astonished fancy.
  Who had e&rsquo;er suspected you of so much eloquence? I vow I do not understand
  how your lordship could have seen so much of my doings just now, seeing that
  at that moment you had eyes and ears only for Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mme. de Stainville hath naught to do with the present matter, Madame,&rdquo; he
  rejoined, &ldquo;nor with my request for an explanation from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I refuse to give it, milor,&rdquo; she said proudly, &ldquo;and as
  I have no wish to spoil or mar your pleasures, so do I pray you to remember
  our bond, which is that you leave me free to act and speak, aye, and to guide
  the destinies of France if she have need of me, without interference from
  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with that refinement of cruelty of which a woman&rsquo;s heart is sometimes
  capable at moments of acute crises, she carefully folded the English letter
  and once more slipped it into the bosom of her gown. She vouchsafed him no
  other look, but gathering her skirts round her she turned and left him. Calm
  and erect she walked the whole length of the room and then passed through
  another doorway finally out of his sight.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Splendid Isolation</b></h2>
  <p>M. Durand looked flustered when Lydie suddenly entered his sanctum. But
  she was hardly conscious of his presence, or even of where she was.</p>
  <p>The vast audience chamber which she had just quitted so abruptly had only
  the two exits; the one close to which she had left milor standing, and the
  other which gave into this antechamber, where M. Durand usually sat for the
  express purpose of separating the wheat from the chaff&mdash;or, in other
  words, the suppliants who had letters of introduction or passports to &ldquo;le
  petit lever&rdquo; of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, from
  those who had not.</p>
  <p>It was not often that Mme. la Marquise came this way at all; no doubt this
  accounted in some measure for M. Durand&rsquo;s agitation when she opened
  the door so suddenly. Had Lydie been less absorbed in her own thoughts she
  would have noticed that his hands fidgeted quite nervously with the papers
  on his bureau, and that his pale watery eyes wandered with anxious restlessness
  from her face to the heavy porti&egrave;re which masked one of the doors.
  But, indeed, at this moment neither M. Durand nor his surroundings existed
  for her; she crossed the antechamber rapidly without seeing him. She only
  wanted to get away, to put the whole enfilade of the next reception rooms
  between herself and the scene which had just taken place.</p>
  <p>Something was ringing in her ears. She could not say for certain whether
  she had really heard it, or whether her quivering nerves were playing her
  a trick; but a cry had come to her across the vastness of the great audience-chamber,
  and rang now even through the closed door.</p>
  <p>A cry of acute agony; a cry as of an animal in pain. The word: &ldquo;Lydie!&rdquo; The
  tone: one of reproach, of appeal, of aching, wounded passion!</p>
  <p>She fled from it, unwilling to admit its reality, unwilling to believe her
  ears. She felt too deeply wounded herself to care for the pain of another.
  She hoped, indeed, that she had grievously hurt his pride, his self-respect,
  that very love which he had once professed for her, and which apparently
  had ceased to be.</p>
  <p>Once he had knelt at her feet, comparing her to the Madonna, to the saints
  whom Catholics revered yet dared not approach; then he talked of worship,
  and now he spoke of pollution, of stained honour, and asked her to keep herself
  free from taint. What right had he not to understand? If he still loved her,
  he would have understood. But constant intercourse with Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville
  had blurred his inward vision; the image of the Madonna, serene and unapproachable,
  had become faded and out of focus, and he now groped earthwards for less
  unattainable ideals.</p>
  <p>That this was in any way her fault Lydie would not admit. She had become
  his wife because he had asked her, and because he had been willing to cover
  her wounded vanity with the mantle of his adoration, and the glamour of his
  wealth and title. He knew her for what she was: statuesque and cold, either
  more or less than an ordinary woman, since she was wholly devoid of sentimentality;
  but with a purpose in her mind and a passion for work, for power and influence.
  Work for the good of France! Power to attain this end!</p>
  <p>Thus he had found her, thus he had first learned to love her! She had denied
  him nothing that he had ever dared to ask. This had been a bond between them,
  which now he had tried to break; but if he had loved her as heretofore he
  would not have asked, he would have known. How, and by what subtle process
  of his mind Lydie did not care to analyze.</p>
  <p>He would have known: he would have understood, if he still loved her.</p>
  <p>These two phrases went hammering in her brain, a complement to that cry
  which still seemed to reach her senses, although the whole enfilade of reception
  rooms now stretched their vastness between her and that persistent echo.</p>
  <p>Of course his love had been naught to her. It was nothing more at best than
  mute, somewhat dog-like adoration: a love that demanded nothing, that was
  content to be, to exist passively and to worship from afar.</p>
  <p>Womanlike, she apprised it in inverse ratio to its obtrusiveness; the less
  that was asked of her, the less she thought it worth while to give. But the
  love had always been there. At great social functions, in the midst of a
  crowd or in the presence of royalty, whenever she looked across a room or
  over a sea of faces, she saw a pair of eyes which rested on her every movement
  with rapt attention and unspoken admiration.</p>
  <p>Now she would have to forego that. The love was no longer there. On this
  she insisted, repeating it to herself over and over again, though this seemed
  to increase both the tension of her nerves, and the strange tendency to weakness,
  from which her proud spirit shrank in rebellion.</p>
  <p>She was walking very rapidly now, and as she reached the monumental staircase,
  she ran down the steps without heeding the astonished glances of the army
  of flunkeys that stood about on landing and corridors. In a moment she was
  out on the terrace, breathing more freely as soon as she filled her lungs
  with the pure air of this glorious summer&rsquo;s day.</p>
  <p>At first the light, the glare, the vibration of water and leaves under the
  kiss of the midday sun dazzled her eyes so that she could not see. But she
  heard the chirrup of the sparrows, the call of thrush and blackbird, and
  far away the hymn of praise of the skylark. Her nostrils drew in with glad
  intoxication the pungent fragrance of oak-leaved geraniums, and her heart
  called out joyfully to the secluded plantation of young beech trees there
  on her left, where she often used to wander.</p>
  <p>Thither now she bent her steps. It was a favourite walk of hers, and a cherished
  spot, for she had it always before her when she sat in her own study at the
  angle of the West Wing. The tall windows of her private sanctum gave on this
  plantation, and whenever she felt wearied or disheartened with the great
  burden which she had taken on her shoulders, she would sit beside the open
  casements and rest her eyes on the brilliant emerald or copper of the leaves,
  and find rest and solace in the absolute peace they proclaimed.</p>
  <p>And, at times like the present one, when the park was still deserted, she
  liked to wander in that miniature wood, crushing with delight the moist bed
  of moss under her feet, letting the dew-covered twigs fall back with a swish
  against her hands. She found her way to a tiny glade, where a rough garden
  seat invited repose. The glade was circular in shape, a perfect audience
  chamber, wherein to review a whole army of fancies. On the ground a thick
  carpet of brilliant green with designs of rich sienna formed by last year&rsquo;s
  leaves, and flecks of silver of young buds not yet scorched by the midday
  sun; all around, walls of parallel, slender trunks of a tender gray-green
  colour, with bold patches of glaring viridian and gold intermixed with dull
  blue shadows. And then a dado of tall bracken fantastic in shape and almost
  weird in outline, through which there peeped here and there, with insolent
  luxuriance, clumps of purple and snow-white foxgloves.</p>
  <p>Lydie sank on to the rough bench, leaning well back and resting her head
  against the hard, uneven back of the seat. Her eyes gazed straight upwards
  to a patch of vivid blue sky, almost crude and artificial-looking above the
  canopy of the beeches.</p>
  <p>She felt unspeakably lonely, unspeakably forsaken. The sense of injustice
  oppressed her even more than the atmosphere of treachery.</p>
  <p>Her father false and weak; her husband fickle and unjust! Prince Charles
  Edward abandoned, and she now powerless, probably, to carry through the work
  of rescue which she had planned! Until this moment she had not realized how
  much she had counted on her husband to help her. Now that she could no longer
  ask him to ride to Le Havre, and take her message to the commander of <i>Le
  Monarque</i>, she cast about her in vain for a substitute: some one whom
  she could trust. Her world was made up of sycophants, of flatterers, of pleasure-loving
  fops. Where was the man who would cover one hundred and eighty leagues in
  one night in order to redeem a promise made by France?</p>
  <p>Her head ached with the agony of this thought. It was terrible to see her
  most cherished hope threatened with annihilation. Oh! had she been a man!
  . . .</p>
  <p>Tears gathered in her eyes. At other times she would have scorned the weakness,
  now she welcomed it, for it seemed to lift the load of oppression from her
  heart. The glare of that vivid blue sky above weighed down her lids. She
  closed her eyes and for the space of a few seconds she seemed to forget everything;
  the world, and its treachery, the palace of Versailles, the fugitives in
  Scotland.</p>
  <p>Everything except her loneliness, and the sound of that cry: &ldquo;Lydie!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Clever Tactics</b></h2>
  <p>As soon as M. Durand had recovered from the shock of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s
  sudden invasion of his sanctum, he ran to the porti&egrave;re which he had
  been watching so anxiously, and, pushing it aside, he disclosed the door
  partially open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Comte de Stainville!&rdquo; he called discreetly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has she gone?&rdquo; came in a whisper from the inner room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! I pray you enter, M. le Comte,&rdquo; said M. Durand, obsequiously
  holding the porti&egrave;re aside. &ldquo;Madame la Marquise only passed
  through very quickly; she took notice of nothing, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville cast a quick searching glance round the room as he
  entered, and fidgeted nervously with a lace handkerchief in his hand. No
  doubt his enforced sudden retreat at Lydie&rsquo;s approach had been humiliating
  to his pride. But he did not want to come on her too abruptly, and was chafing
  now because he needed a menial&rsquo;s help to further his desires.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were a fool, man, to place me in this awkward position,&rdquo; he
  said with a scowl directed at M. Durand&rsquo;s meek personality, &ldquo;or
  else a knave, in which case . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten thousand pardons, M. le Comte,&rdquo; rejoined the little man
  apologetically. &ldquo;Madame la Marquise scarcely ever comes this way after <i>le
  petit lever</i>. She invariably retires to her study, and thither I should
  have had the honour to conduct you, according to your wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem very sure that Madame la Marquise would have granted me
  a private audience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would have done my best to obtain one for M. Le Comte,&rdquo; said
  M. Durand with becoming modesty, &ldquo;and I think I should have succeeded
  . . . with tact and diplomacy, Monsieur le Comte, we, who are privileged
  to . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; interrupted Gaston impatiently, &ldquo;but now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! now it will be much more difficult. Madame la Marquise is not
  in her study, and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will want more pay,&rdquo; quoth Gaston with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Monsieur le Comte . . .&rdquo; protested Durand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! how much more?&rdquo; said the Comte impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does M. le Comte desire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To speak with Madame la Marquise quite alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heu! . . . heu! . . . it is difficult. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Gaston de Stainville&rsquo;s stock of patience was running low. He never
  had a great deal. With a violent oath he seized the little man by the collar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two louis, you knave, for getting me that audience now, at once,
  or my flunkey&rsquo;s stick across your shoulders if you fool me any longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Durand apparently was not altogether unprepared for this outburst: perhaps
  his peculiar position had often subjected him to similar onslaughts on the
  part of irate and aristocratic supplicants. Anyway, he did not seem at all
  disturbed, and, as soon as the Comte&rsquo;s grip on his collar relaxed,
  he readjusted his coat and his cravat, and holding out his thin hand, he
  said meekly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The two louis I pray you, Monsieur le Comte. And,&rdquo; he added,
  when Gaston, with another oath, finally placed the two gold pieces on the
  meagre palm, &ldquo;will you deign to follow me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led the way through the large folding doors and thence along the enfilade
  of gorgeous reception rooms, the corridors, landings and staircase which
  Lydie herself had traversed just now. Gaston de Stainville followed him at
  a close distance, acknowledging with a curt nod here and there the respectful
  salutations of the many lackeys whom he passed.</p>
  <p>M. le Comte de Stainville was an important personage at Court: Madame de
  Pompadour&rsquo;s predilection for him was well known, and His Majesty himself
  was passing fond of the gallant gentleman&rsquo;s company, whilst Madame
  la Comtesse was believed to hold undisputed sway over M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
  des Finances.</p>
  <p>Thus Gaston met with obsequiousness wherever he went, and this despite the
  fact that he was not lavish with money. M. Durand would have expected a much
  heavier bribe from any one else for this service which he was now rendering
  to the Comte.</p>
  <p>Anon the two men reached the terrace. M. Durand then pointed with one claw-like
  finger to the spinney on the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte will find Madame la Marquise in yonder plantation,&rdquo; he
  said; &ldquo;as for me, I dare not vacate my post any longer, for M. le Contr&ocirc;leur
  might have need of me, nor would Monsieur le Comte care mayhap to be seen
  by Madame la Marquise in my company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston assented. He was glad to be rid of the mealy-mouthed creature, of
  whose necessary help in this matter he was heartily ashamed. Unlike Lydie,
  he was quite unconscious of the beauty of this August day: neither the birds
  nor the acrid scent of late summer flowers appealed to his fancy, and the
  clump of young beech trees only interested him in so far as he hoped to find
  Lydie there, alone.</p>
  <p>When he reached the little glade, he caught sight of the graceful figure,
  half-sitting, half-reclining in the unconscious charm of sleep. Overcome
  by the heat and the glare, Lydie had dozed off momentarily.</p>
  <p>Presently something caused her to open her eyes and she saw Gaston de Stainville
  standing there looking at her intently.</p>
  <p>She was taken at a disadvantage, since she had undoubtedly been asleep&mdash;if
  only for a moment&mdash;and she was not quite sure if her pose, when Gaston
  first caught sight of her, was sufficiently dignified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have disturbed you,&rdquo; he said humbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was meditating,&rdquo; she replied coldly, as she smoothed down
  her skirts and mechanically put a hand to her hair, lest a curl had gone
  astray.</p>
  <p>Then she made as if she would rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely you are not going?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have my work to do. I only stayed here a moment, in order to rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am intruding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, scarcely,&rdquo; she replied quietly. &ldquo;I was about to return
  to my work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it so urgent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The business of a nation, M. le Comte, is always urgent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So urgent that you have no time now to give to old friends,&rdquo; he
  said bitterly.</p>
  <p>She shrugged her shoulders with a quick, sarcastic laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old friends? . . . Oh! . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, old friends,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly. &ldquo;We were children
  together, Lydie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Much has occurred since then, Monsieur le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only one great and awful fault, which meseems hath been its own expiation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need we refer to that now?&rdquo; she asked calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed, we must,&rdquo; he replied earnestly. &ldquo;Lydie,
  am I never to be forgiven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there aught for me to forgive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An error, a grave error . . . a fault, if you will call it so
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I prefer to call it a treachery,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without one word of explanation, without listening to a single word
  from me. Is that just?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing that you could say now, Monsieur le Comte, that
  I should have the right to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he said with sudden vehemence, as he came nearer to
  her, and in a measure barred the way by which she might have escaped. &ldquo;Even
  a criminal at point of death is allowed to say a few words in self-defence.
  Yet I was no criminal. If I loved you, Lydie, was that wrong? . . . I was
  an immeasurable fool, I own that,&rdquo; he added more calmly, being quick
  to note that he only angered her by his violence, &ldquo;and it is impossible
  for a high-minded woman like yourself to understand the pitfalls which beset
  the path of a man, who has riches, good looks mayhap and a great name, all
  of which will tempt the cupidity of certain designing women, bent above all
  on matrimony, on influence and independence. Into one of these pitfalls I
  fell, Lydie . . . fell clumsily, stupidly, I own, but not inexcusably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to forget, M. le Comte,&rdquo; she said stiffly, &ldquo;that
  you are speaking of your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; he said with a certain sad dignity, &ldquo;I try not
  to forget it. I do not accuse, I merely state a fact, and do so before the
  woman whom I most honour in the world, who was the first recipient of my
  childish confidences, the first consoler of my boyhood&rsquo;s sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was when you were free, M. le Comte, and could bring your confidences
  to me; now they justly belong to another and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And by the heavens above me,&rdquo; he interrupted eagerly, &ldquo;I
  do that other no wrong by bringing my sorrows to you and laying them with
  a prayer for consolation at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He noted that since that first desire to leave him, Lydie had made no other
  attempt to go. She was sitting in the angle of the rough garden seat, her
  graceful arm resting on the back, her cheek leaning against her hand. A gentle
  breeze stirred the little curls round her head, and now, when he spoke so
  earnestly and so sadly about his sorrow, a swift look of sympathy softened
  the haughty expression of her mouth.</p>
  <p>Quick to notice it, Gaston nevertheless in no way relaxed his attitude of
  humble supplication; he stood before her with head bent, his eyes mostly
  riveted on the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is so little consolation that I can give,&rdquo; she said more
  gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a great one, if you will but try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not cast me out from your life altogether. Am I such a despicable
  creature that you cannot now and then vouchsafe me one kind look? . . . I
  did wrong you . . . I know it. . . . Call it treachery if you must, yet when
  I look back on that night, meseems I am worthy of your pity. Blinded by my
  overwhelming love for you, I forgot everything for one brief hour . . . forgot
  that I had sunk deeply in a pitfall&mdash;by Heaven through no fault of mine
  own! . . . forgot that another now had a claim on that love which never was
  mine to give, since it had always been wholly yours. . . . Yes! I forgot!
  . . . the music, the noise, the excitement of the night, your own beauty,
  Lydie, momentarily addled my brain. . . . I forgot the past, I only lived
  for the present. Am I to blame because I am a man and that you are exquisitely
  fair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He forced himself not to raise his voice, not to appear eager or vehement.
  Lydie only saw before her a man whom she had once loved, who had grievously
  wronged her, but who now stood before her ashamed and humbled, asking with
  utmost respect for her forgiveness of the past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us speak of it no longer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;believe me,
  Gaston, I have never borne you ill-will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the first time she had used his Christian name. The layer of ice was
  broken through, but the surface of the lake was still cold and smooth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but you avoid me,&rdquo; he rejoined seeking to meet her eyes, &ldquo;you
  treat me with whole-hearted contempt, whilst I would lay down my life to
  serve you, and this in all deference and honour, as the martyrs of old laid
  down their life for their faith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Protestations, Gaston,&rdquo; she said with a quick sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me prove them true,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Lydie, I watched
  you just now, while you slept; it was some minutes and I saw much. Your lips
  were parted with constant sighs; there were tears at the points of your lashes.
  At that moment I would have gladly died if thereby I could have eased your
  heart from the obvious burden which it bore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Emboldened by her silence, and by the softer expression of her face, he
  sat down close beside her, and anon placed his hand on hers. She withdrew
  it quietly and serenely as was her wont, but quite without anger.</p>
  <p>She certainly felt no anger toward him. Strangely enough, the anger she
  did feel was all against her husband. That Gaston had seen her grief was
  in a measure humiliating to her pride, and this humiliation she owed to the
  great wrong done her by milor. And Gaston had been clever at choosing his
  words; he appealed to her pity and asked for forgiveness. There was no attempt
  on his part to justify himself, and his self-abasement broke down the barrier
  of resentment which up to now she had set up against him. His respectful
  homage soothed her wounded pride, and she felt really, sincerely sorry for
  him.</p>
  <p>The fact that her own actions had been so gravely misunderstood also helped
  Gaston&rsquo;s cause; she felt that, after all, she too might have passed
  a hasty, unconsidered judgment on him, and knew now how acutely such a judgment
  can hurt.</p>
  <p>And he spoke very earnestly, very simply: remember that she had loved him
  once, loved and trusted him. He had been the ideal of her girlhood, and though
  she had remorselessly hurled him down from his high pedestal since then,
  there remained nevertheless, somewhere in the depths of her heart, a lingering
  thought of tenderness for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie!&rdquo; he now said appealingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me be the means of easing your heart from its load of sorrow.
  You spoke of my wife just now. See, I do not shirk the mention of her name.
  I swear to you by that early love for you which was the noblest, purest emotion
  of my life, that I do not wrong her by a single thought when I ask for your
  friendship. You are so immeasurably superior to all other women, Lydie, that
  in your presence passion itself becomes exalted and desire transformed into
  a craving for sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! how I wish I could believe you, Gaston,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me guess what troubles you now. Oh! I am not the empty-headed
  fop that you would believe. I have ears and eyes, and if I hold aloof from
  Court intrigues, it is only because I see too much of their inner workings.
  Do you really believe that I do not see what goes on around me now? Do I
  not know how your noble sympathy must at this very moment be going out to
  the unfortunate young prince whom you honour with your friendship? Surely,
  surely, you cannot be a party to the criminal supineness which at this very
  moment besets France, and causes her to abandon him to his fate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not France, Gaston,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And not you, surely. I would stake my life on your loyalty to a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he ejaculated triumphantly, as if this discovery
  had indeed caused him joyful surprise. &ldquo;Every fibre in my soul told
  me that I would not appeal to you in vain. You are clever, Lydie, you are
  rich, you are powerful. I feel as if I could turn to you as to a man. Prince
  Charles Edward Stuart honoured me with his friendship: I am not presumptuous
  when I say that I stood in his heart second only to Lord Eglinton. . . .
  But because I hold a secondary place I dared not thrust my advice, my prayers,
  my help forward, whilst I firmly believed that his greater friend was at
  work on his behalf. But now I can bear the suspense no longer. The crisis
  has become over-acute. The Stuart prince is in deadly danger, not only from
  supineness but from treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Clever Gaston! how subtle and how shrewd! she would never have to come to
  meet him on this ground, but he called to her. He came to fetch her, as it
  were, and led her along the road. He did not offer to guide her faltering
  footsteps, he simulated lameness, and asked for assistance instead of offering
  it.</p>
  <p>So clever was this move that Lydie was thrown off her guard. At the word &ldquo;treachery&rdquo; she
  looked eagerly into his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you think . . . ?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I have scented it in the air for some days. The King himself
  wears an air of shamefacedness when the Stuart prince is mentioned. Madame
  de Pompadour lately hath talked freely of the completion of her ch&acirc;teau
  in the Parc aux Cerfs, as if money were forthcoming from some unexpected
  source; then a letter came from England, which His Majesty keeps hidden in
  his pocket, whilst whispered conversations are carried on between the King
  and Madame, which cease abruptly if any one comes within earshot. Then to-day
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? . . . to-day?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly dare speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear it might give you pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am used to pain,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;and I would wish
  to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in the antechamber when His Majesty arrived for <i>le petit
   lever</i> of M. le Contr&ocirc;leur. I had had vague hopes of seeing you
   this morning, and lingered about the reception rooms somewhat listlessly,
   my thoughts dwelling on all the sad news which has lately come from Scotland.
   In the antechamber His Majesty was met by M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, your
   father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused again as if loth to speak, but she said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you overheard something which the Duke, my father, said to the
  King, and which confirmed your suspicions. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was His Majesty who spoke, obviously not aware that I was within
  earshot. He said quite airily: &lsquo;Oh! if we cannot persuade milor we
  must act independently of him. The Stuart will be tired by now of living
  in crags and will not be so chary of entrusting his valuable person to a
  comfortable French ship.&rsquo; Then M. le Duc placed a hand on His Majesty&rsquo;s
  arm warning him of my presence and nothing more was said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think that the King of France is about to deliver Prince
  Charles Edward Stuart to his enemies?&rdquo; she asked calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure of it: and the thought is more than I can bear. And I am
  not alone in this, Lydie. The whole of France will cry out in shame at such
  perfidy. Heaven knows what will come of it ultimately, but surely, surely
  we cannot allow that unfortunate young prince whom we all loved and <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> to
  be thus handed over to the English authorities! That is why I have dared
  intrude on you to-day. Lydie,&rdquo; he added now in a passionate appeal; &ldquo;for
  the sake of that noble if misguided young prince, will you try and forget
  the terrible wrong which I in my madness and blindness once did you? Do not
  allow my sin to be expiated by him! . . . I crave your help for him on my
  knees. . . . Hate me an you will! despise me and punish me, but do not deny
  me your help for him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice, though sunk now almost to a whisper, was vibrating with passion.
  He half dropped on his knees, took the edge of her skirt between his fingers
  and raised it to his lips.</p>
  <p>Clever, clever Gaston! he had indeed moved her. Her serenity had gone, and
  her cold impassiveness. She sat up, erect, palpitating with excitement, her
  eyes glowing, her lips parted, all her senses awake and thrilling with this
  unexpected hope.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In what manner do you wish for my help, Gaston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think the King and M. le Duc will do nothing for a day or two at
  any rate. I hoped I could forestall them, with your help, Lydie, if you will
  give it. I am not rich, but I have realized some of my fortune: my intention
  was to charter a seaworthy boat, equip her as well as my means allowed and
  start for Scotland immediately, and then if possible to induce the prince
  to cross over with me to Ireland, or, with great good luck I might even bring
  him back as far as Brittany. But you see how helpless I was, for I dared
  not approach you, and I do not know where I can find the prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I do not give you that help which you need?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would still charter the vessel and start for Scotland,&rdquo; he
  replied quietly. &ldquo;I cannot stay here, in inactivity whilst I feel that
  infamous treachery is being planned against a man with whom I have often
  broken bread. If you will not tell me where I can find Charles Edward Stuart,
  I will still equip a vessel and try and find him somehow. If I fail, I will
  not return, but at any rate I shall then not be a party or a witness to the
  everlasting shame of France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your expedition would require great pluck and endurance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have both, and boundless enthusiasm to boot. Two or three friends
  will accompany me, and my intention was to start for Brest or Le Havre to-night.
  But if you will consent to help me, Lydie . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; she interrupted eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not help you. &rsquo;Tis
  you who shall help me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The plan which you have formed I too had thought on it: the treachery
  of the King of France, my God! I knew it too. But my plans are more mature
  than yours, less noble and self-sacrificing, for, as you say, I have power
  and influence; yet with all that power I could not serve Prince Charles Edward
  as I would wish to do, because though I have pluck and endurance I am not
  a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you want me to help you? Thank God! thank God for that! Tell
  me what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To start for Le Havre&mdash;not Brest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This afternoon . . . reaching Le Havre before dawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There to seek out <i>Le Monarque</i>. She lies in the harbour, and
  her commander is Captain Barre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will hand him over a packet, which I will give you anon, and
  then return here as swiftly as you went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he asked in obvious disappointment, &ldquo;and
  I who had hoped that you would ask me to give my life for you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The faithful and speedy performance of this errand, Gaston, is worth
  the most sublime self-sacrifice, if this be purposeless. The packet will
  contain full instructions for Captain Barre how and where to find Prince
  Charles Edward. <i>Le Monarque</i> is ready equipped for the expedition,
  but . . .&rdquo; she paused a moment as if half ashamed of the admission, &ldquo;I
  had no one whom I could entrust with the message.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville was too keen a diplomatist to venture on this delicate
  ground. He had never once mentioned her husband&rsquo;s name, fearing to
  scare her, or to sting her pride. He knew her to be far too loyal to allow
  condemnation of her lord by the lips of another man; all he said now was
  a conventional:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ready!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she rose and held out her hand to him. He bowed with great deference,
  and kissed the tips of her fingers. His face expressed nothing but the respectful
  desire to be of service, and not one thought of treachery disturbed Lydie&rsquo;s
  serenity. Historians have, we know, blamed her very severely for this unconditional
  yielding of another&rsquo;s secret into the keeping of a man who had already
  deceived her once; but it was the combination of circumstances which caused
  her to act thus, and Gaston&rsquo;s masterly move in asking for her help
  had completely subjugated her. She would have yielded to no other emotion,
  but that of compassion for him, and the desire to render him assistance in
  a cause which she herself had so deeply at heart. She had no love for Gaston
  and no amount of the usual protestations would have wrung a confidence from
  her. But he had so turned the tables that it appeared that he was confiding
  in her; and her pride, which had been so deeply humiliated that self-same
  morning, responded to his appeal. If she had had the least doubt or fear
  in her mind, she would not have given up her secret, but as he stood so coldly
  and impassively before her, without a trace of passion in his voice or look,
  she had absolutely no misgivings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can be in the saddle at four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said in the
  same unemotional tones, &ldquo;when and how can I receive the packet from
  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wait for me here?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The packet
  is quite ready, and the walls of the palace have eyes and ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus they parted. She full of confidence and hope, not in any way attempting
  to disguise before him the joy and gratitude which she felt, he the more
  calm of the two, fearing to betray his sense of triumph, still trembling
  lest her present mood should change.</p>
  <p>Her graceful figure quickly disappeared among the trees. He gave a sigh
  of intense satisfaction. His Majesty would be pleased, and Madame de Pompadour
  would be more than kind. Never for a moment did the least feeling of remorse
  trouble his complacent mind; the dominant thought in him was one of absolute
  triumph and pride at having succeeded in hoodwinking the keenest statesman
  in France. He sat down on the garden seat whereon had been fought that close
  duel between himself and the woman whom he had once already so heartlessly
  betrayed. He thought over every stage of the past scene and smiled somewhat
  grimly. He felt quite sure that he individually would never have trusted
  for the second time a woman who had once deceived him. But Lydie had no such
  misgivings; as she now sped through the park, she no longer saw its artificiality,
  its stunted rose trees and the stultified plantations. The air was invigorating
  to breathe, the fragrance of the flowers was sweet, the birds&rsquo; twitter
  was delicious to the ear. There were good and beautiful things in this world,
  but the best of all was the loyalty of a friend.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  A Crisis</b></h2>
  <p>Lydie returned to the palace in a very different frame of mind than when,
  half an hour ago, she had run along corridor and staircase, her nerves on
  the jar, her whole being smarting under the sense of wrong and of injustice.</p>
  <p>Hope had consoled her since then, and the thought that her own cherished
  plan need not fail for want of a loyal man&rsquo;s help had in a measure
  eased that strange obsession which had weighed on her heart, and caused foolish
  tears to start to her eyes. She was also conscious of a certain joy in thinking
  that the companion of her childhood, the man who had been her earliest ideal
  was not so black a traitor as she had believed.</p>
  <p>Gaston had spoken of pitfalls, he owned to having been deceived, and there
  is no woman living who will not readily admit that her successful rival is
  naught but a designing minx. Gaston had always been weak where women were
  concerned, and Lydie forgave him his weakness, simply because he had owned
  to it and because she liked to think of his fault as a weakness rather than
  as a deliberate treachery.</p>
  <p>Now she only thought of her project. When first she had talked of commissioning <i>Le
   Monarque</i>, milor had entrusted her with all necessary directions by
   which Captain Barre could most easily reach the Stuart prince and his friends.
   It was but a very few weeks, nay days ago, that she had been quite convinced
   that the King himself would be foremost in the general desire to fit out
   an expedition for the rescue of the unfortunate Jacobites, and naturally
   the fitting-out of such an expedition would have been entrusted primarily
   to herself and incidentally to her husband.</p>
  <p>These directions she still had. All she had to do now was to embody them
  in the secret orders which Gaston de Stainville would hand over to the Commander
  of <i>Le Monarque</i>. Further orders would be anent getting the prince and
  his friends on board, and the route to be taken homeward, the better to ensure
  their safety.</p>
  <p>Beyond that she would need some sort of token which, when shown to Charles
  Edward Stuart by Captain Barre, would induce the young prince to trust himself
  and his friends unconditionally to <i>Le Monarque</i>. Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s
  signet ring had been spoken of for this object the day of the Young Pretender&rsquo;s
  departure, but now of course she could not ask milor for it. On the other
  hand she felt quite sure that a written word from her would answer the necessary
  purpose, a brief note sealed with the Eglinton arms.</p>
  <p>The thought of the seal as an additional message of good faith first occurred
  to her when she once more reached the West Wing of the palace.</p>
  <p>From the great square landing where she now stood, a monumental door on
  her right gave on her own suite of apartments. On the left was the long enfilade
  of reception rooms, with the vast audience chamber and milor&rsquo;s own
  withdrawing room beyond.</p>
  <p>She deliberately turned to the left, and once more traversed the vast and
  gorgeous halls where, half an hour ago, she had suffered such keen humiliation
  and such overwhelming disappointment. She forced herself not to dwell on
  that scene again, and even closed her eyes with a vague fear that the mental
  vision might become materialized.</p>
  <p>Beyond the audience chamber there were two or three more reception rooms,
  and from the last of these a door masked by a heavy porti&egrave;re, gave
  on milor&rsquo;s study. All these apartments were now deserted, save for
  a few flunkeys who stood about desultorily in the window embrasures. From
  one of them Lydie asked if M. le Contr&ocirc;leur des Finances was within,
  but no one remembered having seen milor since the <i>petit lever</i>, and
  it was generally thought that he had gone to Trianon. Lydie hesitated a moment
  before she opened the door; she scarcely ever entered this portion of the
  palace and had never once been in milor&rsquo;s private rooms. But she wanted
  that seal with the Eglinton arms, and would not admit, even to herself, that
  her husband&rsquo;s presence or absence interested her in the least.</p>
  <p>But on the threshold she paused. Milor was sitting at a gigantic escritoire
  placed squarely in front of the window. He had obviously been writing; at
  the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish of Lydie&rsquo;s skirts,
  he raised his head from his work and turned to look at her.</p>
  <p>Immediately he rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon for this intrusion, milor,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;your
  lacqueys gave me to understand that you were from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there anything that you desire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only a seal with the Eglinton arms,&rdquo; she replied quite casually, &ldquo;I
  have need of it for a private communication.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sought for the seal among the many costly objects which littered his
  table and handed it to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry that you should have troubled to come so far for it,&rdquo; he
  said coldly, &ldquo;one of my men would have taken it to your study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am sorry that I should have disturbed you,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;I
  was told that you had gone to Trianon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be on my way thither in a few moments, to place my resignation
  in the hands of His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your resignation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I have had the honour to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you will leave Versailles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make way for my successor, as soon as His Majesty hath appointed
  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you go . . . whither?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! what matter?&rdquo; he replied carelessly, &ldquo;so long as
  I no longer trouble your ladyship with my presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you will have no objection if I return to my father until your
  future plans are more mature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Objection?&rdquo; he said with a pleasant little laugh. &ldquo;Nay,
  Madame, you are pleased to joke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She felt a little bewildered: this unexpected move on his part had somehow
  thrown all her plans out of gear. For the moment she scarcely had time to
  conjecture, even vaguely, what her own future actions would be if her husband
  no longer chose to hold an important position in the Ministry. The thought
  that his resignation would of necessity mean her own, suddenly rushed into
  her mind with overwhelming violence, but she was too confused at present
  to disentangle herself from the maze of conflicting emotions which assailed
  her, when first she realized the unexpected possibility.</p>
  <p>She was toying with the seal, forgetful somehow of the purpose and the plans
  which it represented. These not being in jeopardy through milor&rsquo;s extraordinary
  conduct, she could afford to dismiss them from her mind.</p>
  <p>It was the idea of her husband&rsquo;s resignation and her own future which
  troubled her, and strangely enough there was such an air of finality about
  his attitude that, for the moment, she was somewhat at a loss how to choose
  a line of argument with which to influence him. That she could make him alter
  his decision she never doubted for a moment, but since the first day of their
  married life he had never taken any initiative in an important matter, and
  his doing so at this moment found her at first wholly unprepared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I to understand that my wishes in so vital a decision are not
  to be consulted in any way?&rdquo; she asked after a momentary pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will honour me, Madame, by making me acquainted with them,&rdquo; he
  replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must reconsider your resignation,&rdquo; she said decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is not possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have much important business of the nation in hand which I could
  not hand over to your successor in an incomplete state,&rdquo; she said haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no necessity for that, Madame, nor for depriving the nation
  of your able, guiding hand. The post of Comptroller of Finance need not be
  filled immediately. It can remain in abeyance and under your own matchless
  control, at the pleasure of His Majesty and M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, neither
  of whom will, I am sure, desire to make a change in an administration, which
  is entirely for the benefit of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him very keenly, through narrowed lids scanning his face and
  trying to read his intent. But there was obviously no look of sarcasm in
  his eyes, nor the hint of a sneer in the even placidity of his voice. Once
  more that unaccountable feeling of irritation seemed to overmaster her, the
  same sense of wrath and of injustice which had assailed her when she first
  spoke to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is senseless, milor,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;You
  seem to forget that I am your wife, and that I have a right to your protection,
  and to a fitting home if I am to leave Versailles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not forgetting that you are my wife, Madame, but my protection
  is worth so little, scarcely worthy of your consideration. As for the rest,
  my ch&acirc;teau of Vincennes is entirely at your disposal; a retinue of
  servants is there awaiting your orders, and my notary will this day prepare
  the deed which I have commanded wherein I humbly ask you to accept the ch&acirc;teau,
  its lands and revenues as a gift from me, albeit these are wholly unworthy
  of your condescension.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is monstrous, milor, and I&rsquo;ll not accept it,&rdquo; she
  retorted. &ldquo;Think you perchance I am so ready to play the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
  a forsaken wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A strange thought had been gradually creeping into her mind: a weird kind
  of calculation whereby she put certain events in juxtaposition to one another:
  the departure of Gaston de Stainville, for he had told her that he was prepared
  to go to Scotland whether she helped him in his expedition or not: then Ir&egrave;ne
  would be temporarily free, almost a widow since Gaston&rsquo;s return under
  those circumstances would have been more than problematical; and now milor
  calmly expressing the determination to quit Versailles, and to give away
  his ch&acirc;teau and lands of Vincennes, forsooth, as a sop to the forsaken
  wife, whilst Madame de Stainville&rsquo;s provocative attitude this morning
  more than bore out this conclusion.</p>
  <p>Lydie felt as if every drop of blood in her body rushed up violently to
  her cheeks, which suddenly blazed with anger, whilst his, at her suggestion,
  had become a shade more pale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am free to suppose, milor, that Madame de Stainville has something
  to do with your sudden decision!&rdquo; she said haughtily; &ldquo;therefore,
  believe me, I have no longer a wish to combat it. As the welfare of France,
  the work which I have in hand, interests you so little, I will not trouble
  you by referring to such matters again. By all means place your resignation
  in His Majesty&rsquo;s hands. I understand that you desire to be free. I
  only hope that you will assist me in not washing too much of our matrimonial
  linen in public. I have many enemies and I must refuse to allow your whims
  and fantasies to annihilate the fruits of my past labours, for the good of
  my country. I will confer with Monsieur le Duc, my father; you will hear
  my final decision from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned once more toward the door. He had not spoken one word in interruption,
  as with a harsh and trenchant voice she thus hurled insult upon insult at
  him. She only saw that he looked very pale, although his face seemed to her
  singularly expressionless: whilst she herself was conscious of such unendurable
  agony, that she feared she must betray it in the quiver of her mouth, and
  the tears which threatened to come to her eyes.</p>
  <p>When she ceased speaking, he bowed quite stiffly, but made no sign of wishing
  to defend himself. She left the room very hurriedly: in another second and
  she would have broken down. Sobs were choking her, an intolerable anguish
  wrung her heartstrings to that extent, that if she had had the power, she
  would have wounded him physically, as she hoped that she had done now mentally.
  Oh! if she had had the strength, if those sobs that would not be denied had
  not risen so persistently in her throat, she would have found words of such
  deadly outrage, as would at least have stung him and made him suffer as she
  was suffering now.</p>
  <p>There are certain pains of the heart that are so agonizing, that only cruelty
  will assuage them. Lydie&rsquo;s strong, passionate nature perpetually held
  in check by the force of her great ambition and by her will to be masculine
  and firm in the great purpose of her life, had for once broken through the
  trammels which her masterful mind had fashioned round it. It ran riot now
  in her entire being. She was conscious of overwhelming, of indomitable hate.</p>
  <p>With burning eyes and trembling lips she hurried through the rooms, and
  along the interminable corridors. The flunkeys stared at her as she passed,
  she looked so different to her usual composed and haughty self: her cheeks
  were flaming, her bosom heaving beneath the primly-folded kerchief, and at
  intervals a curious moan-like sound escaped her lips.</p>
  <p>Thus she reached her own study, a small square room at the extreme end of
  the West Wing, two of its walls formed an angle of the structure, with great
  casement windows which gave on that secluded spinney, with its peaceful glade
  which she loved.</p>
  <p>As soon as she entered the room her eyes fell on that distant beech plantation.
  A great sigh rose from her oppressed heart, for suddenly she had remembered
  her great purpose, the one project which was infinitely dear to her.</p>
  <p>The graceful beech trees far away, with their undergrowth of bracken and
  foxgloves gleaming in the sun, recalled to her that Gaston was waiting in
  their midst for her message to <i>Le Monarque</i>.</p>
  <p>Thank God, this great joy at least was not denied her. She still had the
  power and the will to accomplish this all-pervading object of her life: the
  rescue of the Stuart prince from the hands of his enemies and from the perfidy
  of his whilom friends.</p>
  <p>This thought, the recollection of her talk with Gaston, the work which still
  remained for her to do, eased the tension of her nerves and stilled the agonizing
  pain of her heart.</p>
  <p>With a tremendous effort of will she chased away from her mental vision
  the picture of that pale, expressionless face, which seemed to haunt her.
  She forced herself to forget the humiliation, the injustice, the affront
  which she had suffered to-day, and not to hear the persistent echo of the
  deadly insults which she had uttered in response.</p>
  <p>Her study was cool and dark; heavy curtains of soft-toned lavender fell
  beside the windows, partially shutting out the glare of the midday sun. Her
  secretaire stood in the centre of the room. She sat down near it and unlocked
  a secret drawer. For the next quarter of an hour her pen flew across two
  sheets of paper. She had in front of her a map of a certain portion of the
  West Coast of Scotland, with directions and other sundry notes carefully
  written in the margins, and she was writing out the orders for the commander
  of <i>Le Monarque</i> to reach that portion of the coast as quickly as possible,
  to seek out Prince Charles Stuart, who would probably be on the look-out
  for a French vessel, and having got him, and as many friends of his as accompanied
  him, safely aboard, to skirt the West Coast of Ireland and subsequently to
  reach Morlaix in Brittany, where the prince would disembark.</p>
  <p>There was nothing flustered or undetermined about her actions, she never
  paused a moment to collect her thoughts for obedient to her will they were
  already arrayed in perfect order in her mind: she had only to transfer them
  to paper.</p>
  <p>Having written out the orders for Captain Barre she carefully folded them,
  together with the map, and fastened and sealed them with the official seal
  of the Ministry of Finance: then she took one more sheet of paper and wrote
  in a bold clear hand:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bearer of this letter is sent to meet you by your true and faithful
  friends. You may trust yourself and those you care for unconditionally to
  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this note she affixed a seal stamped with the Eglinton arms: and across
  the words themselves she wrote the name &ldquo;Eglinton!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no reason to fear for a moment that the Stuart prince would have
  any misgivings when he received this message of comfort and of hope.</p>
  <p>Then with all the papers safely tied together and hidden in the folds of
  her corselet, she once more found her way down the great staircase and terraces
  and into the beech wood where M. de Stainville awaited her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  A Farewell</b></h2>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville had been sitting idly on the garden seat, vaguely wondering
  why Lydie was so long absent, ignorant of course of the acute crisis through
  which she had just passed. For the last quarter of an hour of this weary
  waiting, anxiety began to assail him.</p>
  <p>Women were so fickle and so capricious! which remark inwardly muttered came
  with singular inappropriateness from Gaston de Stainville. His keen judgment,
  however, fought his apprehensions. He knew quite well that Lydie was unlike
  other women, at once stronger and weaker than those of her own sex, more
  firm in her purpose, less bendable in her obstinacy. And he knew also that
  nothing could occur within the gorgeous walls of that palace to cause her
  to change her mind.</p>
  <p>But as the moments sped on, his anxiety grew apace. He no longer could sit
  still, and began walking feverishly up and down the little glade, like an
  animal caged within limits too narrow for its activity. He dared not wander
  out of the wood, lest she should return and, not finding him there, think
  at once of doubting.</p>
  <p>Thus when she once more appeared before him, he was not so calm as he would
  have wished, nor yet so keen in noting the subtle, indefinable change which
  had come over her entire personality. Desirous of masking his agitation,
  he knelt when she approached, and thus took the packet from her hand.</p>
  <p>The action struck her as theatrical, her mind being filled with another
  picture, that of a man motionless and erect, with pale, expressionless face,
  which yet had meant so much more of reality to her.</p>
  <p>And because of this theatricality in Gaston&rsquo;s attitude, she lost something
  of the fullness of joy of this supreme moment. She ought to have been happier,
  more radiant with hope for the future and with gratitude to him. She tried
  to say something enthusiastic, something more in keeping with the romance
  of this sudden and swift departure, the prospective ride to Le Havre, the
  spirit of self-sacrifice and courage which caused him to undertake this task,
  so different to his usual avocation of ease and luxury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, Gaston,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;guard the packet safely,
  and use your best endeavours to reach Le Havre ere the night hath yielded
  to a new dawn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not say more just now, feeling that if she added words of encouragement
  or of praise, they would not ring true, and would seem as artificial as his
  posture at her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will guard the packet with my life,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;and
  if perchance you wake to-night from dreams of the unfortunate prince, whom
  your devotion will save from death, send one thought wandering far away across
  the rich fields of Normandy, for they will be behind me by that time, and
  I will sight the port of Le Havre long before its church spires are tipped
  with gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God speed you then!&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not detain
  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She chided herself for her coldness, noting that Gaston on the other hand
  seemed aglow now with excitement, as he unbuttoned his coat and slipped the
  papers into an inner pocket. Then he sprang to his feet and seemed ready
  to go.</p>
  <p>Just at the moment of actual parting, when he asked for her hand to kiss,
  and she, giving it to him felt his lips trembling on her fingers, some measure
  of his excitement communicated itself to her, and she repeated more warmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God speed you, Gaston, and farewell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you, Lydie, for this trust which you have deigned to place
  in me! Two days hence at even I shall have returned. Where shall I see you
  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In my study. Ask for an audience. I will see that it is granted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next moment he had gone; she saw the rich purple of his coat gradually
  vanish behind the tall bracken. Even then she had no misgivings. She thought
  that she had done right, and that she had taken the only course by which
  she could ensure the safety of the Stuart prince, to whom France, whom she
  guided through the tortuous paths of diplomacy, and for whose honour she
  felt herself to be primarily responsible, had pledged her word and her faith.</p>

  Royal Thanks</b></h2>
  <p>In one of the smaller rooms of the palace of Trianon, His Majesty King Louis
  XV received M. le Comte de Stainville in private audience. Madame la Marquise
  de Pompadour was present. She sat in an armchair, close beside the one occupied
  by His Majesty, her dainty feet resting on a footstool, her hand given up
  to her royal patron, so that he might occasionally imprint a kiss upon it.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville sat on a tabouret at a respectful distance. He had
  in his hand a letter with a seal attached to it and a map, which had a number
  of notes scribbled in the margin. His Majesty seemed in a superlatively good
  humour, and sat back in his chair, his fat body shaking now and again with
  bursts of merriment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh! eh! this gallant Count!&rdquo; he said jovially, &ldquo;par ma
  foi! to think that the minx deceived us and our Court all these years, with
  her prim ways and prudish manner. Even Her Majesty the Queen looks upon Madame
  Lydie as a pattern of all the virtues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He leaned forward and beckoned to Gaston to draw his chair nearer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Voyons, M. le Comte,&rdquo; continued Louis with a humorous leer, &ldquo;there
  is no need for quite so much discretion. We are all friends together . .
  . eh? Tell us how you did it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville did draw his chair nearer to His Majesty, such a proffered
  honour was not to be ignored. His face wore an air of provocative discretion
  and a fatuous smile curled his sensual lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said unctuously, &ldquo;your Majesty who is <i>galant
   homme</i> par excellence will deign to grant me leave to keep inviolate
   the secret of how I succeeded in breaking through the barrier of prudery,
   set up by the most unapproachable woman in France. Enough that I did succeed:
   and that I have been made thrice happy by being allowed to place the result,
   with mine own hands, at the feet of the most adored of her sex.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with an elegant and graceful flourish of the arm, he rose from his tabouret
  and immediately dropped on one knee at Madame&rsquo;s feet, offering her
  the letter and the map which he held. She took them from him, regarding him
  with a smile, which fortunately the amorous but highly jealous monarch failed
  to see; he had just taken the papers from Pompadour and was gloating over
  their contents.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had best see M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont at once,&rdquo; said His
  Majesty with a quick return to gravity, as soon as Gaston de Stainville had
  once more resumed his seat. &ldquo;Go back to the palace now, Monsieur le
  Comte, Madame will allow you to take her chair, and then by using our own
  private entrance on the South side, you will avoid being seen from the West
  Wing. Needless to say, I hope, that discretion and wariness must be your
  watchword until the affair is brought to a successful conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville bent himself nearly double, and placed one hand there,
  where his heart was supposed to be, all in token that he would be obedient
  to the letter and the spirit of every royal command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We do not think,&rdquo; said Louis, with somewhat forced carelessness, &ldquo;that
  our subjects need know anything about this transaction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Sire,&rdquo; rejoined De Stainville most emphatically,
  whilst Madame too nodded very decisively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most people have strange ideas about politics and diplomacy,&rdquo; continued
  the King. &ldquo;Just as if those complicated arts could be conducted on
  lines of antiquated medi&aelig;val codes: therefore the whole business must
  be kept between our three selves now present, M. le Comte, and of course
  M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, who has helped us throughout, and without whom
  we could not now proceed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I quite understand, Sire,&rdquo; assented Gaston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are of course presuming that your happy influence over Madame
  Lydie will not cease with her giving you those papers,&rdquo; said Louis
  with another of his unpleasant leers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think not your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will hold her tongue, I should imagine . . . for very obvious
  reasons,&rdquo; said Madame with a malicious sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow you had best make our recommendations known to Monsieur le
  Duc d&rsquo;Aumont. Tell him that we suggest not relying on <i>Le Monarque</i> even
  though she be ready to put to sea, as her commander may be, for aught we
  know a secret adherent of the Stuart. We should not care to trust him, since
  the Eglintons seem to have been already to do so. A delay of five or six
  days while <i>Le Levantin</i> is being commissioned is better than the taking
  of any risk. Though we are doing nothing that we are ashamed of,&rdquo; added
  Louis the Well-beloved airily, &ldquo;we have no wish that the matter be
  bruited abroad, lest we be misunderstood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We must suppose that Monsieur le Comte de Stainville had been denied at
  his birth the saving gift of a sense of humour, for in reply to this long
  tirade from the King, he said quite seriously and emphatically:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty need not be under the slightest apprehension. Neither
  M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, I feel sure, nor I myself will in any way endanger
  the absolute secrecy of the transaction, lest we be misunderstood. As for
  Madame Lydie . . .&rdquo; He paused a moment, whilst carefully examining
  his well-trimmed nails: a smile, wherein evil intent now fought with fatuity,
  played round the corners of his lips. &ldquo;Madame Lydie will also hold
  her tongue,&rdquo; he concluded quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is well!&rdquo; assented the King. &ldquo;M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont
  will see to the rest. In five or six days, <i>Le Levantin</i> should be ready.
  Her secret orders have been drafted and already bear our royal signature.
  Now with this map and directions, and the private note for the Stuart, all
  so kindly furnished by Madame Lydie, the expedition should be easy, and above
  all quite swift. The sooner the affair is concluded and the money paid over,
  the less likelihood there is of our subjects getting wind thereof. We must
  stipulate, M. le Comte, since you are the youngest partner in this undertaking
  and the least prominent in the public eye, that you take the secret orders
  yourself to <i>Le Levantin</i>. We should not feel safe if they were in any
  one else&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank your Majesty for this trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For this special task, and for your work this afternoon, you shall
  be rewarded with two out of the fifteen millions promised by His Grace of
  Cumberland. M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont will receive three, whilst we shall
  have the honour and pleasure of laying the remainder at the feet of Madame
  la Marquise de Pompadour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He cast an amorous glance at Madame, who promptly rewarded him with a gracious
  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that is all which we need say for the present M. le Comte,&rdquo; concluded
  His Majesty; &ldquo;within six days from now you should be on your way to
  Brest where <i>Le Levantin</i> should by then be waiting her orders and ready
  to put to sea. A month later, if wind, weather and circumstances favour us,
  that young adventurer will have been handed over to the English authorities
  and we, who had worked out the difficult diplomatic problems so carefully,
  will have shared between us the English millions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With his habitual airy gesture, Louis now intimated that the audience was
  at an end. He was obviously more highly elated than he cared to show before
  Gaston, and was longing to talk over plans and projects for future pleasures
  and extravagances with the fair Marquise. Madame, who had the knack of conveying
  a great deal by a look, succeeded in intimating to Gaston that she would
  gladly have availed herself a little longer of his pleasant company, but
  that royal commands must prevail.</p>
  <p>Gaston therefore rose and kissed each hand, as it was graciously extended
  to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are pleased with what you have done, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; said
  the King as M. de Stainville finally took his leave, &ldquo;but tell me,&rdquo; he
  whispered slily, &ldquo;did the unapproachable Lydie yield with the first
  kiss, or did she struggle much? . . . eh? . . . B-r-r . . . my dear Comte,
  are your lips not frozen by contact with such an icicle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, your Majesty! all icicles are bound to melt sooner or later!&rdquo; said
  Gaston de Stainville with a smile which&mdash;had Lydie seen it&mdash;would
  have half killed her with shame.</p>
  <p>And with that same smile of fatuity still lurking round his lips, he bowed
  himself out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  Paternal Anxiety</b></h2>
  <p>M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, Prime Minister of His Majesty King Louis XV of
  France, was exceedingly perturbed. He had just had two separate interviews,
  each of half an hour&rsquo;s duration, and he was now busy trying to dissociate
  what his daughter had told him in the first interview, from that which M.
  de Stainville had imparted to him in the second. And he was not succeeding.</p>
  <p>The two sets of statements seemed inextricably linked together.</p>
  <p>Lydie, certainly had been very strange and agitated in her manner, totally
  unlike herself: but this mood of course, though so very unusual in her, did
  not astonish M. le Duc so much, once he realized its cause.</p>
  <p>It was the cause which was so singularly upsetting.</p>
  <p>Milor Eglinton, his son-in-law, had sent in his resignation as Comptroller-General
  of Finance, and this without giving any reason for so sudden and decisive
  a step. At any rate Lydie herself professed to be ignorant of milor&rsquo;s
  motives for this extraordinary line of action as she was of his future purpose.
  All she knew&mdash;or all that she cared to tell her father&mdash;was that
  her husband had avowedly the intention of deserting her: he meant to quit
  Versailles immediately, thus vacating his post without a moment&rsquo;s notice,
  and leaving his wife, whom he had allowed to conduct all State affairs for
  him for over a year, to extricate herself, out of a tangle of work and an
  anomalous position, as best she might.</p>
  <p>The only suggestion which milor had cared to put forward, with regard to
  her future, was that he was about to make her a free gift of his ch&acirc;teau
  and lands of Vincennes, the yearly revenues of which were close upon a million
  livres. This gift she desired not to accept.</p>
  <p>In spite of strenuous and diplomatic efforts on his part, M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont
  had been unable to obtain any further explanation of these extraordinary
  events from his daughter. Lydie had no intention whatever of deceiving her
  father and she had given him what she believed to be a perfectly faithful <i>expos&eacute;</i> of
  the situation. All that she had kept back from him was the immediate cause
  of the grave misunderstanding between herself and her husband, and we must
  do her the justice to state that she did not think that this was relevant
  to the ultimate issue.</p>
  <p>Moreover, she was more than loath to mention the Stuart prince and his affairs
  again before M. le Duc. She knew that he was not in sympathy with her over
  this matter and she dreaded to know with absolute certainty that there was
  projected treachery afoot, and that he perhaps would have a hand in it. What
  Gaston de Stainville had conjectured, had seen and overheard, what she herself
  had guessed, was not to her mind quite conclusive as far as her father&rsquo;s
  share in the scheme was concerned.</p>
  <p>She was deeply attached to her father, and her heart found readily enough
  a sufficiency of arguments which exonerated him from actual participation
  in such wanton perfidy. At any rate in this instance she chose ignorance
  rather than heartrending certainty, and as by her quick action and Gaston&rsquo;s
  timely and unexpected help, the actual treachery would be averted, she preferred
  to dismiss her father&rsquo;s problematical participation in it entirely
  from her mind.</p>
  <p>Thus she told him nothing of milor&rsquo;s attitude with regard to the Duke
  of Cumberland&rsquo;s letter; in fact, she never once referred to the letter
  or to the Young Pretender; she merely gave M. le Duc to understand that her
  husband seemed desirous of living his future life altogether apart from hers.</p>
  <p>M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont was sorely disquieted: two eventualities presented
  themselves before him, and both were equally distasteful. One was the scandal
  which would of necessity spread around his daughter&rsquo;s name the moment
  her matrimonial differences with her husband became generally known. M. le
  Duc d&rsquo;Aumont was too well acquainted with this Court of Versailles
  not to realize that Lydie&rsquo;s position, as a neglected wife, would subject
  her to a series of systematic attentions, which she could but regard in the
  light of insults.</p>
  <p>On the other hand M. le Duc could not even begin to think of having to forego
  his daughter&rsquo;s help in the various matters relating to his own administration.
  He had been accustomed for some years now to consult her in all moments of
  grave crises, to rely on her judgment, on her able guidance, worth ten thousand
  times more to him than an army of masculine advisers.</p>
  <p>In spite of the repeated sneers hurled at this era of &ldquo;petticoat government,&rdquo; Lydie
  had been of immense service to him, and if she were suddenly to be withdrawn
  from his official life, he would feel very like Louis XIII had done on that
  memorable Journ&eacute;e des Dupes, when Richelieu left him for twenty-four
  hours to conduct the affairs of State alone. He would not have known where
  to begin.</p>
  <p>But Lydie told him that her decision was irrevocable, or what was more to
  the point, milor had left her no alternative: his resignation was by now
  in His Majesty&rsquo;s hands, and he had not even suggested that Lydie should
  accompany him, when he quitted Versailles, in order to take up life as a
  private gentleman.</p>
  <p>It was all very puzzling and very difficult. M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont strongly
  deprecated the idea of his daughter vacating her official post, because of
  this sudden caprice of milor. He had need of her, and so had France, and
  the threads of national business could not be snapped in a moment. The post
  of Comptroller-General of Finance could remain in abeyance for awhile. After
  that one would see.</p>
  <p>Then with regard to the proposed gifts of the ch&acirc;teau and revenues
  of Vincennes, M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont would not hear of a refusal. Madame
  la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton must have a private establishment worthy of
  her rank, and an occasional visit from milor would help to keep up an outward
  appearance of decorum, and to throw dust in the eyes of the scandal-mongers.</p>
  <p>The interview with his daughter had upset M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont very
  considerably. The whole thing had been so unexpected: it was difficult to
  imagine his usually so impassive and yielding son-in-law displaying any initiative
  of his own. M. le Duc was still puzzling over the situation when M. le Comte
  de Stainville, specially recommended by His Majesty himself, asked for a
  private audience.</p>
  <p>And the next half-hour plunged M. le Duc into a perfect labyrinth of surmises,
  conjectures, doubts and fears. That Gaston de Stainville was possessed not
  only of full knowledge with regard to the Stuart prince&rsquo;s hiding-place,
  but also of a letter in Lydie&rsquo;s handwriting, addressed to the prince
  and sealed with her private seal, was sufficiently astonishing in itself,
  but the young man&rsquo;s thinly veiled innuendoes, his fatuous smiles, his
  obvious triumph, literally staggered M. le Duc, even though his palm itched
  with longing for contact with the insolent braggart&rsquo;s cheek. Every
  one of his beliefs was being forcibly uprooted; his daughter whom he had
  thought so unapproachable, so pure and so loyal! who had this very morning
  shamed him by her indignation at the very thought of this treachery, which
  she now so completely condoned! that she should have renounced her opinions,
  her enthusiasm for the sake of a man who had already betrayed her once, was
  more than M. le Duc could and would believe at first.</p>
  <p>Yet the proofs were before him at this very moment. They had been placed
  in his hand by Gaston de Stainville: the map with the marginal notes, which
  Lydie had so often refused to show even to her own father, and the letter
  in her handwriting with the bold signature right across the contents, bidding
  the unfortunate young prince trust the traitor who would deliver him into
  the hands of his foes.</p>
  <p>But M. le Duc would have had to be more than human not to be satisfied in
  a measure at the result of Gaston de Stainville&rsquo;s diplomacy; he stood
  in for a goodly share of the millions promised by England. But it was the
  diplomacy itself which horrified him. He had vainly tried to dissuade Lydie
  from chivalrous and misguided efforts on behalf of the young prince, or at
  any rate from active interference, if His Majesty had plans other than her
  own; but whilst she had rejected his merest suggestions on that subject with
  unutterable contempt, she had not only listened to Gaston de Stainville,
  but actually yielded her will and her enthusiasms to his pleadings.</p>
  <p>M. le Duc sighed when he thought it all out. Though Lydie had done exactly
  what he himself wanted her to do, he hated the idea that she should have
  done it because Gaston de Stainville had persuaded her.</p>
  <p>Later on in the afternoon when an excellently cooked dinner had softened
  his mood, he tried to put together the various pieces of the mental puzzle
  which confronted him.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville had obtained a certain ascendancy over Lydie, and Lydie
  had irretrievably quarrelled with her husband. Milor was determined to quit
  Versailles immediately; Lydie was equally bent on not relinquishing her position
  yet. Gaston de Stainville was obviously triumphant and somewhat openly bragged
  of his success, whilst milor kept to his own private apartments, and steadily
  forbade his door to every one.</p>
  <p>It was indeed a very difficult problem for an indulgent father to solve.
  Fortunately for his own peace of mind, M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont was not only
  indulgent to his own daughter whom he adored, but also to every one of her
  sex. He was above all a <i>preux chevalier</i>, who held that women were
  beings of exceptional temperament, not to be judged by the same standards
  as the coarser fibred male creatures; their beauty, their charm, the pleasure
  they afforded to the rest of mankind, placed them above criticism or even
  comment.</p>
  <p>And of course Lydie was very beautiful . . . and milor a fool . . . and
  . . . Gaston. . . . Well! who could blame Gaston?</p>
  <p>And it was most amazingly lucky that Lydie had given up her absurd ideas
  about that Stuart prince, and had thus helped those English millions to find
  their way comfortably across the Channel, into the pockets of His Majesty
  the King of France, and of one or two others, including her own doting father.</p>
  <p>And after that M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont gave up worrying any more about
  the matter.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Queen&rsquo;s Soir&eacute;e</b></h2>
  <p>What chronicler of true events will ever attempt to explain exactly how
  rumour succeeds in breaking through every bond with which privacy would desire
  to fetter her, and having obtained a perch on the swiftest of all currents
  of air, travels through infinite space, and anon, observing a glaringly public
  spot wherein to alight, she descends with amazing rapidity and mingles with
  the crowd.</p>
  <p>Thus with the news anent milor Eglinton&rsquo;s resignation of the General
  Control of Finance.</p>
  <p>By the time the Court assembled that evening for the Queen&rsquo;s reception,
  every one had heard of it, and also that milor, having had a violent quarrel
  with his wife, had quitted or was about to quit Versailles without further
  warning.</p>
  <p>The news was indeed exceedingly welcome. Not from any ill-will toward Lord
  Eglinton, of course, who was very popular with the ladies and more than tolerated
  by the men, nor from any sense of triumph over Madame Lydie, although she
  had not quite so many friends as milor, but because it happened to be Thursday,
  and every Thursday Her Majesty the Queen held her Court from seven o&rsquo;clock
  till nine o&rsquo;clock: which function was so deadly dull, that there was
  quite an epidemic of dislocated jaws&mdash;caused by incessant yawning&mdash;among
  the favoured few who were both privileged and obliged to attend. A piece
  of real gossip, well-authenticated, and referring to a couple so highly placed
  as Lord and Lady Eglinton, was therefore a great boon. Even Her Majesty could
  not fail to be interested, as Lydie had always stood very highly in the good
  graces of the prim and melancholy Queen, whilst milor was one of that very
  small and very select circle which the exalted lady honoured with her conversation
  on public occasions.</p>
  <p>Now on this same Thursday evening, Queen Marie Leszcynska entered her throne-room
  precisely at seven o&rsquo;clock. Madame Lydie was with her as she entered,
  and it was at once supposed that Her Majesty was already acquainted with
  Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s decision, for she conversed with the neglected wife
  with obvious kindliness and sympathy.</p>
  <p>His Majesty was expected in about a quarter of an hour. As Madame de Pompadour
  and her immediate entourage were excluded from these solemn functions, the
  King showed his disapproval of the absence of his friends by arriving as
  late as etiquette allowed, and by looking on at the presentations, and other
  paraphernalia of his wife&rsquo;s receptions, in morose and silent <i>ennui</i>.</p>
  <p>This evening, however, the proceedings were distinctly enlivened by that
  subtle and cheerful breath of scandal, which hovered all over the room. Whilst
  noble dowagers presented d&eacute;butante daughters to Her Majesty, and grave
  gentlemen explained to fledgling sons how to make a first bow to the King,
  groups of younger people congregated in distant corners, well away from the
  royal dais and discussed the great news of the day.</p>
  <p>Lydie did not mingle with these groups. In addition to her many other dignities
  and functions, she was Grande Mar&eacute;chale de la Cour to Queen Marie
  Leszcynska and on these solemn Thursday evenings her place was beside Her
  Majesty, and her duty to present such ladies of high rank who had either
  just arrived at Court from the country or who, for some other reason, had
  not yet had the honour of a personal audience.</p>
  <p>Chief among these reasons was the Queen&rsquo;s own exclusiveness. The proud
  daughter of Stanislaus of Poland with her semi-religious education, her narrow
  outlook on life, her unfortunate experience of matrimony, had a wholesome
  horror of the frisky matrons and flirtatious minxes whom Louis XIV&rsquo;s
  taste had brought into vogue at the Court of France; and above all, she had
  an unconquerable aversion for the various scions of that mushroom nobility
  dragged from out the gutter by the catholic fancies of le Roi Soleil.</p>
  <p>Though she could not help but receive some of these people at the monster
  Court functions, which the elaborate and rigid etiquette of the time imposed
  upon her, and whereat all the tatterdemalions that had e&rsquo;er filched
  a handle for their name had, by that same unwritten dictum, the right of
  entry, she always proudly refused subsequently to recognize in private a
  presentation to herself, unless it was made by her special leave, at one
  of her own intimate audiences, and through the mediation either of her own
  Grande Mar&eacute;chale de la Cour, or of one of her privileged lady friends.</p>
  <p>Thus Madame la Comtesse de Stainville, though formally presented at the
  general Court by virtue of her husband&rsquo;s title and position, had never
  had the honour of an invitation to Her Majesty&rsquo;s private throne-room.
  Queen Marie had heard vague rumours anent the early reputation of &ldquo;la
  belle brune de Bordeaux&rdquo;; this very nick-name, freely bandied about,
  grated on her puritanic ear. Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville, chafing under the
  restrictions which placed her on a level with the Pompadours of the present
  and the Montespans or La Valli&egrave;res of the past, had more than once
  striven to enlist Lydie&rsquo;s help and protection in obtaining one of the
  coveted personal introductions to Her Majesty.</p>
  <p>Lydie, however, had always put her off with polite but ambiguous promises,
  until to-day, when her heart, overfilled with gratitude for Gaston de Stainville,
  prompted her to do something which she knew must please him, and thus prove
  to him that she was thinking of him at the very time when he was risking
  his entire future and probably his life in an attempt to serve her.</p>
  <p>Her own troubles and sorrows in no way interfered with the discharge of
  her social duties. Whilst she still occupied certain official positions at
  Court, she was determined to fill them adequately and with perfect dignity.
  A brief note to Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville acquainted the latter lady with
  the pleasing fact, that Madame la Grande Mar&eacute;chale would have much
  pleasure in introducing her personally to Her Majesty the Queen that very
  same evening, and &ldquo;la belle brune de Bordeaux&rdquo; was therefore
  present at this most exclusive of all functions on Thursday, August 13, 1746,
  and duly awaited the happy moment when she could make her curtsey before
  the proudest princess in all Europe, in the magnificent gown which had been
  prepared some time ago in view of this possible and delightful eventuality.</p>
  <p>She stood somewhat isolated from the rest of the throng, between two or
  three of her most faithful admirers, holding herself aloof from the frivolity
  of the surrounding gossip and wearing a sphinx-like air of detachment and
  of hidden and sorrowful knowledge.</p>
  <p>To every comment as to the non-appearance of her lord at the soir&eacute;e,
  she had mutely replied by a slight shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>Up in the gallery, behind a screen of exotic plants, the band of musicians
  was playing one of M. Lulli&rsquo;s most famous compositions, the beautiful
  motet in E flat which, alone amongst the works of that master of melody,
  was sufficiently serious and sedate for the Queen&rsquo;s taste. Anon Her
  Majesty gave the signal that dancing might begin. She liked to watch it,
  if it was decorously performed, though she never joined in it herself. Therefore
  a measured and stately gavotte was danced by the young people every Thursday,
  and perhaps a majestic pavane afterward. But the minuet was thought unbecoming.
  Her Majesty sat in one of the heavy gilded chairs underneath the canopy,
  the other being reserved for King Louis.</p>
  <p>Lydie watched the gavotte with dreamy, abstracted eyes; every now and then
  the Queen spoke to her, and the force of habit caused her to reply coherently
  and with that formality of expression, which Her Majesty liked to hear. But
  her mind was very far from her surroundings. It was accompanying Gaston de
  Stainville on his reckless ride through the rich plains of Normandy; her
  wishes sped him on his way, her gratitude for his noble self-sacrifice would
  have guarded him from the perils of the road.</p>
  <p>The monotonous tune of the gavotte with its distinct and sharply defined
  beat, sounded to her like the measured clink of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on
  rough hard ground. She was quite unconscious that, from every corner of the
  room, inquisitive and sarcastic eyes were watching all her movements.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  Gossip</b></h2>
  <p>Whilst the younger people danced, the older ones gossiped, and the absence
  of any known facts rendered the gossip doubly interesting.</p>
  <p>There was one group most especially so engaged; at the further corner of
  the room, and with sixteen dancing pairs intervening between it and the royal
  da&iuml;s, there was little fear of Her Majesty overhearing any frivolous
  comments on the all-absorbing topic of the day, or of Madame Lydie herself
  being made aware of their existence.</p>
  <p>Here Madame de la Beaume, a young and pretty matron, possessed of a good-looking
  husband who did not trouble her much with his company, was the centre of
  a gaily cackling little crowd, not unlike an assemblage of geese beside a
  stream at eventide. Young M. de Louvois was there and the old Duchesse de
  Pontchartrain, also M. Cr&eacute;billon, the most inveterate scandal-monger
  of his time, and several others.</p>
  <p>They all talked in whispers, glad that the music drowned every echo of this
  most enjoyable conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have it from my coiffeur, whose son was on duty in an adjacent
  room, that there was a violent quarrel between them,&rdquo; said Madame de
  la Beaume with becoming mystery. &ldquo;The man says that Madame Lydie screamed
  and raged for half an hour, then flew out of the room and along the passages
  like one possessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These English are very peculiar people,&rdquo; said M. Cr&eacute;billon
  sententiously. &ldquo;I have it on M. de Voltaire&rsquo;s own authority
  that English husbands always beat their wives, and he spent some considerable
  time in England recently studying their manners and customs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We may take it for granted that milor Eglinton, though partly civilized
  through his French parentage, hath retained some of his native brutality,&rdquo; added
  another cavalier gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it is quite natural that Madame Lydie would not tolerate his
  treatment of her,&rdquo; concluded the old Duchess.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Madame de la Beaume pathetically, &ldquo;I believe
  that English husbands beat their wives only out of jealousy. At least, so
  I have been told, whereas ours are too often unfaithful to feel any such
  violent and uncomfortable pangs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; quoth young M. de Louvois, casting an admiring glance
  at Madame&rsquo;s bold d&eacute;colletage, &ldquo;you would not wish M. de
  la Beaume to lay hands on those beautiful shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heu! heu!&rdquo; nodded Madame enigmatically.</p>
  <p>M. Cr&eacute;billon cast an inquisitorial look at Madame de Stainville,
  who was standing close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! from what I hear,&rdquo; he said mysteriously, &ldquo;milor
  Eglinton had quite sufficient provocation for his jealousy, and like an Englishman
  he availed himself of the privileges which the customs of his own country
  grant him, and he frankly beat his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every one rallied round him, for he seemed to have fuller details than any
  one else, and Madame de la Beaume whispered eagerly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean M. de Stainville. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh,&rdquo; interrupted the old Duchess quickly, &ldquo;here
  comes miladi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Dowager Marchioness of Eglinton, &ldquo;miladi,&rdquo; as she was always
  called, was far too shrewd and too well versed in the manners and customs
  of her friends not to be fully aware of the gossip that was going on all
  round the room. Very irate at having been kept in ignorance of the facts
  which had caused her son&rsquo;s sudden decision, and Lydie&rsquo;s strange
  attitude, she was nevertheless determined that, whatever scandal was being
  bruited abroad, it should prove primarily to the detriment of her daughter-in-law&rsquo;s
  reputation.</p>
  <p>Therefore, whenever, to-night, she noted groups congregated in corners,
  and conversations being obviously carried on in whispers, she boldly approached
  and joined in the gossip, depositing a poisoned shaft here and there with
  great cleverness, all the more easily as it was generally supposed that she
  knew a great deal more than she cared to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I beg of you, Mesdames and Messieurs,&rdquo; she now said quite
  cheerfully, &ldquo;do not let me interrupt your conversation. Alas! do I
  not know its subject? . . . My poor son cannot be to blame in the unfortunate
  affair. Lydie, though she may be wholly innocent in the matter, is singularly
  obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you really think that?&mdash;&rdquo; queried Madame de
  la Beaume eagerly, and then paused, half afraid that she had said too much.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! what can I say?&rdquo; rejoined miladi with a sigh. &ldquo;I
  was brought up in the days when we women were taught obedience to our husband&rsquo;s
  wishes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame Lydie was not like to have learnt the first phrase of that
  wholesome lesson,&rdquo; quoth M. de Louvois with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly, cher Monsieur,&rdquo; assented miladi, as she sailed majestically
  on to another group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did miladi mean exactly?&rdquo; asked M. Cr&eacute;billon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! she is so kind-hearted, such an angel!&rdquo; sighed pretty Madame
  de la Beaume, &ldquo;she wanted to palliate Madame Lydie&rsquo;s conduct
  by suggesting that milor merely desired to forbid her future intercourse
  with M. de Stainville. . . . I have heard that version of the quarrel already,
  but I must own that it bears but little resemblance to truth. We all know
  that so simple a request would not have led to a really serious breach between
  milor and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was more than that, of course, or milor would not have beaten
  her,&rdquo; came in unanswerable logic from M. Cr&eacute;billon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh!&rdquo; admonished the old Duchess, &ldquo;here
  comes His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He looks wonderfully good-humoured,&rdquo; said Madame de la Beaume, &ldquo;and
  doth not wear at all his usual Thursday&rsquo;s scowl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we may all be sure, Mesdames and Messieurs,&rdquo; said the
  irrepressible Cr&eacute;billon, &ldquo;that rumour hath not lied again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What rumour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not heard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; came from half a dozen eager and anxious lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say that His Majesty the King of France has agreed to deliver
  the Chevalier de Saint George to the English in consideration of a large
  sum of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That cannot be true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My valet had it from Monsieur de Stainville&rsquo;s man,&rdquo; protested
  M. Cr&eacute;billon, &ldquo;and he declares the rumour true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A King of France would never do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A palpable and clumsy lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the same people, who, five minutes ago, had hurled the mud of scandal
  at the white robes of an exceptionally high-minded and virtuous woman, recoiled
  with horror at the thought of any of it clinging to the person of that fat
  and pompous man, whom an evil fate had placed on the throne of France.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  The First Doubt</b></h2>
  <p>His Majesty certainly looked far less bored than he usually did on his royal
  consort&rsquo;s reception evenings. He entered the room with a good-natured
  smile on his face, which did not leave him, even whilst he kissed the frigid
  Queen&rsquo;s hand, and nodded to her entourage, every one of whom he cordially
  detested.</p>
  <p>But when he caught sight of Lydie, he positively beamed at her, and astonished
  all the scandal-mongers by the surfeit of attentions which he bestowed on
  her. Directly after he had paid his respects to his wife and received the
  young scions of ancient aristocratic houses, that were being presented to
  him, he turned with great alacrity to Lydie and engaged her in close conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you honour us by stepping the pavane with us, Marquise?&rdquo; he
  asked in sugary tones. &ldquo;Alas! our dancing days should be over, yet
  par ma foi! we could yet tread another measure beside the tiniest feet in
  France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie would perhaps have been taken aback at the King&rsquo;s superlative
  amiability, but instinctively her mind reverted to the many occasions when
  he had thus tried to win her good graces, in the hope of obtaining concessions
  of money from the virtual chief of the Department of Finance. She saw that
  inquisitive eyes were watching her over-keenly as&mdash;unable to refuse
  the King&rsquo;s invitation&mdash;she placed a reluctant hand in his, and
  took her position beside him for the opening of the pavane.</p>
  <p>She was essentially graceful even in the studied stiffness of her movements;
  a stiffness which she had practised and then made entirely her own, and which
  was somehow expressive of the unbendable hauteur of her moral character.</p>
  <p>The stately pavane suited the movements of her willowy figure, which appeared
  quite untrammelled, easy and full of spring, even within the narrow confines
  of the fashionable corslet. She was dressed in white to-night and her young
  shoulders looked dazzling and creamy beside the matt tone of her brocaded
  gown. She never allowed the ridiculous coiffure, which had lately become
  the mode, to hide entirely the glory of her own chestnut hair, and its rich,
  warm colour gleamed through the powder, scantily sprinkled over it by an
  artist&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>She had not forgotten even for a moment the serious events of this never-to-be-forgotten
  day; but amongst the many memories which crowded in upon her, as, with slow
  step she trod the grave measure of the dance, none was more vivid than that
  of her husband&rsquo;s scorn, when he spoke of her own hand resting in that
  of the treacherous and perfidious monarch, who would have sold his friend
  for money. She wondered how he would act if he could see her now, her fingers,
  very frequently meeting those of King Louis during the elaborate figures
  of the dance.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, although everything milor had said to her at that interview
  had merely jarred upon her mood and irritated her nerves, without seemingly
  carrying any conviction, yet now, when she was obliged to touch so often
  the moist, hot palm of King Louis, she felt something of that intolerable
  physical repugnance which her husband had, as it were, brought to actuality
  by the vigour of his suggestions.</p>
  <p>Otherwise she took little heed of her surroundings. During the preliminary
  movement of the dance, the march past, with its quaint, artificial gestures
  and steps and the slow majesty of its music, she could not help seeing the
  looks of malevolent curiosity, of satisfied childish envy, and of sarcastic
  triumph which were levelled at her from every corner of the room.</p>
  <p>The special distinction bestowed on her by the King&mdash;who as a rule
  never danced at his wife&rsquo;s soir&eacute;es&mdash;seemed in the minds
  of all these gossip-lovers to have confirmed the worst rumours, anent the
  cause of Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s unexpected resignation. His Majesty did not
  suffer like his wife from an unconquerable horror of frisky matrons; on the
  contrary, his abhorrence was chiefly directed against the starchy dowagers
  and the prudish <i>d&eacute;votes</i> who formed the entourage of the Queen.
  The fact that he distinguished Lydie to-night so openly, showed that he no
  longer classed her among the latter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty hath at last found a kindred spirit in the unapproachable
  Marchioness,&rdquo; was the universal comment, which thoroughly satisfied
  the most virulent disseminator of ill-natured scandal.</p>
  <p>Lydie knew enough of Court life to guess what would be said. Up to now she
  had been happily free from Louis&rsquo;s compromising flatteries, save at
  such times when he required money, but his attentions went no further&mdash;and
  they invariably ceased the moment he had obtained all that he wanted. But
  to-night he was unswerving in his adulation; and, in the brief pause between
  the second and third movement of the dance, he contrived to whisper in her
  ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Madame! how you shame your King! Shall we ever be able to adequately
  express the full measure of our gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gratitude, Sire?&rdquo; she murmured, somewhat bewildered and rather
  coldly, &ldquo;I do not understand . . . why gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are modest, Madame, as well as brave and good,&rdquo; he rejoined,
  taking one more opportunity of raising her hand to his lips. He had succeeded
  in gradually leading her into a window embrasure, somewhat away from the
  rest of the dancers. He did not admire the statuesque grace of Lydie in the
  least, and had always secretly sneered at her, for her masculine strength
  of will and the rigidity of her principles, but it had been impossible for
  any man, alive to a sense of what was beautiful, not to delight in the exquisitely
  harmonious picture formed by that elegant woman, in her stiff, white brocaded
  gown and with her young head crowned by its wreath of ardent hair, standing
  out brilliantly against the pale, buttercup colour of the damask curtain
  behind her. There was nothing forced therefore in the look of admiration
  with which the King now regarded Lydie; conscious of this, she deeply resented
  the look, and perhaps because of it, she was not quite so fully alive to
  the hidden meaning of his words as she otherwise might have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And as beautiful as you are brave,&rdquo; added Louis unctuously. &ldquo;It
  is not every woman who would thus have had the courage of her convictions,
  and so openly borne witness to the trust and loyalty which she felt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sire,&rdquo; she said coldly and suddenly beginning to feel
  vaguely puzzled, &ldquo;I am afraid your Majesty is labouring under the misapprehension,
  that I have recently done something to deserve special royal thanks, whereas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whereas you have only followed the dictates of your heart,&rdquo; he
  rejoined gallantly, seeing that she had paused as if in search of a word, &ldquo;and
  shown to the sceptics in this ill-natured Court that, beneath the rigid mask
  of iron determination, this exquisitely beautiful personality hid the true
  instincts of adorable womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The musicians now struck the opening chords to the third and final measure
  of the pavane. There is something dreamy and almost sad in this movement
  of the stately dance, and this melancholy is specially accentuated in the
  composition of Rameau, which the players were rendering with consummate art
  to-night. The King&rsquo;s unctuous words were still ringing unpleasantly
  in Lydie&rsquo;s ears, when he put out his hand, claiming hers for the dance.</p>
  <p>Mechanically she followed him, her feet treading the measure quite independently
  of her mind, which had gone wandering in the land of dreams. A vague sense
  of uneasiness crept slowly but surely into her heart, she pondered over Louis&rsquo;s
  words, not knowing what to make of them, yet somehow beginning to fear them,
  or rather to fear that she might after all succeed in understanding their
  full meaning. She could not dismiss the certitude from her mind that he was,
  in some hidden sense, referring to the Stuart prince and his cause, when
  he spoke of &ldquo;convictions&rdquo; and of her &ldquo;courage&rdquo;; but
  at first she only thought that he meant, in a vague way, to recall her interference
  of this morning, Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s outburst of contempt, and her own
  promise to give the matter serious consideration.</p>
  <p>This in a measure re-assured her. The King&rsquo;s words had already become
  hazy in her memory, as she had not paid serious attention to them at the
  time, and she gradually forced those vague fears within her to subside, and
  even smiled at her own cowardice in scenting danger where none existed.</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly that was the true reason of the rapacious monarch&rsquo;s flatteries
  to-night; truth to tell, her mind had been so absorbed with actual events,
  her quarrel with her husband, the departure of Gaston, the proposed expedition
  of <i>Le Monarque</i>, that she had almost forgotten the promise which she
  had made to the King earlier in the day, with a view to gaining time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How admirably you dance, Madame,&rdquo; said King Louis, &ldquo;the
  poetry of motion by all the saints! Ah! believe me, I cannot conquer altogether
  a feeling of unutterable envy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Envy, Sire, of whom?&mdash;or of what?&rdquo; she asked, forced to
  keep up a conversation which sickened her, since etiquette did not allow
  her to remain silent if the King desired to talk. &ldquo;Methinks fate leaves
  your Majesty but little to wish for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Envy of the lucky man who obtained a certitude, whilst we had to
  be content with vague if gracious promises,&rdquo; he rejoined blandly.</p>
  <p>She looked at him keenly, inquiringly, a deep line of doubt, even of fear
  now settling between her brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certitude of what, Sire?&rdquo; she asked suddenly pausing in the
  dance and turning to look him straight in the eyes. &ldquo;I humbly crave
  your Majesty&rsquo;s pardon, but meseems that we are at cross-purposes, and
  that your Majesty speaks of something which I, on the other hand, do not
  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! nay! then we&rsquo;ll not refer to the subject again,&rdquo; rejoined
  Louis with consummate gallantry, &ldquo;for of a truth we would not wish
  to lose one precious moment of this heavenly dance. Enough that you understand,
  Madame, that your King is grateful, and will show his gratitude, even though
  his heart burn with jealousy at the good fortune of another man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no mistaking the sly leer which appeared in his eye as he spoke.
  Lydie felt her cheeks flaming up with sudden wrath; wrath, which as quickly
  gave way to an awful, an unconquerable horror.</p>
  <p>Still she did not suspect. Her feet once more trod the monotonous measure,
  but her heart beat wildly against the stiff corslet; the room began to whirl
  round before her eyes; a sickening sense of dizziness threatened to master
  her. Every drop of blood had left her cheeks, leaving them ashen pale.</p>
  <p>She was afraid; and the fear was all the more terrible as she could not
  yet give it a name. But the sense of an awful catastrophe was upon her, impending,
  not yet materialized, but which would overwhelm her inevitably when it came.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  The Awful Certitude</b></h2>
  <p>Then all at once she understood!</p>
  <p>There at the further end of the room, against the rich gold of the curtain,
  she saw Gaston de Stainville standing beside his wife and one or two other
  women, the centre of a gaily chattering crowd, he himself chattering with
  them, laughing and jesting, whilst from time to time his white and slender
  hand raised a gold-rimmed glass to his eye, with a gesture of fatuity and
  affectation.</p>
  <p>Something in her look, though it had only lasted a few seconds, must then
  and there have compelled his own, for he suddenly dropped his glass, and
  their eyes met across the room; Lydie&rsquo;s inquiring, only just beginning
  to doubt, and fearful, as if begging for reassurance! his, mocking and malicious,
  triumphant too and self-flattering, whilst la belle Ir&egrave;ne, intercepting
  this exchange of glances, laughed loudly and shrugged her bare shoulders.</p>
  <p>Lydie was not that type of woman who faints, or screams at moments of acute
  mental agony. Even now, when the full horror of what she had so suddenly
  realized, assailed her with a crushing blow that would have stunned a weaker
  nature, she contrived to pull herself together and to continue the dance
  to the end. The King&mdash;beginning to feel bored in the company of this
  silent and obviously absent-minded woman&mdash;made no further effort at
  conversation. She had disappointed him; for Monsieur le Comte de Stainville&rsquo;s
  innuendoes had led him to hope that the beautiful marble statue had at last
  come to life and would henceforth become a valuable addition to the light-hearted
  circle of friends that rallied round him, helping to make him forget the
  ennui of his matrimonial and official life.</p>
  <p>Thus the dance was concluded between them in silence. Louis was too dull
  and vapid to notice the change in his partner&rsquo;s attitude, the icy touch
  of her fingers, the deathly whiteness of her lips. But presently he, too,
  caught sight of Gaston de Stainville and immediately there crept into his
  face that malicious leer, which awhile ago had kindled Lydie&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
  <p>Whether she noted it now or not, it were difficult to say. Only a great
  determination kept her from making a display before all these indifferent
  eyes, of the agonizing torture of her mind and heart.</p>
  <p>With infinite relief, she made her final curtsey to her partner, and allowed
  him to lead her back to her official place beside the royal da&iuml;s. She
  could not see clearly, for her eyes had suddenly filled with burning tears
  of shame and bitter self-accusation. She bit her lips lest a cry of pain
  escaped them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are ill, my dear! Come away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice&mdash;gentle and deeply concerned&mdash;was that of her father.
  She did not dare look at him, lest she should break down, but she allowed
  him to lead her away from the immediate noise and glare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Lydie?&rdquo; queried M. le Duc again, more anxiously,
  as soon as they had reached a small and secluded alcove. &ldquo;Has anything
  further happened? Par Dieu, if that man has again dared . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What man, father?&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
  <p>Her voice had no tone in it, she wondered even if M. le Duc would hear,
  but he was talking ambiguously and she had had enough of misunderstandings
  to-day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; rejoined Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont irritably. &ldquo;Your
  husband of course. I have heard rumours about his behaviour to you, and by
  all the heathen gods . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, astonished and almost awed, for Lydie had laughed suddenly, laughed
  loudly and long, and there was such a strange ring in that unnatural mirth,
  that Monsieur le Duc feared lest excitement had been too much for his daughter&rsquo;s
  brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie! what is it? You must tell me . . . Lydie . . .&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;listen
  to me . . . do you hear me, Lydie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed to be collecting her scattered senses now, but great sobs of
  hysterical laughter still shook her from head to foot, and she leaned against
  her father&rsquo;s arm almost as if she feared to fall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father dear,&rdquo; she said fairly coherently, &ldquo;I do
  hear you, and I pray you take no heed of me. Much hath occurred to-day to
  disturb me and my nerves seem to be on the jar. Perhaps I do not see quite
  clearly either. Father, tell me,&rdquo; she added with a voice almost steady,
  but harsh and trenchant, and with glowing eyes fixed on the Duke&rsquo;s
  face, &ldquo;did I perceive Gaston de Stainville in the crowd just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may have done, my dear,&rdquo; he replied with some hesitation. &ldquo;I
  do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had been quick enough to note that, at mention of Gaston&rsquo;s name,
  his eyes suddenly wore a curious shamefaced expression and avoided meeting
  her own. She pressed her point more carelessly, feeling that there was something
  that he would only tell her, if she was perfectly calm and natural in her
  questionings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he is here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes . . . I believe so . . . why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought him gone,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;that was all.
  Methought there was an errand he had meant to perform.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! there is no immediate hurry for that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Amont, never a very keen observer, was feeling quite
  reassured by her calmer mood. His daughter had been overwrought. Events had
  crowded in upon her, thick and fast, some of them of an unpleasant nature:
  her final surrender to Gaston de Stainville could not have occurred without
  a wrench; sentiment&mdash;he supposed&mdash;having conquered friendship and
  loyalty, no doubt remorse had held sway for awhile. He certainly thought
  his daughter quite at one with him and his confederates in the treacherous
  plan; it never entered his head for a moment to blame her for this <i>volte-face</i>,
  nor did he realize that Gaston&rsquo;s attitude had been one of lying infamy.
  He knew her for a pure-minded and exceptionally proud woman and his paternal
  heart had no fear that she would stoop to a vulgar intrigue, at the same
  time he had no reason to doubt that she had yielded to the persuasive powers
  of a man whom she had certainly loved at one time, who and of necessity would
  still exercise a certain influence over her.</p>
  <p>And now she was no doubt anxious to know something of future plans she had
  probably not heard what had been decided with regard to the expedition, and
  perhaps fretted as to how her own actions had been interpreted by her father
  and the King. It was with a view to reassuring her on all these points that
  he now added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are not thinking of sending <i>Le Monarque</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah? I thought that she would have been the most likely vessel. .
  .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Le Levantin</i> will be safer,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but
  she will not be ready to put to sea for five or six days, so Gaston will
  not start until then; but you need have no fear, dear; the orders together
  with the map and the precious letter, which you have given him, are quite
  safe in his hands. He is too deeply concerned in the success of the expedition
  to think of betraying you, even if his regard were less genuine. . . . And
  we are all deeply grateful to you, my dear . . . It was all for the best.
  . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He patted her hand with kindly affection, much relieved now, for she seemed
  quite calm and the colour even was coming back to her cheeks: all the afternoon
  he had been dreading this meeting with his daughter, for he had not seen
  her since he learned from Gaston that she had yielded to his entreaties,
  and given him the map and letter which would help the King of France to betray
  his friend: now he was glad to find that&mdash;save for an unusual hysterical
  outburst&mdash;she took the whole matter as coolly as he did himself.</p>
  <p>There is no doubt that there are moments in life when a crisis is so acute,
  a catastrophe so overwhelming, that all our faculties become completely deadened:
  our individuality goes out of us, and we become mere dolls moving automatically
  by muscular action and quite independently of our brain.</p>
  <p>Thus it was with Lydie.</p>
  <p>Her father&rsquo;s words could not be misunderstood. They left her without
  that last faint shadow of doubt which, almost unbeknown to herself, had been
  her main support during the past few minutes of this intense agony. Now the
  tiny vestige of hope had vanished. Blank despair invaded her brain and she
  had the sensation as if sorrow had turned it into a pulpy mass, a great deal
  too bulky for her head, causing it to throb and to ache intolerably. Beyond
  that, the rest of herself as it were, became quite mechanical. She was glad
  that her father said nothing more about the scheme. She knew all that she
  wanted to know: Gaston&rsquo;s hideous, horrible treachery, the clumsy trap
  into which she had fallen, and above all the hopeless peril into which she
  had plunged the very man whom she had wished to save.</p>
  <p>She had been the most perfidious traitor amongst them all, for the unfortunate
  prince had given her his friendship, and had trusted her more fully than
  he had others.</p>
  <p>And then there was her husband!</p>
  <p>Of him she would not think, for that way lay madness surely!</p>
  <p>She managed to smile to her father, and to reassure him. Presently she would
  tell him all . . . to-morrow perhaps, but not just yet . . . She did not
  hate him somehow. She could not have hated him, for she knew him and had
  always loved him. But he was weak and easily misguided.</p>
  <p>Heavens above! had anyone been more culpably weak, more misguided than she
  herself?</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc, fully satisfied in his mind now by her outward calm, and
  the steady brilliance of her eyes, recalled her to her official duties.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dancing is over, Lydie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you not a few
  presentations to Her Majesty to effect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; she said perfectly naturally, &ldquo;of a truth I
  had almost forgotten . . . the first time for many years, eh? my dear father.
  . . How some people will gossip at this remissness of Madame la Grande Mar&eacute;chale
  de la Cour . . . will you conduct me straight away to Her Majesty? . . .
  I hope she has not yet noticed my absence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She leaned somewhat heavily on her father&rsquo;s arm, for she was afraid
  that she could not otherwise have walked quite straight. She fully realized
  what it meant when men talked of drunkenness amongst themselves. Copious
  libations must produce&mdash;she thought&mdash;just this same sensation of
  swaying and tottering, and hideous, painful giddiness.</p>
  <p>Already Monsieur de Louvois, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chamberlain, was waiting,
  whilst the ladies, who were to receive the honour of special presentation,
  were arraigned in a semi-circle to the left of the dais. Beneath the canopy
  the King and Queen were standing: Louis looking as usual insufferably bored,
  and the Queen calmly dignified, not a little disdainful, and closely scrutinizing
  the bevy of women&mdash;more or less gorgeously apparelled, some old, some
  young, mostly rather dowdy and stiff in their appearance&mdash;who were waiting
  to be introduced.</p>
  <p>Quickly, and with a respectful curtsey indicative of apology, Lydie now
  took her stand beside her Royal mistress and the ceremony of presentations
  began. The chamberlain read out a name; one unit thereupon detached itself
  from the feminine group, approached with sedate steps to the foot of the
  throne, and made a deep obeisance, whilst Madame la Grande Mar&eacute;chale
  said a few appropriate words, that were meant to individualize that unit
  in the mind of the Queen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame de Balincourt. Your Majesty will deign to remember the brave
  General who fought at Fontenoy. Madame has eschewed country life momentarily
  for the honour of being presented to your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enchant&eacute;e, Madame,&rdquo; the Queen would reply graciously,
  offering her hand for a respectful kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame Helvetius, the wife of our renowned scientist and philosopher.
  Your Majesty is acquainted with his works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enchant&eacute;e, Madame!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Mademoiselle Helvetius, striving to become as learned as her
  distinguished father, and almost succeeding so &rsquo;tis said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Queen deigned to say a few special words to this shy <i>d&eacute;butante</i> and
  to her mother, both primly clad in badly-fitting gowns which proclaimed the
  country dressmaker, but in their simplicity and gaucherie peculiarly pleasing
  to Her Majesty.</p>
  <p>And thus the procession filed past. Elderly women and young girls, some
  twenty in all, mostly hailing from distant parts of France, where the noise
  and frivolity of the Court of Versailles had not even roused an echo. The
  Queen was very gracious. She liked this select little circle of somewhat
  dowdy provincials, who she felt would be quite at one with her in her desire
  for the regeneration of social France. The uglier and less fashionable were
  the women, the more drabby and ill-fitting their clothes, the sweeter and
  more encouraging became Her Majesty&rsquo;s smile. She asked lengthy questions
  from her Grande Mar&eacute;chale, and seemed to take a malicious delight
  in irritating the King, by protracting this ceremony, which she knew bored
  him to distraction, until he could scarcely manage to smother the yawns which
  continually assailed his jaws.</p>
  <p>Suddenly Lydie felt her limbs stiffen and her throat close as if iron fingers
  had gripped it. She had been saying the usual platitudes anent the wife,
  sister or aunt of some worthy general or country squire, when Monsieur de
  Louvois called out a name:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Comtesse de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And from out the group of dowdy country matrons and starchy-looking <i>d&eacute;votes</i> a
  brilliant figure now detached itself and glided forward with consummate grace.
  Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville was approaching for presentation to the Queen,
  her eyes becomingly cast down, a rosy flush on her cheeks, for she was conscious
  that she was beautiful and that the King&rsquo;s wearied eyes had lighted
  up at sight of her.</p>
  <p>There was something almost insolent in the gorgeousness of her gown: it
  was of a rich turquoise blue, that stood out, glaring and vivid against the
  buttercup-coloured hangings of the room. Her stiff corslet was frankly <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i>,
  displaying her fine shoulders and creamy bosom, on which reposed a delicately
  wrought turquoise necklet of exquisite design. Her hair was piled up over
  her head, in the monumental and <i>outr&eacute;</i> style lately decreed
  by Dame Fashion, and the brocade of her panniers stood out in stiff folds
  each side of her, like balloon-shaped supports, on which her white arms rested
  with graceful ease. It seemed as if a gaudy, exotic butterfly had lost its
  way, and accidentally fluttered into an assembly of moths.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville stood a little behind his wife. Etiquette demanded
  that he should be near her, when she made her obesiance to the Queen. He,
  too, somehow, looked out of place among these more sedate cavaliers: there
  had always been a very distinct difference between the dress worn by the
  ladies and gentlemen of the Queen&rsquo;s entourage, and the more ornate
  style adopted by the gayer frequenters of the Court of Versailles. This difference
  was specially noticeable now, when this handsome young couple stood before
  Her Majesty, she not unlike a glittering jewel herself, he in a satin coat
  of pale mauve, that recalled the delicate shades of a bank of candytuft in
  mid-June.</p>
  <p>The Queen no longer looked down from her da&iuml;s with an indulgent, somewhat
  melancholy smile. Her eyes&mdash;cold and gray as those of King Stanislaus
  had been&mdash;regarded with distinct disapproval these two people, who,
  in her rigid judgment, were naught but gaudily decked-out dolls, and who
  walked on high-heeled shoes that made an unpleasant noise on the polished
  floor.</p>
  <p>Lydie had during the last agonizing half-hour wholly forgotten Ir&egrave;ne
  de Stainville and the presentation which, on an impulse of gratitude toward
  Gaston, she had promised to bring about, and she certainly had not been prepared
  for this meeting, face to face, with the man who, for the second time in
  her life, had so bitterly and cruelly wronged her.</p>
  <p>Gaston did not seem anxious to avoid her gaze. There was insolent triumph
  and mockery in every line of his attitude: in the head thrown a little to
  one side; in the eyes narrowed until they were slits, gazing at her over
  the barrier of his wife&rsquo;s elaborate coiffure: in the slender, well-kept
  hand toying with the gold-rimmed eyeglass, and above all in the sensual,
  sneering mouth, and the full lips parted in a smile.</p>
  <p>Lydie was hardly conscious of Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s presence, of any one
  in fact, save of Gaston de Stainville, of whom she had dreamed so romantically
  a few hours ago, speeding him on his way, praying&mdash;God help her!&mdash;that
  he might be well and safe. An intense bitterness surged up in her heart,
  a deadly contempt for him. Awhile ago she would not have believed that she
  could hate anyone so. She would at this moment have gladly bartered her life
  for the joy of doing him some awful injury. All softness, gentleness, went
  out of her nature, just while she looked at Gaston and caught his mocking
  smile.</p>
  <p>It was the mockery that hurt her so! The awful humiliation of it all!</p>
  <p>And there was also in Lydie that highly sensitive sense of loyalty, which
  revolted at the sight of these traitors approaching, with a smile of complacency
  on their lips, this proud Queen who was ignorant of their infamy.</p>
  <p>Women have often been called petty in their hates: rightly perhaps! but
  let us remember that their power to punish is limited, and therefore they
  strike as best they can. Lydie, in spite of her influence and her high position,
  could do so little to punish Gaston, now that by his abominable treachery
  he had filched every trump card from her.</p>
  <p>She had been such an unpardonable fool&mdash;and she knew it&mdash;that
  her very self-abasement whipped up her sense of retaliation, her desire for
  some sort of revenge, into veritable fury; and thus, when la belle Ir&egrave;ne,
  triumphant in the pride of her universally acknowledged beauty, came to the
  foot of the Royal da&iuml;s, when&mdash;through some unexplainable and occult
  reason&mdash;a hush of expectancy descended on all spectators, Lydie&rsquo;s
  voice was suddenly raised, trenchant and decisive:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is an error on Monsieur le Chambellan&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; she
  said loudly, so that everyone in the vast audience-chamber might hear. &ldquo;There
  is no one here to present this lady to Her Majesty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A gasp went round the room, a sigh of astonishment, of horror, of anticipation,
  and in the silence that immediately followed, the proverbial pin would have
  been heard to drop: every rustle of a silken gown, every creak of a shoe
  sounded clear and distinct, as did the quickly-suppressed sneer that escaped
  Gaston de Stainville&rsquo;s lips and the frou-frou of his satin coat sleeve
  as he raised the gold-rimmed glass to his eye.</p>
  <p>What were the joys of gossip in comparison with this unexpected sensation,
  which moreover would certainly be the prelude to an amazing scandal? Anon
  everyone drew instinctively nearer. All eyes were fixed on the several actors
  of this palpitating little scene.</p>
  <p>Already Ir&egrave;ne had straightened her graceful figure, with a quick
  jerk as if she had been struck. The terrible affront must have taken her
  completely unawares, but now that it had come, she instantly guessed its
  cause. Nevertheless there was nothing daunted or bashful about her attitude.
  The colour blazed into her cheeks, and her fine dark eyes responded to Lydie&rsquo;s
  scornful glance with one of defiance and of hate.</p>
  <p>The Queen looked visibly annoyed. She disliked scenes and unpleasantness,
  and all incidents which disturbed the even placidity of her official life:
  the King, on the other hand, swore an unmistakable oath. Obviously he had
  already taken sides in favour of the gaily-plumaged butterfly against the
  duller moths, whilst Monsieur de Louvois looked hopelessly perturbed. He
  was very young and had only lately been appointed to the onerous position
  of Queen&rsquo;s Chamberlain. Though the post was no sinecure, a scandal
  such as threatened now, was quite unprecedented. He scented a violent passage
  of arms between two young and beautiful women, both of high social position,
  and manlike he would sooner have faced a charge of artillery than this duel
  between two pairs of rosy lips, wherein he feared that he might be called
  upon to arbitrate.</p>
  <p>Lydie, alone among all those present, had retained her outward serenity.
  This was her hour, and she meant to press her triumph home to the full. All
  the pent-up horror and loathing which had well-nigh choked her during the
  whole of this terrible day, now rose clamouring and persistent in this opportunity
  for revenge. Though Gaston stood calm and mocking by, though Ir&egrave;ne
  looked defiant and her cheeks flamed with wrath, they would glow with shame
  anon, for Lydie had deliberately aimed a blow at her vanity, the great and
  vulnerable spot in the armour of <i>la belle brune de Bordeaux</i>.</p>
  <p>Lydie knew Marie Leszcynska well enough to be sure that the very breath
  of scandal, which she had deliberately blown on Gaston&rsquo;s wife, was
  enough to cause the rigid, puritanically-minded Queen to refuse all future
  intercourse with her. Rightly or wrongly, without further judgment or appeal,
  the Queen would condemn Ir&egrave;ne unheard, and ban her and her husband
  for ever from her intimacy, thus setting the mark of a certain social ostracism
  upon them, which they could never live down.</p>
  <p>Less than three seconds had elapsed whilst these conflicting emotions assailed
  the various actors of this drawing-room drama. The Queen now turned with
  a frown half-inquiring, wholly disapproving toward the unfortunate Louvois.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Chambellan,&rdquo; she said sternly, &ldquo;how did this
  occur? We do not allow any error to creep in the list of presentations made
  to our Royal person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These few words recalled Ir&egrave;ne to the imminence of her peril. She
  would not allow herself to be humiliated without a protest, nor would she
  so readily fall a victim to Lydie&rsquo;s obvious desire for revenge. She
  too was shrewd enough to know that the Queen would never forgive, and certainly
  never forget, the <i>esclandre</i> of this presentation; but if she herself
  was destined to fall socially, at least she would drag her enemy down with
  her, and bury Lydie&rsquo;s influence, power and popularity beneath the ruins
  of her own ambitions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty will deign I hope to pause a moment ere you sweep me
  from before your Royal eyes unheard,&rdquo; she said boldly; &ldquo;the error
  is on the part of Madame la Grande Mar&eacute;chale. My name was put on Monsieur
  le Chambellan&rsquo;s list by her orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Marie Leszcynska would not at this juncture take any direct notice of
  Ir&egrave;ne; until it was made quite clear that Madame la Comtesse de Stainville
  was a fit and proper person to be presented to the Queen of France, she absolutely
  ignored her very existence, lest a word from her be interpreted as implying
  encouragement, or at least recognition. Therefore she looked beyond Ir&egrave;ne,
  straight at Monsieur de Louvois, and addressed herself directly to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are the true facts, Monsieur le Chambellan?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I certainly . . . er . . . had the list as usual . . . er . . . from
  Madame la Grande Mar&eacute;chale . . . and . . .&rdquo; poor Monsieur de
  Louvois stammered in a fit of acute nervousness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;tis from you, Madame la Marquise, that we require an
  explanation for this unseemly disturbance,&rdquo; rejoined Her Majesty turning
  her cold, gray eyes on Lydie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The explanation is quite simple, your Majesty,&rdquo; replied Lydie
  calmly. &ldquo;It had been my intention to present Madame la Comtesse de
  Stainville to your Majesty, but since then events have occurred, which will
  compel me to ask Madame la Comtesse to find some other lady to perform the
  office for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The explanation is not quite satisfactory to us,&rdquo; rejoined
  Her Majesty with all the rigid hauteur of which she possessed the stinging
  secret, &ldquo;and it will have to be properly and officially amplified to-morrow.
  But this is neither the place nor the moment for discussing such matters.
  Monsieur de Louvois, I pray you to proceed with the other names on your list.
  The Queen has spoken!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With these arrogant words culled from the book of etiquette peculiar to
  her own autocratic house, the daughter of the deposed King of Poland waved
  the incident aside as if it had never been. A quickly repressed murmur went
  all round the room. Lydie swept a deep and respectful curtsey before Her
  Majesty, and indicated by her own manner that, as far as she was concerned,
  the incident was now closed by royal command.</p>
  <p>But Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville&rsquo;s nature was not one that would allow
  the matter to be passed over so lightly. Whichever way the Queen might choose
  to act, she felt that at any rate the men must be on her side: and though
  King Louis himself was too indolent and egotistical to interfere actively
  on her behalf, and her own husband could not do more than pick a quarrel
  with some wholly innocent person, yet she was quite sure that she detected
  approval and encouragement to fight her own battles in the looks of undisguised
  admiration which the masculine element there present freely bestowed upon
  her. Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, for one, looked stern disapproval at
  his daughter, whilst Monsieur de Louvois was visibly embarrassed.</p>
  <p>It was, therefore, only a case of two female enemies, one of whom certainly
  was the Queen of France&mdash;a prejudiced and obstinate autocrat if ever
  there was one, within the narrow confines of her own intimate circle&mdash;and
  the other exceptionally highly placed, both in Court favour and in official
  status.</p>
  <p>Still Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville felt that her own beauty was at least as
  powerful an asset, when fighting for social prestige, as the political influence
  of her chief adversary.</p>
  <p>Therefore when the Queen of France chose to speak as if Madame la Comtesse
  de Stainville did not even exist, and Monsieur de Louvois diffidently but
  firmly begged her to stand aside, she boldly refused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! the Queen shall hear me,&rdquo; she said in a voice which trembled
  a little now with suppressed passion; &ldquo;surely Her Majesty will not
  allow a jealous woman&rsquo;s caprice . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, wench,&rdquo; interrupted Marie Leszcynska with all the
  authority, the pride, the dictatorial will, which she had inherited from
  her Polish ancestors; &ldquo;you forget that you are in the presence of
  your Queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Madame, I do not forget it,&rdquo; said Ir&egrave;ne, nothing
  daunted, and firmly holding her ground. &ldquo;I remember it with every word
  I utter, and remember that the name of our Queen stands for purity and for
  justice. Your Majesty,&rdquo; she added, being quick to note the slightly
  yielding look which, at her cleverly chosen words, crept in Marie Leszcynska&rsquo;s
  eyes, and gracefully dropping on her knees on the steps of the throne, &ldquo;will
  you at least deign to hear me? I may not be worthy to kiss your Majesty&rsquo;s
  hand; we none of us are that, I presume, for you stand infinitely above us
  by right of your virtues and your dignity, but I swear to the Queen of France
  that I have done nothing to deserve this public affront.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused a moment, to assure herself that she held the attention of the
  Queen and of every one there present, then she fixed her dark eyes straight
  on Lydie and said loudly, so that her clear, somewhat shrill young voice
  rang out triumphantly through the room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband was made a tool of by Madame la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton,
  for the purpose of selling the Stuart prince to England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more there was dead silence in the vast reception hall, a few seconds
  during which the loudly accusing voice died away in an almost imperceptible
  echo, but in one heart at least those seconds might have been a hundred hours,
  for the wealth of misery they contained.</p>
  <p>Lydie stood as if turned to stone. Though she had realized Gaston&rsquo;s
  treachery she had not thought that it would mean all this. The utter infamy
  of it left her paralyzed and helpless. She had delivered her soul, her mind,
  her honour, her integrity to the vilest traitor that ever darkened the face
  of the earth. If a year ago she had humiliated him, if to-day she had tried
  to thwart all his future ambitions, he was fully revenged now.</p>
  <p>She did not hear even the loyal Queen&rsquo;s protest:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; for Marie Leszcynska, sickened and horrified,
  was loth to believe the truth of this terrible indictment against the one
  woman she had always singled out for royal trust and royal friendship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true, your Majesty,&rdquo; said Ir&egrave;ne firmly, as she
  once more rose to her feet. &ldquo;Deign to ask Madame la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton
  if to-day in the loneliness of the Park of Versailles, she did not place
  in the hands of Monsieur le Comte de Stainville the secret of the Stuart
  prince&rsquo;s hiding place so that he might be delivered over to the English
  for a large sum of money. Madame is beautiful and rich and influential, Monsieur
  de Stainville being a man, dared not refuse to obey her orders, but Monsieur
  de Stainville is also handsome and young, Madame honoured him with her regard,
  and I the wife was to be publicly ostracised and swept aside, for I was in
  the way, and might have an indiscreet tongue in my mouth. That, your Majesty,
  is the truth,&rdquo; concluded Ir&egrave;ne now with triumphant calm; &ldquo;deign
  to look into her face and mine and see which is the paler, she or I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Marie Leszcynska had listened in silence at the awful accusation thus hurled
  by one woman against the other. At Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s final words she turned
  and looked at Lydie, saw the marble-like hue of the face, the rigidity of
  the young form, the hopeless despair expressed in the half-closed eyes. It
  is but fair to say that the Queen even now did not altogether believe Madame
  de Stainville&rsquo;s story: she instinctively was still drawing a comparison
  between the gaudily apparelled doll with the shrill voice, and the impudently
  bared shoulders, and the proud, graceful woman in robes of virginal white,
  of whom, during all these years of public life, unkind tongues were only
  able to say that she was cold, rigid, dull, uninteresting perhaps, but whose
  vestal robes the breath of evil scandal had never dared to pollute.</p>
  <p>The Queen did not feel that guilt was written now on that straight, pure
  brow, but she had a perfectly morbid horror of any <i>esclandre</i> occurring
  in her presence or at one of her Courts. Moreover, Ir&egrave;ne had certainly
  struck one chord, which jarred horribly on the puritanical Queen&rsquo;s
  nerves, and unfortunately at the very moment when Madame de Stainville made
  this final poisoned suggestion, Marie Lesczynska&rsquo;s eyes happened to
  be resting on the King&rsquo;s face. In Louis&rsquo; expression she caught
  the leer, the smile, half-mocking, half indulgent which was habitual to him
  when woman&rsquo;s frailty was discussed, and her whole pride rose in revolt
  at contact with these perpetual scandals, which disgraced the Court of Versailles,
  and which she was striving so hard to banish from her own entourage.</p>
  <p>Because of this she felt angered now with every one quite indiscriminately.
  A few years ago her sense of justice would have caused her to sift this matter
  through, to test for herself the rights or wrongs of an obviously bitter
  quarrel; but lately this sense of justice had become blunted, through many
  affronts to her personal dignity as a Queen and as a wife. It had left her
  with a morbid egotistical regard for the majesty of her Court: this she felt
  had been attainted; and now she only longed to get away, and leave behind
  her all this vulgarity, these passions, these petty quarrels, which she so
  cordially abhorred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; she said sternly; &ldquo;our royal cheeks glow with
  shame at thought that this indecent brawl should have occurred in our presence.
  Your Majesty,&rdquo; she added turning haughtily to the King, &ldquo;your
  arm, I pray; we cannot endure this noisy bickering, which is more fitting
  for the slums of Paris than for the throne-room of the Queen of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis&rsquo; bewilderment was almost comical. It would have been utterly
  impossible for him, and quite unseemly in his wife&rsquo;s presence, to interfere
  in what was obviously a feminine quarrel, even if he had desired to do so;
  and he had not altogether made up his mind how Madame la Comtesse de Stainville&rsquo;s
  indiscreet outburst would affect him personally, which was all that really
  interested him in the matter. On the whole he was inclined to think favourably
  of the new aspect of affairs. When the fact of the Stuart prince&rsquo;s
  betrayal into his enemies&rsquo; hands became known&mdash;which it was bound
  to do sooner or later&mdash;it was not unpleasant that the first hint of
  the treachery should have come in such a form as to implicate Lydie, and
  that so deeply, that ever afterward the public, clinging to the old proverb
  that there is no smoke without fire, would look upon her as the prime mover
  in the nefarious scheme.</p>
  <p>Louis the Well-beloved possessed, par excellence, the subtle knack of taking
  care of his august person, and above all of his august reputation. It would
  certainly be as well, for the sake of the future, that his over-indulgent
  subjects should foster the belief that, in this vile treachery, their King
  had been misled; more sinned against than sinning.</p>
  <p>But of course he too was anxious to get away. That the present feminine
  altercation would lead to a more serious quarrel, he already guessed from
  the fact that his shrewd eyes had perceived Lord Eglinton standing close
  to one of the great doors at the further end of the room. Vaguely Louis wondered
  how much the husband had heard, and what he would do if he had heard everything.
  Then he mentally shrugged his shoulders, thinking that after all it did not
  matter what milor&rsquo;s future actions might be. Louis was quite convinced
  that Madame Lydie had thrown her bonnet over the mills, and that, as a gallant
  gentleman, milor would above all things have to hold his peace.</p>
  <p>His Majesty therefore was not angered against any one. He smiled quite affably
  at the Comte and Comtesse de Stainville and bestowed a knowing wink on Lydie,
  who fortunately was too dazed to notice this final insult.</p>
  <p>Every one else was silent and awed. The Queen now descended the steps of
  the da&iuml;s on the arm of the King. Ir&egrave;ne was a little disappointed
  that nothing more was going to happen. She opened her lips, ready to speak
  again but Marie Leszcynska threw her such a haughty, scornful glance that
  Gaston de Stainville, realizing the futility&mdash;nay! the danger&mdash;-of
  prolonging this scene, placed a peremptory hand on his wife&rsquo;s arm,
  forcibly drawing her away.</p>
  <p>At the foot of the steps Her Majesty once more turned to Lydie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall expect an explanation from you, Marquise,&rdquo; she said
  haughtily, &ldquo;but not to-night. See that our audience chamber is cleared
  from all this rabble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with this parting shot, hurled recklessly at her faithful adherents,
  just as much as at those who had offended her, the descendant of a proud
  line of Kings sailed majestically out of the room, whilst a loud &ldquo;hush-sh-sh-sh
  . . .&rdquo; caused by the swish of brocaded skirts on the parquet floor
  as every one made a deep obeisance, accompanied the Royal lady in her short
  progress toward the door and then softly died away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  A Fall</b></h2>
  <p>Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville was quite right when she thought that sympathy
  would be on her side, in the grave affront which had been put upon her, and
  for which she had revenged herself somewhat drastically, but under the circumstances
  quite naturally.</p>
  <p>Although in this circle&mdash;known as the Queen&rsquo;s set&mdash;the young
  Marchioness of Eglinton had always been looked up to as a leader and an especial
  favourite, the accusation which Ir&egrave;ne had brought against her was
  so awful, her own attitude of passive acquiescence so incomprehensible, that
  it was small wonder that after the departure of Their Majesties, when the
  crowd broke up into isolated groups, most people there present held themselves
  aloof from her.</p>
  <p>The words &ldquo;a jealous woman&rsquo;s caprice,&rdquo; which at the outset
  had so angered the Queen, expressed fully the interpretation put upon Lydie&rsquo;s
  conduct by those who witnessed the scene from beginning to end. That Ir&egrave;ne
  de Stainville had inflicted on her the humiliation of a terrible public indictment,
  was reckoned only as retributive human justice.</p>
  <p>Lydie knew well enough that the crowd which surrounded her&mdash;though
  here usually composed of friends&mdash;was only too ready to believe evil,
  however crying, against a woman placed so highly in Royal and social favour
  as she herself had been for years. Already she could hear the murmur of condemnation
  round her, and that from people who should have known that she was quite
  incapable of committing the base treachery attributed to her.</p>
  <p>Of course she had not denied it. She could not have denied it, in the face
  of the wording of the accusation itself.</p>
  <p>And she felt herself hideously and morally guilty, guilty in the facts though
  not in the spirit. As Ir&egrave;ne had put it crudely and simply, she had
  handed over to Gaston de Stainville in the privacy of the Park of Versailles
  the secret which would deliver the Stuart prince into the hands of his enemies.</p>
  <p>How could she begin to explain to all these people that her motive had been
  good and pure, her orders to Gaston altogether different from those imputed
  to her by Ir&egrave;ne? No one would have believed her explanation unless
  Gaston too spoke the truth. And Gaston meant to be an infamous liar to the
  end.</p>
  <p>She had been the tool of that clique, it was they now who were ready to
  cast her aside, to break her power and ultimately to throw her on the heap
  of social refuse, where other traitors, liars and cheats mouldered away in
  obscurity.</p>
  <p>Already she knew what the end would be, already she tasted the bitter fruit
  of waning popularity.</p>
  <p>Quite a crowd of obvious sympathizers gathered round the Comte and Comtesse
  de Stainville. Gaston&rsquo;s avowedly base conduct was&mdash;it seems&mdash;to
  be condoned. At best he stood branded by his own wife&mdash;unwittingly perhaps&mdash;as
  having betrayed a woman who for right or wrong, had trusted him, but it is
  strange to record that, in this era of petticoat rule, the men were always
  more easily forgiven their faults than the women.</p>
  <p>Lydie found herself almost alone, only Monsieur de Louvois came and spoke
  to her on an official matter, and presently Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont
  joined them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me take you back to your apartments, Lydie?&rdquo; urged
  Monsieur le Duc. &ldquo;I fear the excitement has seriously upset you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think I have been to blame, father dear?&rdquo; she asked quite
  gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! . . .&rdquo; he murmured vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not speak up for me when that woman accused me . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said evasively, &ldquo;you had not taken
  me into your confidence. I thought . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You still think,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;that what Madame de
  Stainville said was true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
  <p>He did not understand this mood of hers at all. Was she trying to deny?
  Impossible surely! She was a clever woman, and with the map and her own letter,
  sealed and signed with her name, what was the good of denying?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your own letter and the map, my child,&rdquo; he added with gentle
  reproach, thinking that she feared to trust him completely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah yes! my own letter!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;the map . . .
  I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No! she did not mean to deny! She could not deny! . . . Her own father believed
  her guilty . . . and all she could have done would have been to urge the
  purity of her motive. Gaston had of course destroyed her orders to the command
  of <i>Le Monarque</i> and there was only the map . . . and that awful, awful
  letter.</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc thought that his daughter had been very unwise. Having trusted
  Gaston, and placed herself as it were in his hands, she was foolish to anger
  him. No man&mdash;if he have the faintest pretension to being called an honourable
  gentleman&mdash;however smitten he might be with another woman&rsquo;s charms,
  will allow his wife to be publicly insulted by her rival. No doubt Lydie
  had been jealous of Ir&egrave;ne, whose somewhat indiscreet advances to milor
  Eglinton had aroused universal comment. But Lydie did not even pretend to
  care for her own husband and she had yielded her most treasured secret to
  Gaston de Stainville. There she should have remained content and not have
  provoked Ir&egrave;ne&rsquo;s wrath, and even perhaps a revulsion of feeling
  in Gaston himself.</p>
  <p>Unlike King Louis, Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont did not approve of his
  daughter&rsquo;s name being associated with the treacherous scheme from which
  he was ready enough to profit financially himself, although in the innermost
  depths of his heart he disapproved of it. He knew his Royal master well enough
  to be fully aware of the fact that, when the whole nefarious transaction
  came to light, Louis would find means of posing before the public as the
  unwilling tool of a gang of money-grabbers. When that happened, every scornful
  finger would of necessity&mdash;remembering the events of this night&mdash;point
  at Lydie, and incidentally at her father, as the prime movers of the scheme.</p>
  <p>It had been far better to have conciliated Ir&egrave;ne and not to have
  angered Gaston.</p>
  <p>But women were strange creatures, and jealousy their most autocratic master.
  Even his daughter whom he had thought so exceptional, so clever and so clear-headed,
  was not free from the weaknesses of her sex.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Methinks, my dear,&rdquo; he said kindly, &ldquo;you have not acted
  as wisely as I should have expected. Madame de Stainville, on my honour,
  hath not wronged you so as to deserve a public affront, and Gaston himself
  only desired to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc must have raised his voice more than he intended, or else
  perhaps there had occurred quite suddenly in the crowd of sympathizers, that
  now stood in a dense group round Madame de Stainville, one of those inevitable
  moments of complete silence when angels are said to be fluttering round the
  room. Certain it is that Monsieur le Duc&rsquo;s words sang out somewhat
  loudly, and were heard by those whose names had been on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I entreat you, Monsieur le Duc,&rdquo; came in light, bantering
  accents from Gaston de Stainville, &ldquo;do not chide your fair daughter.
  Believe me, we who have suffered most are not inclined to be severe. As to
  me the psychology of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s mood has been profoundly
  interesting, since it hath revealed her to the astonished gaze of her many
  admirers, as endowed with some of the weaknesses of her adorable sex. Why
  should we complain of these charming weaknesses? For though we might be very
  hard hit thereby, they are but expressions of flattery soothing to our pride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The groups had parted somewhat as he spoke, leaving him face to face with
  Lydie, towards whom he advanced with an affected gait and mincing steps,
  looking at her with mocking eyes, whilst toying gracefully with the broad
  black ribbon that held his eyeglass.</p>
  <p>But Gaston&rsquo;s were not the only sarcastic glances that were levelled
  at Lydie. His fatuous innuendoes were unmistakable, and bore out the broader
  and more shameful accusation hurled by Ir&egrave;ne. Lydie&rsquo;s own attitude,
  her every action to-night, the expression of her face at this moment seemed
  to prove them true. She retreated a little as he advanced, and, doing so,
  she raised her head with that proud toss which was habitual to her.</p>
  <p>Thus her eyes travelled swiftly across the room, and she saw her husband
  standing some distance away. She, too, like King Louis, wondered how much
  he had heard, how much he knew: and knowing all, what he meant to do. Instinctively
  when she caught sight of him, and then once more saw Gaston de Stainville
  drawing nearer to her, she remembered that warning which milor had given
  her that morning, and which she had thought so futile, anent the loathsome
  reptile that, once touched, would pollute for ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Gaston now, as he boldly approached her, &ldquo;my
  friends here would tell me no doubt that, by every code of social honour,
  my duty is to punish you or someone who would represent you in this matter,
  for the affront done to my wife. But how can I do that since the offender
  is fair as well as frail? My desire is not to punish, but rather to thank
  you on my knees for the delicate compliment implied by your actions to-night.
  I knew that you honoured me by trusting in me,&rdquo; he added with obvious
  significance, &ldquo;but I had not hoped to provoke such flattering jealousy
  in the heart of the most statuesque woman in France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A titter went round the room. Gaston&rsquo;s attitude seemed suddenly to
  have eased the tension, as of an impending tragedy, which had hung over the
  brilliant assembly for the last half hour. Monsieur le Comte was such a dreadful <i>mauvais
  sujet</i> but so delightful in his ways, so delicately refined in his wickedness!
  He was quite right to take the matter lightly, and a murmur of approval followed
  the titter, at the tact with which he had lifted the load of apprehension
  from the minds of the company.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton was something of a fool to take the
  matter so thoroughly <i>au tragique</i>. No doubt the affairs of the Stuart
  prince would right themselves presently, and she certainly should have had
  more regard for her willing and obviously devoted accomplice.</p>
  <p>He looked so superlatively elegant and handsome now, the younger women sighed
  whilst they admired him. He pointed his toe and held out his tricorne in
  the manner prescribed by fashion for the making of a bow, and it was most
  unfortunate that he was so suddenly stopped in the very midst of his graceful
  flourish by a quiet and suave voice which came immediately from behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not do that, were I in your red-heeled shoes, my good Stainville.
  A slip on this highly-polished floor is certain to be the result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even before the gentle echo of these blandly spoken words had penetrated
  to the further ends of the room, Monsieur le Comte de Stainville had measured
  his full length face downward on the ground.</p>
  <p>His fall was so instantaneous that he had not the time to save himself with
  his hands, and he was literally sprawling now at Lydie&rsquo;s feet with
  arms and legs stretched out, his face having come in violent contact with
  the polished floor. Quite close to him Lord Eglinton was standing, laughing
  softly and discreetly and looking down on the prostrate and distinctly inelegant
  figure of the handsome cavalier.</p>
  <p>A ripple of merry laughter followed this unexpected turn of events. One
  or two spectators, who had stood quite close at the very moment that the
  catastrophe occurred, declared subsequently that milor had with a quick action
  of his foot thrown Monsieur de Stainville off his balance; the intense slipperiness
  of the parquet having merely done the rest.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, the laughter of necessity was prudently suppressed, for
  already Gaston had picked himself up and there was that in his face which
  warned all those present that the farce&mdash;such as it was&mdash;would
  prove the prelude to real and serious tragedy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Lord Eglinton blandly, &ldquo;did I not warn
  you, Monsieur le Comte? Graceful flourishes are apt to be treacherous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor. . .&rdquo; said Gaston, who was livid with rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh,&rdquo; interrupted milor in the same even
  and gentle voice, &ldquo;not in the presence of ladies. . . . An you desire,
  Monsieur le Comte, I&rsquo;ll be at your service later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned toward his wife, bowing low, but not in the least as Gaston
  de Stainville would have bowed, for he had inherited from his father all
  the stiffness of manner peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>
  <p>Thus at this moment he looked distinctly gauche, though not without dignity,
  as, his back slightly bent, his left arm outstretched, he waited until Lydie
  chose to place her hand on his sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your seconds, milor,&rdquo; shouted Gaston, who seemed quite unable
  to control himself, and who had to be distinctly and even determinedly held
  back by two of his friends from springing then and there at Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s
  throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will wait on yours to-night, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; replied <i>le
   petit Anglais</i> affably. &ldquo;Madame la Marquise, will you honour me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Lydie took his arm and allowed him to lead her out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  Husband And Wife</b></h2>
  <p>Monsieur Achille was waiting in the vestibule of the Queen&rsquo;s apartments.
  As soon as Lord and Lady Eglinton appeared his majestic figure detached itself
  from the various groups of flunkeys, who stood about desultorily pending
  the breaking up of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Court; he had a cloak over his arm,
  and, at a sign from his master he approached and handed him the cloak which
  milor then placed round his wife&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you desire to sleep in Versailles to-night, Madame?&rdquo; he
  asked, &ldquo;my coach is below in case you wished to drive to Ch&acirc;teau
  d&rsquo;Aumont.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, milor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would wish to remain
  in Versailles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she added with a pathetic sigh of bitterness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father would prefer it, I think. He is not prepared for my visit.
  And I do not interfere with your lordship&rsquo;s arrangements. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least, Madame,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly. &ldquo;The
  corridors are interminable; would you like a chair?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. . . . Let us walk,&rdquo; she said curtly.</p>
  <p>Without further comment he once more offered her his arm. She took it and
  together they descended the monumental staircase and then turned along the
  endless, vast corridors which lead to the West Wing. Monsieur Achille followed
  at a respectful distance, and behind him walked two flunkeys, also in the
  gorgeous scarlet and gold Eglinton livery, whilst two more bearing torches
  preceded Monsieur le Marquis and Madame, lighting them on their way.</p>
  <p>On the way to the West Wing, milor talked lightly of many things: of Monsieur
  de Voltaire&rsquo;s latest comedy, and the quaint new fashion in headgear,
  of His Majesty the King of Prussia and of the pictures of Monsieur Claude
  Gel&eacute;e. He joked about the Duchesse de Pontchartrain&rsquo;s attempts
  at juvenility and Monsieur Cr&eacute;billon&rsquo;s pretensions to a place
  among the Immortals. Lydie answered in monosyllables; she could not bring
  herself to speak, although she quite appreciated milor&rsquo;s desire to
  appear natural and unconcerned before his own lacqueys.</p>
  <p>A great resolution was taking root in her mind, and she only wanted the
  privacy and the familiarity of her own apartments to put it into execution.
  Thus they reached the West Wing.</p>
  <p>Arrived in the antechamber whence her rooms branched off to the right and
  milor&rsquo;s to the left, Lord Eglinton stopped, disengaged her arm from
  his and was about to bid her an elaborate good-night, when she said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I speak with you privately and in your own study, milor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, Madame,&rdquo; he replied seemingly a little astonished
  at her request.</p>
  <p>He dismissed all the flunkeys with the exception of Monsieur Achille, who
  led the way through the reception rooms toward milor&rsquo;s private suite.
  Lord and Lady Eglinton followed in silence now. The rooms seemed strangely
  silent and deserted, ghostlike too, for there was no artificial light, and
  the moon peered in through the tall windows, throwing patches of pale mauve
  and weird, translucent greens on the parquet floor and the brocade coverings
  of the chairs.</p>
  <p>In milor&rsquo;s study, Monsieur Achille lighted the candles in two massive
  candelabra, which stood on the secr&eacute;taire, then, at a nod from his
  master, he walked backward out of the room.</p>
  <p>The heavy porti&egrave;re fell back with a curious sound like a moan, and
  for the third time to-day husband and wife stood face to face alone. The
  gaucherie of his manner became at once apparent now: yet he seemed in no
  way bashful or ill as ease, only very stiff and awkward in his movements,
  as he drew a chair for her at a convenient angle, and when she had sat down,
  placed a cushion to her back and a footstool at her feet. He himself remained
  standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you sit, milor,&rdquo; she said with a quick sigh, that trembled
  as it escaped her lips, &ldquo;and if I have not angered you beyond the bounds
  of your patience, I earnestly ask you to bear with me, for if I have been
  at fault I have also suffered much and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said quite gently if somewhat coldly, &ldquo;might
  I entreat of you not to insist on this interview if it distresses you very
  much; as to a fault . . . on my honour, Madame, the very thought of self-accusation
  on your part seems to me wildly preposterous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not sit as she had asked him to do, but stood looking down at her
  and thinking&mdash;thinking alas!&mdash;that she never had been quite so
  beautiful. She was almost as white as her gown, the powder still clung to
  her hair, which, in the dim light of the candles, chose to hide the glory
  of its ardent colour beneath the filmy artificial veil. She wore some exquisite
  pearls, his gift on the day of her marriage: row upon row of these exquisite
  gems fell on her throat and bosom, both as white, as glittering and pure
  as the priceless treasures from the deep.</p>
  <p>The chair in which she sat was covered with damask of a rich dull gold,
  and against this background with its bright lights and impenetrably dark
  shadows, the white figure stood out like what he had always pictured her,
  a cold and unapproachable statue.</p>
  <p>But to-night, though so still and white, the delicate marble had taken unto
  itself life: the life which means sorrow. All the haughtiness of the look
  had vanished; there were deep shadows under the eyes and lines of suffering
  round the perfectly chiselled lips.</p>
  <p>Henry Dewhyrst, Marquis of Eglinton, was not yet thirty: he loved this exquisitely
  beautiful woman with all his heart and soul, and she had never been anything
  more to him than a perfectly carved image would be on the high altar of a
  cathedral. She had been neither helpmate nor wife, only an ideal, an intangible
  shadow which his love had not succeeded in materializing.</p>
  <p>As he looked at her now, he wondered for the first time in the course of
  their married life, if it had been his own fault that they had remained such
  complete strangers: this was because for the first time to-day a great sorrow,
  a still greater shame had breathed life into the marble-like statue.</p>
  <p>All at once he felt deeply, unutterably sorry for her; he had no thought
  of her wrongs toward him, only of those done to herself by her pride and
  the faults of the epoch in which she lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; she said trying to steady her voice, &ldquo;it would
  ease me a little&mdash;and ease the painfulness of this interview&mdash;if
  you were to tell me at what precise moment you entered Her Majesty&rsquo;s
  throne-room to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say, Madame,&rdquo; he replied with the ghost of a smile; &ldquo;I
  did not look at the clock, but I was in attendance on His Majesty and therefore
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard what passed between Madame la Comtesse de Stainville and
  myself?&rdquo; she interrupted hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow she felt relieved. She would have hated to recapitulate that vulgar
  scene, the mutual recriminations, the insults, culminating in Her Majesty&rsquo;s
  contemptuous exit from the room. She could not now see her husband&rsquo;s
  face, for he had contrived to stand so as to allow the light from the candelabra
  to fall full upon her, whilst he himself, silhouetted against the light,
  remained in the shadow; but there was a certain dignified repose about the
  whole figure, the white, slender hand resting lightly on the bureau, the
  broad shoulders square and straight, suggesting physical strength, and the
  simple, somewhat sober style and cut of the clothes.</p>
  <p>The room too appeared as a complete contrast to the other apartments of
  the palace of Versailles, where the mincing fancies of Watteau and the artificialities
  of Boucher had swept aside the nobler conceptions of Girardon and Mansard.
  It was quite plainly furnished, with straight-back chairs and hangings of
  dull gold, and the leather covering of the bureau gave ample signs of wear.</p>
  <p>The turmoil in Lydie&rsquo;s heart subsided, yielding itself to peace in
  the midst of these peaceful surroundings. She was able to conquer the tremor
  of her voice, the twitch of her lips, and to swallow down the burning tears
  of humiliation which blinded her eyes and obscured her judgment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, milor, it will indeed be easier for me. You understand of what
  I am charged, the awful load of disgrace and shame which by my own folly
  I have placed upon my shoulders . . . you understand,&rdquo; and her voice,
  though steady, sunk to a whisper, &ldquo;that I have proved unworthy of the
  confidence which the unfortunate Stuart prince, who was your friend, placed
  in me as well as in you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not reply, waiting for her to continue. Her head had drooped and
  a heavy tear fell from her sunken lids upon her hands. To him who loved her,
  and whom she had so deeply wronged, there was a strange yet painful joy in
  watching her cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What Madame de Stainville said to-night is true,&rdquo; she added
  tonelessly. &ldquo;I gave into Monsieur de Stainville&rsquo;s hands the
  map, with full marginal notes and description of the place where the Stuart
  prince is hiding; I also gave him a letter written and signed by me, addressed
  to Prince Charles Edward Stuart, begging him to trust implicitly his own
  royal person and that of his friends to the bearer of my note. That letter
  and the plan are even now in the hands of His Majesty, who purposes to accept
  the proposals of His Grace the Duke of Cumberland, and to sell the Stuart
  prince to his foes for the sum of fifteen million livres. And that is all
  true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Knowing men, the men of her world, she fully expected that this confession
  of hers would cause her husband&rsquo;s just wrath to break through that
  barrier of courteous good-breeding and self-restraint, imposed on all men
  of honour when in the presence of women, and which she firmly believed had
  alone prevented him from interfering between herself and Ir&egrave;ne. She
  would not have been astonished if he had stormed and raged, loudly accused
  and condemned her, nay!&mdash;she had heard of such things&mdash;if he had
  laid hands on her. But when, hearing nothing, she looked up, she saw that
  he had scarcely moved, only the hand which still rested on the secr&eacute;taire
  trembled a little. Perhaps her look made him conscious of that, for he withdrew
  it, and then seemed to pull himself together, and draw himself up, straight
  and rigid like a soldier on parade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having told you this, milor,&rdquo; she resumed after a slight pause, &ldquo;I
  should like to add that I am fully aware that in your eyes there can be no
  excuse possible for what I did, since in doing it I have sacrificed the life
  of a man who trusted us&mdash;you and me, milor&mdash;more even than he did
  France. He and his friends, by my act, will leave the shelter of their retreat,
  and will be delivered into the hands of those who cannot do aught, for political
  and self-protective reasons, but send them to the scaffold. You see, milor,
  I do not palliate my offence, nor do I seek your pardon&mdash;although I
  know that you will look on what I have done as a disgrace brought by your
  wife upon your name. I deserve no pardon, and I ask for none. But if there
  is no excuse for my conduct, at least do I owe you an explanation, and for
  this I crave your attention if you would care to listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Madame, you do but jest,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;you owe
  me nothing . . . not even an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you will listen?&rdquo; she urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be only painful to us both, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You prefer to think of me as ignoble, treacherous and base,&rdquo; she
  said with sudden vehemence, &ldquo;you do not wish to know for certain and
  from my own lips that Gaston de Stainville . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused abruptly and bit her lips, he watching her keenly, she not knowing
  that she was watched.</p>
  <p>This was going to be a fight and he knew it, a dire conflict between distress
  and pride. At first he had hoped that she was prepared to yield, that she
  had sought this interview because the load of sorrow and of humiliation being
  more than she could bear, she had turned instinctively to the only man in
  the world who could ease and comfort her: whose boundless, untiring love
  was ready to share the present pain, as it had shrunk from participating
  in the glories of the past. But as she spoke, as she sat there before him
  now, white, passive, disdainful even in her self-abasement, he knew that
  his hour&mdash;Love&rsquo;s hour&mdash;had not yet struck. Pride was not
  yet conquered.</p>
  <p>The dominant ruler of a lifetime will not abdicate very readily, and though
  distress and sorrow are powerful opponents, they are more transient, more
  easily cast aside than Pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say, milor,&rdquo; she now said more quietly, &ldquo;the matter
  is only painful to us both. I understand that your estimate of me is not
  an exalted one. You despise&mdash;you probably hate me! Well! so be it. Let
  us not think of our own feelings in this matter, milor! I entreat you to
  ignore my very existence for the time being, only thinking of the Stuart
  prince and of his dire peril!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis because of him I have begged for this interview,&rdquo; she
  resumed with just a thought of that commanding manner, which she was wont
  to assume whenever matters of public import were discussed: &ldquo;I need
  not reiterate the fact that he is in deadly danger. <i>Le Levantin</i>, a
  fast brigantine, milor, is even now being equipped by His Majesty for the
  nefarious expedition. <i>Le Levantin</i> or perhaps <i>Le Monarque</i>&mdash;the
  latter is quite ready to sail at any time, and with the map and my letter
  it will be easy . . . oh! so easy! . . . Oh!&rdquo; she added with a sudden
  uncontrollable outburst of passionate appeal, &ldquo;milor, he was your friend
  . . . can nothing be done? . . . can nothing be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know, madame,&rdquo; he replied coldly, &ldquo;how should
  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely, surely you remember your promise to him, milor,&rdquo; she
  said impatient at his coldness, unable to understand this lack of enthusiasm. &ldquo;You
  remember that night, in the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Aumont&mdash;the banquet
  . . . his farewell to you . . . his trust, his confidence . . . the assurance
  you gave him . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much has occurred since then, Madame,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;The
  guidance of affairs has been in your hands. . . . I have lost what little
  grasp I ever had of the situation. . . . As you know, I am neither clever
  nor strong&mdash;and I have only too gladly relied on abler wits than mine
  own. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But your promise,&rdquo; she urged, with real passion ringing in
  her voice, &ldquo;your promise to him. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I made a far more solemn one to you, madame, never to interfere in
  matters of State.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll release you of that,&rdquo; she cried impulsively; &ldquo;think,
  milor . . . I entreat you to think! . . . there must be some way out of this
  terrible labyrinth . . . there must be some one whom you can trust . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She checked herself, and a quick hot blush rose to her cheeks. She thought
  that she had detected a quick flash in his eyes at these last words of hers,
  a flash which had caused that sudden rush of blood to her temples, but which
  was extinguished almost as soon as it arose: he said quite naturally and
  tonelessly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no one. How could there be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely, surely,&rdquo; she repeated with growing, obstinate vehemence, &ldquo;you
  can think of something to do . . . you have the means . . . you are rich
  . . . have you no enthusiasms, milor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! . . .&rdquo; he said deprecatingly, &ldquo;so few! . . . they
  are scarce worthy of the name. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No thought how to help your friend who is in fear and peril of his
  life? . . . Heavens above us, what are the men of France? Wooden dolls or
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That what the women of France have made them, Madame,&rdquo; he said
  quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you have no thought, or initiative how to help your friend?&rdquo; she
  retorted.</p>
  <p>He had noted the ring of scorn in her voice, the return of that haughty
  and obstinate self-will, which would for ever stand between her and happiness.
  His expression suddenly hardened, as he looked at her flashing eyes and the
  contemptuous curl of the exquisite lips, all the gentleness went out of his
  face, the latent tenderness which she had wilfully ignored, and his voice,
  no longer softly mocking, became hard and bitter in its tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; he said with a slight uplifting of his brow and a self-deprecating
  droop of the lip, &ldquo;surely, Madame, you are pleased to jest. I am no
  statesman, no politician, I scarce have a sufficiency of brains to be a figure
  head in an administration. I have never been taught to think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mocking me, milor,&rdquo; she said haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing is further from my thoughts. I have far too much respect
  for your ladyship to venture on either mockery or individual thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused awhile, frowning and impatient, angered beyond bounds, too, at
  his attitude, which she was quite clever enough to see did not represent
  the true state of his mind. No doubt he desired to punish her for her contempt
  of him that morning. She would have liked to read the expression in his face,
  to know something of what was going on behind that straight, handsome brow,
  and the eyes always so gentle, yet so irritating now in this semblance of
  humility. She thought certainly that the outline of the jaw suggested obstinacy&mdash;the
  obstinacy of the inherently weak. If she had not wanted his help so much,
  she would have left him then and there, in scorn and in wrath, only too glad
  that sentiment had not led her into more excuses or explanations&mdash;a
  prayer for forgiveness mayhap. She was not a little irritated with herself
  too, for she felt that she had made a wrong start: she was quite sure that
  his supineness, at any rate with regard to the fate of the Stuart prince,
  was assumed. There must be a way of appealing to that loyalty which she knew
  he cherished for his friend, some means of breaking down that barrier of
  resentment which he had evidently set up against her.</p>
  <p>Oh! if it had been a few months ago, when he still loved her, before Ir&egrave;ne
  de Stainville. . . She paused in this train of thought, her mind not daring
  to travel further along it; it was such a wide, such a glorious possibility
  that that one little &ldquo;if&rdquo; suggested, that her heart quivered
  with renewed agony, and the weak tears, of which she was so ashamed, insisted
  on coming to her eyes.</p>
  <p>If only his love for her was not dead, how easy her task would have been!
  It would have fired him to enthusiasm now, caused him to forget his resentment
  against her in this great work yet to be accomplished, and instead of asking
  him for passive help she could have incited him to a deed of loyalty and
  of courage. But now she was too proud to continue her appeal: she thought
  that she had done her best, and had not even succeeded in breaking through
  the icy reserve and resentment which in his heart had taken the place of
  silent and humble worship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; she said with sudden determination, and in the authoritative
  manner which was more habitual to her than the more emotional, passionately
  appealing mood, &ldquo;with your leave we&rsquo;ll cease these unworthy bickerings.
  I may have been hasty in my actions this morning. If so I pray you not to
  vent your anger against your friend. If I have wronged you by taking you
  at your word, when a year ago you told me that you would never wish to interfere
  in my official work, well! I humbly beg you pardon, and again entreat you
  not to allow your friend to expiate the sins of your wife. You say that the
  men of France are what the women have made them; there I think that you are
  wrong&mdash;at least in this: that in your mind the word woman stands for
  those of the sex who are pure and loyal as well as those for who are not.
  It is not the women of France who have made the men, milor, rather it is
  the men who&mdash;looking to the Pompadours, the Ir&egrave;ne de Stainvilles,
  not only for companionship and for pleasure, but also, heaven help them!
  for ideals&mdash;have made the women what they are! But enough of this. You
  no doubt think me wordy and tedious, and neither understand, nor wish to
  understand that there may be honour and chivalry in a far greater degree
  in the heart of a woman, than in that of the more selfish sex. I have asked
  for your advice in all simplicity and loyalty, acknowledging the sin I have
  committed and asking you to help me in atoning for it, in a way useful to
  your friend. This appeal for advice you have met with sneers and bitter mockery:
  on my soul, milor if I could now act without your assistance I would do so,
  for in all the humiliation which I have had to endure to-day, none has been
  more galling or more hard to bear believe me, than that which I must now
  endure through finding myself, in a matter essentially vital to my heart
  and even to my reason, dependent upon your help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He could hear her voice trembling a little in spite of her efforts at self-control.
  He knew quite well that at this moment she spoke the truth, and these last
  words of hers, which for many a long day afterward rang persistently in his
  ears, represented to him ever afterward the very acme of mental&mdash;aye!
  and physical&mdash;pain which one human being could inflict on another. At
  the time it absolutely seemed unendurable: it seemed to him that under the
  blow, thus coldly dealt by those same beautiful lips, for which his own ached
  with an intensity of passionate longing, either his life or his reason must
  give way. The latter probably, for life is more tenacious and more cruel
  in its tenacity: yet if reason went, then Heaven alone could help him, for
  he would either kill her or outrage her beyond the hope of pardon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore, milor,&rdquo; she resumed after a slight pause, unconscious
  evidently of the intense cruelty of her words, &ldquo;I will beg of you not
  to make it harder for me than need be. I must ask this help from you, in
  order to succeed, if humanly possible, in outwitting the infamous work of
  a gang of traitors. Will you, at least, give me this help I need?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it lies within my power,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I pray you
  to command Madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am thinking of sending a messenger post haste to the commander
  of <i>Le Monarque</i> with orders to set sail at once for Scotland,&rdquo; she
  continued in matter-of-fact tones. &ldquo;I should want a fresh copy of the
  map where Prince Charles Edward is in hiding, and to make assurance doubly
  sure a letter from you to the prince, asking him to trust Captain Barre implicitly. <i>Le
  Monarque</i> I know can reach Scotland long ere <i>Le Levantin</i> is ready
  for sea, and my idea had been originally to commission her to take the prince
  and his friends on board, and then to skirt the west coast of Ireland, reaching
  Brittany or mayhap the Pyrenees by a circuitous route. I have firm belief
  that it is not too late to send this messenger, milor, and thus to put my
  original plan into execution. And if you will give me a new map and full
  directions and your signet ring for the prince, I feel confident that I can
  find someone whom I could thoroughly trust . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no one whom you could thoroughly trust with such an errand,
  Madame!&rdquo; he said drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must risk that, milor. The crisis has become so acute that I must
  do something to avert that awful catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Betrayal would be the inevitable result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you to leave that to me,&rdquo; she urged firmly. &ldquo;I
  know I can find someone, all I ask is for the map, and a word and signet
  ring from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was leaning forward now, eager and enthusiastic again, self-willed and
  domineering, determined that he should do what she wished. Her eyes were
  glowing, the marble was indeed endowed with life; she gleamed like a jewel,
  white and fragile-looking, in this dull and sombre room, and he forgetting
  for the moment her cruelty of awhile ago was loth to let her go, to speak
  the harsh words which anon would have to be said, and which would send her
  resentful, contemptuous, perhaps heartbroken, out of his sight again.</p>
  <p>Would it not have been ten thousand times more simple to throw pride, just
  anger, reason to the winds, to fall at those exquisite feet, to encircle
  that glittering marble with passionately tremulous arms, to swear fealty,
  slavery, obedience to her whims.</p>
  <p>How she would smile, and how softly and tenderly would the flush of victory
  tinge those pale cheeks with delicate rose! to see it gradually chase away
  the pearl-like tone of her skin, to see her eyes brighten at his word, to
  feel perhaps the tiny hand tremble with joy as it lay for sheer gratitude
  a few brief seconds in his, was not that well worth the barren victory of
  a man&rsquo;s pride over a woman&rsquo;s self-will?</p>
  <p>She had thought that he would have yielded at her first word, would at once
  have fawned at her feet, kissing her hand, swearing that he was her slave.
  He had done it once . . . a year ago, and why not now again? Then she had
  smiled on him, had allowed him to kneel, to kiss her gown, anon had yielded
  her cold fingers to his kiss; he had reaped a year of misery for that one
  moment&rsquo;s joy, and now, just for the space of a few seconds he was again
  assailed with an awful temptation to throw prudence and pride away, to enjoy
  one golden hour&mdash;less perhaps&mdash;but glorious and fulsome whilst
  it lasted, until it gave way once more to humiliation, far worse to bear
  than heretofore.</p>
  <p>The temptation for those few brief seconds was overwhelming, and &rsquo;twas
  fortunate that he stood in shadow, else she had seen signs of an awful conflict
  in that young and handsome face which she had been wont to see so gentle
  and so placid. But he knew that in her, pride had by now absolutely got the
  upper hand: sorrow had laid down her arms and constituted herself a prisoner
  of war, following meekly behind the triumphal chariot of her conquering rival.</p>
  <p>And because of that, because he knew that there was not one spark yet in
  her heart which Love had kindled, that Love itself was still lying dormant
  within her, gagged and bound even in his sleep, kept in subjection thus pinioned
  and helpless by masterful self-will and by obstinate pride, he would not
  yield to the temptation of culling the Dead Sea fruit, that would inevitably
  turn to ashes, even as his lips first tasted its fleeting, if intoxicating
  savour.</p>
  <p>She had half risen from her chair leaning across the bureau, eager, excited,
  tremulous, sure of victory. Paper and pen lay close to her hand, smiling
  she pointed to these:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I pray you, milor,&rdquo; she said with passionate fervour, &ldquo;do
  not delay! Every hour, every minute is precious . . . I swear to you that
  I&rsquo;ll find a messenger. He&rsquo;ll not know the purport of his errand.
  . . . Oh! I assure you I&rsquo;ll play the part of indifference to perfection!
  . . . The packet to the commander of <i>Le Monarque</i> will seem of the
  most insignificant kind. . . . I&rsquo;ll not even order the messenger to
  hurry . . . just to guard the packet as inviolate as any secret of State.
  . . . Nay! hundreds of such messages have to be trusted to indifferent hands,
  in the course of a single transaction of the nation&rsquo;s business. Believe
  me, milor, there is not cause for fear! <i>Le Monarque</i> can put to sea
  within an hour of receiving my orders, and Prince Charles Edward Stuart and
  his friends will be safely out of reach, ere <i>Le Levantin</i> unfurls her
  sails, and pins to her masthead the pennant of traitors. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you do not speak, milor,&rdquo; she said suddenly changing the
  tone of her voice, all eagerness gone from her manner, a strange, nameless
  anxiety gripping her heart, &ldquo;will you not do this little I ask? . .
  .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is impossible, Madame,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible? . . . Why? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice now was harsh, trenchant, as it had been when she hurled a loud
  insult at Gaston de Stainville through his wife. She was on her feet, tall
  and erect; a statue once more, white to the lips, cold and haughty, rigid
  too, save for the slight trembling of her hands and the tremulous quiver
  of her mouth when she spoke.</p>
  <p>As he did not reply to her question, she said impatiently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you give me a reason for this unexplainable refusal, milor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I refuse, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is not your last word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my last word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you have me think that you are at one with the treacherous
  scheme, milor? and that you do not desire the safety of the Stuart prince?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had raised her voice, boldly accusing him, inwardly knowing that the
  accusation was groundless, yet wishing to goad him now into passion, into
  explanation, above all into acquiescence if it still lay in her power to
  force it.</p>
  <p>But he took the insult with apparent calm, shrugged his shoulders and said
  quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or is it . . . is it that you do not trust me? . . . that you think
  I . . . ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not finish the sentence, nor put into words the awful suggestion
  which had sprung like a stinging viper straight across the train of her thoughts.
  Her eyes dazed and burning tried to pierce the gloom wherein he stood, but
  the flickering light of the candles only threw weird, fantastic gleams upon
  his face, which suddenly seemed strange, unknown, incomprehensible to her.
  His figure appeared preternaturally tall, the sober gray of his coat looked
  like the pall of an avenging ghost. He was silent and had made no sign of
  protest, when she framed the terrible query.</p>
  <p>A bitter, an awful humiliation overwhelmed her. She felt as if right within
  her heart something had snapped and crumbled, which nothing on earth could
  ever set up again.</p>
  <p>She said nothing more, but she could not altogether repress a heartbroken
  moan, which rose from the intensity of her mental agony.</p>
  <p>Then she turned and with head thrown back, with silent, trembling lips and
  half-closed eyes she walked slowly out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  The Fate Of The Stuart Prince</b></h2>
  <p>Lydie hardly knew how she reached her apartments. Earlier in the day she
  had thought once or twice that she had reached the deepest abyss of sorrow
  and humiliation into which it was possible for a woman of pride to descend.
  When her husband first asked an explanation from her, and taxed her with
  lending an ear to the King&rsquo;s base proposals; when she found that her
  own father, whom she respected and loved, had himself delved deeply in the
  mire of treachery; when she stood face to face with Gaston de Stainville
  and realized that he was an infamous liar and she a weak, confiding fool;
  when Ir&egrave;ne had accused her publicly of scheming that which she would
  have given her life&rsquo;s blood to avert, all these were moments when she
  felt that the shame of them was more than she could bear.</p>
  <p>Yet how simple and childish, how paltry seemed the agony of those mental
  tortures in comparison with that she endured now.</p>
  <p>She felt as if she had received a blow in the face, a blow which had left
  a hideous, disfiguring mark on her which everyone henceforth would see: the
  scarlet letter of ignominy with which in the New World beyond the seas a
  puritanic inquisition branded the shameless outcasts. By her husband&rsquo;s
  silence rather than by his words she had been branded with a mark of infamy.</p>
  <p>Ye saints and angels above, how terribly it hurt!</p>
  <p>Yet why did she suffer so? Was it only because she had failed to obtain
  that which she almost begged for on her knees? Lydie, proud, dictatorial,
  domineering Lydie, felt that she had humiliated herself beyond what she would
  have thought possible less than twelve hours ago, and she had been refused.</p>
  <p>Was it that, that made her heart, her head, her very limbs ache with almost
  unendurable agony?</p>
  <p>Her mind&mdash;though almost on the verge of madness&mdash;retained just
  one glimmer of reason. It answered &ldquo;No! the pain has deeper roots,
  more mysterious, at present incomprehensible, and death-dealing in their
  tenacity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her husband thought that if he entrusted her with a letter for the Stuart
  prince, she might use that letter for treacherous ends. That was the reason
  of his refusal. He so hated, so despised her that his mind classed her as
  one of the most ignoble of her sex!</p>
  <p>Well! Awhile ago, in the Queen&rsquo;s antechamber, Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville
  had publicly accused her of selling her royal friend for gold. Most people
  there had believed Ir&egrave;ne readily enough! That had hurt too, but not
  so much.</p>
  <p>Then why this? Why these terrible thoughts which went hammering in her mind?
  whispers of peace to escape from this racking torture? peace that could only
  be found in death!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great God, am I going mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur Achille had been accompanying Madame la Marquise on her way along
  the corridors; he was carrying a candelabrum, wherein four wax candles spluttered
  and flickered in the incessant draught. Lydie had been unconscious of the
  man&rsquo;s presence, but she had followed the light mechanically, her eyes
  fixed on the four yellowish flames which looked like mocking mouths that
  laughed, and emitted a trail of black smoke, foul as the pestilential breath
  of shame.</p>
  <p>Arrived at the door of her own antechamber, she was met by one of her liveried
  servants, who told her that Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont was within and
  awaiting to see her. To her hastily put query, the man replied that Monsieur
  le Duc had arrived about half an hour ago, and, hearing that Madame la Marquise
  was closeted with milor, he had elected to wait.</p>
  <p>This visit from her father at this hour of the night meant a grave crisis,
  of course. At once Lydie&rsquo;s mind flew back to the Stuart prince. She
  had almost forgotten him since she left her husband&rsquo;s room. It seemed
  as if the overwhelming misery of that silent and deadly indictment had weighed
  down all other thoughts, until they sank into complete insignificance.</p>
  <p>Vaguely, too, she had the sensation that there was no immediate necessity
  for her to rack her overtired brain to-night on the subject of the Jacobite&rsquo;s
  fate. She had at least six clear days before her, before <i>Le Levantin</i>,
  which was to start on the dire expedition, could be ready to put to sea.
  There was <i>Le Monarque</i>, on the other hand, quite ready to sail within
  an hour of receiving her orders. And Captain Barre was an honest man, a gallant
  sailor; he would only be too willing to make top speed in order to circumvent
  a treacherous plot, which he would abhor if he knew of it.</p>
  <p>True, Lydie had now no means of locating the fugitives exactly, but with
  a six days&rsquo; start of <i>Le Levantin</i> this want of precise knowledge
  need not necessarily prove fatal. She could trust to her memory somewhat,
  for she had repeatedly studied and fingered the map; she could draw something
  approximate from memory, and Captain Barre&rsquo;s determination and enthusiasm
  would surely do the rest.</p>
  <p>These suggestions all rushed into her mind directly she heard that her father
  had come to visit her at this late hour. At first her desire was to avoid
  seeing him at risk even of offending him: but in spite of all that she had
  gone through, Lydie still retained sufficient presence of mind not to allow
  any impulse to rule her at such a critical moment. She forced herself to
  reflect on the Stuart prince and on him alone, on his danger and the treacherous
  plot against him, for at least twenty seconds, time enough to realize that
  it was absolutely necessary that she should see her father, in order to glean
  from him if possible every detail of the proposed expedition. She would indeed
  be helpless if she remained in ignorance of what had been planned between
  the King, Gaston, and her father. Perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;in accordance
  with the habits of a lifetime, the Duke might even at this moment be anxious
  to consult his daughter&mdash;his helpmeet in all such matters&mdash;as to
  the final arrangements for the equipment of <i>Le Levantin</i>.</p>
  <p>Satisfied with her conclusions, she therefore went straight into the boudoir
  where the lacquey said that Monsieur le Duc was waiting.</p>
  <p>The first look at his benign face proved to her that he, at least, was not
  in any trouble. Whatever his daughter&rsquo;s views on the subject might
  be, he evidently was not altogether dissatisfied with the events of the day.
  He still wore a perturbed look, certainly; the scene which had occurred in
  Her Majesty&rsquo;s throne-room would not tend to decrease his mental worry;
  but beyond the slightly troubled look in his kindly eyes, and the obvious
  solicitude with which he took her hand and led her to a low divan, he seemed
  fairly serene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said in a tone of anxious query.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, father dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your husband . . . what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him, a little bewildered, with a stupid, vacant stare which
  puzzled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What should he have said, father dear?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I
  do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About the fracas to-night, my child. Was he there when Ir&egrave;ne
  de Stainville spoke up so indiscreetly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No . . . no . . . I mean yes . . .&rdquo; she said vaguely, &ldquo;yes,
  milor was there; he heard every word which Ir&egrave;ne de Stainville said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? What did he say?&rdquo; he repeated with marked impatience. &ldquo;Lydie,
  my child, this is not like you. . . . Cannot you see that I am anxious? .
  . . I have been waiting here for over an half hour in a perfect agony of
  uncertainty. . . . Your servants told me you were closeted with milor. .
  . . You must tell me what he said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said nothing, father,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc looked at her very keenly, but her eyes were clear now and
  met his straight and full. There was obviously no deceit there, no desire
  to conceal more serious matters from him. He shrugged his shoulders, in token
  that he gave up all desire to understand. His son-in-law had always been
  a shadowy personality to him, and this attitude of his now, in face of the
  public scandal resting on his wife&rsquo;s name, was quite beyond Monsieur
  le Duc&rsquo;s comprehension.</p>
  <p>Had Lydie told him that her husband had heaped torrents of abuse on her,
  and had concluded a noisy scene by striking her, he would have been very
  angry, but he would have understood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; he said placidly, &ldquo;these English are mad, of a truth;
  we men of honour here cannot really comprehend them. Nevertheless, my dear
  Lydie, I suppose I, as your father, must be thankful that he did not lay
  hands on you, for English husbands are notoriously brutal. You are quite
  sure that you have nothing to complain of in your husband&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, father dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had come prepared to take you away with me. My coach is below and
  I am driving to Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Aumont to-night. Would you like to
  come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night, dear,&rdquo; she replied serenely, and her father was
  glad to note that a slight smile hovered round her lips. &ldquo;I am a little
  tired, and will go straight to bed. . . . But to-morrow I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Permanently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! until you go to your Ch&acirc;teau of Vincennes, you know my
  views on that subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father dear. . . . We will talk of that another time. . . .
  I am very tired to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand that, my child,&rdquo; said Monsieur le Duc rather fussily
  now, and clearing his throat, as if there was something which still oppressed
  him and of which he would have liked to speak before leaving her.</p>
  <p>There was that awkward pause, the result of a want of mutual understanding
  between two people who hitherto have been all in all to each other, but whom
  certain untoward events have suddenly drawn apart. Lydie sincerely wished
  that her father would go. She had much to think about, a great deal to do,
  and the strain of keeping up a semblance of serenity was very trying to her
  overwrought nerves. He on the other hand felt uncomfortable in her presence:
  he left quite angry with himself for not being able to discuss freely with
  her the subject matter which was uppermost in his mind. There were one or
  two details in connection with the expedition to the Scottish coast that
  he very much wanted to talk over with his daughter. The habits of a lifetime
  gave him the desire to consult her about these details, just as he had been
  wont to do on all public and official matters. He had come to her apartments
  chiefly for that purpose. Was she not at one with him, with the King and
  Gaston over the scheme? She had given substantial proof that she favoured
  the expedition. His Majesty had thanked her for her help: she had rendered
  such assistance as now made the whole affair not only feasible but easy of
  accomplishment.</p>
  <p>It was therefore passing strange that Monsieur le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont still
  felt an unaccountable bashfulness in her presence when referring to the Stuart
  prince at all.</p>
  <p>So he went to work in a circuitous way, for there was another matter that
  troubled him, but less so than the expedition: therefore, perhaps, he spoke
  of it first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I presume, my dear child,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;that you
  are sufficiently a woman of the world to understand that some sort of reparation
  is due from your husband to Monsieur de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reparation? . . .&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again she stared at him blankly, and with that vague expression of puzzlement
  which irritated whilst it half-frightened him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were there, my dear,&rdquo; he said impatiently, &ldquo;you know
  . . . and of course you must have seen . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor jeered at Gaston, then tripped him up with his foot, so that
  Monsieur de Stainville measured his full length on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not notice. . . .&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But many people did . . . enough at all events to give Monsieur de
  Stainville the initiative in the necessary reparation. He was the insulted
  party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! a duel, you mean,&rdquo; she said indifferently, &ldquo;yes,
  I suppose my husband will fight Monsieur de Stainville if His Majesty will
  grant them leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gaston will not appeal to His Majesty, and milor cannot very well
  refuse to meet him. The King has oft declared his intention of permanently
  suppressing all duelling just as it has been done in England. Even to-night
  after the unfortunate fracas, when I had the honour of paying my final respects,
  His Majesty said to me: &lsquo;If milor Eglinton and Monsieur de Stainville
  fight and one of them is killed, we&rsquo;ll hang the survivor!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll not fight, you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc stared at his daughter. Such complete indifference as to
  her husband&rsquo;s actions in so grave a matter passed the bounds of correct
  behaviour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mais oui!</i> they will fight, my dear!&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;You
  know as well as I do that Gaston could not pocket the slight put upon him
  by milor without covering himself with ridicule. But the duel need not be
  serious . . . a scratch or two and no more. . . . Gaston is a perfect swordsman
  . . . he never misses his man,&rdquo; added the Duke hesitatingly. &ldquo;Is
  milor clever with the foils?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has never fought a duel to your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whilst Gaston&rsquo;s skill is famous. . . . But, my dear, you need
  have no anxiety. . . . It was also with a view to reassuring you on the subject
  that I have sought you so late. . . . You will believe your father&rsquo;s
  word, Lydie, if he tells you that your husband is in no grave danger at the
  hands of Gaston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, father dear,&rdquo; she rejoined with the same natural,
  even tone of voice which should have tranquillised him as to her mental condition,
  but which somehow failed to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gaston must take up the matter . . . you understand that. . . . It
  is quite public and . . . he would be laughed at if he appealed for leave
  to fight from His Majesty . . . the matter was not serious and the result
  will be likewise. . . . Gaston will administer a slight punishment to milor
  . . . such a perfect swordsman, you understand, can select the very place
  on his opponent&rsquo;s body where he will inflict the scratch . . . it will
  be the shoulder perhaps . . . or . . . or . . . the cheek . . . nothing to
  be anxious about. . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not anxious, father dear,&rdquo; she said with a serene smile,
  amused in spite of herself at his many circumlocutions, his obvious confusion,
  and his still quite apparent wish to speak of one more matter which seemed
  to be weighing on his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all that you wished to say to me, dear?&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;for
  if so I can assure you that you need not be troubled on my account. I am
  neither anxious nor upset. . . . Milor I feel confident will take tender
  care of his shoulder . . . or of his cheek just as he does of his comfort
  and of his . . . his dignity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will not take it amiss from me, my dear, if I do not offer
  to be one of your husband&rsquo;s seconds in the affair?&rdquo; he asked
  suddenly, throwing off his hesitation and speaking more frankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not, father dear. . . . I feel sure that milor himself
  would not have suggested it. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My position near His Majesty . . . you understand, my dear,&rdquo; he
  explained volubly, &ldquo;and also my . . . our association with Gaston.
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; she repeated, emphasizing her words, &ldquo;our
  association with Gaston. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he really is acting like a perfect gentleman . . . a man of honour.
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His enthusiasm, his courage, and devotion have been quite marvellous.
  And though we shall primarily owe the success of our enterprise to you, my
  dear, yet His Majesty feels as I do, that we also owe much to Monsieur de
  Stainville. Ah! <i>mon Dieu!</i> what it is to be young!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has Monsieur de Stainville done, dear, to arouse your special
  enthusiasm?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall judge of it yourself, my dear. After the esclandre provoked
  by Ir&egrave;ne to-night, the publicity given to our scheme, we held a hurried
  boudoir meeting, at which His Majesty and Madame de Pompadour were present,
  as well as myself and Gaston. We all felt that you too should have been there,
  dear, but you had gone with milor, and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, never mind about me, father,&rdquo; she interrupted impatiently,
  seeing that he was getting lost in the mazes of his polite apologies. &ldquo;You
  held a boudoir meeting. What did you decide? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That after the publicity given to the main idea of our scheme, you
  understand,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;it would be no longer safe to wait
  for its execution until <i>Le Levantin</i> was ready for sea. Something had
  to be risked, of course, but on the whole we all thought that now that the
  matter had become &lsquo;le secret de Polichinelle&rsquo; a six days&rsquo; delay
  would be dangerous, if not fatal to success. You were not there, Lydie,&rdquo; he
  repeated diffidently, &ldquo;we could not consult you. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no! Then what did you decide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we must send <i>Le Monarque</i> off at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Le Monarque</i>? . . . at once? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! she is quite ready, so you told me this morning. And though
  we feared that Captain Barre might be too firm an adherent of the Stuart
  cause to be altogether reliable, still&mdash;as we had your own letter&mdash;we
  finally decided that we had better trust him now, rather than wait for <i>Le
  Levantin</i>. . . . I think we did right, do you not? . . . Lydie. . . .
  Lydie . . . child, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The desperately anxious query had its justification in Lydie&rsquo;s terrible
  pallor, the wild dilation of her pupils, the dark purple rings which circled
  her eyes.</p>
  <p>As her father spoke she had risen from the divan, and now she seemed unable
  to stand; she was trembling from head to foot, her hands were held out before
  her, as in a pathetic appeal for physical support. In a moment his arm was
  round her, and with gentle force he drew her back to the couch, pressing
  her head against his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie . . . Lydie, dear . . . I am sure you are ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already she had recovered from this sudden attack of faintness and dizziness,
  of which, with characteristic impatience for all feminine weaknesses, she
  was now thoroughly ashamed. Her nervous system had received so many severe
  shocks in the course of this terrible and memorable day, that it was small
  wonder that this last awful blow struck her physically as well as mentally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, dear father,&rdquo; she said as lightly as she could for
  she still felt very faint and ill, &ldquo;I am quite well, I assure you .
  . . please . . . please . . .&rdquo; she urged earnestly, &ldquo;do not worry
  about me now, but tell me quite clearly&mdash;and as briefly as you can&mdash;exactly
  what are your plans at this moment . . . yours and Gaston&rsquo;s, with regard
  to the expedition against the Stuart prince . . . you spoke of a duel just
  now . . . and then of Monsieur de Stainville&rsquo;s enthusiasm and courage.
  . . . I . . . I am a little confused . . . and I would like to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you as briefly as I can, my dear,&rdquo; he rejoined,
  not feeling altogether reassured, and regarding her with loving anxiety. &ldquo;We
  decided that, instead of waiting for <i>Le Levantin</i> to be ready for sea,
  we would send <i>Le Monarque</i>, and instruct Captain Barre in accordance
  with the plan and the letter which you gave us, and the secret orders framed
  by His Majesty and myself. <i>Le Monarque</i> having got the Stuart and his
  friends on board will make straight for the north-west coast of England,
  and land the Jacobites at the first possible port, where they can be handed
  over to the English authorities. Once this was settled, Gaston immediately
  offered to start for Le Havre at dawn with the secret orders. We are not
  really afraid of Captain Barre&rsquo;s possible disloyalty&mdash;and, of
  course, he is compelled to obey orders or suffer for his insubordination,
  which he is not likely to contemplate. On the whole I think we may safely
  say that we run far less risk by sending <i>Le Monarque</i> than by waiting
  for <i>Le Levantin</i>: and Gaston has full powers to promise Captain Barre
  a heavy bribe in accordance with the speed which <i>Le Monarque</i> will
  make. After that His Majesty was pleased to dismiss Monsieur de Stainville
  and myself, being most specially gratified with Gaston&rsquo;s enthusiastic
  offer to ride at breakneck speed to Le Havre, as soon as he could get to
  horse. Outside the boudoir, Gaston explained to me, however, that he could
  not shirk the duel with Lord Eglinton: his seconds, Monsieur de Belle-Isle
  and Monsieur de Lugeac, already had his instructions and would wait on milor
  to-night: to put it off now would be to cover himself with ridicule and to
  risk social ostracism; the affront put upon his wife could not be allowed
  to rest until after his own return. But the duel could take place at dawn,
  and then he could get to horse half an hour later. . . . So you see, my dear,
  that the duel cannot&mdash;because of these weighty reasons&mdash;have any
  serious consequences. As for our expedition, methinks everything now is most
  satisfactorily arranged, as Gaston swears that he will reach Le Havre ere
  the shades of the evening fall upon the sea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lydie had listened quite quietly to this long explanation, taking in every
  detail of the project, lest anything should escape her. Her father could
  indeed be completely reassured. She was perfectly calm, apparently cheerful,
  and when he had finished speaking she thanked him quite naturally and expressed
  approval of all that had been done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything is beautifully planned and arranged, my dear father,&rdquo; she
  said pleasantly, &ldquo;methinks I cannot do better than take a rest. I fear
  I have been overwrought all day and have caused you much anxiety. All is
  for the best now, is it not? . . . Shall we both go to bed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur le Duc sighed with satisfaction. He seemed to have found a long-lost
  daughter. This was the one he knew, self-possessed, clear-headed, a comfort
  and a guide.</p>
  <p>He drew her to him and kissed her tenderly, and if there was a suggestion
  of shrinking, of withdrawal in the young body, he was certainly too preoccupied
  to notice it. He bade her &ldquo;good-night,&rdquo; and then with obvious
  relief and a light, elastic step, he finally went out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  M. de Stainville&rsquo;s Seconds</b></h2>
  <p>When Monsieur Achille, having escorted Madame la Marquise as far as her
  apartments, once more retraced his sedate footsteps toward those occupied
  by Lord Eglinton, he was much surprised to find the worthy Baptiste Durand
  in the octagonal room which gave immediately on milor&rsquo;s study.</p>
  <p>The wizened little man looked singularly upset; he had a couple of heavy
  books under his arm: and two large white quills, one behind each ear, gave
  him the look of a frightened stork.</p>
  <p>It was long past the usual hour when M. Durand laden with his bulky books
  habitually entered the Marquis&rsquo;s private room and remained closeted
  therein with milor until long past midnight. Every evening at the self-same
  hour he came to the octagonal room, passed the time of day with Monsieur
  Achille and then went in, to milor: he always carried a leather bag filled
  with papers neatly tied in bundles, and he wore a somewhat anxious look when
  he entered and one of relief when he finally departed. Monsieur Achille had
  often bent his broad and majestic back, in order to bring his ear down to
  the level of the keyhole of the door, through which Monsieur Durand invariably
  disappeared at ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening; but all the satisfaction
  which his curiosity obtained was the sound of two voices, one steady and
  low and the other somewhat shrill, without any individual or comprehensible
  sentence detaching itself from the irritating babel.</p>
  <p>And when M. Durand came out of the room after midnight, he bade Monsieur
  Achille a curt good-night and invariably refused any information with regard
  to the work he did for milor at that late hour of the night.</p>
  <p>When closely pressed he would vaguely say: &ldquo;Accounts!&rdquo; which
  of course was ridiculous. Monsieur Achille had never heard of a nobleman
  troubling himself about accounts, at the time when most people of consideration
  were either at <i>petits soupers</i> or else comfortably in bed.</p>
  <p>As time went on Monsieur Achille ceased to take any interest in these nightly
  proceedings; they were so monotonous and so regular, that they were no longer
  exciting. But to-night everything seemed changed. M. Durand instead of marching
  straight through with his books into the study, stood in the middle of the
  room, a veritable picture of helpless perturbation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, M. Durand,&rdquo; said Achille greatly astonished, &ldquo;what
  ails you? You look as if you had seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh!&mdash;-sh!&mdash;-sh!&rdquo; whispered the timorous little man,
  indicating with a jerk of his lean shoulder the distant door of the study, &ldquo;do
  you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Monsieur Achille bent his ear to listen. But strive how he might he could
  hear nothing but the great bracket-clock on the wall ticking monotonously.
  He shrugged his shoulders to indicate that the worthy Baptiste had been dreaming,
  but there was a certain look in the wizened face which caused him to tiptoe
  toward the study door and once more to bring his ear down to the level of
  the keyhole.</p>
  <p>Then he shook his head, and tiptoed back to the centre of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear nothing,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Are you sure he is
  in there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite, quite sure,&rdquo; replied Durand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you go in as usual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I . . . I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I . . . I don&rsquo;t know. . . . I seemed to hear such a funny sound
  as if . . .&rdquo; he paused a moment searching for the words that would
  best render his impression of what he had heard. Finding none apparently,
  he reiterated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a very funny sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps milor was asleep and snoring,&rdquo; suggested the practical
  Achille.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Durand very energetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or ill . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah yes! . . . perhaps . . .&rdquo; stammered the little man, &ldquo;perhaps
  milor is ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll to him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before M. Durand could prevent him&mdash;which undoubtedly he would
  have done&mdash;Achille had gone back to the study door and loudly knocked
  thereat.</p>
  <p>At first there was no answer. M. Achille knocked again, and yet again, until
  a voice from within suddenly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Achille, M. le Marquise!&rdquo; responded the worthy with alacrity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want nothing,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Tell Durand that I
  shall not need him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Durand nearly dropped his heavy books on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not want me!&rdquo; he ejaculated; &ldquo;we shall get terribly in
  arrears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will milor go to bed?&rdquo; again queried M. Achille.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; came somewhat impatiently from within. &ldquo;Do not wait
  up for me. If I want you later I will ring.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Achille looked at M. Durand and the worthy Baptiste returned the look of
  puzzlement and wonder. Both shrugged their shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be done, my good Baptiste,&rdquo; said Achille
  at last; &ldquo;you had best take your paraphernalia away and go to bed.
  I know that tone of voice, I have heard it once before when . . . but never
  mind that,&rdquo; he added abruptly checking himself, as if he feared to
  commit an indiscretion, &ldquo;enough that I know if milor says, in that
  tone of voice, that he does not want you and that you are to go away&mdash;well
  then, my good Durand, he does not want you and you are to go away. . . .
  Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And having delivered himself of this phrase of unanswerable logic he pointed
  toward the door.</p>
  <p>M. Durand was about to take his friend&rsquo;s sound advice, when a loud
  ring broke in upon the silence which had fallen over this portion of the
  stately palace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A visitor at this late hour,&rdquo; mused Monsieur Achille. &ldquo;Ma
  foi! methinks perhaps milor was expecting a fair and tardy visitor. . . .
  eh, M. Durand? . . . and that perhaps this was the reason why you and I were
  to go away . . . eh? . . . and why you were not wanted to-night, . . . What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Durand was doubtful as to that, but there was no time to discuss that
  little matter, for a second ring, louder and more peremptory than the first,
  caused M. Achille to pull himself together, to flick at his cravat, and to
  readjust the set of his coat, whilst M. Durand loath to retire before he
  knew something of the tardy visitor, withdrew with books, bag and papers
  into a dark corner of the room.</p>
  <p>Already the sound of approaching footsteps drew nearer; the visitor had
  been admitted and was now being escorted through the reception rooms by the
  two footmen carrying torches. The next moment the doors leading to the official
  suite of apartments were thrown open, M. Achille put himself in position
  in the centre of the room, whilst a loud voice from the distant hall announced:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Marquis de Belle-Isle! M. le Comte de Lugeac!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Achille&rsquo;s broad back was bent nearly double. The names were well known
  to him and represented, if not exactly the flower of aristocratic France,
  at least the invisible power which swayed her destinies. M. le Marquis de
  Belle-Isle was Madame de Pompadour&rsquo;s best friend, and M. de Lugeac
  was her nephew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your master . . . is he within?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was M. de Belle-Isle who spoke; his voice was loud and peremptory, the
  voice of a man who only recently had been in a position to command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor is . . . er . . . within, M. le Marquis,&rdquo; said Achille
  with slight hesitation. It is not often that he was taken aback when in the
  exercise of his duties, but the situation was undoubtedly delicate, and he
  had not yet made up his mind exactly how he ought to deal with it.</p>
  <p>Neither of the two gentlemen, however, seemed to have any intention of leaving
  him much longer in doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go and tell him at once,&rdquo; said M. de Lugeac, &ldquo;that Monsieur
  le Marquis de Belle-Isle and myself will have to trouble him for about two
  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Achille seemed to be hesitating&mdash;for he did not move with any
  alacrity and his well-kept hand stroked his smooth, heavy chin&mdash;M. de
  Belle-Isle added more loudly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go knave! and at once. . . . Par le diable, man! . . . how dare you
  hesitate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed Monsieur Achille dared do that no longer. M. le Marquis de Belle-Isle
  was not a gentleman to be trifled with so he shrugged his majestic shoulders,
  and rubbed his hands together in token that the affair had passed out of
  their keeping, and that he no longer held himself responsible for any unpleasant
  consequences which might accrue from such unparalleled intrusion.</p>
  <p>He strode with becoming majesty to the study door, his broad, straight back
  emphasising the protest of his whole attitude. Once more he knocked, but
  more loudly, less diffidently than before.</p>
  <p>The voice from within queried with marked impatience:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An urgent call, Monsieur le Marquis!&rdquo; replied Achille in a
  firm voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see no one. I am busy,&rdquo; said the voice from within.</p>
  <p>M. de Belle-Isle felt that this little scene was not quite dignified; neither
  he nor M. de Lugeac was accustomed to stand behind a lacquey&rsquo;s back,
  parleying with a man through closed doors: therefore when Monsieur Achille
  turned to him now with a look which strove to indicate respectfully but firmly
  that the incident was closed, he pushed him roughly aside and himself called
  loudly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi, Marquis, methinks you are over-anxious to forbid your door
  to-night. I, Andr&eacute; de Belle-Isle and my friend le Comte de Lugeac
  desire a word with you. We represent M. le Comte de Stainville, and unless
  you are closeted with a lady, I summon you to open this door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as the door remained obstinately closed&mdash;too long at any rate
  for M. le Marquis&rsquo;s impatience&mdash;he boldly placed his hand on the
  knob and threw it open. The heavy panels flew back, revealing Lord Eglinton
  sitting at his secr&eacute;taire writing. His head was resting on his hand,
  but he turned to look at the two gentlemen, as they stood, momentarily silent
  and subdued in the doorway itself. He rose to greet them, but stared at them
  somewhat astonished and not a little haughtily, and he made no motion requesting
  them to enter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We crave your pardon, milor,&rdquo; began Monsieur de Belle-Isle,
  feeling, as he afterward explained, unaccountably bashful and crestfallen, &ldquo;we
  would not have intruded, M. de Lugeac and I, only that there was a slight
  formality omitted this evening without which we cannot proceed and which
  we must pray you to fulfill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What formality, Monsieur?&rdquo; asked milor courteously. &ldquo;I
  am afraid I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole incident occurred very rapidly, we must admit,&rdquo; continued
  M. de Belle-Isle still standing in the doorway, still unwilling apparently
  to intrude any further on this man whom he had known for some time, yet who
  seemed to have become an utter stranger to him now: haughty, grave and courteous,
  with an extraordinary look of aloofness in the face which repelled the very
  suggestion of familiarity. &ldquo;And that is no doubt the reason, milor,
  why you omitted to name your seconds to Monsieur de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My seconds?&rdquo; repeated milor. &ldquo;I am afraid you must think
  me very stupid . . . but I still do not understand . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely, milor . . .&rdquo; protested M. de Belle-Isle, a little
  taken aback.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you be so kind as to explain? . . . if it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Necessary? Pardi, I should not have thought that it had been necessary.
  You, milor, in yourself also and through Madame la Marquise your wife have
  insulted M. le Comte de Stainville and Madame la Comtesse too. We represent
  M. le Comte de Stainville in this affair, wherein we presume that you are
  prepared to give him satisfaction. And we have come to-night, milor, to ask
  you kindly to name your own representatives so that we may arrange the details
  of this encounter in the manner pre-eminently satisfactory to M. le Comte
  de Stainville, since he is the aggrieved party.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually M. de Belle-Isle had raised his voice. His feeling of bashfulness
  had entirely left him and he felt not a little wrathful at this strange <i>r&ocirc;le</i> which
  he was being made to play. It was quite unheard of that a gentleman who had
  so grossly insulted another, as Lord Eglinton had insulted M. de Stainville,
  should require such lengthy explanations as to what the next course of events
  would necessarily be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore, milor,&rdquo; he continued with some acerbity as Lord
  Eglinton had vouchsafed no reply to his tirade, &ldquo;we pray you to name
  your seconds to us, without delay, so that we may no longer intrude upon
  your privacy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I need not do that, M. le Marquis,&rdquo; said milor quietly. &ldquo;I
  require no seconds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No seconds?&rdquo; gasped the two gentlemen with one breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not going to fight M. de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If Lord Eglinton had suddenly declared his intention of dethroning King
  Louis and placing the crown of France on his own head, he could not more
  have astonished his two interlocutors. Both M. de Belle-Isle and M. de Lugeac
  were in fact absolutely speechless: in all their vast experience of Court
  life such a situation had never occurred before, and literally neither of
  them knew exactly how to deal with it. M. de Lugeac, young and arrogant,
  was the first to recover his presence of mind. Like his successful relative
  Jeanne Poisson de Pompadour he had been born in the slums of Paris, his exalted
  fortune, following so quickly in the wake of the ex-victualler&rsquo;s wife,
  had given him an assurance and an amount of impudence which the older de
  Belle-Isle lacked, and which stood him in good stead in the present crisis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we to look on this as a formal refusal, milor?&rdquo; he now
  asked boldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will not give M. le Comte de Stainville the satisfaction usually
  agreed upon between men of honour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not fight M. de Stainville,&rdquo; repeated milor quietly. &ldquo;I
  am busy with other things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But milor,&rdquo; here interposed M. de Belle-Isle testily: &ldquo;you
  cannot have reflected on the consequences of such an act, which I myself
  at this moment would hardly dare to characterize.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Lord Eglinton with seeming
  irrelevance, &ldquo;but is there any necessity for prolonging this interview?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; sneered M. de Lugeac. &ldquo;It is not our business
  to comment on milor&rsquo;s conduct . . . at present,&rdquo; he added with
  audacious significance.</p>
  <p>But M. de Belle-Isle, who, in spite of his undignified adherence to the
  Pompadour and her faction, was a sprig of the old noblesse of France, was
  loath to see the humiliation of a high-born gentleman&mdash;whatever his
  faults might be&mdash;before such an upstart as de Lugeac. A kindly instinct,
  not altogether unexplainable, caused him to say encouragingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me assure you, milor&mdash;though perhaps in this I am overstepping
  my official powers&mdash;that M. le Comte de Stainville has no desire to
  deal harshly with you. The fact that he is the most noted swordsman in France
  may perhaps be influencing you at this moment, but will you trust to my old
  experience when I assure you that M. le Comte&rsquo;s noted skill is your
  very best safeguard? He will be quite content to inflict a slight punishment
  on you&mdash;being a past master with his sword he can do that easily, without
  causing you graver injury. I am telling you this in confidence of course,
  because I know that these are his intentions. Moreover he starts on an important
  journey to-morrow and would propose a very brief encounter with you at dawn,
  in one of the spinneys of the Park. A mere scratch, I assure you, you need
  fear no more. Less he could not in all honour concede.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A whimsical smile played round the corners of milor&rsquo;s mouth, chasing
  momentarily the graver expression of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your assurance is more than kind, M. de Belle-Isle,&rdquo; he said
  with perfect courtesy, &ldquo;but I can only repeat what I said just now,
  that I will not fight M. de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And instead of repeating what I said just now, milor . . .&rdquo; said
  de Lugeac with a wicked leer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will elect to hold your tongue,&rdquo; said M. de Belle-Isle
  authoritatively, placing his hand on the younger man&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
  <p>De Lugeac, who lived in perpetual fear of doing or saying something which
  would inevitably betray his plebeian origin, meekly obeyed M. de Belle-Isle&rsquo;s
  command. The latter, though very bewildered, would be sure to know the correct
  way in which gentlemen should behave under these amazing circumstances.</p>
  <p>Lord Eglinton standing beside his secr&eacute;taire, his face in shadow,
  was obviously waiting for these intruders to go. M. de Belle-Isle shrugged
  his shoulders partly in puzzlement, partly in contempt; then he nodded casually
  to milor, turned on his heel, and walked out of the doorway into the octagonal
  room beyond, whilst M. de Lugeac imitated as best he could the careless nod
  and the look of contempt of his older friend. M. Achille stepping forward
  now closed the study doors behind the two gentlemen, shutting out the picture
  of that grave, haughty man who had just played the part of coward with such
  absolute perfection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! these English!&rdquo; said young de Lugeac, as he made the gesture
  of spitting on the ground. &ldquo;I had not believed it, <i>par tous les
  diables!</i> had I not heard with mine own ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But de Belle-Isle gravely shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me the young man is only putting off the evil day. His skin
  will have to be tough indeed if he can put up with . . . well! with what
  he will get when this business becomes known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it will become known,&rdquo; asserted de Lugeac spitefully. He
  had always hated what he called the English faction. Madame Lydie always
  snubbed him unmercifully, and milor had hitherto most conveniently ignored
  his very existence. &ldquo;By G&mdash;d I hope that my glove will be the
  first to touch his cheek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh!&mdash;sh!&mdash;sh!&rdquo; admonished de Belle-Isle, nodding
  toward Achille who was busy with the candelabrum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! what do I care,&rdquo; retorted the other; &ldquo;had you not
  restrained me I&rsquo;d have called him a dirty coward then and there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That had been most incorrect, my good Lugeac,&rdquo; rejoined de
  Belle-Isle drily, and wilfully ignoring the language which, in moments of
  passion, so plainly betrayed the vulgar origin. &ldquo;The right to insult
  Lord Eglinton belongs primarily to Gaston de Stainville, and afterward only
  to his friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And although M. le Marquis de Belle-Isle expressed himself in more elegant
  words than his plebeian friend, there was none the less spite and evil intent
  in the expression of his face as he spoke.</p>
  <p>Then giving a sign to Achille to precede them with the light, the two representatives
  of M. le Comte de Stainville finally strode out of the apartments of the
  ex-Comptroller General of Finance.</p>
  <p>M. Durand, with his bulky books and his papers under his arms, followed
  meekly, repeatedly shaking his head.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  The Final Disappointment</b></h2>
  <p>Lydie waited a few moments while her father&rsquo;s brisk steps died away
  along the stone-flagged corridors. In the silence of the evening, the quietude
  which rested on this distant portion of the palace, she could hear his brief
  word of command to the valet who had been stationed in the antechamber; then
  the Duke&rsquo;s quick, alert descent down the marble staircase, and finally
  the call for his coach oft repeated, when he reached the terrace and began
  skirting the building on his way to the main paved yard, where, no doubt,
  his horses were awaiting his return.</p>
  <p>When everything in and around the palace seemed quiet again, Lydie rang
  for her maid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dark hood and cloak,&rdquo; she ordered as soon as the girl appeared,
  and speaking very rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Marquise goes out again?&rdquo; asked the maid a little
  anxiously, seeing that the hour was late and she herself very sleepy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only within the palace,&rdquo; replied Lydie. &ldquo;Quick, girl!
  the cloak!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Within two or three minutes she was enveloped from head to foot in a cloak
  of dark woollen material, that effectually hid the beautiful gown beneath.
  Then she bade the girl wait for her in her boudoir, and, not heeding the
  latter&rsquo;s anxious protestations, she walked quickly out of the room.</p>
  <p>The corridors and reception halls were now quite deserted. Even from the
  main building of the palace, where the King himself was wont to sup copiously
  and long, there no longer came the faintest echo of revelry, of laughter
  or of music. The vast ch&acirc;teau built at the cost of a nation&rsquo;s
  heart&rsquo;s blood, kept up at the cost of her tears and her humiliation,
  now lay wrapped in sleep.</p>
  <p>In this remote West Wing the silence was almost oppressive. From her own
  apartments Lydie could reach those occupied by milor, without going through
  the ante-chamber and corridors, where a few night-watchmen were always stationed.
  Thus she could pass unperceived; a dark, ghost-like figure, silent and swift,
  gliding through an enchanted castle, inhabited mayhap only by a sleeping
  beauty and her Court. From outside not a sound, save the occasional hoot
  of an owl or the flap of a bat&rsquo;s wings against the projecting masonry.</p>
  <p>Lydie drew her cloak closely round her figure; though the August night was
  hot and heavy with the acrid scent of late summer flowers she felt an inward
  shivering, whilst her temples throbbed and her eyes seemed made of glowing
  charcoal. A few more rooms to traverse, a few moments longer wherein to keep
  her trembling knees from giving way beneath her, and she would be in milor&rsquo;s
  rooms.</p>
  <p>She was a little astonished to find them just as deserted as the rest of
  the palace. The great audience chamber with its monumental bed, the antechamber
  wherein M. Durand&rsquo;s wizened figure always sat enthroned behind the
  huge secr&eacute;taire, and the worthy Baptiste himself was wont to hold
  intrusive callers at bay, all these rooms were empty, silent and sombre.</p>
  <p>At last she reached the octagonal room, out of which opened the study. Here,
  too, darkness reigned supreme save for a thin streak of light which gleamed,
  thin and weird, from beneath the study door. Darkness itself fought with
  absolute stillness. Lydie came forward, walking as if in her sleep.</p>
  <p>She called to milor&rsquo;s valet: &ldquo;Achille!&rdquo; but only in a
  whisper, lest milor from within should hear. Then as there was no sound,
  no movement, she called once more:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Achille! is milor still awake? Achille! are you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had raised her voice a little, thinking the man might be asleep. But
  no sound answered her, save from outside the cry of a bird frightened by
  some midnight prowler.</p>
  <p>Then she walked up to the door. There behind it, in that inner sanctum hung
  with curtains of dull gold, the man still sat whom she had so often, so determinedly
  wronged, and who had wounded her to-night with a cruelty and a surety of
  hand which had left her broken of spirit, bruised of heart, a suffering and
  passionate woman. She put her hand on the knob of the door. Nothing stirred
  within; milor was writing mayhap! Perhaps he had dropped asleep! And Gaston
  preparing to ride to Le Havre in order to send the swiftest ship to do its
  deed of treachery!</p>
  <p>No! no! anything but that!</p>
  <p>At this moment Lydie had nerved herself to endure every rebuff, to suffer
  any humiliation, to throw herself at her husband&rsquo;s feet, embrace his
  knees if need be, beg, pray and entreat for money, for help, anything that
  might even now perhaps avert the terrible catastrophe.</p>
  <p>Boldly now she knocked at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor! milor! open! . . . it is I! . . . ! Lydie. . . . !&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as there was no answer from within she knocked louder still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor! Milor! awake! Milor! in the name of Heaven I entreat you to
  let me speak with you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first she had thought that he slept, then that obstinate resentment caused
  him to deny her admittance. She tried to turn the knob of the door, but it
  did not yield.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor! Milor!&rdquo; she cried again, and then again.</p>
  <p>Naught but silence was the reply.</p>
  <p>Excitement grew upon her now, a febrile nervousness which caused her to
  pull at the lock, to bruise her fingers against the gilt ornaments of the
  panel, whilst her voice, hoarse and broken with sobs, rent with its echoes
  the peace and solemnity of the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor! Milor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had fallen on her knees, exhausted mentally and physically, the blood
  beating against her temples until the blackness around her seemed to have
  become a vivid red. In her ear was a sound like that of a tempestuous sea
  breaking against gigantic rocks, with voices calling at intervals, voices
  of dying men, loudly accusing her of treachery. The minutes were speeding
  by! Anon would come the dawn when Gaston would to horse, bearing the hideous
  message which would mean her lifelong infamy and the death of those who trusted
  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor! milor! awake!&rdquo; She now put her lips to the keyhole,
  breathing the words through the tiny orifice, hoping that he would hear. &ldquo;Gaston
  will start at dawn . . . They will send <i>Le Monarque</i>, and she is ready
  to put to sea . . . Milor! your friend is in deadly peril. . . ! I entreat
  you to let me enter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She beat her hands against the door, wounding her delicate flesh. She was
  not conscious of what she was doing. A mystic veil divided her reasoning
  powers from that terrible mental picture which glowed before her through
  the blood-red darkness. The lonely shore, the angry sea, the French ship <i>Le
  Monarque</i> flying the pennant of traitors!</p>
  <p>Then suddenly an astonished and deeply horrified voice broke in upon her
  ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Marquise, in the name of Heaven! Madame la Marquise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She heard quick footsteps behind her, and left off hammering against the
  door, left off screaming and moaning, but she had not the power to raise
  herself from her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; came in respectful, yet frightened accents, &ldquo;will
  Madame la Marquise deign to allow me to raise her&mdash;I fear Madame la
  Marquise is not well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She recognized the voice of Achille, milor&rsquo;s valet, yet it never entered
  her mind to feel ashamed at being found by a lacquey, thus kneeling before
  her husband&rsquo;s door. The worthy Achille was very upset. Etiquette forbade
  him to touch Madame la Marquise, but could he leave her there? in that position?
  He advanced timidly. His behaviour was superlatively correct even in this
  terrible emergency, and there was nothing in his deferential attitude to
  indicate that he thought anything abnormal had occurred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I heard Madame la Marquise calling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
  I thought perhaps Madame la Marquise would wish to speak with milor . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at the word she quickly interrupted him; rising to her feet even as
  she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes . . . ! milor . . . I do wish to speak with him . . . open
  the door, Achille . . . quick . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The door is locked on the outside, Madame la Marquise, but I have
  the key by me,&rdquo; said M. Achille gravely. &ldquo;I had fortunately recollected
  that mayhap milor had forgotten to put out the lights, and would in any case
  have come to see that all was safe . . . if Madame la Marquise will deign
  to permit me . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a little difficult to reconcile utmost respect of movement and demeanour
  with the endeavour to open the door against which Madame la Marquise was
  still standing. However, everything that was deferential and correct was
  possible to Monsieur Achille; he fitted the key in the lock and the next
  moment had thrown the door wide open, whilst he himself stood immediately
  aside to enable Madame la Marquise to enter.</p>
  <p>Four candles were burning in one of the candelabra; milor had evidently
  forgotten to extinguish them. Everything else in the room was perfectly tidy.
  On the secr&eacute;taire there were two or three heavy books similar to those
  Monsieur Durand usually carried about with him when he had to interview milor,
  also the inkpot and sand-well, with two or three quills methodically laid
  on a silver tray. One window must have been open behind the drawn curtains,
  for the heavy damask hangings waved gently in the sudden current of air,
  caused by the opening of the door. The candles too, flickered weirdly in
  the draught. In the centre of the room was the armchair on which Lydie had
  sat a while ago, the cushion of red embroidery which milor had put to her
  back, and below the little footstool covered in gold brocade on which her
  foot had rested . . . a while ago.</p>
  <p>And beside the secr&eacute;taire his own empty chair, and on the table the
  spot where his hand had rested, white and slightly tremulous, when she proffered
  her self-accusation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor?&rdquo; she murmured inquiringly, turning glowing eyes, dilated
  with the intensity of disappointment and despair on the impassive face of
  Achille, &ldquo;milor . . . ? where is milor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor has been gone some little time, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; replied
  Achille.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone? Whither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know, Madame la Marquise . . . Milor did not tell me . .
  . Two gentlemen called to see him at about ten o&rsquo;clock; as soon as
  they had gone milor asked for his outdoor clothes and Hector booted and spurred
  him . . . whilst I dressed his hair and tied his cravat . . . Milor has been
  gone about half an hour, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough . . . that will do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That is all that she contrived to say. This final disappointment had been
  beyond the endurance of her nerves. Physically now she completely broke down,
  a mist gathered before her eyes, the candles seemed to flicker more and more
  weirdly until their lights assumed strange ghoul-like shapes which drew nearer
  to her and nearer; faces in the gloom grinned at her and seemed to mock,
  the walls of the room closed in around her, her senses reeled, her very brain
  felt as if it throbbed with pain, and without a cry or moan, only with one
  long sigh of infinite weariness, she sank lifeless to the ground.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
  The Dawn</b></h2>
  <p>M. le Comte de Stainville only shrugged his shoulders when M. de Belle-Isle
  and young de Lugeac brought him milor&rsquo;s reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said with a sneer, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have to fight
  me later on or I&rsquo;ll hound him out of France! Never fear, gentlemen,
  we&rsquo;ll have our meed of fun very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the whole Gaston was not sorry that this stupid so-called &ldquo;affair
  of honour&rdquo; would not force him to rise before dawn. He had no special
  ill-will against <i>le petit Anglais</i>, for whom he had always tried to
  cultivate a modicum of contempt. He had not always succeeded in this praiseworthy
  endeavour, for milor as a rule chose to ignore M. de Stainville, as far as,
  and often more than, courtesy permitted.</p>
  <p>The two men had not often met since the memorable evening when milor snatched
  the golden prize which Gaston had so clumsily cast aside. Their tastes were
  very dissimilar, and so was their entourage. Milor was officially considered
  to belong to the Queen&rsquo;s set, whilst Gaston clung to the more entertaining
  company of Madame de Pompadour and her friends; nor had M. de Stainville
  had the bad grace to interfere with his wife&rsquo;s obvious predeliction
  for Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s company.</p>
  <p>The memorable day which was just drawing to its close had seen many changes&mdash;changes
  that were almost upheavals of old traditions and of habitual conditions of
  court life. Gaston had deceived and then hideously outraged the woman whom
  long ago he had already wronged. A year ago she had humiliated him, had snatched
  from him the golden prize which his ambition had coveted, and which she made
  him understand that he could not obtain without her. To-day had been his
  hour; he had dragged her down to the very mire in which he himself had grovelled,
  he had laid her pride to dust and shaken the pinnacle of virtue and integrity
  on which she stood.</p>
  <p>That she had partly revenged herself by a public affront against Ir&egrave;ne
  mattered little to Gaston. He had long ago ceased to care for <i>la belle
  brune de Bordeaux</i>, the beautiful girl who had enchained his early affections
  and thereby become a bar to his boundless ambition. The social ostracism&mdash;applicable
  only by a certain set of puritanical d&eacute;votes&mdash;and the disdain
  of Queen Marie Leszcynska which his wife might have to endure would be more
  than compensated by the gratitude of Pompadour and of His Majesty himself,
  for the services rendered by Gaston in the cause of the proffered English
  millions.</p>
  <p>But for him the expedition against the Stuart prince could never have been
  undertaken; at any rate, it had been fraught with great difficulties; delays
  and subsequent failure would probably have resulted. Gaston de Stainville
  felt sure that in the future he could take care that the King should never
  forget his services.</p>
  <p>After his wife&rsquo;s indiscreet outburst he feared once more for the success
  of the plan. Remembering Lydie&rsquo;s reliance on <i>Le Monarque</i> and
  her commander, he declared himself prepared to start for Le Havre immediately.
  He was quite ready to display that endurance and enthusiasm, in the breakneck
  ride across the fields of Normandy, which Lydie had thought to find in him
  for the good of a noble cause.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville&rsquo;s pockets were always empty; the two millions
  which the King had promised him would be more than welcome. His Majesty had
  even offered to supplement these by an additional half million if <i>Le Monarque</i> sailed
  out of Le Havre before sunset on the morrow.</p>
  <p>The incident of the duel with milor would have delayed matters and&mdash;who
  knows&mdash;perhaps have made that pleasant half million somewhat problematical.
  Therefore Gaston received the news of the refusal with a sardonic grin, but
  not with real impatience.</p>
  <p>He felt really no great ill-will toward Lord Eglinton; but for that incident
  when he was forcibly made to measure his length on the parquet floor, Gaston
  would have willingly extended a condescending hand to the man whose wife
  he had so infamously wronged.</p>
  <p>The incident itself had angered him only to the extent of desiring to inflict
  a physical punishment on milor. Sure of his own wrist as the most perfect
  swordsman in France, he had fondled the thought of slicing off a finger or
  two, mayhap a thumb, from the hand of <i>le petit Anglais</i>, or better
  still of gashing milor&rsquo;s face across nose and cheek so as to mar for
  ever those good looks which the ladies of Versailles had so openly admired.</p>
  <p>Well! all these pleasant little occurrences could happen yet. M. de Stainville
  was quite sure that on his return from Le Havre he could provoke the Englishman
  to fight. Milor might be something of a coward&mdash;obviously he was one,
  else he had accepted so mild a challenge&mdash;but he could not always refuse
  to fight in the face of certain provocation, which would mean complete social
  ruin if disregarded.</p>
  <p>The hour was late by the time Gaston de Stainville had bade good-night to
  Belle-Isle and Lugeac. Together the three men had drunk copiously, had laughed
  much and sneered continually at the pusillanimous Englishman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This comes of allowing all these aliens to settle amongst us,&rdquo; said
  de Lugeac impudently; &ldquo;soon there will be neither honour nor chivalry
  left in France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon de Stainville and Belle-Isle, both of whom bore ancient, aristocratic
  names, bethought themselves that it was time to break up the little party
  and to turn their backs on this arrogant gutter-snipe.</p>
  <p>The three men separated at midnight. De Lugeac had a room in the palace,
  and Stainville and Belle-Isle repaired to their respective lodgings in the
  little town itself.</p>
  <p>Soon after dawn Gaston de Stainville was on horseback. He started alone,
  for that extra half million was dangling before his eyes, and he was afraid
  that companionship&mdash;even that of a servant&mdash;might cause unlooked-for
  delay. He had a hundred and eighty leagues by road and field to cover, and
  soon the day would become very hot. He meant to reach Le Havre before five
  o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon; within an hour after that, he could have
  handed over his instructions to Captain Barre, and seen <i>Le Monarque</i> unfurl
  her sails and glide gracefully out of the harbour: an argosy anon to be laden
  with golden freight.</p>
  <p>The little town of Versailles had scarce opened its eyes to the new day
  when the clink of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on her cobble stones roused her from
  her morning sleep.</p>
  <p>A few farmers, bringing in their produce from their gardens, gazed with
  keen interest at the beautiful animal and her gallant rider. The hour was
  indeed early for such a fine gentleman to be about.</p>
  <p>Soon the rough paving of the town was left behind; the sun, who at first
  had hidden his newly-awakened glory behind a bank of clouds, now burnt his
  way through these heavy veils, and threw across the morning sky living flames
  of rose, of orange, and of vivid gold and tipped the towers and spires of
  distant Paris with innumerable tongues of fire.</p>
  <p>Far away the clock of Notre Dame tolled the hour of five. Gaston cursed
  inwardly. It was later than he thought, later than he had intended to make
  a start. That business of the duel had kept him up longer than usual and
  he had felt lazy and tired in the morning. Now he would have to make top
  speed, and he did not feel as alert, nor so well prepared for the fatigues
  of a long day&rsquo;s ride, as he would have been two years ago, before the
  enervating dissipations of court life at Versailles had undermined the activity
  of his youth.</p>
  <p>Fortunately the ground was soft and dry, the air keen and pure, and Gaston
  spurred his horse to a canter across the fields.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
  The Ride</b></h2>
  <p>It is one hundred and fifty leagues from Versailles to the harbour of Le
  Havre as the crow flies, one hundred and eighty most like by road and across
  fields.</p>
  <p>Gaston had twelve hours in which to cover the ground, a good horse, and
  the enthusiasm born of empty pockets when two and a half million livres loom
  temptingly at the end of the journey.</p>
  <p>The fields, after the corn harvest, were excellent for a gallop, yielding
  just sufficiently to the mare&rsquo;s hoofs to give her a pleasant foothold,
  but not in any way spongy, with good stubble to give resistance and the sandy
  soil below to prevent the slightest jar. Riding under such conditions, in
  the cool hours of the morning, was distinctly pleasant.</p>
  <p>Gaston reached Nantes soon after seven, having covered close on forty leagues
  of his journey without unduly tiring Belle Amie. He was a good rider and
  knew how to ease her, and there was Arab blood in her. She made light of
  the work, and enjoyed her gallops, being of the breed that never shows fatigue,
  own daughter to Jedran who had carried Maurice de Saxe on his famous ride
  from Paris to Saargemund, three hundred leagues in eighteen hours.</p>
  <p>At Nantes, Stainville partook of a frugal breakfast, and Belle Amie had
  a rest and a mouthful of corn. He was again to horse within half an hour,
  crossing the Seine here by the newly constructed stone bridge, thence on
  toward Elboeuf. By ten o&rsquo;clock the sun was high in the heavens and
  was pouring heat like molten lead down on horse and rider. Progress had become
  much slower. Several halts had to be made at tiny wayside inns for a cooling
  drink and a rub down for Belle Amie. The enjoyment had gone out of the ride.
  It was heavy, arduous work, beside which despatch riding, with message of
  life and death, was mere child&rsquo;s play.</p>
  <p>But this was not a case of life and death, but of that which was far dearer
  to Gaston than life without it. Money! money at the end of it all! even if
  Belle Amie dropped on the roadside and he himself had to cover the rest of
  the distance on foot. An extra half million if <i>La Monarque</i> set sail
  before sunset to-day.</p>
  <p>At Rouen, horse and rider had to part company. Belle Amie, who had covered
  close on a hundred leagues, and most of it in the full glare of the midday
  sun, wanted at least a couple of hours rest if she was to get to Le Havre
  at all, and this her rider was unwilling to give her. At the posting hostelry,
  which stands immediately at the rear of the cathedral, Stainville bargained
  for a fresh horse, and left Belle Amie in charge of mine host to be tended
  and cared for against his return, probably on the morrow.</p>
  <p>Here, too, he partook of a light midday meal whilst the horse was being
  got ready for him. A good, solid Normandy mare this time, a perfect contrast
  to Belle Amie, short and thick in the legs, with a broad crupper, and a sleepy
  look in her eye. But she was a comfortable mount as Gaston soon found out,
  with a smooth, even canter, and though her stride was short, she got over
  the ground quickly enough. It was still very hot, but the roads beyond Rouen
  were sandy and light; the lanes were quite stoneless and shaded by tall trees;
  the Normandy mare settled down along them to an easy amble. She had not the
  spirit of Belle Amie but she made up in stolidity what she had lacked in
  swiftness. Gaston&rsquo;s first impatience at the slowness of her gait soon
  yielded to content, for she needed no checking, and urging being useless&mdash;since
  she could go no faster&mdash;the rider was soon able to let his mind rest
  and even to sink into semi-somnolence, trusting himself to the horse entirely.</p>
  <p>At half-past five the towers of Notre Dame du Havre were in sight; an hour
  later than Gaston had dared to hope, but still far from the hour of sunset,
  and if he could infuse a sufficiency of enthusiasm into the commander of <i>Le
  Monarque</i>, the gallant ship could still negotiate the harbour before dusk,
  the tide being favourable, and be out in the open ere the first stars appeared
  in the heavens.</p>
  <p>The little seaport town, whose tortuous, unpaved, and narrow streets were
  ankle deep in slimy mud in spite of the persistent heat and dryness of the
  day, appeared to Gaston like the golden city of his dreams. On his left the
  wide mouth of the Seine, with her lonely shore beyond, was lost in the gathering
  mist, which rose rapidly now after the intense heat of the day. On his right,
  a few isolated houses were dotted here and there, built of mud, thatched
  and plastered over, and with diminutive windows not more than a few inches
  square, because of the tax which was heavy; they testified to the squalor
  and misery of their inhabitants, a few families earning an uncertain livelihood
  with their nets. Soon along the length of the river, as it gradually widened
  toward its mouth, a few isolated craft came to view; fishing boats these
  mostly, with here and there a graceful brigantine laden with timber, and
  a few barges which did a precarious coasting-trade with salted fish and the
  meagre farm produce of the environs.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Stainville took no heed of these, though the scene&mdash;if somewhat
  mournful and desolate&mdash;had a certain charm of rich colouring and hazy
  outline in the glow of the afternoon sun. The heat had altogether abated,
  and the damp which rose from the spongy soil, peculiar to the bed of the
  river, was already making itself felt. Gaston shivered beneath the light
  cloth coat which he had donned in the morning, in view of the fatigues of
  a hot summer&rsquo;s day. His eyes peered anxiously ahead and to the left
  of him. His mare, who had borne him stolidly for over five hours, was quite
  ready to give way; there was no Arab blood in her to cause her to go on until
  she dropped. She had settled down to a very slow jog-trot, which was supremely
  uncomfortable to the rider, whose tired back could scarcely endure this continuous
  jar. Fortunately the straggling, outlying portions of the townlet were already
  far behind; the little mud houses appeared quite frequently now, and from
  them, wizened figures came out to the doorway; women in ragged kirtles and
  children half-naked but for a meagre shift, gazed, wide-eyed, at the mud-bespattered
  cavalier and his obviously worn-out mount.</p>
  <p>From the fine old belfry the chime had long tolled the half hour. Gaston
  vainly tried to spur the mare to a final effort. She had reached a stage
  of fatigue when blows would not have quickened her steps, whilst her rider,
  roused from his own somnolent weariness, was suddenly alert and eager. Goal
  was indeed in sight. The mud huts even had been left behind, and one or two
  stone houses testified to the importance of the town and the well-being of
  its inhabitants; the first inn&mdash;a miserable wooden construction quite
  uninviting even after a day&rsquo;s ride&mdash;had already been passed. Ahead
  was the church of Notre Dame, the fish market, and the residence of the governor;
  beyond were some low wooden buildings, suggestive of barracks, whilst the
  Seine, ever widening until her further shore was finally lost in the mist,
  now showed an ever-varying panorama of light and heavy craft upon her breast;
  brigantines, and fishing boats, and the new-fashioned top-sail schooners,
  and far ahead, majestic and sedate, one or two three-deckers of His Majesty&rsquo;s
  own navy.</p>
  <p>Gaston strained his eyes, wondering which of these was <i>Le Monarque</i>!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
 &ldquo;Le Monarque&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A few minutes later he had reached the principal inn of the town, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Auberge
  des Trois Matelots,&rdquo; immediately opposite the rough wooden jetty, and
  from the bay window of which Gaston immediately thought that a magnificent
  view must be obtainable of the stretch of the river and the English Channel
  far away.</p>
  <p>He turned into the gate. The house itself was low, one-storied only, and
  built entirely of wood round a central court-yard, which was as deep in slime
  as the rest of the town of Le Havre. Opposite Gaston as he rode in, were
  some primitive stablings, and on his right some equally primitive open sheds;
  the remaining two sides apparently stood for the main portion of the building,
  as several doors gave upon a covered verandah, to which some four or five
  steps gave access.</p>
  <p>A weary-eyed ostler in a blue blouse and huge wooden sabots, from which
  bunches of straw protruded at the heel came leisurely forward when Gaston
  drew rein. He seemed to have emerged from nowhere in particular, risen out
  of the mud mayhap, but he held the mare none too clumsily when M. le Comte
  dismounted.</p>
  <p>The next moment a portly figure appeared in one of the doorways under the
  verandah, clad precisely like the ostler, save for the gorgeous scarlet kerchief
  round the gargantuan neck, whilst another, equally bright in hue, peeped
  out of the pocket of the blouse.</p>
  <p>Above the scarlet neckerchief a round face, red as a Normandy apple, was
  turned meditatively on the mud-stained cavalier, whilst a pair of small,
  beady eyes blinked drowsily at the afternoon sun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See that the mare gets a good rub down at once, then a feed of corn
  with a dash of eau-de-vie in it, a litter of straw, and a drink of water;
  she is done to death,&rdquo; said Gaston, peremptorily to the sleepy-looking
  ostler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be round in a quarter of an hour to see if she
  is comfortable, and give you a taste of my whip if she is not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ostler did not reply, neither did he touch his forelock in token of
  obedience. He smothered a yawn and with slow, dragging steps he led the over-tired
  mare toward the rough stabling in the rear. Gaston then turned toward the
  verandah and to the few wooden steps which led up to the doorway, wherein
  the apple-faced man still stood with his hands behind him, drowsily blinking
  at the unexpected visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you the innkeeper?&rdquo; asked Gaston curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; replied the other with great deliberation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall want a good room for the night, and a well-cooked supper.
  See to it at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mine host&rsquo;s placidity gave way somewhat at these peremptory orders,
  which were accompanied by a loud and significant tapping of a whip across
  a riding boot. But the placidity did not yield to eagerness, only to a certain
  effort at sulky protest, as Gaston, having mounted the steps, now stood facing
  him in his own doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My house is full, M&rsquo;sieu . . .&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am on the King&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; shouted Gaston now with
  angry impatience, &ldquo;so none of this nonsense. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently mine host not only understood, but thought it best to obey with
  as good grace as he could muster. He stepped aside still somewhat grudgingly,
  and allowed Gaston de Stainville to enter: but he did not condescend to bow
  nor did he bid M&rsquo;sieu the visitor welcome in his house.</p>
  <p>Gaston however was not minded to notice the fat man&rsquo;s sulky temper.
  The moodiness of provincial innkeepers had become proverbial in France; they
  seemed to look upon all guests, who brought money into their pockets, as
  arrogant intruders, and treated them accordingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See to a decent supper at once,&rdquo; repeated de Stainville now
  with that peremptoriness which he knew would alone ensure civility, &ldquo;and
  send a wench into my room to see that it is properly aired, and that clean
  linen is put upon the bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The warning was no doubt necessary, judging by the appearance of the room
  in which Gaston now found himself. It was low and stuffy in the extreme.
  He was conscious of nothing else for the moment, as only two diminutive windows,
  hermetically closed, admitted a tiny modicum of light through four dirty
  and thick panes of rough glass. On the left there was a door evidently leading
  to another and larger room from which&mdash;as this door was ajar&mdash;came
  the sound of voices and also suffocating gusts of very pungent tobacco.</p>
  <p>Obviously there was some light and air in that further room, whereas here
  it seemed to Gaston as if only cave-dwellers and moles could live and breathe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had best serve my supper in there,&rdquo; he said, pointing with
  his riding whip toward that half-open door, and without waiting for the protests
  which mine host was obviously preparing himself to make, he strode boldly
  toward it and pushed it fully open.</p>
  <p>The place was certainly very different to the one which he had just quitted.
  The floor was strewn with clean white sand, and, though the air was thick
  with the fumes of that same pungent tobacco, which already had offended Gaston&rsquo;s
  nostrils, it was not hopelessly unpleasant, as the deep and square oriel
  window at the extreme end of this long, low room was wide open, freely admitting
  the sweet, salt breeze which blew straight from the English Channel; affording
  too&mdash;as Gaston had originally surmised&mdash;a magnificent view of a
  panorama which embraced the mouth of the Seine, the rough harbour and tiny
  jetty, with the many small craft lying at anchor on the calm bosom of the
  river, and the graceful schooners and majestic three-deckers further away,
  all lit by the slanting rays of the slowly-sinking sun.</p>
  <p>Gaston, without hesitation, walked straight up to a bench and trestle table,
  which to his pleasurable surprise he found was unoccupied. These were just
  inside the bay of the window, and he deliberately placed his hat, coat and
  whip upon the table in token that he took possession of it. Then he once
  more turned to mine host, who, much torn between respect for a man who travelled
  on the King&rsquo;s business&mdash;a nobleman mayhap&mdash;and pride of peasant
  at contact with an unwelcome visitor, had slowly followed Gaston, lolling
  with that peculiar gait which betrays the ex-sailor whilst firm if deferential
  protest was writ all over his rubicund countenance.</p>
  <p>Jean Marie Palisson was born at Le Havre; he had been <i>armateur</i> ere
  the welcome death of a relative put him in possession of the most frequented
  inn in the town together with a very comfortable competence, and the best
  furnished cellars this side of Rouen. He greatly resented the appearance
  of a stranger in the midst of his usual habitu&eacute;s, which distinguished
  circle embraced M. le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral commanding the fortress, M. the
  Military Governor of the port, M. the Civil Governor of the town, MM. the
  commanders on His Majesty&rsquo;s ships, not to speak of M. le Maire, and
  M. le D&eacute;put&eacute; of the Parliament of Rouen, in fact all the notabilities
  and dignitaries of the town and the harbour.</p>
  <p>These gentlemen were wont to assemble in this the best room of &ldquo;Les
  Trois Matelots&rdquo; at five o&rsquo;clock, &ldquo;l&rsquo;heure de l&rsquo;ap&eacute;ritif,&rdquo; when
  eau-de-vie, punch or mulled wine were consumed, in order to coax recalcitrant
  appetites to a pleasurable anticipation of supper. It was an understood thing,
  between the worthy Jean Marie Palisson and his distinguished customers, that
  no strangers were to be admitted within this inner sanctum, save by the vote
  of the majority, nor had it ever occurred before that any one had thus forced
  an entrance past that magic door which mine host guarded with jealous care.</p>
  <p>Now when Gaston thus arrogantly took possession of the best table in the
  best portion of the best room in &ldquo;Les Trois Matelots,&rdquo; Jean Marie
  was so taken aback, and so awed by the masterfulness which could rise to
  such complete disregard of the etiquette pertaining to the social circles
  of Le Havre, that he found himself unable to do aught but shrug his broad
  shoulders at intervals, and blink his beady eyes in token of helpless distress.</p>
  <p>And this in spite of the fact that several pairs of eyebrows were lifted
  in token of pained surprise.</p>
  <p>Gaston was equally unconscious of the disapproval which his entry had evoked,
  as of Jean Marie&rsquo;s want of alacrity in his service. When he entered,
  he noted that the several occupants of the room were gentlemen like himself,
  and he always felt thoroughly at home and unabashed amongst his kind: as
  for the landlord of a tumbledown provincial inn, Gaston thought him quite
  unworthy of close attention. He sat himself down on the edge of the table,
  dangling one well-booted leg with easy nonchalance, and from this elevated
  position he surveyed leisurely and with no small amount of impertinence,
  the company there assembled. He had scarce time to note the scowling looks
  of haughty disapproval which were levelled at him from every side, when the
  door was vigorously pushed open and an aggressively cheerful young man, loud
  of voice, jocose of manner, boisterously entered the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Par ma foi! my worthy Jean Marie,&rdquo; he said in stentorian tones, &ldquo;is
  this the latest fashion in Le Havre? the host not at the door to receive
  his guests? . . . H&eacute;! . . .&rdquo; he added, suddenly realizing the
  presence of a stranger in the room, &ldquo;whom have we here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already, at the first words uttered by the newcomer, Gaston de Stainville
  had jumped to his feet, and as soon as the young man ceased talking, he went
  forward to greet him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None other than Gaston de Stainville, my good Mort&eacute;mar, and
  pleased indeed to look into a friend&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gaston de Stainville!&rdquo; exclaimed the other gaily, &ldquo;<i>par
   tous les diables!</i> but this is a surprise! Who would have thought to
   see you in this damned and God-forsaken hole!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s business, my good Mort&eacute;mar,&rdquo; said Gaston, &ldquo;and
  if you&rsquo;ll forgive me I&rsquo;ll see to it at once and then we&rsquo;ll
  sup together, eh? . . . Palsambleu! and I who thought I&rsquo;d die of ennui
  during this enforced halt on this lonely shore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ennui? perish the thought! Gentlemen,&rdquo; added the young Comte
  de Mort&eacute;mar, with a graceful flourish of the arm which embraced the
  entire company, &ldquo;allow me to present unto you the most accomplished
  cavalier of the day, whom I have the honour to call my friend, and whom I
  hope we will all have the honour to call our guest to-night, M. le Comte
  Gaston Am&eacute;d&eacute; de Stainville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gaston had no cause now to complain of want of welcome. Once the stranger
  duly accredited and presented by a member of the intimate circle, he was
  cheered to the echo. Every one rose to greet him, many pressed forward to
  shake him by the hand: the presence of a cavalier of Versailles with all
  the Court gossip, the little intrigues, the laughable anecdotes which he
  would of necessity bring with him was indeed a veritable God-send to the
  little official world of Le Havre, who spent most of its life in mortal ennui.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for thee, my good Jean Marie,&rdquo; now interposed Mort&eacute;mar
  with mock severity, &ldquo;let me tell thee at once that if within an hour
  this table here doth not groan under the weight of the finest and best cooked
  capon that Normandy can produce, neither I nor these gentlemen here will
  e&rsquo;er darken thy doors again. What say you, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was loudly expressed assent, accompanied by much laughter and vigorous
  clinking of pewter mugs against the deal tables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile,&rdquo; continued Mort&eacute;mar, who seemed
  to have taken the lead in this general desire to bid the visitor a substantial
  welcome, &ldquo;a bowl of punch with half a glass of eau-de-vie and a dozen
  prunes soaked in kirsch therein. Never fear, friend Stainville,&rdquo; he
  added, slapping Gaston boisterously on the shoulder, &ldquo;I tell you mine
  host knows how to brew a bowl of punch, which will send you reeling under
  one of his tables in less than half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A round of applause greeted this cheerful sally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, in that case,&rdquo; said Gaston, on whom the strenuous fatigues
  of the day were telling severely after the preliminary excitement of arrival, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  to my business, ere your good cheer, friend, render me quite helpless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perish the thought of business,&rdquo; retorted Mort&eacute;mar. &ldquo;Your
  head in a bucket of cold water after the punch, and you can meet the most
  astute notary on even ground and beat him at his own game. The punch, knave!&rdquo; he
  shouted to the fat landlord, &ldquo;the punch, this instant, M. le Comte
  de Stainville is wearied and is waiting for refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Gaston&rsquo;s frame of mind was far too grave, his purpose far too
  important, to allow himself to be led into delaying business with Captain
  Barre a moment longer than was necessary. Mort&eacute;mar and his convivial
  friends could not know that half a million livres would be the price paid
  for that bowl of punch, since it might mean an hour&rsquo;s carousing and
  the full of dusk before <i>Le Monarque</i> received her orders. He was deadly
  fatigued undoubtedly, faint too from the heat and want of proper food, but
  when money was at stake Gaston de Stainville always displayed an enthusiasm
  and an amount of courageous endurance worthy of a better cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, my good Mort&eacute;mar, and to you all, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
  now said courteously but firmly, &ldquo;do not, I beseech you, think me churlish
  if I must momentarily refuse your kind hospitality. One glass of eau-de-vie
  to give me a modicum of strength, and I must to my business first. Gentlemen,
  I see by your coats that most of you serve the King in some capacity or other,
  you know as well as I do that the laws which govern the King&rsquo;s commands
  cannot be broken. I will not be gone long, half an hour at most; after that
  I am at your commands, and will be the most grateful as well as the most
  joyous of you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well spoken, friend Stainville,&rdquo; declared Mort&eacute;mar &ldquo;and
  you, Jean Marie, serve a small refreshment to M. le Comte immediately. Nay,
  friend,&rdquo; he added pleasantly, &ldquo;I fear I have been importunate
  . . . &rsquo;twas the joy of seeing so elegant a cavalier grace this unhallowed
  spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Every one nodded approval; as Gaston had surmised, there were soldiers,
  sailors there present, all of whom understood duty and obedience to the King&rsquo;s
  commands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps some of us could be of assistance to M. le Comte de Stainville,&rdquo; suggested
  a grave gentleman who wore His Majesty&rsquo;s colours. &ldquo;If he is a
  stranger at Le Havre he might be glad of help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed well said,&rdquo; spoke another; &ldquo;could one of us here
  accompany you anywhere, Monsieur le Comte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am more than grateful, gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Gaston, to whom
  the host was even now offering a cup of mulled wine. He drank the liquor
  at one draught, then set down the cup ere he spoke further:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And gladly will I accept these kindly offers of assistance,&rdquo; he
  now said. &ldquo;I am indeed a stranger here, and did feel doubtful how I
  could most speedily accomplish my business. I must have speech with Captain
  Barre, gentlemen, commanding His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Le Monarque</i> and
  that with as little delay as possible. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To his intense astonishment he was interrupted by a ringing laugh from his
  friend Mort&eacute;mar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then my good Stainville,&rdquo; said the lively young man, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
  have plenty of time for that bowl of punch, aye! and for getting right royally
  drunk and fully sober again if your business is with Captain Barre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; queried Gaston with a sudden frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Le Monarque</i> sailed out of Le Havre an hour ago; methinks you
  can still see her sails against the evening sun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the young man pointed through the open window out toward the West. Mechanically
  Gaston&rsquo;s eyes followed the direction in which his friend pointed. There,
  far away in the mist-laden distance, a graceful three-decker, with sails
  unfurled, was distinctly visible in the glow of the setting sun. She was
  gaily riding the waves, the soft south-easterly breeze having carried her
  swiftly and lightly already far out to sea.</p>
  <p>Gaston felt an awful dizziness in his head. An icy sweat broke out upon
  his brow, he passed a hand across his eyes for he did not feel that he could
  trust them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is not <i>Le Monarque</i>,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By my faith, but it is,&rdquo; said Mort&eacute;mar, a little perturbed,
  for he had not thought to be conveying evil news. &ldquo;I was bidding her
  captain &lsquo;God-speed&rsquo; myself little more than an hour ago. A gallant
  sailor, and a personal friend,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and he seemed mighty
  glad to get on the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither was he bound?&rdquo; asked Gaston mechanically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! that I do not know. Barre had received secret orders only an
  hour before he started. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But now Gaston felt his senses reeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She must be stopped! . . . she must be stopped!&rdquo; he shouted
  wildly. &ldquo;I have orders for her . . . she must be stopped, at any cost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And breaking through the compact group of his newly found friends he made
  a wild dash for the door.</p>
  <p>But the excitement, the terrible keenness of this disappointment had been
  too much for him, after the strenuous fatigues and the overpowering heat
  of the day. The dizziness turned to an intolerable feeling of sickness, the
  walls of the room spun round and round him, he felt as if a stunning blow
  had been dealt him on the head, and with a final shriek of &ldquo;Stop her!&rdquo; he
  staggered and would have fallen headlong, but that a pair of willing arms
  were there to break his fall.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
  The Stranger</b></h2>
  <p>It was M. des Coutures&mdash;a middle-aged man, military governor of Le
  Havre&mdash;who had caught Gaston de Stainville in his arms when the latter
  all but lost consciousness. A dozen willing pairs of hands were now ready
  to administer to the guest&rsquo;s comforts, from the loosening of his cravat
  to the pulling off of his heavy riding boots.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The mulled wine was too heavy for him,&rdquo; said M. le Maire Valledieu, &ldquo;no
  doubt he had been fasting some hours and his stomach refused to deal with
  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell the kitchen wench to hurry with that supper, Jean Marie,&rdquo; said
  Mort&eacute;mar to mine host, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be himself again when he
  has eaten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a plate of soup ready, bring that,&rdquo; added
  M. Valledieu. &ldquo;Anything&rsquo;s better than an empty paunch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, friends,&rdquo; now murmured Stainville feebly. &ldquo;I
  fear me I must have turned giddy . . . the heat and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was recovering quickly enough. It had been mere dizziness caused by fatigue;
  and then that awful blow which had staggered him physically as well as mentally!
  His newly found friends had dragged him back to the table close to the open
  window: the keen sea-breeze quickly restored him to complete consciousness.</p>
  <p>Already he had turned his head slowly round to watch that fast disappearing
  three-decker, gleaming golden now in the distant haze.</p>
  <p>His argosy which he had hoped to see returning from her voyage laden with
  golden freight! Somehow as first the hulk and then the graceful sails were
  gradually merged into the Western glow, Gaston knew&mdash;by one of those
  inexplainable yet absolutely unerring instincts which baffle the materialist&mdash;that
  all hopes of those coveted millions were vanishing as surely as did the ship
  now from before his gaze. He was still weak in body as well as in mind, and
  it was as if in a dream, that he listened to de Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s carelessly
  given explanations of the event which meant the wreckage of so many fondly
  cherished hopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Barre broke his fast in this very room this morning,&rdquo; said
  the young man lightly, &ldquo;several of these gentlemen here, as well as
  myself, had speech with him. He had no idea then that he would have to start
  on a voyage quite so soon. He left here at eleven o&rsquo;clock and went
  back to his ship. An hour later when I was strolling along the shore I met
  him again. He seemed in a vast hurry and told me in a few curt words that <i>Le
  Monarque</i> had received orders to be under way as soon as the tide permitted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not ask him whither the ship was bound?&rdquo; queried Gaston,
  speaking hoarsely like a man who has been drinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He could not tell me,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;her orders
  were secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know who was the bearer of these secret orders?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but I heard later that a stranger had ridden into Le Havre at
  midday to-day. His mare&mdash;a beautiful creature so I understand&mdash;dropped
  not far from here; she had been ridden to her death, poor thing; and her
  rider, so they say, was near to dropping too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; here interposed a young soldier, &ldquo;he was
  just outside that God-forsaken hole, &lsquo;Le Gros Normand&rsquo; and politely
  asked me if it were the best inn in Le Havre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you told him it was,&rdquo; said des Coutures with a growl, &ldquo;we
  want no stranger here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor do we want Le Havre to have a reputation for dirt and discomfort,&rdquo; corrected
  M. le Maire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I certainly could not allow a gentlemen&mdash;for he was that&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
  lay any wager on it, with any one&mdash;to be made superlatively uncomfortable
  on the broken beds of &lsquo;Le Gros Normand,&rsquo;&rdquo; asserted the
  young soldier hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You advised him to come here?&rdquo; gasped Mort&eacute;mar with
  genuine horror. He was the chief of that clique which desired to exclude,
  with utmost rigour from the sacred precincts of &ldquo;Les Trois Matelots,&rdquo; every
  stranger not properly accredited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma foi! what would you have me do?&rdquo; retorted the other sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did quite right, Lieutenant le Tellier,&rdquo; rejoined M. le
  Maire, who was jealous of the reputation of Le Havre. &ldquo;Gentlemen must
  be under no misapprehension with regard to the refinement and hospitality
  of this town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The entrance of mine host carrying a steaming bowl of soup broke up the
  conversation for awhile. Jean Marie was followed by a fat and jovial-looking
  wench, who quickly spread a white cloth for Monsieur le Comte&rsquo;s supper
  and generally administered to his wants.</p>
  <p>De Mort&eacute;mar, G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Coutures, and M. le Maire
  Valledieu had constituted themselves the nominal hosts of Gaston. They too
  sat round the table, and anon when Jean Marie brought huge jugs of red wine,
  they fell to and entertained their guest, plying him with meat and drink.</p>
  <p>This broke up the company somewhat. The other gentlemen had withdrawn with
  all the respect which Frenchmen always feel for the solemnity of a meal;
  they had once more assumed their old places at the various tables about the
  room. But no one thought yet of returning home: &ldquo;l&rsquo;heure de l&rsquo;ap&eacute;ritif&rdquo; was
  being indefinitely prolonged.</p>
  <p>Conversation naturally drifted back again and again to <i>Le Monarque</i> and
  her secret orders. Every one scented mystery, for was it not strange that
  a noble cavalier like Monsieur le Comte de Stainville should have ridden
  all the way from Versailles on the King&rsquo;s business, in order to have
  speech with the commander of one of His Majesty&rsquo;s own ships, only to
  find that he had been forestalled? The good ship had apparently received
  orders which the King knew naught about, else His Majesty had not sent Monsieur
  de Stainville all this way on a fool&rsquo;s errand.</p>
  <p>Eager, prying eyes watched him as he began to eat and drink, dreamily at
  first, almost drowsily. Obviously he was absorbed in thought. He too must
  be racking his brains as to who the stranger might be who had so unexpectedly
  forestalled him.</p>
  <p>His three genial hosts plied him continually with wine and soon the traces
  of fatigue in him began to yield to his usual alertness and vigour. The well-cooked
  food, the rich liquors were putting life back into his veins. And with renewed
  life came a seething, an ungovernable wrath.</p>
  <p>He had lost a fortune, the gratitude of the King, the goodwill of Pompadour,
  two and a half millions of money through the interference of a stranger!</p>
  <p>He tried to think, to imagine, to argue with himself. Treacherous and false
  himself, he at once suspected treachery. He imagined that some sycophant,
  hanging to the Pompadour&rsquo;s skirts, had succeeded in winning her good
  graces sufficiently to be allowed to do this errand for her, instead of himself.</p>
  <p>Or had the King played him false, and sent another messenger to do the delicate
  business and to share in the spoils?</p>
  <p>Or had Lydie . . . ? But no! this was impossible! What could she have done
  at a late hour of the night? How could she have found a messenger whom she
  could trust? when earlier in the day she had herself admitted that there
  was no one in whom she could confide, and thus turned almost unwillingly
  to the friend of her childhood.</p>
  <p>Jean Marie&rsquo;s favoured customers sat at the various tables sipping
  their eau-de-vie; some had produced dice and cards, whilst others were content
  to loll about, still hoping to hear piquant anecdotes of that distant Court
  of Versailles, toward which they all sighed so longingly.</p>
  <p>But the elegant guest was proving a disappointment. Even after the second
  bumper of wine Gaston de Stainville&rsquo;s tongue had not loosened. He was
  speculating on the identity of that mysterious stranger, and would not allow
  his moodiness to yield to the joys of good cheer. To-morrow he would have
  to ride back to Versailles hardly more leisurely than he had come, for he
  must find out the truth of how he came to be forestalled. But he could not
  start before dawn, even though fiery impatience and wrath burned in his veins.</p>
  <p>To all inquisitive queries and pointed chaff he replied with a sulky growl,
  and very soon the delight of meeting an interesting stranger gave place to
  irritation at his sullen mood. He was drinking heavily, and did not seem
  cheerful in his cups, and anon even Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s boisterous hilarity
  gave way before his persistent gloom.</p>
  <p>After an hour or two the company started yawning: every one had had enough
  of this silent and ill-tempered stranger, who not only had brought no new
  life and animation into the sleepy town, but was ill repaying the lavish
  hospitality of &ldquo;Les Trois Matelots&rdquo; by his reticence and sulky
  humour.</p>
  <p>One by one now the habitu&eacute;s departed, nodding genially to mine host,
  as they settled for their <i>consommations</i>, and bidding as hearty a good-night
  to the stranger as their disappointment would allow.</p>
  <p>De Mort&eacute;mar and Valledieu had tried to lure M. le Comte de Stainville
  to hazard or even to a more sober game of piquet, but the latter had persistently
  refused and sat with legs stretched out before him, hands buried in breeches&rsquo; pockets,
  his head drooping on his chest, and a meditative scowl between his eyes.</p>
  <p>The wine had apparently quite dulled his brilliant wit, and now he only
  replied in curt monosyllables to queries addressed directly to him.</p>
  <p>Anon Valledieu and old G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Coutures pleading the ties
  of family and home, begged to be excused. Now de Mort&eacute;mar alone was
  left to entertain his surly guest, bored to distraction, and dislocating
  his jaws in the vain efforts which he made to smother persistent yawns.</p>
  <p>It was then close on half-past seven. The final glory of the setting sun
  had yielded to the magic wand of night which had changed the vivid crimson
  and orange first to delicate greens and mauves and then to the deep, the
  gorgeous blue of a summer&rsquo;s evening sky. The stars one by one gleamed
  in the firmament, and soon the crescent moon, chaste and cold, added her
  incomparable glory to the beauty and the silent peace of the night.</p>
  <p>Tiny lights appeared at masthead or prow of the many craft lying at anchor
  in the roadsteads, and from far away through the open window there came wafted,
  on the sweet salt breeze, the melancholy sound of an old Normandy ditty sung
  by a pair of youthful throats.</p>
  <p>Fatigue and gloom had oppressed Gaston at first, now it was unconquerable
  rage, seething and terrible, which caused him to remain silent. De Mort&eacute;mar
  was racking his brains for an excuse to break up this wearisome <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> without
  overstepping the bounds of good-breeding, whilst cursing his own impetuosity
  which had prompted him to take this surly guest under his wing.</p>
  <p>Jean Marie now entered with the candles, causing a welcome diversion. He
  placed one massive pewter candelabrum on the table occupied by Gaston and
  de Mort&eacute;mar: the other he carried to the further end of the room.
  Having placed that down too, he lolled back toward de Mort&eacute;mar. His
  rubicund face looked troubled, great beads of perspiration stood out upon
  his forehead, and his fat fingers wandered along the velvety surface of his
  round, closely-cropped crown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu le Comte . . .&rdquo; he began hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Mort&eacute;mar smothering a yawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A stranger, M&rsquo;sieu le Comte . . .&rdquo; stammered Jean Marie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, another? . . . I mean,&rdquo; added the young man with a nervous
  little laugh, feeling that the sudden exclamation of undisguised annoyance
  was not altogether courteous to his guest, &ldquo;I mean a . . . an . . .
  an . . . unknown stranger? . . . altogether different to M. le Comte de Stainville,
  of course!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A stranger, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; repeated Jean Marie curtly. &ldquo;He
  came at midday. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you told us nothing about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not think it was necessary, nor that the stranger would trouble
  M&rsquo;sieu le Comte. He asked for a clean room and a bed and said nothing
  about supper at the time. . . . He seemed very tired and gave me a couple
  of louis, just if as they were half livres.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt &rsquo;twas the stranger with whom Lieutenant Tellier had
  speech outside &lsquo;Le Gros Normand!&rsquo;&rdquo; suggested de Mort&eacute;mar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mayhap! mayhap!&rdquo; rejoined Jean Marie thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
  took him up a bowl of sack and half a cold capon, but what he wanted most
  was a large wash-tub and plenty of water . . . it seems he needed a bath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he was English,&rdquo; commented Mort&eacute;mar decisively.</p>
  <p>But at these words, Gaston, who had been listening with half an ear to mine
  host&rsquo;s explanations, roused himself from his heavy torpor.</p>
  <p>The stranger who had forestalled him and sent <i>Le Monarque</i> on her
  secret voyage to-day was English!</p>
  <p>Then it was . . .</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is that stranger now?&rdquo; he demanded peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, M&rsquo;sieu le Comte!&rdquo; replied Jean
  Marie, obstinately ignoring Gaston and still addressing de Mort&eacute;mar, &ldquo;he
  slept all the afternoon. Now he wants some supper. He throws louis about
  as if they were dirt, and I can&rsquo;t serve him in there!&rdquo; he added
  with unanswerable logic and pointing to the stuffy room in the rear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardi! . . .&rdquo; began Mort&eacute;mar.</p>
  <p>But Gaston de Stainville was fully alert now; with sudden vigour he jumped
  to his feet and brought his fist crashing down on the table so that the candelabrum,
  the mugs, and decanters of wine shook under the blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beseech you, friend, admit the stranger into this room without
  delay,&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;Ma foi! you have found me dull and
  listless, ill-humoured in spite of your lavish hospitality; I swear to you
  by all the devils in hell that you&rsquo;ll not yawn once for the next half-hour,
  and that Gaston de Stainville and the mysterious stranger, who thwarts his
  will and forestalls his orders, will afford you a measure of amusement such
  as you&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His face was flushed, and his eyes, somewhat hazy from the copiousness of
  his libations, had an evil leer in them and an inward glow of deadly hate.
  There was no longer any weakness, nor yet ill-humour, visible in his attitude.
  His hands were clenched, one resting on the table, the other roughly pushing
  back the chair on which he had been sitting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admit the stranger, friend host!&rdquo; he shouted savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  vouch for it that your patron will not regret his presence in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ma foi! I trust not,&rdquo; said a quiet voice, which seemed to come
  suddenly from out the gloom. &ldquo;Gentlemen, your servant!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mort&eacute;mar turned toward the door, whence had proceeded that gentle,
  courteous voice. Lord Eglinton was standing under the lintel, elegantly attired
  in full riding dress, with top boots and closely-fitting coat. He wore no
  sword, and carried a heavy cloak on his arm.</p>
  <p>He made a comprehensive bow which included every one there present, then
  he stepped forward into the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
  Revenge</b></h2>
  <p>We must surmise that surprise and rage had rendered Gaston speechless for
  the moment.</p>
  <p>Of all the conjectures which had racked his brains for the past two hours
  none had come near this amazing reality. Gaston was no fool, and in one vivid
  flash he saw before his mental vision not only his own discomfiture, the
  annihilation of all his hopes, but also the failure of King Louis&rsquo; plans,
  the relegation of those fifteen millions back into the pockets of His Grace
  the Duke of Cumberland.</p>
  <p>That Eglinton had not ridden to Le Havre on the King&rsquo;s business but
  on his own, that he had not sent <i>Le Monarque</i> to Scotland in order
  that he might share in those millions was of course obvious.</p>
  <p>No! no! it was clear enough! Lydie having found that Gaston had failed her,
  had turned to her husband for help: and he, still nominally Comptroller-General
  of Finance, had found it quite easy to send Captain Barre on his way with
  secret orders to find Charles Edward Stuart and ensure the safety of the
  Jacobites at once and at any cost.</p>
  <p>Milor was immensely rich; that had helped him too, of course; bribes, promises,
  presents of money were nothing to him. Mentally he was weak&mdash;reasoned
  Gaston&rsquo;s vanity&mdash;and Lydie had commanded him.</p>
  <p>But physically he was as strong as a horse, impervious to fatigue, and whilst
  Gaston rested last night preparing for his journey, <i>le petit Anglais</i> was
  in the saddle at midnight and had killed a horse under him ere de Stainville
  was midway.</p>
  <p>What King Louis&rsquo; attitude would be over this disappointment it were
  premature to conjecture. Royal disfavour coupled with Pompadour&rsquo;s ill-humour
  would make itself felt on innocent and guilty alike.</p>
  <p>That he himself was a ruined man and that, through the interference of that
  weak-kneed young fop, whom it had been the fashion in Versailles mildly to
  despise, was the one great, all-absorbing fact which seemed to turn Gaston&rsquo;s
  blood into living fire within his veins.</p>
  <p>And the man who had thus deliberately snatched a couple of millions or more
  from his grip stood there, not twenty paces away, calm, somewhat gauche in
  manner, yet with that certain stiff dignity peculiar to Englishmen of high
  rank, and withal apparently unconscious of the fact that the rival whom he
  had deprived of a fortune was in this same room with him, burning with rage
  and thirsting for revenge.</p>
  <p>Gaston watched his enemy for awhile as he now settled himself at the table,
  with Jean Marie ministering obsequiously to his wants. Soon mine host had
  arranged everything to his guest&rsquo;s liking, had placed a dish of stewed
  veal before him, a bottle of wine, some nice fresh bread, then retired walking
  backwards, so wonderfully deferential was he to the man who dealt with gold
  as others would with tin.</p>
  <p>One grim thought had now risen in Stainville&rsquo;s mind, the revival of
  a memory, half-faded: an insult, a challenge, refused by that man, who had
  thwarted him!</p>
  <p>A coward? Eh?</p>
  <p>These English would not fight! &rsquo;twas well known; in battle, yes! but
  not in single combat, not in a meeting &rsquo;twixt gentlemen, after a heady
  bottle of wine when tempers wax hot, and swords skip almost of themselves
  out of the scabbard.</p>
  <p>Aye! he would ride a hundred and eighty leagues, to frustrate a plan, or
  nathless to dip into the well-filled coffers of the Jacobite Alliance&mdash;such
  things were possible&mdash;but he would not fight!</p>
  <p>Gaston hugged the thought! it was grim but delicious! revenge, bitter, awful,
  complete revenge was there, quite easy of accomplishment. Fortune was lost
  to him, but not revenge! Not before his hand had struck the cheek of his
  enemy.</p>
  <p>This was his right. No one could blame him. Not even the King, sworn foe
  of duelling though he might profess to be.</p>
  <p>A long laugh now broke from Gaston&rsquo;s burning throat! Was it not all
  ridiculous, senseless, and puerile?</p>
  <p>His Majesty the King, Pompadour, the Duc d&rsquo;Aumont, Prime Minister
  of France, and he himself, Gaston de Stainville, the most ruthlessly ambitious
  man in the kingdom, all fooled, stupidly fooled and tricked by that man,
  who was too great a coward to meet the rival whom he had insulted.</p>
  <p>At Gaston&rsquo;s laugh Eglinton turned to look in his direction, and his
  eyes met those of de Mort&eacute;mar fixed intently upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely it is M. le Contr&ocirc;leur-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral,&rdquo; said
  the latter, jumping to his feet.</p>
  <p>He had paid no heed to his guest&rsquo;s curious outburst of merriment,
  putting it down as another expression of his strange humour, else to the
  potency of Jean Marie&rsquo;s wine; but he had been deeply interested in
  the elegant figure of the stranger, that perfect type of a high-born gentleman
  which the young man was quick enough to recognise. The face, the quaintly
  awkward manner, brought back certain recollections of two days spent at the
  Court of Versailles.</p>
  <p>Now when Eglinton turned toward him, he at once recognised the handsome
  face, and those kind eyes, which always looked grave and perfectly straight
  at an interlocutor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor Eglinton, a thousand pardons,&rdquo; he now said as he moved
  quickly across the room. &ldquo;I had failed to recognise you at first, and
  had little thought of seeing so great a personage in this sleepy old town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Eglinton too had risen at his first words and had stepped forward, with
  his habitual courtesy, to greet the young man. De Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s
  hand was cordially stretched out toward him, the next moment he would have
  clasped that of the young Englishman, when with one bound and a rush across
  the room and with one wild shout of rage, Gaston de Stainville overtook his
  friend and, catching hold of his arm, he drew him roughly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! de Mort&eacute;mar, my friend,&rdquo; he cried loudly, &ldquo;be
  warned in time lest your honest hand come in contact with that of a coward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His words echoed along the vast, empty room. Then there was dead silence.
  Instinctively Mort&eacute;mar had stepped back as if he had been stung. He
  did not of course understand the meaning of it all, and was so taken aback
  that he could no nothing but stare amazed at the figure of the young man
  before him. Eglinton&rsquo;s placidity had in no sense given way before the
  deadly insult; only his face had become pale as death, but the eyes still
  looked grave, earnest and straight at his enemy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! a coward,&rdquo; said Gaston, who during these few moments of
  silence had fought the trembling of his limbs, the quiver of his voice. He
  saw the calm of the other man and with a mighty effort smothered the cryings
  of his rage, leaving cool contempt free play. &ldquo;Or will you deny here,
  before my friend le Comte de Mort&eacute;mar, who was about to touch your
  hand, that last night having insulted me you refused to give me satisfaction?
  Coward! you have no right to touch another&rsquo;s hand . . . the hand of
  an honourable gentleman. . . . Coward! . . . Do you hear me? I&rsquo;ll say
  it again&mdash;coward&mdash;and coward again ere I shout it on the house-tops
  of Versailles&mdash;coward!&mdash;even now when my hand has struck your cheek&mdash;coward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How it all happened Mort&eacute;mar himself could not afterward have said,
  the movement must have been extraordinarily quick, for even as the last word &ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; rose
  to Gaston&rsquo;s lips it was drowned in an involuntary cry of agony, whilst
  his hand, raised ready to strike, was held in a grip which indeed seemed
  like one of steel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis done, man! &rsquo;tis done!&rdquo; said the gentle, perfectly
  even voice, &ldquo;but in the name of Heaven provoke me no further, or it
  will be murder instead of fight. There!&rdquo; he added, releasing the other
  man&rsquo;s wrist, who staggered back faint and giddy with the pain, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
  true that I refused to meet you in combat yester e&rsquo;en; the life of
  my friend, lonely and betrayed, out there in far-off Scotland, had been the
  price of delay if I did not ride out of Versailles before cock-crow, but
  now &rsquo;tis another matter,&rdquo; he added lightly, &ldquo;and I am at
  your service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; sneered Gaston, still writhing with pain, &ldquo;at my
  service now, when you hope that my broken wrist will ensure your impunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, but at your service across the width of this table,&rdquo; responded
  Eglinton coldly, &ldquo;a pair of pistols, one unloaded. . . . And we&rsquo;ll
  both use the left hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An exclamation of protest broke from Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible! . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why so, Monsieur le Comte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tere murder, milor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does M. le Comte de Stainville protest?&rdquo; queried the other
  calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! damn you! . . . Where are the pistols?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yours, M. le Comte, an you will; surely you have not ridden all the
  way from Versailles without a pair in your holster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well guessed, milor,&rdquo; quoth Gaston lightly. &ldquo;Mort&eacute;mar,
  I pray you, in the pocket of my coat . . . a pair of pistols.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mort&eacute;mar tried again to protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Gaston savagely, &ldquo;do you not see that
  I must kill him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis obvious as the crescent moon yonder, M. de Mort&eacute;mar,&rdquo; said
  Eglinton with a whimsical smile. &ldquo;I entreat you, the pistols.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man obeyed in silence. He strode across the room to the place
  lately vacated by Gaston, and near which his cloak was lying close to his
  hat and whip. Mort&eacute;mar groped in the pockets: he found the two pistols
  and then rejoined the antagonists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used one against a couple of footpads in the early dawn,&rdquo; said
  Gaston, as he took the weapons from Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s hands and placed
  them on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas lucky, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; rejoined Eglinton gravely, &ldquo;then
  all we need do is to throw for the choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dice,&rdquo; said Stainville curtly.</p>
  <p>On a table close by there was a dice-box, left there by one of Jean Marie&rsquo;s
  customers: Mort&eacute;mar, without a word, handed it to Eglinton. He could
  not understand the placidity of the man: Gaston&rsquo;s attitude was simple
  enough, primitive animal rage, blinding him to the possibility of immediate
  death; excitement too, giving him a sense of bravado, an arrogant disregard
  of the consequences of his own provocation.</p>
  <p>Eglinton was within his rights. He was now the insulted party, he could
  make his own conditions, but did he wish to die? or was he so supremely indifferent
  to life that he could view with perfect serenity that pair of pistols, one
  of which death-dealing of a surety across a narrow table, and that box of
  dice the arbiter of his fate?</p>
  <p>Of a truth Eglinton was perfectly indifferent as to the issue of the combat.
  He did not care if he killed Gaston, nor did he care to live. Lydie hated
  him, so what mattered if the sky was blue, or if the sun ceased to shed radiance
  over the earth?</p>
  <p>It was the supreme indifference of a man who with life had nothing else
  to lose.</p>
  <p>His hand was absolutely steady as he took the dice-box and threw:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blank!&rdquo; murmured Mort&eacute;mar under his breath, as he saw
  the result of the throw. Yet the face of milor was as impassive as before,
  even though now by all the rules of chance Gaston&rsquo;s was the winning
  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo; he said calmly, as the dice once more rolled on to
  the table. &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte, the choice of weapon rests with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more Mort&eacute;mar tried to interpose. This was monstrous! horrible!
  a shocking, brutal murder!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur de Stainville knows his own weapons,&rdquo; he said impulsively, &ldquo;he
  discharged one this morning and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor should have thought of this before!&rdquo; retorted Stainville
  savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The remark did not come from me, Monsieur,&rdquo; rejoined Eglinton
  passively, &ldquo;an you will choose your weapon, I am fully satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But his grave eyes found occasion to send a kindly glance of gratitude to
  young de Mort&eacute;mar. The latter felt a tightening of his very heart
  strings: he would at this moment have willingly given his fortune to avert
  the awful catastrophe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mort&eacute;mar, an you interfere,&rdquo; said Gaston, divining his
  thoughts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll brand you as a meddler before the Court of Versailles.
  An you are afraid to see bloodshed, get you gone in the name of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By all the unwritten laws which governed such affairs of honour, Mort&eacute;mar
  could not interfere. He did not know the right or wrong of the original enmity
  between these two men, but had already guessed that mere disappointment with
  regard to the voyage of <i>Le Monarque</i> had not been sufficient to kindle
  such deadly hate: vaguely he surmised that somewhere in the background lurked
  the rustle of a silk petticoat.</p>
  <p>Without the slightest hesitation now Gaston took one of the pistols in his
  left hand: his right still caused him excruciating pain; and every time he
  felt the agony, his eyes gleamed with more intense savagery, the lust of
  a certain revenge.</p>
  <p>He had worked himself up into a passion of hate. Money has the power to
  do that sometimes; that vanished hope of fortune had killed every instinct
  in the man, save that of desire for vengeance. He was sure of himself. The
  pistols were his as de Mort&eacute;mar had said, and he had handled them
  but a few hours ago: he could apprise their weight&mdash;loaded or unloaded&mdash;and
  he was quite satisfied.</p>
  <p>It was hatred alone that prompted him to a final thrust, a blow, he thought,
  to a dying man. Eglinton was as good as dead, with the muzzle of a loaded
  pistol a foot away from his breast, and an empty weapon in his own hand;
  but his serenity irritated Gaston; the blood which tingled in his own veins,
  which had rushed to his head almost obscuring his vision clamoured for a
  sight of a shrinking enemy, not of a wooden puppet, calm, impassive even
  before certain death.</p>
  <p>The agony as he lifted the half-broken wrist to his coat was intolerable,
  but he almost welcomed it now, for it added a strange, lustful joy to the
  excitement of this deed. His eyes, glowing and restless with fumes of wine
  and passion of hate, were fixed upon the marble-like face of his enemy. Then
  from the breast-pocket of his coat, he drew a packet of papers.</p>
  <p>And although he was nigh giddy with the pain in his wrist, he clutched that
  packet tightly, toyed with it for a while, smoothed out the creases with
  a hand which shook with the intensity of his excitement, the intensity of
  his triumph.</p>
  <p>The proofs in Madame la Marquise d&rsquo;Eglinton&rsquo;s own writing that
  she was at one with the gang who meant to sell the Stuart prince for gold!
  The map revealing his hiding-place! and her letter to him bidding him trust
  the bearer whose orders&mdash;now affixed to map and letter&mdash;were that
  he deliver the young Pretender into the hands of the English authorities.</p>
  <p>That these orders to <i>Le Monarque</i> had been forestalled by milor Eglinton
  could not exonerate Madame la Marquise from having been at one with Gaston
  de Stainville and Madame de Pompadour, and others who might remain nameless,
  in the blackest treachery ever planned against a trusting friend.</p>
  <p>No wonder Gaston de Stainville forgot physical suffering when he toyed lovingly
  with this packet of papers in his hand, the consummation of his revenge.</p>
  <p>At last &rsquo;twas done. A subtle, indefinable change had come over the
  calm face of Lord Eglinton, an ashen grey hue which had chased the former
  pallor of the cheeks, and the slender hand, which held the pistol, trembled
  almost imperceptibly.</p>
  <p>Serenity had given way at sight of that packet of papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friend de Mort&eacute;mar,&rdquo; said Gaston lightly, but with glowing
  eyes still fixed on his opponent, &ldquo;the chances of my demise being at
  least equal to those of milor&rsquo;s&mdash;seeing that I know not, on my
  honour, which is the loaded pistol, and that methinks at this moment I can
  read murder in his eye&mdash;I pray you to take charge of this packet. It
  is a sacred trust. In case of my death promise me that you will deliver it
  into the hands of my wife, and into no other. Madame la Comtesse de Stainville
  will know how to deal with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young Comte de Mort&eacute;mar took the packet from Gaston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do as you desire,&rdquo; he said coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You promise that no one shall touch these papers except my wife,
  Ir&egrave;ne Comtesse de Stainville,&rdquo; reiterated Gaston solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On my word of honour,&rdquo; rejoined the young man.</p>
  <p>The request was perfectly proper and natural, very usual in such cases;
  de Mort&eacute;mar could not help but comply. He could not know that the
  fulfilment of this promise would mean public dishonour to an innocent and
  noble woman, and the supreme revenge of a baffled traitor.</p>
  <p>If Gaston expected protest, rage, or excitement from his foe he was certainly
  disappointed. Eglinton had all the characteristics of his race, perfect sang-froid
  in the face of the inevitable, and an almost morbid consciousness of pride
  and dignity. He could not filch those papers from Gaston nor prevent de Mort&eacute;mar
  from accepting and fulfilling a trust, which had all the appearance of being
  sacred.</p>
  <p>He knew that by this act he had wrested a fortune from a man whose fetish
  was money, and the power which money gives: true that being an honest man
  himself, he had never thought of such an infamous revenge.</p>
  <p>If he died now Heaven help his proud Lydie! but if he lived then Heaven
  help them both!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
  The Letter</b></h2>
  <p>De Mort&eacute;mar had stowed the packet carefully away inside his coat,
  Gaston keenly watching his antagonist the while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you ready, milor?&rdquo; he asked now with marked insolence of
  manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; replied the other quietly. &ldquo;M. de Mort&eacute;mar,
  will you give the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men stood opposite to one another, a table not four feet wide between
  them. Each held a pistol in his left hand. Of these one was loaded, the other
  not. De Mort&eacute;mar had cleared the table, pushing aside the decanter
  of wine, the tureen of soup, the glasses. The window was still open, and
  from that outside world which to these men here present seemed so far away,
  there came the sound of the old church belfry tolling the hour of eight,
  and still from afar that melancholy tune, the Norman ditty sung by young
  throats:</p>
  <p><i>&ldquo;C&rsquo;est les Normands, qu&rsquo;&agrave; dit ma m&egrave;re,&rdquo;C&rsquo;est
   les Normands qu&rsquo;ont conquis l&rsquo;Angleterre!&rdquo;</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; said de Mort&eacute;mar.</p>
  <p>Two arms were raised. Eye was fixed to eye for one brief second, then lowered
  for the aim. There was a slight dull sound, then a terrible curse muttered
  below the breath, as the pistol which Gaston de Stainville had vainly tried
  to fire dropped from his hand.</p>
  <p>Had his excitement blinded him when he chose his weapon, or was it just
  fate, ruthless, inscrutable, that had placed the loaded pistol in Lord Eglinton&rsquo;s
  hand?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A blank!&rdquo; he shouted with a blasphemous oath. &ldquo;<i>&Agrave; vous</i>,
  milor! Curse you, why don&rsquo;t you fire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fire, milor, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Mort&eacute;mar,
  who was as pale as death. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis cruelty to prolong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Eglinton too had dropped his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte de Stainville,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;before I
  use this weapon against you, as I would against a mad dog, I&rsquo;ll propose
  a bargain for your acceptance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d buy that packet of precious documents from me, eh?&rdquo; sneered
  Gaston savagely, &ldquo;nay, milor, &rsquo;tis no use offering millions to
  a dying man. . . . Shoot, shoot, milor! the widowed Comtesse de Stainville
  will deal with those documents and no one else. . . . They are not for sale,
  I tell you, not for all your millions now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not even for this pistol, M. le Comte?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And calm, serene with that whimsical smile again playing round the corners
  of his expressive mouth, Lord Eglinton offered the loaded pistol to his enemy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My life? . . .&rdquo; stammered Gaston, &ldquo;you would? . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, mine, M. le Comte,&rdquo; rejoined milor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  not stir from this spot. I offer you this pistol and you shall use it at
  your pleasure, after you have handed me that packet of letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively Gaston had drawn back, lost in a maze of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you&rsquo;ll not take the weapon, M. le Comte,&rdquo; said Eglinton
  decisively, &ldquo;I shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, whilst Gaston&rsquo;s pride fought a
  grim battle with that awful instinct of self-preservation, that strange love
  of fleeting life to which poor mortals cling.</p>
  <p>Men were not cowards in those days; life was cheap and oft sold for the
  gratification of petty vanity, yet who shall blame Gaston if, with certain
  death before him, he chose to forego his revenge?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me that pistol, milor,&rdquo; he said dully, &ldquo;de Mort&eacute;mar,
  hand over that packet to Lord Eglinton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took the pistol from milor, and it was his own hand that trembled.</p>
  <p>Silently de Mort&eacute;mar obeyed. Milor took the packet of papers from
  him, then held them one by one to the flame of the candle: first the map,
  then the letter which bore Lydie&rsquo;s name writ so boldly across it. The
  black ash curled and fell from his hand on to the table, he gripped the paper
  until his seared fingers could hold it no longer.</p>
  <p>Then he once more stood up, turning straight toward Gaston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ready, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>Gaston raised his left arm and fired. There was a wild, an agonized shriek
  which came from a woman&rsquo;s throat, coupled with one of horror from de
  Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s lips, as <i>le petit Anglais</i> stood for the space
  of a few seconds, quite still, firm and upright, with scarce a change upon
  his calm face, then sank forward without a groan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame, you are hurt!&rdquo; shouted de Mort&eacute;mar, who was
  almost dazed with surprise at the sight of a woman at this awful and supreme
  moment. He had just seen her, in the vivid flash when Gaston raised his arm
  and fired: she had rushed forward then, with the obvious intention of throwing
  herself before the murderous weapon, and now was making pathetic and vain
  efforts to raise her husband&rsquo;s inanimate body from the table against
  which he had fallen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coward! coward!&rdquo; she sobbed in anguish, &ldquo;you have stilled
  the bravest heart in France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray God that I have not,&rdquo; murmured Gaston fervently, as, impelled
  by some invisible force, he threw the pistol from him, then sank on his knees
  and buried his face in his hands.</p>
  <p>But Mort&eacute;mar had soon recovered his presence of mind, and had already
  reached his wounded friend, calling quickly to Jean Marie who apparently
  had followed in the wake of Madame la Marquise in her wild rush from her
  coach to the inner room.</p>
  <p>Together the two men succeeded in lifting Lord Eglinton and in gently insinuating
  his body backward into a recumbent position. Thus Lydie&mdash;still on her
  knees&mdash;received her lord in her arms. Her eyes were fixed upon his pallid
  face with passionate intensity. It seemed as if she would wrest from those
  closed lids the secret of life or death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not die? . . .&rdquo; she whispered wildly; &ldquo;tell
  me that he&rsquo;ll not die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A deep red stain was visible on the left side, spreading on the fine cloth
  of the coat. With clumsy though willing fingers, Mort&eacute;mar was doing
  his best to get the waistcoat open, and to stop temporarily the rapid flow
  of blood with Lydie&rsquo;s scarf, which she had wrenched from her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Jean Marie! the leech!&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and have
  the rooms prepared . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Jean Marie obeyed with unusual alacrity and anon his stentorian
  voice calling to ostler and maids echoed through the silence of the house,
  Lydie&rsquo;s eyes met those of the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame! Madame! I beseech you,&rdquo; he said appalled at the terrible
  look of agony expressed on the beautiful, marble-like face, &ldquo;let me
  attend you . . . I vow that you are hurt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she rejoined quickly, &ldquo;only my hand . . . I
  tried to clutch the weapon . . . but &rsquo;twas too late . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she yielded her hand to him. The shot had indeed pierced the fleshy
  portion between thumb and forefinger, leaving an ugly gash: the wound was
  bleeding profusely and already she felt giddy and sick. De Mort&eacute;mar
  bound up the little hand with his handkerchief as best he could. She hardly
  heeded him, beyond that persistent appeal, terrible in its heartrending pathos:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not die . . . tell me that he&rsquo;ll not die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst not five paces away, Gaston de Stainville still knelt, praying that
  the ugly stain of murder should not for ever sully his hand.</p>

  The Home In England</b></h2>
  <p>The first words which milor uttered when presently consciousness returned
  were:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The letter . . . Madonna . . . &rsquo;tis destroyed . . . I swear.
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was then lying in Jean Marie&rsquo;s best bed, between lavender-scented
  sheets. On his right a tiny open window afforded a glimpse of sea and sky,
  and of many graceful craft gently lolling on the breast of the waves, but
  on his left, when anon he turned his eyes that way, there was a picture which
  of a truth was not of this earth, and vaguely, with the childish and foolish
  fancy of a sick man who hath gazed on the dark portals, he allowed himself
  to think that all the old tales of his babyhood, about the first glimpse
  of paradise after death, must indeed be true.</p>
  <p>He was dead and this was paradise.</p>
  <p>What he saw was a woman&rsquo;s face, with grave anxious eyes fixed upon
  him, and a woman&rsquo;s smile which revealed an infinity of love and promised
  an infinity of happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; he murmured feebly. Then he closed his eyes again,
  for he was weak from loss of blood and from days and nights of fever and
  delirium, and he was so afraid that the vision might vanish if he gazed at
  it too long.</p>
  <p>The leech&mdash;a kindly man&mdash;visited him frequently. Apparently the
  wound was destined to heal. Life was to begin anew, with its sorrows, its
  disappointments, its humiliations, mayhap.</p>
  <p>Yet a memory haunted him persistently&mdash;a vision, oh! &rsquo;twas a
  mere flash&mdash;of his madonna standing with her dear, white hand outstretched,
  betwixt him and death.</p>
  <p>It was a vision, of course; such as are vouchsafed to the dying: and the
  other picture?&mdash;nay! that was a fevered dream; there had been no tender,
  grave eyes that watched him, no woman&rsquo;s smile to promise happiness.</p>
  <p>One day M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont came to visit him. He had posted straight
  from Paris, and was singularly urbane and anxious when he pressed the sick
  man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must make a quick recovery, milor,&rdquo; he said cordially; &ldquo;<i>par
   Dieu!</i> you are the hero of the hour. Mort&eacute;mar hath talked his
   fill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trust not,&rdquo; rejoined Eglinton gravely.</p>
  <p>M. le Duc looked conscious and perturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! he is a gallant youth,&rdquo; he said reassuringly, &ldquo;and
  knows exactly how to hold his tongue, but Belle-Isle and de Lugeac had to
  be taught a lesson . . . and &rsquo;twas well learned I&rsquo;ll warrant
  you. . . . As for Gaston. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! M. le Duc? what of M. le Comte de Stainville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath left the Court momentarily . . . somewhat in disgrace . .
  . &rsquo;twas a monstrous encounter, milor,&rdquo; added the Duke gravely. &ldquo;Had
  Gaston killed you it had been murder, for you never meant to shoot, so says
  de Mort&eacute;mar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sick man&rsquo;s head turned restlessly on the pillow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Mort&eacute;mar&rsquo;s tongue hath run away with him,&rdquo; he
  said impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The account of the duel . . . nothing more, on my honour,&rdquo; rejoined
  the Duke. &ldquo;No woman&rsquo;s name has been mentioned, but I fear me
  the Court and public have got wind of the story of a conspiracy against the
  Stuart prince, and connect the duel with that event&mdash;hence your popularity,
  milor,&rdquo; continued the older man with a sigh, &ldquo;and Gaston&rsquo;s
  disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s whipping-boy, eh? the scapegoat in the aborted
  conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Gaston! You bear him much ill-will, milor, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I? None, on my honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. le Duc hesitated a while, a troubled look appeared on his handsome face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lydie,&rdquo; he said tentatively. &ldquo;Milor, she left Paris that
  night alone . . . and travelled night and day to reach Le Havre in time to
  help you and to thwart Gaston . . . she had been foolish of course, but her
  motives were pure . . . milor, she is my child and . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is my wife, M. le Duc,&rdquo; interrupted Lord Eglinton gravely; &ldquo;I
  need no assurance of her purity even from her father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was such implicit trust, such complete faith expressed in those few
  simple words, that instinctively M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont felt ashamed that
  he could ever have misunderstood his daughter. He was silent for a moment
  or two, then he said more lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty is much angered of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against me, I hope,&rdquo; rejoined Eglinton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; sighed the Duke. &ldquo;King Louis is poorer by fifteen
  million livres by your act, milor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And richer by the kingdom of honour. As for the millions, M. le Duc,
  I&rsquo;ll place them myself at His Majesty&rsquo;s service. My ch&acirc;teau
  and dependencies of Choisy are worth that,&rdquo; added milor lightly. &ldquo;As
  soon as this feeble hand can hold a pen, I&rsquo;ll hand them over to the
  crown of France as a free gift.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will do that, milor?&rdquo; gasped the Duke, who could scarce
  believe his ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my firm intention,&rdquo; rejoined the sick man with a
  smile.</p>
  <p>A great weight had been lifted from M. le Duc&rsquo;s mind. Royal displeasure
  would indeed have descended impartially on all the friends of &ldquo;le petit
  Anglais&rdquo; and above all on milor&rsquo;s father-in-law, whose very
  presence at Court would of a surety have become distasteful to the disappointed
  monarch. Now this unparalleled generosity would more than restore Louis&rsquo; confidence
  in a Prime Minister whose chief virtue consisted in possessing so wealthy
  and magnanimous a son-in-law.</p>
  <p>Indeed we know that M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont continued for some time after
  these memorable days to enjoy the confidence and gratitude of Louis the Well-beloved
  and to bask in the sunshine of Madame de Pompadour&rsquo;s smiles, whilst
  the gift of the ch&acirc;teau and dependencies of Choisy by Milor the Marquis
  of Eglinton to the crown of France was made the subject of a public f&ecirc;te
  at Versailles and of an ode by M. Jolyot Cr&eacute;billon of the Institut
  de France, writ especially for the occasion.</p>
  <p>But after the visit of M. le Duc d&rsquo;Aumont at his bedside in the &ldquo;auberge
  des Trois Matelots&rdquo; the munificent donor of fifteen millions livres
  felt over-wearied of life.</p>
  <p>The dream which had soothed his fevered sleep no longer haunted his waking
  moments, and memory had much ado to feed love of life with the rememberance
  of one happy moment.</p>
  <p>Milor the Marquis of Eglinton closed his eyes, sighing for that dream. The
  little room was so still, so peaceful, and from the tiny window a gentle
  breeze from across the English Channel fanned his aching brow, bringing back
  with its soothing murmur the memory of that stately home in England, for
  which his father had so often sighed.</p>
  <p>How peaceful it must be there among the hills!</p>
  <p>The breeze murmured more persistently, and anon with its dreamlike sound
  there mingled the frou-frou of a woman&rsquo;s skirts.</p>
  <p>The sick man ventured to open his eyes.</p>
  <p>Lydie, his wife, was kneeling beside his bed, her delicate hands clasped
  under her chin, her eyes large, glowing and ever grave fixed upon his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I on earth?&rdquo; he murmured quaintly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, milor,&rdquo; she replied, and her voice was like the
  most exquisite music he had ever heard; it was earnest and serious like her
  own self, but there was a tremor in it which rendered it unspeakably soft.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The leech saith there&rsquo;s no longer any danger for your life,&rdquo; she
  added.</p>
  <p>He was silent for awhile, as if he were meditating on a grave matter, then
  he said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you have me live, Lydie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as she did not reply, he repeated his question again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to live, Lydie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She fought with the tears, which against her will gathered in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milor, milor, are you not cruel now?&rdquo; she whispered through
  those tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cruel of a truth,&rdquo; he replied earnestly, &ldquo;since you would
  have saved me at peril of your own dear life. . . . Yet would I gladly die
  to see you happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not rather live, milor?&rdquo; she said with a smile of
  infinite tenderness, &ldquo;for then only could I taste happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet if I lived, you would have to give up so much that you love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is impossible, milor, for I only love one thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your work in France?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. My life with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands dropped on to the coverlet, and he grasped them in his own. How
  oft had she drawn away at his touch. Now she yielded, drawing nearer to him,
  still on her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you come to England with me, Lydie? to my home in England,
  amongst the hills of Sussex, far from Court life and from politics? Would
  you follow me thither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the uttermost ends of the world, good milor,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
