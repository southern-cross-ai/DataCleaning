    Which Tells Of A Very Commonplace Incident</b></h2>
  <p>No! No! she was not going to gush!&mdash;Not even though there was nothing
    in the room at this moment to stand up afterward before her as dumb witness
    to a moment&rsquo;s possible weakness. Less than nothing in fact: space might
    have spoken and recalled that moment . . . infinite nothingness might at
    some future time have brought back the memory of it . . . but these dumb,
    impassive objects! . . . the fountain pen between her fingers! The dull,
    uninteresting hotel furniture covered in red velvet&mdash;an uninviting red
    that repelled dreaminess and peace! The ormolu clock which had ceased long
    ago to mark the passage of time, wearied&mdash;as it no doubt was, poor thing&mdash;by
    the monotonous burden of a bronze Psyche gazing on her shiny brown charms,
    in an utterly blank and unreflective bronze mirror, while obviously bemoaning
    the fracture of one of her smooth bronze thighs! Indeed Louisa might well
    have given way to that overmastering feeling of excitement before all these
    things. They would neither see nor hear. They would never deride, for they
    could never remember.</p>
  <p>But a wood fire crackled on the small hearth . . . and . . . and those citron-coloured
    carnations were favourite flowers of his . . . and his picture did stand
    on the top of that ugly little Louis Philippe bureau . . . No! No! it would
    never do to gush, for these things would see . . . and, though they might
    not remember, they would remind.</p>
  <p>And Louisa counted herself one of the strong ones of this earth. Just think
    of her name. Have you ever known a Louisa who gushed? who called herself
    the happiest woman on earth? who thought of a man&mdash;just an ordinary
    man, mind you&mdash;as the best, the handsomest, the truest, the most perfect
    hero of romance that ever threw a radiance over the entire prosy world of
    the twentieth century?</p>
  <p>Louisas, believe me, do no such things. The Mays and the Floras, the Lady
    Barbaras and Lady Edithas, look beatific and charming when, clasping their
    lily-white hands together and raising violet eyes to the patterned ceiling
    paper above them, they exclaim: &ldquo;Oh, my hero and my king!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Louisas would only look ridiculous if they behaved like that . . . Louisa
    Harris, too! . . . Louisa, the eldest of three sisters, the daughter of a
    wealthy English gentleman with a fine estate in Kent, an assured position,
    no troubles, no cares, nothing in her life to make it sad, or sordid or interesting
    . . . Louisa Harris and romance! . . . Why, she was not even pretty. She
    had neither violet eyes nor hair of ruddy gold. The latter was brown and
    the former were gray. . . . How could romance come in the way of gray eyes,
    and of a girl named Louisa?</p>
  <p>Can you conceive, for instance, one of those adorable detrimentals of low
    degree and empty pocket who have a way of arousing love in the hearts of
    the beautiful daughters of irascible millionaires, can you conceive such
    an interesting personage, I say, falling in love with Louisa Harris?</p>
  <p>I confess that I cannot. To begin with, dear, kind Squire Harris was not
    altogether a millionaire, and not at all irascible, and penniless owners
    of romantic personalities were not on his visiting list.</p>
  <p>Therefore Louisa, living a prosy life of luxury, got up every morning, ate
    a copious breakfast, walked out with the dogs, hunted in the autumn, skated
    in the winter, did the London season, and played tennis in the summer, just
    as hundreds and hundreds of other well-born, well-bred English girls of average
    means, average positions, average education, hunt, dance, and play tennis
    throughout the length and breadth of this country.</p>
  <p>There was no room for romance in such a life, no time for it. . . . The
    life itself was so full already&mdash;so full of the humdrum of daily rounds,
    of common tasks, that the heart which beat with such ordinary regularity
    in the seemingly ordinary breast of a very ordinary girl did so all unconscious
    of the intense pathos which underlay this very ordinary existence.</p>
  <p>Vaguely Louisa knew that somewhere, beyond even the land of dreams, there
    lay, all unknown, all mysterious, a glorious world of romance: a universe
    peopled by girlish imaginings, and the sensitive, creating thoughts of poets,
    by the galloping phantasies of super-excited brains, and the vague longings
    of ambitious souls: a universe wherein dwelt alike the memories of those
    who have loved and the hopes of those who suffer. But when she thought of
    it all, she did so as one who from the arid plain gazes on the cool streams
    and golden minarets which the fairy Fata Morgana conjures on the horizon
    far away. She looked on it as all unreal and altogether beyond her ken. She
    shut her eyes to the beautiful mirage, her heart against its childish yearnings.</p>
  <p>Such things did not exist. They were not for her&mdash;Louisa Harris. The
    little kitchenmaid at the court who, on Sunday evenings, went off giggling,
    her chubby face glowing with pride and the result of recent ablutions, on
    the arm of Jim the third gardener, knew more about that world of romance
    than well-bred, well-born young ladies ever dreamed of in their commonplace
    philosophy.</p>
  <p>And Louisa Harris had always shut down the book which spoke of such impossible
    things, and counted herself one of the strong ones of the earth.</p>
  <p>Therefore now, with Luke&rsquo;s letter in her hand, in which he tells her
    in a very few words that he loves her beyond anything on earth, and that
    he only waits the day when he can call her his own, his very own dearly loved
    wife, why should Louisa&mdash;prosy, healthy-minded, healthy-bodied Louisa&mdash;suddenly
    imagine that the whole world is transfigured?&mdash;that the hotel room is
    a kind of ante-chamber to heaven?&mdash;that the red velvet, uncompromising
    chairs are clouds of a roseate hue and that the bronze Psyche with the broken
    thigh is the elusive fairy who, with Morgana-like wand, hath conjured up
    this mirage of glorious visions which mayhap would vanish again before long?</p>
  <p>She went up to the window and rested her forehead against the cool pane.
    She might be ever so strong, she could not help her forehead feeling hot
    and her eyes being full of tears&mdash;tears that did not hurt as they fell.</p>
  <p>Outside the weather was indeed prosy and commonplace. Rain was coming down
    in torrents and beating against the newspaper kiosk over the way, on the
    roofs of tramways and taxi-autos, making the electric light peep dimly through
    the veil of wet, drowning, by its incessant patter, to which the gusts of
    a November gale made fitful if loud accompaniment, the shouts of the <i>cochers</i> on
    their boxes, the rattle of wheels on the stone pavement, even at times the
    shrill whistle for cabs emanating from the porch of the brilliantly lighted
    Palace Hotel.</p>
  <p>It was close on half-past six by the clock of the Gare du Nord opposite.
    The express from Ostend had just come in&mdash;very late of course, owing
    to the gale which had delayed the mail boat. Louisa, straining her eyes,
    watched the excited crowd pouring out of the station in the wake of porters
    and of piles of luggage, jabbering, shouting, and fussing like an army of
    irresponsible pigmies: men in blouses, and men in immaculate bowler hats,
    women wrapped in furs, clinging to gigantic headgear that threatened to leave
    the safe refuge of an elaborate coiffure or of well fixed gargantuan hatpins,
    midinettes in fashionable skirts and high-heeled shoes, country women in
    wool shawls that flapped round their bulky forms like the wings of an overfed
    bat, all hurrying and jostling one another in a mad endeavour to avoid the
    onrush of the innumerable taxi-autos which in uncountable numbers wound in
    and out of the slower moving traffic like the erratic thread of some living,
    tangled skein.</p>
  <p>Just the every-day prosy life of a small but ambitious capital struggling
    in the midst of an almost overpowering sense of responsibility toward the
    whole of Europe in view of its recent great Colonial expansion.</p>
  <p>Louisa gave an impatient sigh.</p>
  <p>Even the strong ones of the earth get wearied of the daily round, the common
    task at times. She and aunt were due to dine at the British Embassy at eight
    o&rsquo;clock; it was only half-past six now and obviously impossible to
    sit another two hours in this unresponsive hotel room in the company of red
    velvet chairs and the bronze Psyche.</p>
  <p>Aunt, in conjunction with her maid Annette, was busy laying the foundations
    of an elaborate toilette. Louisa was free to do as she pleased. She got a
    serviceable ulster and a diminutive hat and sallied forth into the streets.
    She did not want to think or to dream, nor perhaps did she altogether wish
    to work off that unusual feeling of excitement which had so unaccountably
    transformed her ever since Luke&rsquo;s letter had come.</p>
  <p>All she wanted was to be alone, and to come out of herself for awhile. She
    had been alone all the afternoon, save for that brief half hour when aunt
    discussed the obvious over a badly brewed cup of tea: it was not that kind
    of &ldquo;alone-ness&rdquo;  which Louisa wanted now, but rather the solitude
    which a crowded street has above all the power to give.</p>
  <p>There is a kind of sociability in any room, be it ever so uncompromising
    in the matter of discomfort, but a crowded street can be unutterably lonely,
    either cruelly so or kindly as the case may be.</p>
  <p>To Louisa Harris, the commonplace society girl, accustomed to tea fights,
    to dances and to dinner parties, the loneliness of this crowded little city
    was eminently welcome. With her dark ulster closely buttoned to the throat,
    the small hat tied under her chin, with everything on her weather-proof and
    unfashionable, she attracted no notice from the passers-by.</p>
  <p>Not one head was turned as, with a long breath of delight, she sallied forth
    from under the portico of the hotel out into the muddy, busy street; not
    one glance of curiosity or interest so freely bestowed in the streets of
    foreign capitals on a solitary female figure, if it be young and comely,
    followed this very ordinary-looking English miss.</p>
  <p>To the crowd she was indifferent. These men and women hurrying along, pushing,
    jostling, and scurrying knew nothing of Luke, nor that she, Louisa Harris,
    was the happiest woman on earth.</p>
  <p>She turned back toward the Boulevard, meaning to take a brisk walk all along
    the avenue of trees which makes a circuit round the inner part of the town
    and which ultimately would lead her back to the Gare du Nord and the Palace
    Hotel. It was a walk she had often done before: save for one or two busy
    corners on the way, it would be fairly solitary and peaceful.</p>
  <p>Louisa stepped out with an honest British tread, hands buried in the pockets
    of her serviceable ulster, head bent against the sudden gusts of wind. She
    did not mind the darkness of the ill-lighted, wide boulevard, and had every
    intention of covering the two miles in a little more than half an hour.</p>
  <p>How the time sped! It seemed as if she had only just left the hotel, and
    already surely not a quarter of a mile away she could see glimmering the
    lights of the Place Namur, the half-way point of her walk.</p>
  <p>She was in the Boulevard Waterloo where private houses with closed porte-coch&egrave;res
    add nothing to the municipal lighting of the thoroughfare.</p>
  <p>Trams had been rushing past her in endless succession: but now there was
    a lull. Close by her a taxi-auto whizzed quickly past and came to a standstill
    some hundred yards away, near the pavement, and not far from an electric
    light standard.</p>
  <p>Louisa, with vacant eyes attached on that cab, but with her mind fixed on
    a particular room in a particular house in Grosvenor Square where lived a
    man of the name of Luke de Mountford, continued her walk. Those same vacant
    eyes of hers presently saw the chauffeur of the taxi-auto get down from his
    box and open the door of the cab, and then her absent mind was suddenly brought
    back from Grosvenor Square, London, to the Boulevard Waterloo in Brussels,
    by a terrible cry of horror which had broken from that same chauffeur&rsquo;s
    lips. Instinctively Louisa hurried on, but, even as she did so, a small crowd
    which indeed seemed to have sprung from nowhere had already gathered round
    the vehicle.</p>
  <p>Murmurs of &ldquo;What is it? What is it?&rdquo; mingled with smothered
    groans of terror, as curiosity caused one or two of the more bold to peer
    into the gloomy depths of the cab. Shrill calls brought a couple of <i>gardiens</i> to
    the spot. In a moment Louisa found herself a unit in an eager, anxious crowd,
    asking questions, conjecturing, wondering, horror-struck as soon as a plausible
    and graphic explanation came from those who were in the fore-front and were
    privileged to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man&mdash;murdered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The chauffeur got down from his box . . . and looked in . . . ah, <i>mon
      Dieu</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man . . . he is quite young . . . only about twenty years of age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed through the neck&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed?&mdash;Bah?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right through the neck I tell you . . . just below the ear. I can
    see the wound, quite small as if done with a skewer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Allons! Voyons! Voyons!</i>&rdquo; came the gruff accents from
    the two portly <i>gardiens</i> who worked vigorously with elbows and even
    feet to keep the crowd somewhat at bay.</p>
  <p>Louisa was on the fringe of the crowd. She could see nothing of course&mdash;she
    did not wish to see that which the chauffeur saw when first he opened the
    door of his cab&mdash;but she stood rooted to the spot, feeling that strange,
    unexplainable fascination which one always feels, when one of those great
    life dramas of which one reads so often and so indifferently happens to be
    enacted within the close range of one&rsquo;s own perception.</p>
  <p>She gleaned a phrase here and there&mdash;saw the horror-stricken faces
    of those who had seen, the placid, bovine expression of the two <i>gardiens</i>,
    more inured to such sights and calmly taking notes by the light of the electric
    standard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But to think that I drove that rascally murderer in my cab, and put
    him down safe and sound not ten minutes ago!&rdquo; came with the adjunct
    of a loud oath from the irate chauffeur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it all occur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>gardiens</i> tried to stem the flow of the driver&rsquo;s eloquence;
    such details should first be given to the police. <i>Voyons!</i> But what
    were two fat <i>mouchards</i> against twenty stalwart idlers all determined
    to hear&mdash;and then there were the women&mdash;they were determined to
    know more.</p>
  <p>Louisa bent her ear to listen. She was just outside the crowd&mdash;not
    a part of it&mdash;and there was no really morbid curiosity in her. It was
    only the call of the imagination which is irresistible on these occasions&mdash;the
    prosy, matter-of-fact, high-bred girl could not, just then, tear herself
    away from that cab and the tragedy which had been enacted therein, in the
    mysterious darkness whilst the unconscious driver sped along, ignorant of
    the gruesome burden which he was dragging to its destination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Voila!</i>&rdquo; he was saying with many ejaculations and expletives,
    and a volley of excited gestures. &ldquo;Outside the <i>Parc</i> near the
    theatre two bourgeois hailed me, and one of them told me to draw up at the
    top of the Galerie St. Hubert, which I did. The same one&mdash;the one who
    had told me where to go&mdash;got out, clapped the door to and spoke a few
    words to his friend who had remained inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I couldn&rsquo;t hear and I didn&rsquo;t listen. But after that
    he told me to drive on to Boulevard Waterloo No. 34 and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You suspected nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, how should I? Two bourgeois get into my cab; I see nothing;
    I hear nothing. One of them gets out and tells me to drive on farther. How
    should I think there&rsquo;s anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was the other man like? The one who spoke to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i> I don&rsquo;t know. . . . It was raining so fast and
    pitch dark just outside the <i>Parc</i> lights&mdash;and he did seem to keep
    in the shadow&mdash;now I come to think of it&mdash;and his cap&mdash;he
    wore a cap&mdash;was pulled well over his face&mdash;and the collar of his
    coat was up to his nose. It was raining so, I didn&rsquo;t really see him
    properly. I saw the other one better&mdash;the one who has been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the rotund <i>gardiens</i> had had enough of this. Moreover, they would
    hear all about it at full length presently. As for the crowd&mdash;it had
    no business to know too much.</p>
  <p>They hustled the excited driver back on to his box, and themselves got into
    the cab beside it&mdash;the dead man, stabbed in the neck from ear to ear&mdash;the
    wound quite small as if it had been done with a skewer.</p>
  <p>The <i>gardiens</i> ordered the chauffeur to drive to the commissariat,
    and Louisa turned away with a slight shiver down her spine and her throat
    choked with the horror of what she had only guessed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    Once More The Obvious</b></h2>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t suppose for a moment, I hope, that a girl like Louisa would
    allow her mind to dwell on such horrors. Mysterious crimes in strange cities&mdash;and
    in London, too, for a matter of that&mdash;are, alas! of far too frequent
    occurrence to be quite as startling as they should be.</p>
  <p>A day or two later, Louisa Harris and her aunt, Lady Ryder, crossed over
    to England. They had spent five weeks in Italy and one in Brussels, not with
    a view to dreaming over the beauties of the Italian Lakes, or over the art
    treasures collected in the museums of Brussels, but because Lady Ryder had
    had a bronchial catarrh which she could not shake off and so her doctor had
    ordered her a thorough change. Bellaggio was selected, and Louisa accompanied
    her. They stayed at the best hotels both in Bellaggio and in Brussels, where
    Lady Ryder had several friends whom she wished to visit before she went home.</p>
  <p>Nothing whatever happened that should not have happened; everything was
    orderly and well managed; the courier and the maid saw to tickets and to
    luggage, to hotel rooms and sleeping compartments. It was obviously their
    mission in life to see that nothing untoward or unexpected happened, but
    only the obvious.</p>
  <p>It was clearly not their fault that Miss Harris had seen a cab in which
    an unknown man happened to have been murdered.</p>
  <p>Louisa, with a view to preventing her aunt from going to sleep after dinner
    and thereby spoiling her night&rsquo;s rest, had told her of the incident
    which she had witnessed in the Boulevard Waterloo, and Lady Ryder was genuinely
    shocked. She vaguely felt that her niece had done something unladylike and
    odd, which was so unlike Louisa.</p>
  <p>The latter had amused herself by scanning a number of English papers in
    order to find out what was said in London about that strange crime, which
    she had almost witnessed&mdash;the man stabbed through the neck, from ear
    to ear, and the wound so small it might have been done with a skewer. But,
    with characteristic indifference, London paid but little heed to the mysterious
    dramas of a sister city. A brief account of the gruesome discovery&mdash;a
    figurative shrug of the shoulders as to the incompetence of the Belgian police,
    who held neither a clue to the perpetrator of the crime nor to the identity
    of the victim. Just a stranger&mdash;an idler. Brussels was full of strangers
    just now. His nationality? who knows? His individuality? there seemed no
    one to care. The police were active no doubt, but so far they had discovered
    nothing.</p>
  <p>Two men, the murderer and the murdered, engulfed in that great whirlpool
    known as humanity, small units of no importance, since no one seemed to care.
    Interesting to the detective whose duty it was to track the crime to its
    perpetrator. Interesting to the reporter who could fill a column with accounts
    of depositions, of questionings, of examinations. Interesting to the after-dinner
    talker who could expatiate over the moral lessons to be drawn from the conception
    of such a crime.</p>
  <p>But the murdered man goes to his grave unknown: and the murderer wanders
    Cain-like on the face of the earth&mdash;as mysterious, as unknown, as silent
    as his victim.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    And Now Almost Like A Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Everything went on just as convention&mdash;whose mouth-piece for the moment
    happened to be Lady Ryder&mdash;desired; just as Louisa surmised that everything
    would; the letters of congratulations; the stately visits from and to Lord
    Radclyffe, Luke&rsquo;s uncle; the magnificent diamond tiara from the latter;
    the rope of pearls from Luke; the silver salvers and inkstands and enamel
    parasol handles from everybody who was anybody in London society.</p>
  <p>Louisa&rsquo;s portrait and that of Luke hastily and cheaply reproduced
    in the halfpenny dailies, so that she looked like a white negress with a
    cast in her eye, and he like the mutilated hero of <i>L&rsquo;Homme Qui Rit</i>;
    the more elegant half-tone blocks in the sixpenny weeklies under the popular
    if somewhat hackneyed heading of &ldquo;The Earl of Radclyffe&rsquo;s heir
    and his future bride, Miss Louisa Harris&rdquo;; it was all there, just as
    it had been for hundreds of other girls and hundreds of other young men before
    Louisa had discovered that there was only one man in the whole wide world,
    and that, beyond the land of diamond tiaras and of society weddings, there
    was a fairy universe, immense and illimitable, whereon the sun of happiness
    never set and whither no one dared venture alone, only hand in hand with
    that other being, the future mate, the pupil and teacher of love, the only
    one that mattered.</p>
  <p>And the wedding was to be in four weeks from this day. The invitations were
    not out yet, for Louisa, closely pressed by Luke, had only just made up her
    mind half an hour ago about the date. Strangely enough she had been in no
    hurry for the wedding day to come. Luke had been so anxious, so crestfallen
    when she put him off with vague promises, that she herself could not account
    for this strange reticence within her&mdash;so unworthy a level-headed, conventional
    woman of the world.</p>
  <p>But the outer lobby of the fairy universe was surpassingly beautiful, and
    though the golden gates to the inner halls beyond were ajar and would yield
    to the slightest pressure of Louisa&rsquo;s slender fingers, yet she was
    glad to tarry awhile longer. Were they not hand in hand? What mattered waiting
    since eternity called beyond those golden gates?</p>
  <p>This morning, however, convention&mdash;still voiced by Lady Ryder&mdash;was
    more vigorous than was consistent with outward peace. Louisa, worried by
    aunt, and with the memory of Luke&rsquo;s expression of misery and disappointment
    when last night she had again refused to fix the wedding day, chided herself
    for her silly fancies, and at eleven o&rsquo;clock set out for a stroll in
    Battersea Park, her mind made up, her unwonted fit of sentimentality smothered
    by the louder voice of common-sense.</p>
  <p>She and Luke always took their walks abroad in Battersea Park. In the morning
    hours they were free there from perpetual meetings with undesired company&mdash;all
    outside company being undesirable in the lobby of the fairy universe. Louisa
    had promised to meet Luke in the tropical garden at half-past eleven. She
    was always punctual, and he always before his time; she smart and businesslike
    in her neat, tailor-made gown and close hat which defied wind and rain, he
    always a little shamefaced when he took her neatly gloved hand in his, as
    most English young men are apt to be when sentiment for the first time happens
    to overmaster them.</p>
  <p>To-day she saw him coming toward her just the same as on other days. He
    walked just as briskly and held himself as erect as he always did, but the
    moment that he was near enough for her to see his face she knew that there
    was something very wrong in the world and with him. Some one from the world
    of eternity beyond had seen fit to push the golden gates closer together,
    so that now they would not yield quite so easily to the soft pressure of
    a woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Luke?&rdquo; she asked very quietly, as soon as her fingers
    rested safely between his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is what?&rdquo; he rejoined foolishly and speaking like a child,
    and with a forced, almost inane-looking, smile on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; she reiterated more impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that need worry you, I think.
    Shall we sit down here? You won&rsquo;t catch cold?&rdquo; and he indicated
    a seat well sheltered against the cold breeze and the impertinent gaze of
    the passers-by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never catch cold,&rdquo; said Louisa, smiling in spite of herself
    at Luke&rsquo;s funny, awkward ways. &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t sit down.
    Let us stroll up and down, shall we? You can talk better then, and tell me
    all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to tell at present. And no occasion to worry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that worries me so much as your shilly-shallying,
    Luke, or the thought that you are making futile endeavours to keep something
    from me,&rdquo; she retorted almost irritably this time, for, strangely enough,
    her nerves&mdash;she never knew before this that she had any&mdash;were slightly
    on the jar this morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to shilly-shally, little girl,&rdquo; he replied
    gently, &ldquo;nor to keep anything from you. There, will you put your hand
    on my arm? &lsquo;Arry and &lsquo;Arriet, eh? Well! never mind. There&rsquo;s
    no one to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took her hand&mdash;that neatly gloved, small hand of hers&mdash;and
    put it under his arm. For one moment it seemed as if he would kiss that tiny
    and tantalizing place just below the thumb where the pink palm shows in the
    opening of the glove. Luke was not a demonstrative lover, he was shy and
    English and abrupt; but this morning&mdash;was it the breath of spring in
    the air, the scent of the Roman hyacinths in that bed over there, or merely
    the shadow of a tiny cloud on the uniform blue of his life&rsquo;s horizon
    that gave a certain rugged softness to his touch, as his hand lingered over
    that neat glove which nestled securely in among the folds of his coat sleeve?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; he asked with abrupt irrelevance, &ldquo;read your
    paper all through this morning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all through. Only the important headlines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you saw nothing about a claim to a peerage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! that&rsquo;s all about it. A man has sprung up from nowhere
    in particular, who claims to be my uncle Arthur&rsquo;s son, and, therefore,
    heir presumptive to the title and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke heaved a deep sigh, as if with this brief if ungrammatical statement,
    his own heart had been unburdened of a tiresome load.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your uncle Arthur?&rdquo; she repeated somewhat bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You never knew him, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I never knew him, though as a baby I
    must have seen him. I was only three, I think, when he died. But I never
    heard that he had been married. I am sure father never knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor did I, nor did Uncle Rad, nor any of us. The whole thing is either
    a thunderbolt or . . . an imposture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a little more clearly, Luke dear,
    will you? I am feeling quite muddled.&rdquo; And now it was she who led the
    way to the isolated seat beneath that group of silver birch, whose baby leaves
    trembled beneath the rough kiss of the cool April breeze.</p>
  <p>They sat down together and on the gravelled path in front of them a robin
    hopped half shyly, half impertinently, about and gazed with tiny, inquisitive
    eyes on the doings of these big folk. All around them the twitter of bird
    throats filled the air with its magic, its hymn to the reawakened earth,
    and drowned in this pleasing solitude the distant sounds of the busy city
    that seemed so far away from this secluded nook inhabited by birds and flowers,
    and by two dwellers in Fata Morgana&rsquo;s land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; said Louisa, in her most prosy, most matter
    of fact tone of voice, &ldquo;all that is known about your uncle Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, up to now, I individually knew very little about him. He was
    the next eldest brother to Uncle Rad, and my father was the youngest of all.
    When Uncle Rad succeeded to the title, Arthur was heir-presumptive of course.
    But as you know he died&mdash;as was supposed unmarried&mdash;nineteen years
    ago, and my poor dear father was killed in the hunting field the following
    year. I was a mere kid then and the others were babies&mdash;orphans the
    lot of us. My mother died when Edith was born. Uncle Rad was said to be a
    confirmed bachelor. He took us all to live with him and was father, mother,
    elder brother, elder sister to us all. Bless him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke paused abruptly, and Louisa too was silent. Only the song of a thrush
    soaring upward to the skies called for that blessing which neither of them
    at that moment could adequately evoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Louisa at last, &ldquo;I knew all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe and his people were all of the same world as herself. She
    knew all about the present man&rsquo;s touching affection for the children
    of his youngest brother, but more especially for Luke on whom he bestowed
    an amount of love and tender care which would have shamed many a father by
    its unselfish intensity. That affection was a beautiful trait in an otherwise
    not very lovable character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; resumed Luke after a little while, &ldquo;that
    I have been badly brought up. I mean in this way, that if&mdash;if the whole
    story is true&mdash;if Uncle Arthur did marry and did have a son, then I
    should have to go and shift for myself and for Jim and Frank and Edith. Of
    course Uncle Rad would do what he could for us, but I should no longer be
    his heir&mdash;and we couldn&rsquo;t go on living at Grosvenor Square and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you rambling on a little too fast, dear?&rdquo; said
    Louisa gently, whilst she beamed with an almost motherly smile&mdash;the
    smile that a woman wears when she means to pacify and to comfort&mdash;on
    the troubled face of the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; he replied more calmly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
    help it. For some days now I&rsquo;ve had a sort of feeling that something
    was going to happen&mdash;that&mdash;well, that things weren&rsquo;t going
    to go right. And this morning when I got up, I made up my mind that I would
    tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did you hear first, and from whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first thing we heard was last autumn. There came a letter from
    abroad for Uncle Rad. It hadn&rsquo;t the private mark on it, so Mr. Warren
    opened it along with the rest of the correspondence. He showed it to me.
    The letter was signed Philip de Mountford, and began, &lsquo;My dear uncle.&rsquo; I
    couldn&rsquo;t make head or tail of it; I thought it all twaddle. You&rsquo;ve
    no idea what sort of letters Uncle Rad gets sometimes from every kind of
    lunatic or scoundrel you can think of, who wants to get something out of
    him. Well, this letter at first looked to me the same sort of thing. I had
    never heard of any one who had the right to say &lsquo;dear uncle&rsquo; to
    Uncle Rad&mdash;but it had a lot in it about blood being thicker than water
    and all the rest of it, with a kind of request for justice and talk about
    the cruelty of Fate. The writer, however, asserted positively that he was
    the only legitimate son of Mr. Arthur de Mountford, who&mdash;this he professed
    to have only heard recently&mdash;was own brother to the earl of Radclyffe.
    The story which he went on to relate at full length was queer enough in all
    conscience. I remember every word of it, for it seemed to get right away
    into my brain, then and there, as if something was being hammered or screwed
    straight into one of the cells of my memory never really to come out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet when&mdash;when we were first engaged,&rdquo; rejoined Louisa
    quietly,  &ldquo;you never told me anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you directly how that was. I remembered and then
    forgot&mdash;if you know what I mean&mdash;and now it has all come back.
    At the time I thought the letter of this man who called himself Philip de
    Mountford nothing but humbug. So did Mr. Warren, and yet he and I talked
    it over and discussed it between us for ever so long. It all sounded so strange.
    Uncle Arthur&mdash;so this man said who called himself Philip de Mountford&mdash;had
    married in Martinique a half-caste girl named Adeline Petit, who was this
    same Philip&rsquo;s mother. He declares that he has all the papers&mdash;marriage
    certificates or whatever they are called&mdash;to prove every word he says.
    He did not want to trouble his uncle much, only now that his mother was dead,
    he felt all alone in the world and longed for the companionship and affection
    of his own kith and kin. All he wanted he said, was friendship. Then he went
    on to say that of course he did not expect his lordship to take his word
    for all this, he only asked for an opportunity to show his dear uncle all
    the papers and other proofs which he held that he was in real and sober truth
    the only legitimate son of Mr. Arthur de Mountford, own brother to his lordship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How old is this man&mdash;this Philip de Mountford&mdash;supposed
    to be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he said in that first letter that the marriage took place in
    the parish church of St. Pierre in Martinique on the 28th of August, 1881;
    that he himself was born the following year, and christened in the same church
    under the name of Philip Arthur, and registered as the son of Mr. Arthur
    Collingwood de Mountford of Ford&rsquo;s Mount in the county of Northampton,
    England, and of Adeline de Mountford, n&eacute;e Petit, his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-four years ago,&rdquo; said Louisa thoughtfully, &ldquo;and
    he only claims kinship with Lord Radclyffe now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just,&rdquo; rejoined Luke, &ldquo;where the curious
    part of the story comes in. This Philip de Mountford&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
    know how else to call him&mdash;said in his first letter that his mother
    never knew that Mr. Arthur de Mountford was anything more than a private
    English gentleman travelling either for profit or pleasure, but in any case
    not possessed of either wealth or social position. Between you and me, dear,
    I suppose that this Adeline Petit was just a half-caste girl, without much
    knowledge of what goes on in the world, and why she should have married Uncle
    Arthur I can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she did marry him, you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she did marry him, as you say,&rdquo; said Luke with a singular
    want of conviction, which Louisa was not slow to remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think that this young man&rsquo;s story is true then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more,&rdquo; added Louisa simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this Philip&rsquo;s story goes on to say that his father&mdash;Uncle
    Arthur&mdash;apparently soon tired of his exotic wife, for it seems that
    two years after the marriage he left Martinique and never returned to it
    to the day of his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; said Louisa in her prim little way, &ldquo;my interrupting
    you: but have any of you&mdash;Lord Radclyffe I mean, or any of your friends&mdash;any
    recollection of your uncle Arthur living at Martinique for awhile? Two years
    seems a long time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Uncle Arthur was a bit of a wastrel you know.
    He never would study for anything. He passed into the navy&mdash;very well,
    too, I believe&mdash;but he threw it all up almost as soon as he got his
    commission, and started roaming about the world. I do know for a fact that
    once his people had no news of him for about three or four years, and then
    he turned up one fine day as if he had only been absent for a week&rsquo;s
    shooting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly. I was only a tiny kid at the time,
    not more than three years old I should say. Yes, I do remember, now I come
    to think of it, that Uncle Arthur was home the Christmas after my third birthday.
    I have a distinct recollection of my dad telling me that Uncle Arthur was
    one of my presents from Father Christmas, and of my thinking what a rotten
    present it was. Later on in the nursery all of us children were rather frightened
    of him, and we used to have great discussions as to where this uncle came
    from. The Christmas present theory was soon exploded, because of some difficulty
    about Uncle Arthur not having been actually found in a stocking, and his
    being too big anyway to be hidden in one, so we fell back on Jim&rsquo;s
    suggestion that he was the man in the moon come down for a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;had your third birthday in 1883.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was the year, then, that your uncle Arthur came home from his
    wanderings about the world, during which he had never given any news of himself
    or his doings to any member of his family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Jove, Lou, what a splendid examining magistrate you&rsquo;d make!&rdquo; was
    Luke&rsquo;s unsophisticated comment on Louisa&rsquo;s last remark.</p>
  <p>But she frowned a little at this show of levity, and continued quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your uncle, according to this so-called Philip de Mountford,
    was married in 1881 in Martinique, his son was born in 1882, and he left
    Martinique in 1883 never to return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang it all, Lou!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man almost roughly, &ldquo;that
    is all surmise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it is, dear; I was only thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thinking what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That it all tallies so very exactly and that this&mdash;this Philip
    de Mountford seems in any case to know a great deal about your Uncle Arthur,
    and his movements in the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of that; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke paused a moment and a curious blush spread over his face. The Englishman&rsquo;s
    inborn dislike to talk of certain subjects to his women folk had got hold
    of him, and he did not know how to proceed.</p>
  <p>As usual in such cases the woman&mdash;unmoved and businesslike&mdash;put
    an end to his access of shyness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The matter is&mdash;or may be&mdash;too serious, dear, for you to
    keep any of your thoughts back from me at this juncture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I meant was,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;that this Philip
    might quite well be Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s son you know; but it doesn&rsquo;t
    follow that he has any right to call himself Philip de Mountford, or to think
    that he is Uncle Rad&rsquo;s presumptive heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will of course depend on his proofs&mdash;his papers and so
    on,&rdquo; she assented calmly. &ldquo;Has any one seen them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the time&mdash;it was sometime last November&mdash;that he first
    wrote to Uncle Rad, he had all his papers by him. He wrote from St. Vincent;
    have I told you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it was from St. Vincent that he wrote. He had left Martinique,
    I understand, in 1902, when St. Pierre, if you remember, was totally destroyed
    by volcanic eruption. It seems that when Uncle Arthur left the French colony
    for good, he lodged quite a comfortable sum in the local bank at St. Pierre
    in the name of Mrs. de Mountford. Of course he had no intention of ever going
    back there, and anyhow he never did, for he died about three years later.
    The lady went on living her own life quite happily. Apparently she did not
    hanker much after her faithless husband. I suppose that she never imagined
    for a moment that he meant to stick to her, and she certainly never bothered
    her head as to what his connections or friends over in England might be.
    Amongst her own kith and kin, the half-caste population of a French settlement,
    she was considered very well off, almost rich. After a very few years of
    grass-widowhood, she married again, without much scruple or compunction,
    which proves that she never thought that her English husband would come back
    to her. And then came the catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What catastrophe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The destruction of St. Pierre. You remember the awful accounts of
    it. The whole town was destroyed. Every building in the place&mdash;the local
    bank, the church, the presbytery, the post-office&mdash;was burned to the
    ground; everything was devastated for miles around. And thousands perished,
    of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. de Mountford and her son Philip were amongst the very few who
    escaped. Their cottage was burned to the ground, but she, with all a Frenchwoman&rsquo;s
    sense of respect for papers and marks of identification, fought her way back
    into the house, even when it was tottering above her head, in order to rescue
    those things which she valued more than her life, the proofs that she was
    a respectable married woman and that Philip was her lawfully begotten son.
    Her second husband&mdash;I think from reading between the lines that he was
    a native or at best a half-caste&mdash;was one of the many who perished.
    But Mrs. de Mountford and Philip managed to reach the coast unhurt and to
    put out to sea in an open boat. They were picked up by a fishing smack from
    Marie Galante and landed there. It is a small island&mdash;French settlement,
    of course&mdash;off Guadeloupe. They had little or no money, and how they
    lived I don&rsquo;t know, but they stayed in Marie Galante for some time.
    Then the mother died, and Philip made his way somehow or other to Roseau
    in Dominica and thence to St. Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last year I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she said, meditating on all that she had heard, &ldquo;it
    was in St. Vincent that he first realized who he was&mdash;or might be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, in a British colony it was bound to happen. Whether somebody
    put him up to it out there, or whether he merely sucked the information in
    from nowhere in particular, I can&rsquo;t say: certain it is that he did
    soon discover that the name he bore was one of the best known in England,
    and that his father must, as a matter of fact, have been own brother to the
    earl of Radclyffe. So he wrote to Uncle Rad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa was silent. She was absorbed in thought and for the moment Luke had
    come to the end of what he had to say&mdash;or, rather, of what he meant
    to say just now. That there was more to come, Louisa well knew. Commonplace
    women have a way of intuitively getting at the bottom of the thoughts of
    people for whom they care. Louisa guessed that beneath Luke&rsquo;s levity
    and his school-boyish slang&mdash;which grew more apparent as the man drew
    to the end of his narrative&mdash;that beneath his outward flippancy there
    lay a deep substratum of puzzlement and anxiety.</p>
  <p>The story as told by Luke sounded crude enough, almost melodramatic, right
    out of the commonplace range of Louisa&rsquo;s usual every-day life. Whilst
    she sat listening to this exotic tale of secret and incongruous marriage
    and of those earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which had seemed so remote
    when she had read about them nine years ago in the newspapers, she almost
    thought that she must be dreaming; that she would wake up presently in her
    bed at the Langham Hotel where she was staying with aunt, and that she would
    then dress and have her breakfast and go out to meet Luke, and tell him all
    about the idiotic dream she had had about an unknown heir to the Earldom
    of Radclyffe, who was a negro&mdash;or almost so&mdash;and was born in a
    country where there were volcanoes and earthquakes.</p>
  <p>How far removed from her at this moment did aunt seem, and father, and the
    twins! Surely they could not be of the same world as this exotic pretender
    to Uncle Radclyffe&rsquo;s affection, and to Luke&rsquo;s hitherto undisputed
    rights. And as father and aunt and Mabel and Chris were very much alive and
    very real, then this so-called Philip de Mountford must be a creature of
    dreams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or else an imposter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had said this aloud, thus breaking in on her own thoughts and his. A
    feeling of restlessness seized her now. She was cold, too, for the April
    breeze was biting and had searched out the back of her neck underneath the
    sable stole and caused her to shiver in the spring sunshine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us walk,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a little&mdash;shall we?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    Nothing Really Tangible</b></h2>
  <p>They walked up the gravelled walk under the chestnut trees, whereon the
    leaf buds, luscious looking, with their young green surface delicately tinged
    with pink, looked over ready to burst into fan-shaped fulness of glory. The
    well-kept paths, the orderly flower beds, and smoothly trimmed lawns looked
    all so simple, so obvious beside the strange problem which fate had propounded
    to these two young people walking up and down side by side&mdash;and with
    just a certain distance between them as if that problem was keeping them
    apart.</p>
  <p>And that intangible reality stood between them, causing in Luke a vague
    sense of shamefacedness, as if he were guilty toward Louisa, and in her a
    feeling of irritation against the whole world around her, for having allowed
    this monstrous thing to happen&mdash;this vague shadow on life&rsquo;s pathway,
    on the life of the only man who mattered.</p>
  <p>People passed them as they walked: the curious, the indifferent: men with
    bowler hats pulled over frowning brows, boys with caps carelessly thrust
    at the back of their heads, girls with numbed fingers thrust in worn gloves,
    tip-tilted noses blue with cold, thin, ill-fitting clothes scarce shielding
    attenuated shoulders against the keen spring blast.</p>
  <p>Just the humdrum, every-day crowd of London: the fighters, the workers,
    toiling against heavy odds of feeble health, insufficient food, scanty clothing,
    the poor that no one bothers about, less interesting than the unemployed
    labourer, less picturesque, less noisy, they passed and had no time to heed
    the elegantly clad figure wrapped in costly furs, or the young man in perfectly
    tailored coat, who was even now preparing himself for a fight with destiny,
    beside which the daily struggle for halfpence would be but a mere skirmish.</p>
  <p>Instinctively they knew&mdash;these two&mdash;the society girl and the easy-going
    wealthy man&mdash;that it was reality with which they would have to deal.
    That instinct comes with the breath of fate: a warning that her decrees are
    serious, not to be lightly set aside, but pondered over; that her materialized
    breath would not be a phantom or a thing to be derided.</p>
  <p>Truth or imposture? Which?</p>
  <p>Neither the man nor the girl knew as yet, but reality&mdash;whatever else
    it was.</p>
  <p>They walked on for awhile in silence. Another instinct&mdash;the conventional
    one&mdash;had warned them that their stay in the park had been unduly prolonged:
    there were social duties to attend to, calls to make, luncheon with Lord
    Radclyffe at Grosvenor Square.</p>
  <p>So they both by tacit consent turned their steps back toward the town.</p>
  <p>A man passed them from behind, walking quicker than they did. As he passed,
    he looked at them both intently, as if desirous of arresting their attention.
    Of course he succeeded, for his look was almost compelling. Louisa was the
    first to turn toward him, then Luke did likewise: and the passer-by raised
    his hat respectfully with a slight inclination of head and shoulders that
    suggested foreign upbringing.</p>
  <p>Once more convention stepped in and Luke mechanically returned the salute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; asked Louisa, when the passer-by was out of
    ear shot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Luke. &ldquo;I thought it was
    some one you knew. He bowed to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to you, I think. Funny you should not
    know him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But silence once broken, constraint fled with it. She drew nearer to Luke
    and once more her hand sought his coat sleeve, with a light pressure quickly
    withdrawn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Luke,&rdquo; she said, abruptly reverting to the subject, &ldquo;how
    do you stand in all this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. What does Lord Radclyffe say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He laughs the whole thing to scorn, and declares that the man is
    an impudent liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He saw,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;the first letter? The one that came
    from St. Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Warren and I did not think we ought to keep it from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;Then he said that the
    letter was a tissue of lies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He refused,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;to believe in the marriage
    of your uncle Arthur out there in Martinique?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t go into details. He just said that the whole letter
    was an impudent attempt at blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And since then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has never spoken about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until to-day?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t spoken,&rdquo; he replied, insisting on the word, &ldquo;even
    to-day. Two or three times I think letters came for him in the same handwriting.
    Mr. Warren did not open them, of course, and took them straight to Uncle
    Rad. They always bore foreign postmarks, some from one place, some from another;
    but Uncle Rad never referred to them after he had read them, nor did he instruct
    Mr. Warren to reply. Then the letters ceased, and I began to forget the whole
    business. I didn&rsquo;t tell you, because Uncle Rad told me not to talk
    about the whole thing. It was beneath contempt, he said, and he didn&rsquo;t
    want the tittle-tattle to get about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A week ago a letter came with a London postmark on it. The address
    and letter were both type-written, and the latter covered four sheets of
    paper, and was signed Philip de Mountford. Bar the actual story of the marriage
    and all that, the letter was almost identical to the first one which came
    from St. Vincent. Mr. Warren had opened it, for it looked like a business
    one, and he waited for me in his office to ask my opinion about it. Of course
    we had to give it to Uncle Rad. It had all the old phrases in it about blood
    being thicker than water, and about longing for friendship and companionship,
    and all that. There was no hint of threats or demand for money or anything
    like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Whilst Lord Radclyffe is alive,
    the young man has no claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;that of kinship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe need not do anything for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already there was a note of hostility in Louisa&rsquo;s even voice. The
    commonplace woman was donning armour against the man who talked of usurping
    the loved one&rsquo;s privileges.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;that I could have got the letter
    from Uncle Rad to show you. It was so simple and so sensible. All he asks
    is just to see Uncle Rad personally, to feel that he has kindred in the world.
    He knows, he says, that, beyond good-will, he has no claim now. As a matter
    of fact, he has something more substantial than that, for Uncle Arthur had
    a little personal property, about fifteen thousand pounds, which he left
    to us four children&mdash;Jim and Frank and Edie and me, and which I for
    one wouldn&rsquo;t touch if I knew for certain that this Philip was his son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;you say that the man does not speak
    of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She hated the talk about money: for she had all that contempt for it which
    women have who have never felt the want of it. It would have been so simple
    if the intruder had only wanted money. She would not have cared a little
    bit if Luke had none, or was not going to have any. It was his right which
    she would not hear of being questioned; his right in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s
    affections, in his household, and also his rights in the future when Lord
    Radclyffe would be gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are sure,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;that he does not want money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that he does, just
    now. He seems to have a little; he must have had a little, since he came
    over from St. Vincent and is staying at a moderately good hotel in London.
    No. He wants to see Uncle Rad, because he thinks that, if Uncle Rad saw him,
    blood would cry out in response. It appears that now he has lodged all his
    papers of identification with a London lawyer&mdash;a very good firm, mind
    you&mdash;and he wants Uncle Rad&rsquo;s solicitor to see all the papers
    and to examine them. That seems fair to me, doesn&rsquo;t it to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very fair indeed,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I mean,&rdquo; he added with great conviction, &ldquo;is that
    if those papers weren&rsquo;t all right, he wouldn&rsquo;t be so anxious
    for Uncle Rad&rsquo;s solicitors to have a look at them, would he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And after awhile she reiterated more emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;that the whole thing simply
    beats me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what does Lord Radclyffe say now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say. He won&rsquo;t talk about the thing. He won&rsquo;t
    discuss it. He won&rsquo;t answer any question which I put to him. &lsquo;My
    dear boy, the man is a palpable, impudent impostor, a blackmailer&rsquo; and
    that&rsquo;s all I can get out of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t see the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t he let his solicitor&mdash;Mr. Dobson, isn&rsquo;t
    it?&mdash;meet the other lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says he wouldn&rsquo;t dream of wasting old Dobson&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a talk about it all with Mr. Dobson, and see
    what he says?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t very well do that. Strictly speaking it&rsquo;s none
    of my business&mdash;as yet. I couldn&rsquo;t consult Uncle Rad&rsquo;s lawyers,
    without Uncle Rad&rsquo;s consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another one then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged his shoulders, obviously undecided what to do. He had thought
    very little about himself or his future in all this: his thoughts had dwelt
    mostly on Lord Radclyffe&mdash;father, mother, brother, sister to them all.
    Bless him! And then he had thought of her. He looked round him with eyes
    that scarcely saw, for they really were turned inward to his own simple soul,
    and to his loving heart. Right up against that very simplicity of soul, a
    duty stood clear and uncompromising. A duty yet to be performed, the real
    aim and end of all that he had said so far. But he did not know how best
    to perform such a duty.</p>
  <p>Simple souls&mdash;unlike the complex psychological phenomena of modern
    times&mdash;are apt to be selfless, to think more of the feelings of others,
    than of analyzing their own various sensations; and Luke knew that what he
    considered his duty would not be quite so obvious to Louisa, and that by
    fulfilling it he would give her pain.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    Just An Obvious Duty</b></h2>
  <p>But it was she who gave him an opening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very well, but the matter
    does concern you in a way; far more so, in fact, than it does Lord Radclyffe.
    Nothing can make any difference to Lord Radclyffe, but if what this young
    man asserts is all true, then it will make a world of difference to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that. That&rsquo;s just the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were thinking of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I was thinking of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said now very abruptly, quite roughly and crudely,
    not choosing his words lest they helped to betray what he felt, and all that
    he felt. &ldquo;If what this man says is true, then I am a penniless nonentity
    whom you are not going to marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are talking nonsense, Luke, and you know it,&rdquo; was all she
    said. And she said it very quietly, very decisively. He was talking nonsense,
    of course, for, whatever happened or didn&rsquo;t happen, there was one thing
    in the world that was absolutely, undeniably impossible, and that was that
    she should not marry Luke.</p>
  <p>Whilst she Louisa Harris, plain, uninteresting, commonplace Louisa Harris
    was of this world, her marriage with Luke must be. People, in this present
    day, matter-of- fact world, didn&rsquo;t have their hearts wrenched out of
    them; they were not made to suffer impossible and unendurable tortures; then
    why should she Louisa Harris, be threatened with such a cataclysm?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; he was saying rather tonelessly, &ldquo;talking
    nonsense, Lou. I have thought all that over. It&rsquo;s over eight days since
    that letter came; eight times twenty-four hours since I seemed in a way to
    see all my future through a thick, black cloud, and I&rsquo;ve had time to
    think. I saw you too, through that thick, black cloud&mdash;I saw you just
    as you are, exquisite, beautiful, like a jewel that should forever remain
    in a perfect setting. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He broke off abruptly, and, mechanically, his hand went up to his forehead
    and eyes. Where was he? He gave a sudden, quaint laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a drivelling fool you must think me, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked straight at him, pure of soul, simple of heart, with a passion
    of tenderness and self-abnegation as yet dormant beneath the outer crust
    of a conventional education and of commonplace surroundings, but with the
    passion there nevertheless. And it was expressed in the sudden, strange luminosity
    of her eyes&mdash;I would not have you think that they were tears&mdash;as
    they met and held his own.</p>
  <p>They didn&rsquo;t say anything more just then. People of their type and
    class in England do not say much, you know, under such circumstances. They
    have been drilled not to: drilled and drilled from childhood upward, from
    the time when, after a fall and a cut lip or broken tooth, the tears have
    to be held back, lest the words &ldquo;snivel&rdquo;  or &ldquo;cry-baby&rdquo; be
    mentioned. But quietude does not necessarily mean freedom from pain. A cut
    lip hurts worse when it is not wetted with tears.</p>
  <p>It was only the shadow that was hovering over these two as yet: nothing
    really tangible. And the shadow was not between them. She would not let it
    come between them. If it covered him, it should wrap her too. The commonplace
    woman had no fear of its descent, only as far as it affected him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said after awhile, &ldquo;could make a difference
    to our marriage, Luke. Except, of course, if you ceased to care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or you, Lou,&rdquo; he suggested meekly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;that I should? Just because
    you had no money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; he owned, &ldquo;because of that. But I should be such
    a nonentity. I have no real profession, and there are the others. Jim in
    the Blues costs a fearful lot a year, and Frank in the diplomatic service
    must have his promised allowance. I have read for the bar, but beyond that
    what am I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s right hand,&rdquo; she retorted firmly, &ldquo;his
    agent, his secretary, his factotum, all rolled into one. You manage his estates,
    his charities, his correspondence. You write his speeches and control his
    household. Lord Radclyffe&mdash;every one says it in London&mdash;would not
    be himself at all without Luke de Mountford behind him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment then added with seeming irrelevance :</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all know that Uncle Rad is a curious kind of man. If this story
    turns out to be true, he would still say nothing, but he would fret and fret
    and worry himself into his grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; she argued obstinately, &ldquo;will not turn out
    to be true. It&rsquo;s not like you, Luke, to jump at conclusions, or to
    be afraid of a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; he rejoined simply. &ldquo;But I must look
    at possibilities. Yes, dear,&rdquo; he continued more forcibly, &ldquo;it
    is possible that this story is true. No good saying that it is impossible:
    improbable if you like, but not impossible. Look at it how you like, you
    must admit that it is not impossible. Uncle Arthur may have married in Martinique;
    he was out there in 1881; he may have had a son; his telling no one about
    his marriage is not to be wondered at; he was always reticent and queer about
    his own affairs. This Philip may possibly be Uncle Rad&rsquo;s sole and rightful
    heir, and I may possibly be a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She uttered an exclamation of incredulity. Luke, a beggar! Luke the one
    man in all the world, different from every other man! Luke ousted by that
    stranger upstart!</p>
  <p>God hath too much sense of humour to allow so ridiculous a Fate to work
    her silly caprice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she said with scorn, &ldquo;because of all these absurd
    possibilities you talk of breaking off your engagement to me. Do you care
    so little as all that, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not reply, but continued to walk beside her, just a yard or so apart
    from her, turning his steps in the direction of the gates, toward the Albert
    Bridge, their nearest way home. She&mdash;meekly now, for already she was
    sorry&mdash;turned to look at him. Something in his attitude, the stoop of
    the shoulders, usually so square and erect, the hands curiously clasped behind
    his back, told her that her shaft&mdash;very thoughtlessly aimed&mdash;had
    struck even deeper than it should.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, dear,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
  <p>His look forgave her, even before the words were fully out of her mouth,
    but with characteristic reticence, he made no reply to her taunt. Strangely
    enough she was satisfied that he should say nothing. The look, which did
    not reproach even whilst it tried to conceal the infinite depth of the wound
    so lightly dealt, had told her more than any words could do. Whatever Luke
    decided to do, it would be from a sense of moral obligation, that desire
    for doing the right thing&mdash;in the worldly sense of the term&mdash;which
    is inherent in Englishmen of a certain class. No sentiment save that of a
    conventional one of honour would be allowed to sway her destiny and his.</p>
  <p>Conventionality&mdash;that same strained sense of honour and duty&mdash;decreed
    that under certain mundane circumstances a man and woman should not mate.
    Differences of ancestry, of parentage, of birth and of country, divergence
    of taste, of faith, of belief&mdash;all these matter not one jot. But let
    the man be beggared and the woman rich, and convention steps in and says, &ldquo;It
    shall not be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These two bowed to that decree: unconventional, in so far that they both
    made the sacrifice out of the intense purity of their sentiment to one another.
    They made an absolutely worldly sacrifice for a wholly unworldly motive.
    Luke would as soon have thought of seeing Louisa in a badly fitting serge
    frock, and paying twopence for a two-mile ride in an omnibus, as he would
    expect to see a diamond tiara packed in a card-board box, it would be unfair
    on the jeweller who had made the tiara thus to subject it to rough treatment;
    and it would be equally unfair on the Creator of Louisa to let her be buffeted
    about by the cruder atoms of this world.</p>
  <p>Louisa only thought of Luke and that perhaps he would feel happier in his
    mind if she allowed him to make this temporary sacrifice.</p>
  <p>There is such wonderful balm in self-imposed sacrifice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she asked simply, &ldquo;do you want me to say, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only that&mdash;that you won&rsquo;t give me up altogether unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he checked himself abruptly. Was there ever an Englishman born who
    could talk sentiment at moments such as this? Luke was no exception to that
    rule. There was so much that he wanted to say to Louisa, and yet the very
    words literally choked him before he could contrive to utter them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;let us even refer to
    such things, Luke. I do not believe in this shadow, and I cannot even understand
    why you should worry about it. But whatever happens, I should never give
    you up. Never. We will put off fixing the day of our wedding; since we have
    made no announcement this won&rsquo;t matter at all: but I only agree to
    this because I think that it is what you would like. I fancy that it would
    ease your mind. As for breaking our engagement in the future&mdash;in case
    the worst happens&mdash;well it shall not be with my consent, Luke, unless
    you really cease to care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They had reached the gate close to the bridge. Life pulsated all round them,
    the life of the big city, callous, noisy, and cruel. Omnibuses, cabs, heavy
    vans, rattled incessantly past them. People jostled one another, hurrying
    and scurrying, pigmies and ants adding their tiny load of work, of care,
    of sorrow to the titanic edifice of this living world.</p>
  <p>Louisa&rsquo;s last words remained unanswered. Luke had, by his silence,
    said everything there was to say. They stood on the pavement for a moment,
    and Luke hailed a passing taxicab.</p>
  <p>At the corner opposite, an omnibus pulled up on its way westward. A man
    stepped off the curb ready to enter it. Louisa caught his eye, and he raised
    his hat&mdash;the man who had passed them in the park just now.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    Just A Disagreeable Old Man</b></h2>
  <p>The luncheons at Grosvenor Square were always rather dull and formal, but
    Louisa did not mind that very much. She was used to dull and formal affairs:
    they were part and parcel of her daily life. London society is full of it.
    The dull and formal dominate; the others&mdash;vulgar if more lively&mdash;were
    not worth cultivating.</p>
  <p>Then, she almost liked Lord Radclyffe, because he was so fond of Luke. And
    even then &ldquo;almost&rdquo; was a big word. No one&mdash;except Luke&mdash;could
    really like the old man. He was very bad tempered, very dictatorial, a perfect
    tyrant in his own household. His opinions no one dared contradict, no one
    cared to argue with him, and his advanced Tory views were so rabid that he
    almost made perverts from the cause, of all those whom he desired to convince.</p>
  <p>And even these were few, for Lord Radclyffe had no friends and very few
    acquaintances. He had a strange and absolute dislike for his fellow men.
    He did not like seeing people, he hated to exchange greetings, to talk or
    to mingle with any crowd that was purely on pleasure bent. He went up to
    the House and made speeches&mdash;political, philanthropic, economic speeches&mdash;which
    Luke prepared for him, and which he spoke without enthusiasm or any desire
    to please. This he did, not because he liked it or took any interest in things
    political, philanthropic or economic, but only because he considered that
    a man in his position owed certain duties to the State&mdash;duties which
    it would be cowardly to shirk.</p>
  <p>But he really cared nothing for the thoughts of others, for their opinions,
    their joys, or their sorrows. He had schooled himself not to care, to call
    philanthropy empty sentiment, politics senseless ambition, economics grasping
    avarice.</p>
  <p>His was a life entirely wrapped up in itself. In youth he had been very
    shy: a shyness caused at first by a serious defect of speech which, though
    cured in later years, always left an unconquerable diffidence, an almost
    morbid fear of ridicule in its train.</p>
  <p>Because of this, I think, he had never been a sportsman&mdash;or, rather,
    had never been an athlete, for he was splendid with a gun and the finest
    revolver shot in England, so I&rsquo;ve been told, and an acknowledged master
    of fence, but with bat, ball, or racquet he was invariably clumsy.</p>
  <p>He had always hated to be laughed at, and therefore had never gone through
    the rough mill of a tyro in athletics or in games. Arthur, one of his brothers,
    had been a blue at Oxford; the other one, James&mdash;you remember James
    de Mountford? was the celebrated cricketer; but he, the eldest, always seemed
    to remain outside that magic circle of sport, the great ring of many links
    which unites Englishmen one to another in a way that no other conformity
    of tastes, of breeding, or of religion can ever do.</p>
  <p>Because of this diffidence too, no doubt, he had never married. I was told
    once by an intimate friend of his, that old Rad&mdash;as he was universally
    called&mdash;had never mustered up sufficient courage to propose to any woman.
    And as he saw one by one the coveted matrimonial prizes&mdash;the pretty
    girls whom at different times he had admired sufficiently to desire for wife&mdash;snapped
    up by more enterprising wooers, his dour moroseness grew into positive chronic
    ill-humour.</p>
  <p>He liked no one and no one liked him: and during sixty years of life he
    had succeeded in eliminating from his entire being every feeling of sentiment
    save one. He had to all appearances an absolutely callous heart: he cared
    neither for dog nor horse&mdash;he ordered a splendid mare to be shot without
    the slightest compunction after she had carried him in the hunting field
    and in the park faithfully and beautifully for over eight years, just because
    she had shied at a motor-car and nearly thrown him. He was not cruel, you
    know, just callous in all respects save one: void of all sentiment&mdash;he
    called it sentimentality&mdash;save in his affection for Luke.</p>
  <p>Luke had been&mdash;ever since he was a growing lad&mdash;the buffer in
    the establishment between the irascible master and the many subordinates.
    From Mr. Warren&mdash;the highly paid and greatly snubbed secretary&mdash;down
    to the maids below stairs, one and all brought troubles, complaints, worries
    to Mr. Luke. No one dared approach his lordship. A word out of season brought
    instant dismissal, and no one thought of leaving a place where, besides excellent
    wages, there was the pleasure of waiting on Mr. Luke. Never Mr. de Mountford,
    you notice, always Mr. Luke. He had grown up amongst the household; Winston,
    the old coachman, had taught him to ride; Mary, now housekeeper, then a nurse,
    had bathed him in a wash-hand basin when he was less than eighteen inches
    long.</p>
  <p>Therefore the atmosphere of the gloomy old house pleased Louisa Harris.
    With the perfect and unconscious selfishness of a woman in love, she gauged
    everything in life just as it affected Luke. She even contrived to like Lord
    Radclyffe. He trod on every one of her moral and spiritual corns, it is true;
    he had that lofty contempt for the entire feminine sex which pertains to
    the Oriental, more than to the more civilized Western races; he combated
    her opinions, both religious and political, without any pretence at deference;
    he smoked very strong cigars in every room in the house, without the slightest
    regard for the feelings of his lady visitors; he did or left undone a great
    many other things which would tend to irritate and even to offend a woman
    accustomed to the conventional courtesies of daily social life; but when
    Luke entered a room, where, but a moment ago, Lord Radclyffe had been venting
    his chronic ill-humour on an offending or innocent subordinate, the old man&rsquo;s
    dour face would become transfigured, irradiated with a look of pride and
    of joy at sight of the man on whom he had lavished all the affection of which
    his strong nature was capable.</p>
  <p>Luke could do no wrong. Luke was always right. He could argue with his lordship,
    contradict him, obtain anything he liked from him. Eternal contradictions
    of human nature: the childless man in perfect adoration before a brother&rsquo;s
    son; the callous, hard-hearted misanthrope soft as wax in the hands of one
    man.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    The Part Played By A Five-Pound Note</b></h2>
  <p>And it was into this atmosphere of gloom and of purposeless misanthropy
    that Louisa Harris brought this morning the cheering sunshine of her own
    indomitable optimism.</p>
  <p>She knew of course from the first that the subject which interested every
    one in the house more than any other subject could ever do was not to be
    mentioned in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s presence. But she was quite shrewd enough
    to see that dear old Luke&mdash;unsophisticated and none too acute an observer&mdash;had
    overestimated his uncle&rsquo;s indifference to the all-absorbing matter.</p>
  <p>The old man&rsquo;s face&mdash;usually a mirror of contemptuous cynicism&mdash;looked,
    to the woman&rsquo;s keener insight, distinctly troubled, and his surly silence
    was even more profound than hitherto.</p>
  <p>He hardly did more than bid Louisa a curt, &ldquo;How de do?&rdquo; when
    she entered, and then relapsed into moroseness wholly unbroken before luncheon
    was announced.</p>
  <p>Jim&mdash;&ldquo;in the Blues&rdquo;&mdash;was there when she arrived, and
    Edie came in a few moments later, breathless and with hat awry and tawny
    hair flying in all directions, straight from a tussle with the dogs and the
    sharp wind in the park.</p>
  <p>Evidently no secret had been made before these two of the strange events
    which had culminated this very morning in their brother&rsquo;s avowal to
    Louisa, and the postponement <i>sine die</i> of the wedding. But equally
    evidently these young creatures absorbed in their own life, their own pursuits
    and amusements, were not inclined to look on the matter seriously.</p>
  <p>Their sky had been so absolutely cloudless throughout their lives that it
    was impossible for them at the moment to realize that the dark shadow on
    the distant horizon might possibly conceal thunder in its filmy bosom.</p>
  <p>Edie&mdash;just over twenty years of age and already satiated with the excitement
    of three London seasons, her mind saturated with novel reading and on the
    lookout for some new sensations&mdash;was inclined to look on the affair
    as an exhilarating interlude between the Shrove Tuesday dance at Wessex House
    and the first Drawing-Room in May. Jim&mdash;&ldquo;in the Blues&rdquo;&mdash;very
    eligible as a possible husband for the daughters of ambitious mammas, a trifle
    spoiled, a little slow of wit, and not a little self-satisfied&mdash;dismissed
    the whole incident as &ldquo;tommy-rot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Louisa first greeted them, Edie had whispered excitedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has he told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without waiting for a direct reply had continued, with unabated eagerness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful exciting, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Jim with the elegant drawl peculiar to his kind had suppressed further
    confidences by an authoritative:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awful rot I call it, don&rsquo;t you? Luke is soft to worry about
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, at luncheon it was Lord Radclyffe who brought up the subject
    matter. Edie with the tactlessness of youth had asked a point-blank question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when is that wedding to be? and what
    are we bridesmaids going to wear? I warn you I won&rsquo;t have white&mdash;I
    hate a white wedding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as no answer came she said impatiently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d name the day, you two stupids. Awfully soft I
    call it hanging about like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke would have said something then, but Louisa interposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all my fault, Edie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know I want
    to take the twins out myself this season. I must give them a real good time
    before I marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; remarked Edith unceremoniously. &ldquo;Mabel and Chris
    will have a far better time when you are married and can present them yourself.
    Tell them from me that its no fun being &lsquo;out&rsquo; and the longer
    they put it off the better they&rsquo;ll enjoy themselves later on. Besides,
    Colonel Harris will take them about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father hates sitting up late&mdash;&rdquo; hazarded Louisa, somewhat
    lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The truth of the matter is,&rdquo; here broke in Lord Radclyffe dryly, &ldquo;that
    Luke had persuaded you to put off the wedding because of this d&mdash;d impostor
    who seems to have set you all off by the ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Edie laughed and said, &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; Jim growled and murmured, &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke and Louisa were silent, the while Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s closely-set,
    dark, piercing eyes, wandered from one young face to the other. Louisa, feeling
    uncomfortable beneath that none too amiable scrutiny, did not know what to
    say, but Luke quietly remarked after awhile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, uncle. It is my doing, but Lou agrees with me,
    and we are going to wait until this cloud is properly cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If any one else had spoken so clearly and decisively in direct contradiction
    to the old man&rsquo;s obvious wishes in the matter, the result would have
    been an outburst of ill-humour and probably a volley of invectives, not unmixed
    with more forcible language. But since it was Luke who had spoken&mdash;and
    Luke could do no wrong&mdash;Lord Radclyffe responded quite gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; he said, and it was really touching to hear the
    hard voice soften and linger on the endearing words, &ldquo;I have told you
    once and for all that the story of this so-called Philip de Mountford is
    a fabrication from beginning to end. There is absolutely no reason for you
    to fret one single instant because of the lies a blackmailer chooses to trump
    up. As for your putting off your wedding one single hour because of this
    folly, why, it is positive nonsense. I should have thought you had more common-sense&mdash;and
    Miss Harris, too, for a matter of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke was silent for a moment or two while Edie tossed her irresponsible
    young head with the gesture of an absolute &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Jim
    muttered something behind his heavy cavalry moustache. Louisa, with head
    bent and fingers somewhat restless and fidgety, waited to hear what Luke
    would say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would consent, Uncle Rad to let
    Mr. Dobson go through this man&rsquo;s papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were the good of wasting Mr. Dobson&rsquo;s time?&rdquo; retorted
    Lord Radclyffe with surprising good humour. &ldquo;I know that the man is
    an impostor. I don&rsquo;t think it,&rdquo; he reiterated emphatically, &ldquo;I
    know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before the old man had time to reply, the butler&mdash;sober, solemn Parker&mdash;came
    in with a card on a salver, which he presented to his master. Lord Radclyffe
    took up the card and grunted as he glanced at it. He always grunted when
    he was threatened with visitors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said gruffly, and he threw the card back onto the
    salver,  &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you told Mr. Warren?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Warren,&rdquo; said solemn Parker, &ldquo;is out, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then ask Mr. Dobson to call another time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Mr. Dobson hisself, my lord. But a young gentleman
    from his office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell the young gentleman from the office that I haven&rsquo;t
    time to bother about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I see him, sir?&rdquo; asked Luke, ready to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; retorted the irascible old man. &ldquo;Stay
    where you are. You have got Miss Harris to entertain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The young gentleman,&rdquo; resumed Parker with respectful insistence, &ldquo;said
    he wouldn&rsquo;t keep your lordship five minutes. He said he&rsquo;d brought
    some papers for your lordship&rsquo;s signature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Tower Farm lease, Uncle Rad,&rdquo; remarked Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think, Mr. Luke,&rdquo; assented the butler, &ldquo;that the young
    gentleman did mention the word lease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why has that confounded Warren taken himself off just when I want
    him?&rdquo; was Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s gruff comment as he rose from the
    table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go, sir,&rdquo; insisted Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, hang it, boy, you can&rsquo;t sign my name&mdash;not yet anyway.
    I am not yet a helpless imbecile. Show the young man into the library, Parker.
    I can&rsquo;t think why Dobson is always in such a confounded hurry about
    leases&mdash;sending a fool of a clerk up at most inconvenient hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still muttering half audibly, he walked to the library door, which Parker
    held open for him, and even this he did not do without surreptitiously taking
    hold of Luke&rsquo;s hand and giving it a friendly squeeze. For a moment
    it seemed as if Luke would follow him, despite contrary orders. He paused,
    undecided, standing in the middle of the room, Louisa&rsquo;s kind gray eyes
    following his slightest movement.</p>
  <p>Jim stolidly pulled the cigar box toward him, and Edie, with chin resting
    in both hands, looked sulky and generally out of sorts.</p>
  <p>Parker&mdash;silent and correct of mien&mdash;had closed the library door
    behind his master, and now with noiseless tread he crossed the dining-room
    and opened the other door&mdash;the one that gave on the hall. Louisa instinctively
    turned her eyes from Luke and saw&mdash;standing in the middle of the hall&mdash;a
    young man in jacket suit and overcoat, who had looked up, with palpitating
    eagerness expressed in his face, the moment he caught sight of Parker.</p>
  <p>It was the same man who had lifted his hat to Luke and to herself in Battersea
    Park this very morning. Luke saw him too and apparently also recognized him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he bowed to us, Luke&mdash;in the park&mdash;you
    remember?&rdquo; she said as soon as the door had once more closed on Parker
    and the visitor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Funny that you didn&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; she continued since
    Luke had made no comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he remarked curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not and do not know this man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not Mr. Dobson&rsquo;s clerk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke did not answer but went out into the hall. Parker was standing beside
    the library door which he had just closed, having introduced the visitor
    into his lordship&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; said Luke abruptly, &ldquo;what made you tell his
    lordship that that young gentleman came from Mr. Dobson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The question had come so suddenly that Parker&mdash;pompous, dignified Parker&mdash;was
    thrown off his balance, and the reply which took some time in coming, sounded
    unconvincing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The young gentleman,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;told me, Mr. Luke,
    that he came from Mr. Dobson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Parker,&rdquo; asserted Luke unhesitatingly, &ldquo;he did nothing
    of the sort. He wanted to see his lordship and got you to help him concoct
    some lie whereby he could get what he wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A grayish hue spread over Parker&rsquo;s pink and flabby countenance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord help me, Mr. Luke,&rdquo; he murmured tonelessly, &ldquo;how
    did you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Luke curtly. &ldquo;I guessed. Now
    I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I was doing no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No harm by introducing into his lordship&rsquo;s presence strangers
    who might be malefactors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already Luke, at Parker&rsquo;s first admission, had gone quickly to the
    library door. Here he paused, with his hand on the latch, uncertain if he
    should enter. The house was an old one, well-built and stout; from within
    came the even sound of a voice speaking quite quietly, but no isolated word
    could be distinguished. Parker was floundering in a quagmire of confused
    explanations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Malefactor, Mr. Luke!&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;that young man was
    no malefactor. He spoke ever so nicely. And he had plenty of money about
    him. I didn&rsquo;t see I was doing no harm. He wanted to see his lordship
    and asked me to help him to it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; queried Luke impatiently, &ldquo;paid you to help him,
    eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; replied the man loftily ignoring the suggestion, &ldquo;that
    taking in one of Mr. Dobson&rsquo;s cards that was lying in the tray could
    do no harm. I thought it couldn&rsquo;t do no harm. The young gentleman said
    his lordship would be very grateful to me when he found out what I&rsquo;d
    done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how grateful was the young gentleman to you, Parker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the tune of a five-pound note, Mr. Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then as you have plenty of money in hand, you can pack up your things
    and get out of this house before I&rsquo;ve time to tell his lordship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Luke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t argue. Do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must take my notice from his lordship,&rdquo; said Parker, vainly
    trying to recover his dignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well. You can wait until his lordship has been told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Luke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Best not wait to see his lordship, Parker. Take my word for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a tone of finality in Luke&rsquo;s voice which apparently Parker
    did not dare to combat. The man looked confused and troubled. What had seemed
    to him merely a venial sin&mdash;the taking of a bribe for a trivial service&mdash;now
    suddenly assumed giant proportions&mdash;a crime almost, punished by a stern
    dismissal from Mr. Luke.</p>
  <p>He went without venturing on further protest, and Luke, left standing alone
    in the hall, once more put his hand on the knob of the library door. This
    time he tried to turn it. But the door had been locked from the inside.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    And Thus The Shadow Descended</b></h2>
  <p>From within the hum of a man&rsquo;s voice&mdash;speaking low and insistently&mdash;still
    came softly through. Luke, with the prodigality of youth, would have given
    ten years of his life for the gift of second-sight, to know what went on
    between those four walls beyond the door where he himself stood expectant,
    undecided, and more than vaguely anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was quite natural that Louisa should stand here beside him, having come
    to him softly, noiselessly, like the embodiment of moral strength, and a
    common-sense which was almost a virtue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;has locked himself in with
    this man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is it, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man who calls himself Philip de Mountford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How does one,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;know such things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Parker let him in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He gave Parker a five-pound note. Parker is only a grasping fool.
    He concocted the story of Mr. Dobson and the lease. He is always listening
    at key-holes, and he knows that Mr. Dobson often sends up a clerk with papers
    for Uncle Rad&rsquo;s signature. Those things are not very difficult to manage.
    If one man is determined, and the other corruptible, it&rsquo;s done sooner
    or later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is Lord Radclyffe safe with that man, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; he replied fervently.</p>
  <p>Jim and Edie made a noisy irruption into the hall, and Luke and Louisa talked
    ostentatiously of indifferent things&mdash;the weather, Lent, and the newest
    play, until the young people had gathered up coats and hats and banged the
    street door to behind them, taking their breeziness, their optimism, away
    with them out into the spring air, and leaving the shadows of the on-coming
    tragedy to foregather in every angle of the luxurious house in Grosvenor
    Square.</p>
  <p>And there were Luke de Mountford and Louisa Harris left standing alone in
    the hall; just two very ordinary, very simple-souled young people, face to
    face for the first time in their uneventful lives with the dark problem of
    a grim &ldquo;might be.&rdquo; A locked door between them and the decisions
    of Fate; a world of possibilities in the silence which now reigned beyond
    that closed door.</p>
  <p>They were&mdash;remember&mdash;wholly unprepared for it, untrained for any
    such eventuality. Well-bred and well-brought up, yet were they totally uneducated
    in the great lessons of life. It was as if a man absolutely untutored in
    science were suddenly to be confronted with a mathematical problem, the solution
    or non-solution of which would mean life or death to him. The problem lay
    in the silence beyond the locked door&mdash;silence broken now and again
    by the persistently gentle hum of the man&rsquo;s voice&mdash;the stranger&rsquo;s&mdash;but
    never by a word from Lord Radclyffe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad,&rdquo; said Luke at last in deep puzzlement, &ldquo;has
    never raised his voice once. I thought that there would be a row&mdash;that
    he would turn the man out of the house. Dear old chap! he hasn&rsquo;t much
    patience as a rule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Luke?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go on standing like that in the hall as if you were
    eavesdropping. The servants will be coming through presently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Lou,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as usual. I&rsquo;ll go
    into the dining-room. I could hear there if anything suspicious was happening
    in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not afraid, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For Uncle Rad, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly know whether I am or not. No,&rdquo; he added decisively
    after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;I am not afraid of violence&mdash;the
    fellow whom we saw in the park did not look that sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led Louisa back into the dining-room, where a couple of footmen were
    clearing away the luncheon things. The melancholy Parker placed cigar box
    and matches on a side table and then retired&mdash;silent and with a wealth
    of reproach expressed in his round, beady eyes.</p>
  <p>Soon Luke and Louisa were alone. He smoked and she sat in a deep arm-chair
    close to him saying nothing, for both knew what went on in the other&rsquo;s
    mind.</p>
  <p>Close on an hour went by and then the tinkle of a distant bell broke the
    silence. Voices were heard somewhat louder of tone in the library, and Lord
    Radclyffe&rsquo;s sounded quite distinct and firm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at Mr.&mdash; Tell
    me the name and address again, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door leading from library to hall was opened. A footman helped the stranger
    on with coat and hat. Then the street door banged to again, and once more
    the house lapsed into silence and gloom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I had better go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa rose, and Luke said in matter-of-fact tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you into a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I prefer to walk. I am going straight
    back to the Langham. Will you go to the Ducies&rsquo; At Home to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know more by then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall know all there is to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was the second time she had put the question to him, but this time its
    purport was a very different one. He understood it nevertheless, for he replied
    simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, Lou, you are just all the world to me&mdash;and a man must
    feel a little afraid when he thinks he may lose the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not me, Luke,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you would not lose me&mdash;whatever
    happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me get you a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was English, you see, and could not manage to say anything just then.
    The floodgates of sentiment might burst asunder now with the slightest word
    uttered that was not strictly commonplace. Louisa understood, else she had
    not loved him as she did. It never occurred to her to think that he was indifferent.
    Nay more! his sudden transition from sentiment to the calling of a cab&mdash;from
    sentiment to the trivialities of life pleased her in its very essence of
    incongruity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said I would walk,&rdquo; she reminded him, smiling.</p>
  <p>Then she gave him her hand. It was still gloveless and he took it in his,
    turning the palm upward so that he might bury his lips in its delicately
    perfumed depths. His kiss almost scalded her flesh, his lips were burning
    hot. Passion held in check will consume with inward fire, whilst its expression
    often cools like the Nereid&rsquo;s embrace.</p>
  <p>He went to the door with her and watched her slender, trim figure walking
    rapidly away until it disappeared round the corner of the Square.</p>
  <p>When he turned back into the hall, he found himself face to face with Lord
    Radclyffe. Not Uncle Rad&mdash;but an altogether different man, an old man
    now with the cynical lines round the mouth accentuated and deepened into
    furrows, the eyes hollow and colourless, the shoulders bent as if under an
    unbearable load.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad,&rdquo; said Luke speaking very gently, forcing his voice
    to betray nothing of anxiety or surprise, &ldquo;can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But even at sight of his nephew, of the man who had hitherto always succeeded
    in dissipating by his very presence every cloud on the misanthrope&rsquo;s
    brow, even at sight of him Lord Radclyffe seemed to shrink within himself,
    his face became almost ashen in its pallor, and lines of cruel hardness quite
    disfigured his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to be alone to-day,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;Tell them
    to send me up some tea in the afternoon. I&rsquo;ll go to my room now&mdash;I
    shan&rsquo;t want any dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, sir, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to be alone to-day,&rdquo; the old man reiterated tonelessly, &ldquo;and
    to be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe walked slowly toward the staircase. Luke&mdash;his heart
    torn with anxiety and sorrow&mdash;saw how heavy was the old man&rsquo;s
    step, how listless his movements. The younger man&rsquo;s instinct drew him
    instantly to the side of the elder. He placed an affectionate hand on his
    uncle&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad,&rdquo; he said appealingly, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I do anything
    for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe turned and for a moment his eyes softened as they rested
    on the face he loved so well. His wrinkled hand sought the firm, young one
    which lingered on his shoulder. But he did not take it, only put it gently
    aside, then said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my boy, there&rsquo;s nothing you can do, except to leave me
    alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he went up stairs and shut himself up in his own room, and Luke saw
    him no more that day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    Which Tells Of The Inevitable Result</b></h2>
  <p>And now a month and more had gone by, and the whole aspect of the world
    and of life was changed for Luke. Not for Louisa, because she, woman-like,
    had her life in love and love alone. Love was unchanged, or if changed at
    all it was ennobled, revivified, purified by the halo of sorrow and of abnegation
    which glorified it with its radiance.</p>
  <p>For Luke the world had indeed changed. With the advent of Philip de Mountford
    that spring afternoon into the old house in Grosvenor Square, life for the
    other nephew&mdash;for Luke, once the dearly loved&mdash;became altogether
    different.</p>
  <p>That one moment of softness, when Lord Radclyffe&mdash;a bent and broken
    old man&mdash;went from the library up the stairs to his own room, determined
    to be alone, and gently removed Luke&rsquo;s affectionate hand from his own
    bowed shoulders, that one moment of softness was the last that passed between
    uncle&mdash;almost father&mdash;and nephew. After that, coldness and cynicism;
    the same as the old man had meted out to every one around him&mdash;save
    Luke&mdash;for years past. Now there was no exception. Coldness and cynicism
    to all; and to the intruder, the new comer, to Philip de Mountford, an unvarying
    courtesy and constant deference that at times verged on impassive submission.</p>
  <p>And the change, I must own, did not come gradually. Have I not said that
    only a month had gone by, and Arthur&rsquo;s son, from the land of volcanoes
    and earthquakes, had already conquered all that he had come to seek? He who
    had been labelled an impostor and a blackmailer took&mdash;after that one
    interview&mdash;his place in the old man&rsquo;s mind, if not in his heart.
    Heaven only knows&mdash;for no one else was present at that first interview&mdash;what
    arguments he held, what appeals he made. He came like a thief, bribing his
    way into his uncle&rsquo;s presence, and stayed like a dearly loved son,
    a master in the house.</p>
  <p>And Luke was shut out once and for all from Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s mind
    and heart. Can you conceive that such selfless affection as the older man
    bore to the younger can live for a quarter of a century and die in one hour?
    Yet so it seemed. Luke was shut out from that innermost recess in Uncle Rad&rsquo;s
    heart which he had occupied, undisputed, from childhood upward. Now he only
    took his place amongst the others; with Jim and Edie and Frank, children
    of the younger brother, of no consequence in the house of the reigning peer.</p>
  <p>Luke with characteristic pride&mdash;characteristic indolence, mayhap, where
    his own interests were at stake&mdash;would not fight for his rightful position&mdash;his
    by right of ages, twenty years of affection, of fidelity, and comradeship.</p>
  <p>The day following the first momentous interview, Lord Radclyffe spent in
    lawyers&rsquo; company&mdash;Mr. Davies in Finsbury Court, then Mr. Dobson
    in Bedford Row. The latter argued and counselled. Though papers might be
    to all appearances correct and quite in order, there was no hurry to come
    to a decision. But Lord Radclyffe&mdash;with that same dictatorial obstinacy
    with which he had originally branded the claimant as an impostor and a blackmailer&mdash;now
    clung to his reversed opinion. Convinced&mdash;beyond doubt, apparently&mdash;that
    Philip de Mountford was his brother Arthur&rsquo;s son, he insisted on acknowledging
    him openly as his heir, and on showering on him all those luxuries and privileges
    which Luke had enjoyed for so many years.</p>
  <p>Indignant and mentally sore, Jim and Edie protested with all the violence
    of youth, violence which proved as useless as it was ill-considered. Luke
    said nothing, for he foresaw that the end was inevitable. He set about making
    a home for his younger brothers and sister to be ready for them as soon as
    the cataclysm came, when Philip de Mountford, usurping every right, would
    turn his cousins out of the old home.</p>
  <p>Frank, absent at Santiago&mdash;a young attach&eacute; out at his first
    post&mdash;had been told very little as yet. Luke had tried to break the
    news to him in a guarded letter, which received but the following brief and
    optimistic answer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, old man! what&rsquo;s the matter with you? worrying over such
    rubbish? Take my advice and go to Carlsbad. Your liver must be out of order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the catastrophe came, nevertheless; sooner even than was expected. Edie&rsquo;s
    language grew very unguarded in Philip&rsquo;s presence, and Jim&mdash;&ldquo;in
    the Blues&rdquo;&mdash;did not watch over his own manners when the new cousin
    was in the house.</p>
  <p>One evening when Luke was absent&mdash;as was very often the case now&mdash;and
    the family gathering consisted of Lord Radclyffe&mdash;sullen and morose;
    Philip, pleasantly condescending; and Jim and Edie, snubbed and wrathful,
    a difference in political opinion between the young people set a spark to
    the smouldering ashes.</p>
  <p>Philip&mdash;still pleasantly condescending&mdash;did not say much that
    evening, though he had been called a cad and an upstart, and told to go back
    to his nigger relations; but the next morning Jim and Edie received a curt
    admonition from Lord Radclyffe, during which they were told that if such
    a disgraceful exhibition of impertinence occurred again, they would have
    to go and pitch their tent elsewhere.</p>
  <p>They brought their grievance to Luke; told him all that they had treasured
    up in their rebellious young hearts against the usurper, and much that they
    had hitherto kept from the elder brother, who already, God knows! had a sufficient
    load of disappointment to bear.</p>
  <p>What could Luke do but promise that Jim and Edie should in future have a
    house of their own, wherein neither usurper nor upstarts would have access,
    and where they could nurse their wrath in peace and unsnubbed.</p>
  <p>For the first time since many, many days Luke was alone with his uncle in
    the library. Philip was out, and Lord Radclyffe was taken unawares.</p>
  <p>What Luke would never have dreamed of doing for himself he did for his brothers
    and sister; he made appeal to his uncle&rsquo;s sense of right, of justice,
    and of mercy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have told us all so often that
    this should be a home for us all. It doesn&rsquo;t matter about me, but the
    others&mdash;Jim and Edie&mdash;they haven&rsquo;t offended you, have they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe was fretful and irritable. When Luke first came in, it had
    almost seemed as if he would order him to go. Such an old man he looked&mdash;sour
    and morose &mdash;his clothes hung more loosely than before on an obviously
    attenuated frame. He seemed careworn and worried, and Luke&rsquo;s heart,
    which could not tear itself away from the memories of past kindness, ached
    to see the change.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you,&rdquo; he asked insistently, &ldquo;would you rather we
    went away, Uncle Rad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man shifted about uneasily in his chair. He would not meet Luke&rsquo;s
    eyes any more than he would take his hand just now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim and Edie,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;are very ill-mannered,
    and Philip feels&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He passed his tongue over his lips which were parched and dry. A look&mdash;it
    was a mere flash&mdash;almost of appeal passed from his eyes to Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Luke simply, &ldquo;it is this&mdash;this Philip
    whom Jim and Edie have offended? Not you, Uncle Rad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip is your uncle Arthur&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; rejoined Lord Radclyffe,
    speaking like a fretful child in a thin voice that cracked now and again. &ldquo;He
    will be the head of the family presently&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; interposed Luke earnestly, &ldquo;before many years are
    past, I trust and pray for all our sakes, Uncle Rad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sooner,&rdquo; continued the old man, not heeding the interruption,  &ldquo;those
    young jackanapes learn to respect him, the better it will be for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jim and Edie have been a little spoiled by your kindness, sir. They
    are finding the lesson a little hard to learn. Perhaps they had better go
    and study elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe made no reply. Silence was full of potent meaning; of submission
    to another&rsquo;s more dominant personality, of indifference to everything
    save to peace and quiet.</p>
  <p>Suppressing a sigh of bitter disappointment, Luke rose to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the sooner I make all arrangements the
    better. There&rsquo;s only the agreement for the flat to sign and we can
    move in next week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the flat?&rdquo; queried the old man hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Exhibition Road, Kensington, close to the park. Edie loves the
    park, and it won&rsquo;t be far from barracks for Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve no furniture. How will you furnish a flat? Don&rsquo;t
    go yet,&rdquo;  continued Lord Radclyffe seeing that Luke was preparing to
    take his leave. &ldquo;Philip won&rsquo;t be here till tea time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid, sir, that I don&rsquo;t care to steal a few minutes
    of your company, just when Philip is absent. I would rather not see you at
    all than see you on sufferance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very obstinate and tiresome&mdash;and you make it so difficult
    for me. I want to hear about the furniture&mdash;and how you are going to
    manage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lou is helping Edie to get what is wanted,&rdquo; replied Luke, smiling
    despite the heavy weight of disappointment in his heart. It was pitiable
    to see the old man&rsquo;s obvious feeling of relief in the absence of the
    man who was exercising such boundless influence over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But have you money, Luke?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not overmuch, sir, but enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fifteen thousand pounds your father left you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And that&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the fifteen thousand pounds from your uncle Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, sir. I think that should go back to
    Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Lord Radclyffe querulously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    talked to Dobson about that. Your uncle Arthur left that money to you&mdash;and
    not to his son. He had his own reasons for doing this. Dobson thinks so too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very kind of Mr. Dobson to trouble about my affairs but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The money was left to you,&rdquo; persisted the old man, &ldquo;and
    to Jim and Edie and Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will do whatever they like with their share, but I could not
    touch a penny of Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, uncle. I have only had a month in which to
    think of so much&mdash;and there was the new flat to see to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe rose and shuffled toward Luke. He dropped his voice, lest
    the library walls had ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget you, Luke&mdash;presently&mdash;when I am gone&mdash;and
    that won&rsquo;t be long&mdash;I&rsquo;ll provide for you&mdash;my will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Uncle Rad, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; and the cry
    was wrung from a heart overburdened with pity and with shame.</p>
  <p>And without waiting to take more affectionate leave, Luke hurried from the
    room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Life Must Go On Just The Same</b></h2>
  <p>They met at dances and at musical At Homes, for the world wagged just as
    it had always done, and here&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think?&mdash;lies the
    tragedy of the commonplace. Luke and Louisa, with the whole aspect of life
    changed for them, with a problem to face of which hitherto they had no conception,
    and the solution of which meant a probing of soul and heart and mind&mdash;Luke
    and Louisa had to see the world pass them by the same as heretofore, with
    laughter and with tears, with the weariness of pleasure, and the burdens
    of disappointment.</p>
  <p>The world stared at them&mdash;curious and almost interested&mdash;searching
    wounds that had only just begun to ache, since indifferent hands had dared
    to touch them. And convention said: &ldquo;Thou shalt not seem to suffer;
    thou shalt pass by serene and unmoved; thou shalt dance and sing and parade
    in park or ball room; thou art my puppet and I have nought to do with thy
    soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Luke and Louisa did as convention bade them, and people stared at them
    and asked them inane questions that were meant to be delicate, but were supremely
    tactless. People too wondered what they meant to do, when the engagement
    would be duly broken off, or what Colonel Harris&rsquo;s&mdash;Louisa&rsquo;s
    father&mdash;attitude would be in all this. Somehow after the first excitement
    consequent on Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s open acknowledgment of the claimant
    things had tamed off somewhat; Luke de Mountford looked just the same as
    before, although awhile ago he had been heir to one of the finest peerages
    in England and now was a penniless son of a younger son. I don&rsquo;t know
    whether people thought that he ought to look entirely different now, or whether
    he should henceforth wear shabby dress clothes and gloves that betrayed the
    dry cleaner; certain it is that when Luke entered a reception room, a dozen
    lips were ready&mdash;had they dared or good-breeding allowed&mdash;to frame
    the question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Or,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do tell us how it feels to find one&rsquo;s self a beggar all of
    a sudden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Enterprising hostesses made great attempts to gather all parties in their
    drawing rooms. With strategy worthy of a better cause they man&oelig;uvred
    to invite Philip de Mountford and Lord Radclyffe, and Luke and Louisa&mdash;all
    to the same dinner party&mdash;promising themselves and their other guests
    a subtle enjoyment at sight of these puppets dancing to rousing tunes, beside
    which the most moving problem play would seem but tame entertainment.</p>
  <p>But Philip de Mountford&mdash;though as much sought after now as Luke had
    been in the past&mdash;declined to be made a show of for the delectation
    of bored society women; he declined all invitations on his own and Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s
    behalf.</p>
  <p>So people had to be content to watch Luke and Louisa.</p>
  <p>They were together at the Ducies&rsquo; At Home. There was a crush, a Hungarian
    band from Germany, a Russian singer from Bayswater, a great many diamonds,
    and incessant gossip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke de Mountford is here&mdash;and Miss Harris. Have you seen them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! we met on the stairs, and had a long chat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do they seem?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! quite happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do they mean to break off the engagement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing. Have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louisa Harris has a nice fortune of her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Lord Radclyffe will provide for Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. He practically turned him out of the house,
    you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it for a positive fact. My sister has just got a new butler,
    who left Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s service the very day Philip de Mountford
    first walked into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Parker, I remember him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He says Lord Radclyffe turned all the family out, bag and baggage.
    They were so insolent to Philip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s quite true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That this Philip is the late Arthur de Mountford&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite true, I believe. Lord Radclyffe openly acknowledges it. He
    is satisfied apparently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So are the lawyers, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! how do you do, Miss Harris? So glad to see you looking so well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This, very pointedly, as Louisa, perfectly gowned, smiling serenely, ascended
    the broad staircase.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not been ill, Lady Keogh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no! of course not. And how is Mr. de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can ask him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Louisa passed on to make way for Luke. And the same remarks and the
    same question were repeated <i>ad infinitum</i>, until a popular waltz played
    by the Hungarian gentlemen from Germany drew the fashionable crowd round
    the musicians&rsquo;  platform.</p>
  <p>Then Luke and Louisa contrived to make good their escape, and to reach the
    half-landing above the heads of numerous young couples that adorned the stairs.
    The hum of voices, the noise of shrill laughter, and swish of skirts and
    fans masked their own whisperings. The couples on the stairs were absorbed
    in their own little affairs; they were sitting out here so that they might
    pursue their own flirtations.</p>
  <p>Luke and Louisa could talk undisturbed.</p>
  <p>They spoke of the flat in Exhibition Road and of the furniture that Louisa
    had helped Edie to select.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are only a few odds and ends to get now,&rdquo; Louisa was
    saying,  &ldquo;coal scuttles and waste-paper baskets; that sort of thing.
    I hope you don&rsquo;t think that we have been extravagant. Edie, I am afraid,
    had rather luxurious notions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Edie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t think she minds very much. Life at Grosvenor Square
    in the past month has not been over cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Luke made no comment she continued in her own straightforward, matter-of-fact
    way&mdash;the commonplace woman facing the ordinary duties of life:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now that the flat is all in order, you can all move in whenever you
    like&mdash;and then, Luke, you must begin to think of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of you, Lou,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to think about
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you are wrong, Lou, and you must not talk like that. Our engagement
    must be officially broken off. Colonel Harris has been too patient as it
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;does not wish the engagement
    broken off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All these people,&rdquo; he said, nodding in the direction of the
    crowd below, &ldquo;will expect some sort of announcement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lou, you must take back your word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How does one take back one&rsquo;s word, Luke? Have you ever done
    it? I shouldn&rsquo;t know how to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at him straight, her eyes brilliant in the glare of the electric
    lamps, not a tear in them or in his, her face immovable, lest indifferent
    eyes happened to be turned up to where these two interesting people sat.
    Only a quiver round the lips, a sign that passion palpitated deep down within
    her heart, below the Bond Street gown and the diamond collar, the soul within
    the puppet.</p>
  <p>She held his glance, forcing him into mute acknowledgment that his philosophy,
    his worldliness, was only veneer, and that he had not really envisaged the
    hard possibility of actually losing her.</p>
  <p>Oh, these men of this awful conventional world! How cruel they can be in
    that proud desire to do what is right!&mdash;what their code tells them is
    right!&mdash;no law of God or nature that!&mdash;only convention, the dictates
    of other men! Hard on themselves, selfless in abnegation, but not under standing
    that the dearest gift they can bestow on a woman is the right for her to
    efface herself, the right for her to be the giver of love, of consolation,
    of sacrifice.</p>
  <p>Commonplace, plain, sensible Louisa understood everything that Luke felt;
    those great luminous eyes of hers, tearless yet brilliant, read every line
    on that face drilled into impassiveness.</p>
  <p>No one else could have guessed the precise moment at which softness crept
    into the hard determination of jaw and lips; no ear but hers could ever have
    perceived the subtle change in the quivering breath, from hard obstinacy
    that drew the nostrils together, and set every line of the face, to that
    in-drawing of the heavy air around caused by passionate longing which hammered
    at the super-excited brain, and made the sinews crack in the mighty physical
    effort at self-repression.</p>
  <p>But to all outward appearance perfect calm, correct demeanour, the attitude
    and tone of voice prescribed by the usages of this so-called society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lou,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not fair to tempt me. I should
    be a miserable cur if I held you to your word. I am a penniless beggar&mdash;a
    wastrel now, without a profession, without prospects, soon to be without
    friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed to take pleasure in recalling his defects, and she let him ramble
    on; women who are neither psychological puzzles nor interesting personalities
    have a way of listening patiently whilst a tortured soul eases its burden
    by contemplating its own martyrdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a penniless beggar,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;I have no right
    to ask any woman to share my future dull and humdrum existence. A few thousands
    is all I have. I think that Edie will marry soon and then I can go abroad&mdash;I
    must go abroad&mdash;I must do something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it together, Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; he continued, rebellious now and wrathful, all the
    primary instincts alive in him of self-preservation and the desire to destroy
    an enemy,  &ldquo;I feel that if I stayed in England I should contrive to
    be even with that blackguard. His rights? By God! I would never question
    those. The moment I knew that he was Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s son I should have
    been ready to shake him by the hand, to respect him, to stand aside as was
    his due. But his attitude!&mdash;the influence he exercises over Uncle Rad!&mdash;his
    rancour against us all! Jim and Edie! what had they done to be all turned
    out of the house like a pack of poor relations&mdash;and poor Uncle Rad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He checked himself, for she had put a hand on his coat sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke, it is no use,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Lou! and I am a miserable wretch. If you only knew
    how I hate that man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us think of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I help it? He robs me of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;not that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hand still rested on his arm, and he took it between both his. The couples
    in front of them all down the length of stairs paid no heed to them, and
    through the hum of voices, from a distant room beyond, came softly wafted
    on the hot, still air the strains of the exquisite barcarolle from the &ldquo;Contes
    d&rsquo; Hoffmann.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa smiled confidently, proudly. He held her hand and she felt that his&mdash;hot
    and dry&mdash;quivered in every muscle at her touch. The commonplace woman
    had opened the magic book of Love. She had turned its first pages, the opening
    Chapters had been simple, unruffled, uncrumpled by the hand of men or of
    Fate. But now at last she read the Chapter which all along she knew was bound
    to reach her ken. The leaves of the book were crumpled; Fate with cruel hand
    had tried to blur the writing; the psychological problem of to-day&mdash;the
    one that goes by the name of &ldquo;modern woman&rdquo;&mdash;would no doubt
    ponder ere she tried to read further; she would analyze her feelings, her
    thoughts, her sensations; she would revel over her own heartache and delight
    in her own soul agony. But simple-minded, conventional Louisa did none of
    these things. She neither ruffled her hair, nor dressed in ill-made serge
    clothes; her dress was perfect and her hand exquisitely gloved. She did nothing
    out of the way; she only loved one man altogether beyond herself, and she
    understood his passionate love for her, and all that troubled him in this
    world in which they both lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I love that barcarolle, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said after awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not hear it,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Lou,&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;You
    must despise me for being a drivelling fool, but I have neither eyes nor
    ears now. I would give all I have in the world to lie down there on the floor
    now before you and to kiss the soles of your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could I despise you, Luke, for that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put your hand on my knee, just for a moment, Lou. I think I shall
    go mad if I don&rsquo;t feel your touch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did as he asked her, and he was silent until the last note of the barcarolle
    died away in a softly murmured breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a cowardly wretch I am,&rdquo; he said under cover of the wave
    of enthusiastic applause which effectually covered the sound of his voice
    to all ears save hers.  &ldquo;I think I would sell my soul for a touch of
    your hand, and all the while I know that with every word I am playing the
    part of a coward. If Colonel Harris heard me he would give me a sound thrashing.
    A dog whip is what I deserve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; she rejoined simply, &ldquo;that father does
    not wish our engagement to be broken off. He sticks to your cause and will
    do so through thick and thin. He still believes that this Philip is an impostor,
    and thinks that Lord Radclyffe has taken leave of his senses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke quite quietly, matter-of-factly now, pulling, by her serene calm,
    Luke&rsquo;s soul back from the realms of turbulent sensations to the prosy
    facts of to-day. And he&mdash;in answer to her mute dictate and with a movement
    wholly instinctive and mechanical&mdash;drew himself upright, and passed
    his hand over his ruffled hair, and the jeopardized immaculateness of shirt
    front and cuffs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip de Mountford,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;is no impostor,
    Lou. He has been perfectly straightforward; and Mr. Dobson for one, who has
    seen all his papers, thinks that there is no doubt whatever that he is Uncle
    Arthur&rsquo;s son. His clerk&mdash;Mr. Downing&mdash;went out to Martinique,
    you know, and his first letters came a day or two ago. All inquiries give
    the same result, and Downing says that it is quite easy to trace the man&rsquo;s
    life, step by step, from his birth in St. Pierre, past the dark days of the
    earthquake and the lonely life at Marie-Galante. Mrs. de Mountford was a
    half-caste native, as we all suspected, but the marriage was unquestionably
    legal. Downing has spoken to people in Martinique and also in Marie-Galante,
    who knew her and her son, or at any rate, of them. I cannot tell you everything
    clearly, but there are a great many links in a long chain of evidence, and
    so far Mr. Dobson and his clerk have not come across a broken one. That the
    Mrs. de Mountford who died at Marie-Galante was Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s wife,
    and that Philip is his son, I am afraid no one can question. He has quite
    a number of letters in his possession which Uncle Arthur wrote after he had
    practically abandoned wife and child. I think it was the letters that convinced
    Uncle Rad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe,&rdquo; she remarked dryly, &ldquo;has taken everything
    far too much for granted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is convinced, Lou&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; she retorted more hotly than was her wont, &ldquo;acting
    in a cruel and heartless manner. Even if this Philip is your uncle Arthur&rsquo;s
    son, even if he is heir to the peerage and the future head of the family,
    there was no reason for installing him in your home, Luke, and turning you
    and the others out of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; rejoined Luke philosophically, &ldquo;the house
    was never really our home. What Uncle Rad gave freely, he has taken away
    again from us. I don&rsquo;t suppose that we have the right to complain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what will become of you all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must scrape along. Frank must have his promised allowance or he&rsquo;ll
    never get along in the service, and five hundred pounds a year is a big slice
    out of a thousand. Jim, too, spends a great deal. Uncle Rad never stinted
    him with money, for it was he who wanted Jim to be in the Blues. Now he may
    have to exchange into a less expensive regiment. I think Edie will marry
    soon&mdash;Reggie Duggan has been in love with her for the past two years&mdash;she
    may make up her mind now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not know if he ought to tell her of his plans. The ostrich farm out
    in Africa&mdash;the partnership offered to him by a cousin of his mother&rsquo;s
    who was doing remarkably well, but who was getting old and wanted the companionship
    of one of his kind. It was a living anyway&mdash;but a giving up of everything
    that had constituted life in the past&mdash;and the giving up of his exquisite
    Lou. How could he ask her to share that life with him?&mdash;the primitive
    conditions, the total absence of luxuries, the rough, every-day existence?</p>
  <p>And Lou, so perfectly dressed, so absolutely modern and dainty, waited on
    hand and foot&mdash;</p>
  <p>But she insisted, seeing that he was hesitating and was trying to keep something
    from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about you, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had not time to reply, for from the hall below a shrill voice called
    to them both by name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. de Mountford, Miss Harris, the young people want to dance. You&rsquo;ll
    join in, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already he was on his feet, every trace of emotion swept away from his face,
    together with every crease from his immaculate dress clothes, and every stray
    wisp of hair from his well-groomed head. Not a man, torn with passion, fighting
    the battle of life against overwhelming odds, casting away from him the hand
    which he would have given his last drop of blood to possess&mdash;only the
    man of the world, smiling while his very soul was being wrung&mdash;only
    the puppet dancing to the conventional world&rsquo;s tune.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dancing?&rdquo; he said lightly: &ldquo;Rather&mdash;Lady Ducies
    may I have this first waltz? No?&mdash;Oh! I say that&rsquo;s too bad. The
    first Lancers then? Good! Lou, may I have this dance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the world went on just the same.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    And There Are Social Duties To Perform</b></h2>
  <p>The first November fog.</p>
  <p>The world had wagged on its matter-of-fact way for more than six months
    now, since that day in April when Philip de Mountford&mdash;under cover of
    lies told by Parker&mdash;had made his way into Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s presence:
    more than five months since the favoured nephew had been so unceremoniously
    thrust out of his home.</p>
  <p>Spring had yielded to summer, summer given way to autumn, and already winter
    was treading hard on autumn&rsquo;s heels. The autumn session had filled
    London with noise and bustle, with political dinner parties and monster receptions,
    with new plays at all the best theatres, and volumes of ephemeral literature.</p>
  <p>And all that was&mdash;to-night&mdash;wrapped in a dense fog, the first
    of the season, quite a stranger, too, in London, for scientists had asserted
    positively that the era of the traditional &ldquo;pea-souper&rdquo; was over;
    the metropolis would know it no more.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris was in town with his sister, Lady Ryder, and Louisa, and
    swearing at London weather in true country fashion. He declared that fogs
    paralyzed his intellect that he became positively imbecile, not knowing how
    to fight his way in the folds of such a black pall. Taxicab drivers he mistrusted;
    in fact, he had all an old sportsman&rsquo;s hatred of mechanically propelled
    vehicles, whilst he flatly refused to bring valuable horses up to town, to
    catch their death of cold whilst waiting about in the fog.</p>
  <p>So Luke had promised to pilot the party as far as the Danish Legation, where
    they were to dine to-night. This was the only condition under which Colonel
    Harris would consent to enter one of those confounded motors.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris had remained loyal to the core to Luke and to his fortunes.
    It is a way old sportsmen have, and he had never interfered by word or innuendo
    in Louisa&rsquo;s actions with regard to her engagement. His daughter was
    old enough, he said, to know her own mind. She liked Luke, and it would be
    shabby to leave him in the lurch, now that the last of the society rats were
    scurrying to leave the sinking ship. They were doing it, too, in a mighty
    hurry. The invitations which the penniless younger son received toward the
    end of the London season were considerably fewer than those which were showered
    on him at its beginning before the world had realized that Philip de Mountford
    had come to stay, and would one day be Earl of Radclyffe with a rent roll
    of eighty thousand pounds a year, and the sore need of a wife.</p>
  <p>It had all begun with the bridge parties. Luke would no longer play, since
    he could no longer afford to lose a quarter&rsquo;s income at one sitting.
    Uncle Rad used to shrug indifferent shoulders at such losses, and place blank
    checks at the dear boy&rsquo;s disposal. Imagine then how welcome Luke was
    at bridge parties, and how very undesirable now.</p>
  <p>Then he could no longer make return for hospitable entertainments. He had
    no home to which to ask smart friends. Lord Radclyffe though a monster of
    ill-humour, gave splendid dinner parties at which Luke was quasi host. Now
    it was all give and no take; and the givers retired one by one, quite unregretted
    by Luke, who thus was spared the initiative of turning his back on his friends.
    They did the turning, quite politely but very effectually. Luke scarcely
    noticed how he was dropping out of his former circle. He was over-absorbed
    and really did not care. Moreover his dress clothes were getting shabby.</p>
  <p>To-night at the Langham, when he arrived at about seven o&rsquo;clock so
    as to have an undisturbed half hour with Lou, Colonel Harris greeted him
    with outstretched hand and a cordial welcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Luke, my boy! how goes it with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa said nothing, but her eyes welcomed him, and she drew him near her,
    on to the sofa in front of the fire, and allowed her hand to rest in his,
    for she knew how he loved the touch of it. People were beginning to say that
    Louisa Harris was getting old: she never had been good-looking, poor thing,
    but always smart, very smart&mdash;now she was losing her smartness, and
    what remained?</p>
  <p>She had come up to town this autumn in last autumn&rsquo;s frocks! and the
    twins were after all being chaperoned by their aunt. Would that absurd engagement
    never be broken off? Fancy Louisa Harris married to a poor man! Why, she
    did not know how to do her hair, and dresses were still worn fastened at
    the back, and would be for years to come! Louisa Harris and no French maid!
    Cheap corsets and cleaned gloves! It was unthinkable.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the engagement was virtually broken off&mdash;anyhow the wedding
    could never take place.</p>
  <p>Unless Philip de Mountford happened to die.</p>
  <p>But it did not look as if the engagement was broken off. Not at any rate
    on this raw November evening, when there was a dense fog outside, but a bright,
    cheery fire and plenty of light in the little sitting room at the Langham,
    and Luke sat on the sofa beside Louisa, and plain Louisa&mdash;in last autumn&rsquo;s
    gown&mdash;looking at him with her candid, luminous eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How is Lord Radclyffe?&rdquo; asked Colonel Harris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Badly,&rdquo; replied Luke, &ldquo;I am afraid. He looks very feeble,
    and his asthma I know must bother him. He was always worse in foggy weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He ought to go to Algeciras. He always used to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; assented Luke dejectedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something be done? Surely, Luke, you haven&rsquo;t lost
    all your influence with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every bit, sir. Why, I hardly ever see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly ever see him?&rdquo; ejaculated Colonel Harris, and I am afraid
    that he swore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been to Grosvenor Square for over six weeks. I am
    only allowed to see him when Philip is out, or by special permission from
    Philip. I won&rsquo;t go under such conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How that house must have altered!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know it, sir: All the old servants have gone,
    one after the other; they had rows with Philip and left at a month&rsquo;s
    notice. I suppose he has no idea how to set about getting new ones&mdash;I
    know I shouldn&rsquo;t! There&rsquo;s only a man and his wife, a sort of
    charwoman who cleans and cooks, and the man is supposed to look after Uncle
    Rad; but he doesn&rsquo;t do it, for he is half seas over most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; murmured Colonel Harris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have shut up all the rooms, except the library where Uncle Rad
    and Philip have their meals when they are at home. But they lunch and dine
    at their club mostly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What club do they go to? I called in at the Atheneum last night,
    thinking to find Radclyffe there, but the hall porter told me that he never
    went there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He and Philip have joined some new club in Shaftesbury Avenue&mdash;The
    Veterans&rsquo; I think it is called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some low, mixed-up kind of place! Old Radclyffe must be out of his
    senses!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He likes it, so he tells me, because people don&rsquo;t come and
    bother him there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should think not indeed. I wouldn&rsquo;t set foot in such a place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He goes there most evenings, and so does Philip&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
    so bad for Uncle Rad to be out late these foggy nights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to make an effort and stop it, Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have made many efforts, sir. But, as a matter of fact, I had made
    up my mind to make a final one to-night. Uncle Rad ought to go abroad, and
    I thought I would try to impress this on Philip. He can&rsquo;t be a bad
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; was Colonel Harris&rsquo;s muttered comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, if I have no influence, he has, and he must exert it
    and get Uncle Rad down to Algeciras or anywhere he likes so long as it is
    well south.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke paused awhile, his face flushed with this expression of determination
    which must have caused his pride many a bitter pang. Then he resumed more
    quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather humiliating, isn&rsquo;t it, to go to that man
    as a suppliant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go as a suppliant, my boy. You must insist on your uncle
    being properly looked after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris thought all that sort of thing so easy. One always does before
    one has had a genuine tussle with the unpleasant realities of life; to the
    good country squire with an assured position, an assured income, assured
    influence, it seemed very easy indeed to insist. He himself never had to
    insist; things occurred round him and at his word, as it were, of themselves.</p>
  <p>But Louisa, knowing how matters stood, made no suggestion. She knew that
    Luke would do his best, but that that best was of little avail now; as Philip
    de Mountford arranged so it would all come about.</p>
  <p>Friends and well-wishers could but pray that the intruder was not a bad
    man, and that he had his uncle&rsquo;s health at heart.</p>
  <p>She gave the signal to go, saying simply,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t be late for dinner, father, must we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she rose to go, held back by the hand, by Luke&rsquo;s fervent insistence.</p>
  <p>He could not accustom himself to part from her, as he often had to do. It
    seemed absurd, but undeniable. He was supremely happy in her company, and
    snatched as much of it as ever he could; but the wrench was always awful
    and Louisa&mdash;subtly comprehensive&mdash;was conscious of the terrible
    pain which she gave him at every parting. She felt the repercussion of it
    in all her nerves, although her sound common-sense condemned the sensation
    as unreal.</p>
  <p>To-night the feeling was even stronger than it had ever been before. At
    her first suggestion that it was time to go, an elusive current passed from
    him to her. He had been holding her hand, and his had been cool and only
    slightly on the quiver from time to time when her own fingers pressed more
    markedly against his. But now, all at once it seemed as if a sudden current
    of lava had penetrated his veins; his hand almost scorched her own, and though
    visibly it did not move, yet she felt the pulses throbbing and trembling
    beneath the flesh. The look of misery in his face made her own heart ache
    though she tried to smile with easy gaiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow we go to the Temple Show together; don&rsquo;t forget,
    Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her words seemed to recall him from another world, and he quickly enough
    pulled himself together and helped her on with her cloak. Colonel Harris
    with the gentle tactfulness peculiar to kind hearts had loudly announced
    that he would be waiting in the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything the matter, Luke?&rdquo; she asked as soon as her father
    had gone from the room.</p>
  <p>He contrived to smile and to look unconcerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem different to-night, somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How different?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain. But you are not yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Myself more than ever. My adoration for you is more uncontrolled&mdash;that
    is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She wrapped herself up in her furs, for it was silence that gave the best
    response. And then he said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you go first. I&rsquo;ll switch off the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father will be waiting down stairs,&rdquo; she rejoined.</p>
  <p>Then she went past him and out through the door, and he had to go back to
    the mantel-piece where one of the electric light switches was. He turned
    off the light; the room remained in darkness save where the dying embers
    of the fire threw a red glow on the sofa where she had sat with him, and
    the footstool on which her evening shoe had rested.</p>
  <p>And the conventional man of the world, schooled from childhood onward to
    discipline and self-control, fell on both knees against that mute footstool,
    and leaning forward he pressed his burning lips against the silk cushions
    of the sofa, which still bore the impress and the fragrance of her exquisite
    shoulders.</p>
  <p>Then he, too, went out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Shall A Man Escape His Fate?</b></h2>
  <p>On the way to the Danish Legation, Colonel Harris asked Luke what his plans
    were for the evening.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; replied Luke, &ldquo;call at Grosvenor Square. I
    may find Uncle Rad, or Philip, or both at home. I mean to have a good tussle
    about this wintering abroad. It&rsquo;s really most important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I call it criminal,&rdquo; retorted Colonel Harris, &ldquo;keeping
    a man in London who has been used to go south in the winter for the past
    twenty years at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad is still fairly well now, though I do think he looks more
    feeble than usual. He ought to go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; suggested Louisa, &ldquo;he oughtn&rsquo;t to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He certainly ought not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would Mr. de Mountford go with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This new man of his, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Luke hotly, &ldquo;would be madness. The man is
    really a drunkard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But somebody ought to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edie would be only too willing&mdash;if she is allowed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edie?&rdquo; exclaimed Louisa.</p>
  <p>And she added with a smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will Reggie Duggan have to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;Reggie Duggan has cried
    off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has given up Edie who has little or nothing a year, and become
    engaged to Marian Montagu who has eight thousand pounds a year of her own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Edie!&rdquo; murmured Louisa, whilst Colonel Harris&rsquo;s
    exclamation was equally to the point and far more forcible, and more particularly
    concerned the Honourable Reginald Duggan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined Luke, &ldquo;it has hit her hard, coming on
    the top of other things. There&rsquo;s no gainsaying the fact, is there,
    Colonel Harris, that we four brothers and sister owe something to Uncle Arthur&rsquo;s
    son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The handle of a riding whip,&rdquo; came from out the depths of Colonel
    Harris&rsquo;s fur coat. &ldquo;Stupid way parsons have of saying that to
    wish a man dead is tantamount to murder. I am committing murder now for a
    matter of that, for I wish that blackguard were buried in one of his native
    earthquakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; added Luke, &ldquo;that wishing alone would
    do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was so much wrath, such hatred and contempt in those words that Louisa
    instinctively whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Luke! don&rsquo;t talk like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Colonel Harris somewhat ostentatiously cleared his throat and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us think of that confounded Philip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke took leave of Colonel Harris and of Louisa at the door of the Danish
    Legation. He waited on the carpeted curb beneath the awning until he saw
    her white evening cloak disappear in the door-way.</p>
  <p>The fog had become very dense. Just here where a number of carriage lamps
    threw light around, one could distinguish faces and forms immediately close
    to one, but as Luke turned away from the brilliant lights, he realized how
    thick was the pall which enveloped London to-night. He looked at his watch;
    it was close upon eight. The next few minutes brought him to the door of
    Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s house.</p>
  <p>He rang but obtained no answer. He rang again and again and finally came
    to the conclusion that his uncle and cousin were as usual dining out and
    that the elderly couple who did perfunctory service in the house were either
    asleep or out of ear-shot or had taken the opportunity of seeking amusement
    in a neighbouring public house.</p>
  <p>But Luke was worried about Lord Radclyffe; moreover he had made up his mind
    that he would speak to him and to Philip to-night, with regard to the imperative
    wintering abroad for the old man.</p>
  <p>The Veterans&rsquo; Club was unknown to Luke, but Shaftesbury Avenue was
    not. He turned into Oxford Street and as taxicabs were now a forbidden luxury
    he hailed a passing omnibus and jumped into it, and thus was rapidly conveyed
    into the very heart of the fog which had found its haven around Piccadilly
    Circus.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    They Have No Heart</b></h2>
  <p>As to what occurred in the heart of the fog on that night in November four
    years ago, most of you no doubt will remember. Those who do not I must refer
    to the morning papers of the following day.</p>
  <p>A perfect harvest for journalists. Gossip and detail sufficient to fill
    column upon column of newspaper: gossip that grew as the hours sped on, and
    the second day of fog pursued its monotonous course.</p>
  <p>A man had been found murdered in a taxicab, his throat stabbed through from
    ear to ear, the jugular pierced, life absolutely extinct; the murderer vanished.</p>
  <p>Drama in the midst of reality.</p>
  <p>Such things are, you know. No amount of so-called realistic literature,
    no amount of sneers at what is dubbed melodrama, will prevent this fact occurring&mdash;and
    occurring very frequently in the streets of a mighty city.</p>
  <p>Just a man murdered and the murderer disappeared. A very real thing that,
    and London has had to face such facts often enough, more often than has an
    audience at Drury Lane or the Adelphi. The superior-minded critic who spells
    British Drama with a capital B and D, and pronounces it Pritish Trama sat
    in the stalls of a London theatre on this very same foggy evening in November,
    four years ago. The play was one that did not appeal to the superior-minded
    critic: it was just a simple tale of jealousy which led to the breaking of
    that great commandment: &ldquo;Thou shalt do no murder!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the superior-minded critic yawned behind a well gloved hand and dubbed
    the play melodramatic, unreal, and stagey, quite foreign to the life of to-day.
    But just at that hour&mdash;between nine and ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a man
    was murdered in a taxicab, and his murderer vanished in the fog.</p>
  <p>London doesn&rsquo;t dub such events melodrama; she does not sneer at them
    or call them unreal. She knows that they are real: there is nothing stagey
    or artificial about them: they have even become commonplace.</p>
  <p>They occur so often! And most often whilst society dines or dances and the
    elect applaud with languid grace the newest play by Mr. Bernard Shaw.</p>
  <p>Only in this case, the event gained additional interest. The murdered man
    was a personality. Some one whom everybody that was anybody had talked about,
    gossiped, and discussed for the past six months. Some one whom few had seen
    but many had heard about&mdash;Philip de Mountford&mdash;the son of the late
    Arthur de Mountford&mdash;Radclyffe&rsquo;s newly found heir, you know.</p>
  <p>The news spread as only such news can spread, and when Society poured out
    from theatres, from houses in Grosvenor Square, or from the dining-room of
    the Carlton, every one had heard the news.</p>
  <p>It was as if the sprite of gossip had been busy whispering in over-willing
    ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip de Mountford has been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was found in a taxicab; his throat was cut from ear to ear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! not cut, I understand. Pierced through with a sharp instrument&mdash;a
    stiletto, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Lord Radclyffe&mdash;such a tragedy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never live through it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has looked very feeble lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The scandal round the late Arthur&rsquo;s name broke him up, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems Arthur de Mountford had married a negress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Philip did not look like a half-caste. I saw him once or
    twice. He was dark but nice looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still, there was some scandal about the marriage!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing to what this scandal will be!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What scandal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seek whom the crime benefits, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you think?&mdash;You really think Luke de Mountford did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so the moment I heard the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought that Luke de Mountford a queer sort of
    fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he took his cousin&rsquo;s advent very badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well one can&rsquo;t wonder at that exactly&mdash;to lose a future
    peerage all of a sudden&mdash;and he has no private fortune either&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor beggar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard there were awful rows between the cousins until Lord Radclyffe
    himself turned Luke and the others out of the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now Philip de Mountford has been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the police will seek him whom the crime benefits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It certainly looks very suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A real <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>! Won&rsquo;t it be exciting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something to read about in one&rsquo;s morning papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall try and get reserved seats for the trial. I hate a crush,
    don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will they hang him, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he is found guilty&mdash;English justice is no respecter of persons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How awful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And tittle-tattle, senseless talk, inane remarks, were wafted on the grimy
    wings of the fog. They penetrated everywhere, in the lobbies of the theatres,
    the boudoir of madame and the smoking room of my lord. They penetrated to
    the magnificent reception rooms of the Danish Legation, and Louisa heard
    the remarks even before she knew the full details of the story. Louisa had
    a well-trained contralto voice, and had been asked to sing, in the course
    of the evening. Just as she stood in an outer room selecting her music, she
    heard a group of idlers&mdash;men and women&mdash;talking over the mysterious
    murder in the taxicab.</p>
  <p>They had at first been unconscious of her presence. She had her back toward
    them, turning over the leaves of of her song. Suddenly there was a hush in
    the conversation; one of the chatterboxes must have pointed her out to the
    others.</p>
  <p>Whereupon Louisa, serene and smiling, a roll of music in her hand, joined
    the merry group.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop. I have heard nothing
    yet. And of course I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the men laughed inanely and the ladies murmured silly nothings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said some one, &ldquo;it mayn&rsquo;t be true. Such lots
    of wild rumours get about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked Louisa placidly, &ldquo;mayn&rsquo;t be true?
    Some one said just now that Philip de Mountford has been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured one of the ladies, &ldquo;they say it was Mr.
    de Mountford; but they can&rsquo;t be sure, can they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The group was dissolving: almost, it seemed, as if it had vanished into
    thin air. When Louisa first heard them talking there were about a dozen men
    and women, a brilliant throng of gaily plumaged birds; now the ladies remembered
    that they wanted to hear the latest infant prodigy who had been engaged to
    entertain the guests at the post-dinner reception to-night, and the men too,
    feeling uncomfortable and awkward, made good their escape.</p>
  <p>People&mdash;the pleasure-loving people of to-day&mdash;have no use for
    latent tragedy. Excitement, yes! and drama; but only from the secure distance
    of a private seat at an Old Bailey trial. The murder of Philip de Mountford
    could be discussed with quite an amount of enjoyment between a dinner party
    and a ball supper, but not in Louisa Harris&rsquo;s presence! By Gad! too
    much of a good thing you know!</p>
  <p>Within a very few minutes Louisa found herself almost alone, just the one
    or two near her to whom she had directly spoken and&mdash;fortunately&mdash;Colonel
    Harris in the door-way, come to look for his daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The infant with the violin,&rdquo; he said as soon as he caught sight
    of Louisa, &ldquo;is just finishing his piece, poor little rat! You promised
    you would sing next, Lou. What songs have you got?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just making a selection when you came, father. What would you
    like me to sing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With an unexpressed sigh of relief the last two of the original group of
    gossips dwindled away into the reception room beyond, congratulating themselves
    on having successfully engineered their exit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dooced awkward, don&rsquo;t you know, Miss Harris asking questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose she doesn&rsquo;t realize&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will soon enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She ought to have broken off her engagement long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful?&mdash;Poor thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa, left alone with her father, could allow her nerves to ease their
    fearful tension. She had no need to hide from him the painful quiver of her
    lips, or the anxious frown across her brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;anything about this awful business,
    father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of gossip,&rdquo; he replied: his voice was not
    only gruff but hoarse, which showed that he was strangely moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;some truth in the gossip?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say Philip de Mountford has been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some people have come on from the theatres, and men from the clubs.
    The streets are full of it&mdash;and evening papers have brought out midnight
    editions which are selling like hot cakes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do they say that Luke has killed Philip de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;with some hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;they don&rsquo;t
    say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they hint at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Newspaper tittle-tattle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much is actual fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that at nine o&rsquo;clock
    or thereabouts two men in evening dress hailed a passing taxicab just outside
    the Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue and told the chauffeur to drive to
    Hyde Park corner, just by the railings of the Green Park. The driver drew
    up there and one of the two men got out. As he reclosed the door of the cab
    he leaned toward the interior and said cheerfully, &ldquo;S&rsquo;long old
    man. See you to-morrow.&rdquo; Then he told the chauffeur to drive on to
    1 Cromwell Road opposite the museum, and turning on his heel disappeared
    in the fog. When the chauffeur drew up for the second time no one alighted
    from the cab. So he got down from his box and opened the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The other man,&rdquo; murmured Louisa vaguely, &ldquo;was in the
    cab&mdash;dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With his throat pierced from ear to ear by a sharp instrument which
    might have been a skewer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have heard it all then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she said hurriedly.</p>
  <p>The room was swaying round her: the furniture started hopping and dancing.
    Louisa, who had never fainted in her life, felt as if the floor was giving
    way under her feet. Memory was unloading one of her storehouses, looking
    over the contents of a hidden cell, wherein she had put away a strange winter
    scene in Brussels, a taxicab, the ill-lighted boulevard, the chauffeur getting
    down from his box and finding a man crouched in the farther corner of the
    cab&mdash;dead&mdash;with his throat pierced from ear to ear by an instrument
    which might have been a skewer. And memory was raking out that cell, clearing
    it in every corner, trying to find the recollection of a certain morning
    in Battersea Park a year ago, when Louisa recounted her impressions of that
    weird scene and told the tale of this crime which she had almost witnessed.
    Memory found a distinct impression that she had told the tale at full length
    and with all the details which she knew. She remembered talking it all over,
    and, that when she did so, the ground in Battersea Park was crisp with the
    frost under her feet, and an inquisitive robin perched himself on the railings
    and then flew away accompanying her and another all the way along as far
    as the gates.</p>
  <p>Two pictures, vivid and distinct: that evening in Brussels, and the morning
    in Battersea Park, her first meeting with Luke after his letter to her&mdash;the
    letter which had come to her in the Palace Hotel and which had made her the
    happiest woman in all the world. Memory&mdash;satisfied&mdash;had at last
    emptied the storehouse of that one cell and left Louisa Harris standing here,
    staring at her father, her ears buzzing with the idle and irresponsible chatter
    of society jackdaws, her mind seeing all that had happened outside 1 Cromwell
    Road: the cab stopping, the chauffeur terrified, the crowd collecting, the
    police taking notes. Her mind saw it as if her bodily eyes had been there,
    and all that her father told her seemed but the recapitulation of what she
    knew already.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; she said after awhile, &ldquo;is the dead man now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I should imagine they
    would keep the body at the police station until the morning. I don&rsquo;t
    suppose they&rsquo;d be such mugs as to disturb Lord Radclyffe at this time
    of night; the shock might kill the old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose they are quite sure that it is Philip de Mountford who
    was killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes; he had his pocket-book, his cards, his letters on him,
    and money too&mdash;robbery was not the object of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Philip de Mountford then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God, yes! Of whom were you thinking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was thinking of Luke,&rdquo; she replied simply.</p>
  <p>The old man said nothing more. Had he spoken at all then it would have been
    to tell her that he, too, was thinking of Luke and that there was perhaps
    not a single person in the magnificent house at that moment who was not&mdash;in
    some way or another&mdash;thinking of Luke.</p>
  <p>The hostess came in, elegant and worldly, with banal words to request the
    pleasure of hearing Miss Harris sing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is so kind of you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to offer. I have never
    heard you, you know, and people say you have such a splendid voice. But perhaps
    you would rather not sing to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke English perfectly, but with a slight Scandinavian intonation,
    which seemed to soften the banality of her words. Being foreign, she thought
    less of concealing her sympathy, and was much less fearful of venturing on
    delicate ground.</p>
  <p>She held out a small, exquisitely gloved hand and laid it almost affectionately
    on the younger woman&rsquo;s arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure you would rather not sing to-night,&rdquo; she said kindly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Countess, why should you think that?&rdquo; retorted Louisa
    lightly.  &ldquo;I shall be delighted to sing. I wonder which of these new
    songs you would like best. There is an exquisite one by Guy d&rsquo;Hardelot.
    Shall I sing that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Her Excellency, who so charmingly represented Denmark in English society,
    followed her guest into the reception room: she admired the elegant carriage
    of the English girl, the slender figure, the soft abundant hair.</p>
  <p>And Her Excellency sighed and murmured to herself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are stiff, these English! and oh! they have no feeling, no sentiment!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And a few moments later when Louisa Harris&rsquo;s really fine voice, firm
    and clear, echoed in the wide reception room, Her Excellency reiterated her
    impressions:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These English have no heart! She sings and her lover is suspected
    of murder! Bah! they have no heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The Tale Had To Be Told</b></h2>
  <p>And whilst the morning papers were unfolded by millions of English men and
    women, and the details of the mysterious crime discussed over eggs and bacon
    and buttered toast, Philip de Mountford, the newly found heir presumptive
    to the Earldom of Radclyffe, was lying in the gloomy mortuary chamber of
    a London police court, whither he had been conveyed in the same cab whose
    four narrow walls jealously guarded the secret of the tragedy which had been
    enacted within their precincts.</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe had been aroused at ten o&rsquo;clock the previous night
    by representatives of the police, who came to break the news to him. It was
    not late, and the old man was not yet in bed. He had opened the front door
    of his house himself, his servants&mdash;he explained curtly&mdash;were spending
    their evening more agreeably elsewhere.</p>
  <p>The house&mdash;even to the police officers&mdash;appeared lonely and gloomy
    in the extreme, and the figure of the old man, who should have been surrounded
    by every luxury that rank and wealth can give, looked singularly pathetic
    as he stood in his own door-way, evidently unprotected and uncared for, and
    suspiciously demanding what his late visitors&rsquo; business might be.</p>
  <p>Very reluctantly on hearing the latter&rsquo;s status he consented to admit
    them. He did not at first appear to suspect that anything wrong might have
    happened, or that anything untoward could occasion this nocturnal visit:
    in fact, he seemed unconscious of the lateness of the hour.</p>
  <p>He walked straight into the library, where he had obviously been sitting,
    for an arm-chair was drawn to the fire, a reading lamp was lighted on the
    table, and papers and magazines lay scattered about.</p>
  <p>The police officer in plain clothes, who stood with his subordinate, somewhat
    undecided, hardly knew how to begin. It was a hard task to break such awful
    news to this lonely old man.</p>
  <p>At last it was done; the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; and &ldquo;your nephew&rdquo; were
    blurted out by the man in command. But hardly were these out of his lips
    than Lord Radclyffe&mdash;livid and trembling&mdash;had jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke!&rdquo; he contrived to exclaim, and his voice was almost choked,
    his lips and hands trembled, beads of perspiration stood upon his forehead. &ldquo;Something
    has happened to Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, my lord! that&rsquo;s not the name&mdash;Philip was on the
    card and on the letters&mdash;Philip de Mountford&mdash;that was, I think,
    the poor gentleman&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And an accident has happened to Mr. Philip de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was quite different now. No longer choked with anxiety, calm and
    as if mildly interested in passing events. It was obvious even to the strangers
    present that one nephew was of far greater moment than the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my lord, that it&rsquo;s worse than an accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The officer paused a moment, satisfied that he was doing all that was necessary
    and possible to mitigate the suddenness of the blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s foul play,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    what it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foul play? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Philip de Mountford has been murdered, my lord&mdash;his body
    now lies at the police station&mdash;would you wish him conveyed home at
    once, my lord&mdash;or wait until after the inquest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the room for a moment or two, while the old-fashioned
    clock ticked stolidly on. At the awful announcement, which indeed might have
    felled a younger and more vigorous man, Lord Radclyffe had not moved. He
    was still standing, his hand resting on the table beside the piled up newspapers.
    The light of the lamp veiled by a red shade illumined the transparent delicacy
    of the high-bred hand, the smooth black surface of the coat, and the glimmering
    whiteness of the shirt front with its single pearl stud. The face itself
    was in shadow, and thus the police officer saw little or nothing of that
    inward struggle for self-mastery which was being put so severely to the test.</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe, face to face with the awful event, strove by every power
    at his command to remain dignified and impassive. The lessons taught by generations
    of ancestors had to bear fruit now, when a representative of the ancient
    name stood confronting the greatest crisis that one of his kind has ever
    had to face&mdash;the brutal, vulgar fact of a common murder. The realities
    of a sordid life brought within the four walls of a solemn, aristocratic
    old house.</p>
  <p>For a moment before he spoke again the old man looked round about him, the
    tall mahogany bookcases filled with silent friends, the busts of Dryden and
    of Milton, the globes in their mahogany casings: all heirlooms from the generations
    of de Mountfords who had gone before.</p>
  <p>It seemed as if the present bearer of the historic name called all these
    mute things to witness this present degradation. A crime had smirched the
    family escutcheon, for to some minds&mdash;those who dwell on empyrean heights
    to which the matter-of-fact sordidness of every-day life never reaches&mdash;to
    those minds the victim is almost as horrible as the assassin.</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe however fought his own battle silently. Not with one tremor
    or one gasp would he let the two men see what he felt. Conventionality wielded
    her iron rod in this shabby old library, just as she had done in the ball
    room of the Danish Legation, and whilst not two hundred yards away Louisa
    Harris sang Guy d&rsquo;Hardelot&rsquo;s songs and smilingly received praise
    and thanks for her perfect performance, so here the old man never flinched.</p>
  <p>He gave to his nerves the word of command, and as soon as he had forced
    them to obey, he looked straight at the police officer and said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please tell me all that I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat in his high-backed chair, curtly bidding the two men to sit down;
    he made no attempt to shade his face and eyes; once the battle fought and
    won he had nothing more to hide: his own face, rigid and still, his firm
    mouth, and smooth brow were mask enough to conceal the feelings within.</p>
  <p>The officer gave the details at full length: he told Lord Radclyffe all
    that was known of the mysterious crime. The old man listened in silence until
    the man had finished speaking, then he asked a few questions:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have a clue of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, my lord,&rdquo; replied the officer guardedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I help in any way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any information, my lord, that you think might help us would of course
    be gladly welcomed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man who hailed the cab in Shaftesbury Avenue&mdash;what was he
    like? I could help you if I knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have his description properly written out, my lord, and
    bring it you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me now? Every moment lost is irretrievable in
    cases like these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my lord, that I cannot tell you definitely now. There&rsquo;s
    a dense fog outside&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The chauffeur&rsquo;s descriptions are vague,&rdquo; interposed Lord
    Radclyffe with a sneer, &ldquo;the eternal excuses for incompetence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My lord!&rdquo; protested the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right! all right! No offence meant I assure you. You must pardon
    an old man&rsquo;s irritability&mdash;the news you have brought me does not
    make for evenness of temper. I rely on your department to clear this matter
    up with the least possible scandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that scandal is inevitable,&rdquo; retorted the officer
    dryly, for he still felt sore at Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s ill-tempered thrust. &ldquo;We
    shall have to rake up a great deal of what might be unpleasant to many parties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should it be unpleasant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall have to know something of the murdered man&rsquo;s past,
    of his associates before&mdash;before he was able to establish his claim
    to your lordship&rsquo;s consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that the late Philip de Mountford had many undesirable
    associates in the past,&rdquo; remarked Lord Radclyffe curtly.</p>
  <p>The silence which followed was tantamount to a dismissal. The officer rose
    to go. He felt nettled at the old man&rsquo;s obvious sneers: they had been
    like a cold douche over his enthusiasm, for the case had already drifted
    into his hands and it promised to be the most interesting and most sensational
    criminal case of modern times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not,&rdquo; he said before taking his leave, &ldquo;told
    me, my lord, what you wish done about the body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; replied Lord Radclyffe querulously, &ldquo;it is too
    late now to make any arrangements. What is the time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Half past ten, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely to-morrow morning we can discuss all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as you wish, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning&mdash;as early as you like. My servants will be
    at home then&mdash;the house will be ready&mdash;and I can make arrangements&mdash;or
    else we&rsquo;ll wait, as you say, until after the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sound of a bell broke the silence that ensued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must excuse me,&rdquo; said his lordship dryly, &ldquo;my servants
    are out, and there&rsquo;s some one at the front door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear footsteps below stairs, my lord,&rdquo; remarked the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I believe you&rsquo;re right. Those two blackguards must have
    come home and I didn&rsquo;t know it. They do pretty much as they like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shuffling, uncertain footsteps were heard across the hall. The officer said
    hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One more thing, my lord&mdash;you will pardon me asking but&mdash;you
    had not thought of&mdash;er&mdash;offering a reward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The apprehension of the murderer, or useful information that would
    lead to conviction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah, yes; a reward by all means! Of course I&rsquo;ll give a reward
    to stimulate incompetence, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will your lordship make it?&rdquo; asked the officer, determined
    this time to show no resentment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two hundred&mdash;five hundred&mdash;have what you like&mdash;so
    long as you get that brute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five hundred, my lord, would stimulate us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Lord Radclyffe briefly. &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good evening, my lord. And to-morrow morning we&rsquo;ll be ready
    for the body to be taken away, if you wish it. But the inquest will be the
    day after, so perhaps it might be best to wait until then. At the coroner&rsquo;s
    court, Victoria, my lord&mdash;South Kensington, you know&mdash;everything
    will be all right. Good evening, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men took their leave, glad enough to have done with the unpleasant
    interview.</p>
  <p>As they walked to the door that gave from the library on the hall it was
    opened from the outside, and a seedy-looking man, dressed in shabby evening
    clothes that bore many traces of past libations, walked unceremoniously midway
    into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you see Mr. Luke de Mountford?&rdquo; he muttered addressing
    his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied his lordship. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much
    too late. Ask Mr. Luke to call again to-morrow. And you and your wife can
    go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    And Many Must Be Questioned</b></h2>
  <p>By the time the police officers reached the outer hall door, Luke had received
    his order of dismissal. He stood on the step for a moment, undecided what
    to do, and saw the two men coming out of his uncle&rsquo;s study.</p>
  <p>They raised their hats as they met him on the door step, and one of them
    said politely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Luke de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; replied Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine is Travers&mdash;attached to Scotland Yard. Could I ask you
    a few questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, but not in my uncle&rsquo;s house, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not; where do you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here on the door step if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly. Might I trouble you to step into a cab with me and to come
    as far as Victoria police court?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very late, isn&rsquo;t it? I have an engagement at eleven
    close by here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was going to fetch Colonel Harris and Louisa at the Danish Legation and
    pilot them home to the Langham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important matter, Mr. de Mountford,&rdquo; retorted
    the man. &ldquo;Are you lodging anywhere near here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Exhibition Road, Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, close to Cromwell Road?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where shall it be, Mr. de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not in the cab?&rdquo; remarked Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The taxicab which had brought the police officers was standing some few
    paces farther on, its strong lights only just piercing the intensity of the
    fog, and its throbbings, as the taximeter marked off twopences with unerring
    rapidity, filled the night with their strangely familiar sound.</p>
  <p>The three men got into the cab, the officer telling the chauffeur to remain
    stationary until told to move on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know very little about the business, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Travers,&rdquo; remarked
    Luke as soon as all three of them had stowed themselves fairly comfortably
    in the interior of the vehicle. &ldquo;I suppose it is about this ghastly
    affair that you wanted to speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It was about that. I thought you could give us some information
    about the late Mr. de Mountford&rsquo;s past life, or his former friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; retorted Luke dryly, &ldquo;of my cousin&rsquo;s
    past or present life. He did not confide in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you were good friends?&rdquo; interposed the other quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We knew each other very little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw him at his club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Veterans&rsquo; in Shaftesbury Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between eight and nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had some talk with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pleasant talk?&rdquo; asked the officer indifferently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Family affairs,&rdquo; rejoined Luke dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you parted from him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somewhere about nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The door steps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. The lobby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was alone then? I mean&mdash;besides yourself was no one with
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one. The hall porter stood there of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one joined him afterward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I cannot say. When I parted from him he was alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know that Mr. Philip de Mountford was murdered in a taxicab between
    Shaftesbury Avenue and Hyde Park Corner, soon after nine o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard most of the details of that extraordinary crime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you can throw no light on it at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None. How could I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; insisted the police officer, &ldquo;occurs to you
    at this moment that might help us in any way to trace the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was silent. It seemed as if he was meditating how best to put one
    or more questions. Up to now these had been curt and to the point, and as
    they followed one another in quick succession there was a marked difference
    in the attitude both of the questioner and the questioned. The police officer
    had started by being perfectly deferential&mdash;just like a man accustomed
    to speak with people whose position in the world compelled a certain regard.
    He had originally addressed Luke as &ldquo;sir,&rdquo;  just as he had invariably
    said &ldquo;my lord&rdquo; to Lord Radclyffe, but now he spoke much more
    curtly. There was a note of demand in every question which he put, a peremptoriness
    of manner which did not escape the observation of his interlocutor.</p>
  <p>As the one man became more aggressive so did Luke also change his manner.
    There had been affable courtesy in his first reply to the questions put to
    him, a desire to be of help if help was needed, but with his senses attuned
    by anxiety and nerve strain to distinguish subtle difference of manner and
    of intention, he was quick enough to notice that he himself was as it were
    in a witness box, with a counsel ready enough to bully, or to trip up any
    contradictory statement.</p>
  <p>Not that Luke realized the reason of this change. The thought that he could
    be suspected of a crime was as far removed from his ken as the desire to
    visit the moon. He could not understand the officer&rsquo;s attitude; it
    puzzled him, and put him on his guard&mdash;but it was just the instinct
    of self-preservation, of caution, which comes to men who have had to fight
    the world, and who have met enemies where they least expected to find one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; now resumed Travers after that slight pause,
    which had seemed very long to Luke, but as a matter of fact had only lasted
    a short minute,  &ldquo;whether you saw Mr. Philip de Mountford speaking
    with any one when you left him in the lobby of the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said Luke impatiently, &ldquo;that he was alone,
    except for the hall porter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone in the whole club house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone,&rdquo; reiterated Luke with measured emphasis, &ldquo;in the
    lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How many rooms has the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; it was the first time I had ever been there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know any of the staff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;since I had never been there before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were not known to any member of the staff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were shown into the club rooms without being known there at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Veterans&rsquo; Club is a new one, and its rules apparently are
    not very strict. I asked if Mr. de Mountford was in the club and was told
    that I should find him in the smoking room, and I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did your interview with Mr. de Mountford last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About three quarters of an hour I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it was of a perfectly amicable nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a perfectly indifferent nature,&rdquo; corrected Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after the interview what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I walked out of the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I walked about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the fog?&rdquo; This in an undisguised tone of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the fog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In what direction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; here rejoined Luke with a sudden show of resentment, &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Travers,
    I fail to see how my movements can be of concern to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was certainly not going to tell this man that he had made his way through
    the fog as far as the residence of the Danish Minister, and that he had walked
    up and down for over an hour outside that house like a love-sick fool, like
    a doting idiot, because he knew that if he waited patiently he would presently
    hear the faint echo of a well-trained contralto voice whose mellowness would
    come to him through the closed windows of the brilliantly illumined mansion,
    and would ease for a moment the wild longing of his heart.</p>
  <p>What the man near him said in answer to his retort he really could not say.
    He had not heard, for in a moment his thoughts had flashed back to that lonely
    vigil in the fog, to the sound of her voice, which came, oh! so faintly,
    to his ear, and then to the first breath of gossip that came from the passers-by,
    the coachmen and chauffeurs who had drawn up in long rows along the curb,
    the idlers who always hang about outside in the cold and the damp when a
    society function is in progress, the pickers-up of unconsidered trifles,
    lost or willingly bestowed.</p>
  <p>From these he had first heard the news: vaguely at first, for he did not&mdash;could
    not&mdash;realize that the amazing thing which was being commented on and
    discussed had anything to do with him. The talk was of murder, and soon the
    name of de Mountford was mentioned. The details he got were very confused,
    and the open allusions as to &ldquo;seek whom the crime will benefit&rdquo; never
    really reached his brain, which was almost numb with the violence of the
    shock.</p>
  <p>His first thought after that was to go and see Uncle Rad: he had, for the
    moment, almost forgotten Louisa. Every other interest in life sank to nothingness
    beside the one clear duty: Uncle Rad would be alone; the awful news must
    be broken very gradually to Uncle Rad. He had hurried to Grosvenor Square,
    only to find that emissaries of the police had forestalled him in his duty.</p>
  <p>All this he could not explain to the man Travers. It would have sounded
    lame and barely plausible. Nowadays men do not walk outside houses wherein
    their liege lady dwells, and, if they do, they do not choose a foggy night
    for the sentimental dalliance. He was thankful, therefore, that Travers put
    no further questions to him, and merely said with a return to his original
    politeness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you, sir. I don&rsquo;t think I need detain
    you any longer. You said you had an engagement later on; won&rsquo;t you
    keep this cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke thanked him, but refused the offer of the cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is close by,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I call on you to-morrow morning, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid so. You see we don&rsquo;t like to trouble Lord Radclyffe
    and we must try and obtain knowledge of certain facts and verify others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so. Well, to-morrow then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. Your address is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fairfax Mansions, Exhibition Road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such a nice neighbourhood. No fog there to-night I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope not. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke made his escape from the cab. He was afraid of missing Louisa and her
    father. His thoughts were somewhat in a whirl, and&mdash;being overburdened
    with matters of paramount importance&mdash;were inclined to dwell on trifles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ought,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;to have taken that man&rsquo;s
    cab. It might be difficult to get another and Colonel Harris hates waiting
    in a crowded hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    And The Puppets Danced</b></h2>
  <p>And so he went to meet Louisa and Colonel Harris at the Danish Legation,
    and found them a taxicab and generally saw to their comparative comfort.</p>
  <p>There was no restraint between the three of them. It was as natural to them
    all to avoid speaking of important matters on the door step of a neighbour&rsquo;s
    house, as it was to eat or drink or breathe. So Luke asked if the dinner
    had been enjoyable and the reception crowded, and Colonel Harris comfortably
    complained of both. He hated foreign cooking, and society crushes, and had
    endured both to-night. No doubt the terrible events of this night, as yet
    mere shadows&mdash;hardly admitted to be real&mdash;were weighing on the
    kind old man&rsquo;s usual hearty spirits.</p>
  <p>But so versed were they all in the art of make believe that each one individually
    was able to register in the innermost depths of an anxious heart the firm
    conviction that the other &ldquo;had not heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke was convinced that the gruesome and sordid news could not have penetrated
    within the gorgeous mansion where Lou in an exquisite gown had sung modern
    songs in her pure contralto voice. He felt sure that neither Lou nor Colonel
    Harris had heard that Philip de Mountford had been murdered in a taxicab
    and that police officers had thought fit to speak to him&mdash;Luke&mdash;in
    tones of contemptuous familiarity. Nay more! now that he himself sat thus
    opposite good-natured, prosy, sensible Colonel Harris, he began to think
    that he must have been dreaming, that the whole thing could not have occurred,
    but that he had imagined it all whilst leaning against the garden-railings
    trying to strain his ears so that they should hear the soft faint echo of
    that pure contralto voice.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the wish had been father to the thought; whilst gazing up at those
    brilliantly illumined windows, he might in his heart of hearts have wished
    the non-existence of Philip&mdash;not his death, but the annihilation of
    the past few months, the non-advent of the intruder: and, thus wishing, he
    may have imagined the whole thing&mdash;the murder in the cab, the police
    officer on the door step of the old home in Grosvenor Square.</p>
  <p>A sense of supreme well-being encompassed him now. Lou sat opposite to him.
    He could not distinguish her face in the gloom, only the outline of her head
    with the soft brown hair perfectly dressed by the hand of an accomplished
    maid: Lou, the personification of modernity, of ordinary commonplace life,
    but exquisite&mdash;just the woman whom he loved with every fibre of his
    heart, every tendril of his being and every sense within him. A soft perfume
    of sweet peas clung to her gown and was wafted to his nostrils. He closed
    his eyes, and drew in a long breath of supreme delight. Now and then as the
    cab gave a jerk his knee came in contact with hers, and down on the ground
    quite close to his own there rested a small neatly shod foot, the sole of
    which he would have given his heart&rsquo;s blood to kiss.</p>
  <p>Oh, yes; he was quite, quite happy: this was reality: his exquisite Louisa,
    the outline of her perfect head, the touch of her knee, the scent of sweet
    peas which intoxicated him and whipped his senses to madness and to dreams.
    It was reality and the other was only the wild phantasmagoria of a wild imagination&mdash;the
    insane thought born of insane desire. In the darkness which enveloped him
    and Lou, he could, you see, give free rein to himself. The world was not
    gaping; conventionality held no sway within these four narrow walls; the
    puppet could loosen the string which had forced it to dance, it could lie
    placid for awhile, dead to the world, but enjoying its own existence and
    its own vitality.</p>
  <p>And Lou, watching him in that same darkness which concealed him entirely,
    save to her eyes of watchfulness, believed that he had heard nothing as yet.
    She vaguely combated the desire to tell him everything then and there, so
    that he should hear the worst and the best from her lips rather than through
    indifferent channels later on.</p>
  <p>But with that subtle perception peculiar to her&mdash;the modern, commonplace
    woman of the world&mdash;she divined that he was living for the moment in
    a world of his own, from which it was sacrilege to try and drag him away.</p>
  <p>Just then the cab drew up outside the Langham Hotel. The every-day world
    had returned with its flaring electric lights, its hall porters, its noise
    and bustle, and chased away the illusions of the past few moments. Luke jumped
    out, ready to help Lou down&mdash;a happy second that, for her hand must
    needs rest in his.</p>
  <p>The glare of the electric lamp above fell full on his face, which was serene,
    placid, the usual mask of supreme indifference: only Louisa read beyond the
    mask, and as her hand rested in his for just a thought longer than conventionality
    allowed, she realized that he knew everything: the murder, the horror, and
    the suspicion which had touched him already with the tip of its sable wing.</p>
  <p>Her eyes, and the pressure of her hand bade him &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; and
    she passed on into the lighted hall of the hotel. He followed Colonel Harris
    into the lobby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have heard?&rdquo; he asked quickly and in a whisper, lest Lou
    should hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Louisa? Does she know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gossip was all over the confounded place,&rdquo; was Colonel Harris&rsquo;s
    muttered comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve heard no details?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little. Only what the police officer chose to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; queried the older man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an absolute
    fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolute, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm! As to that&mdash;have you seen your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I went round as soon as I knew, but the police had forestalled
    me and broken the news to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He sent word that he would rather I come back in the morning. Philip&rsquo;s
    influence still prevalent, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a confounded business,&rdquo; ejaculated Colonel
    Harris with hearty conviction, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going to lament over
    it. After all&rsquo;s said and done it&rsquo;s a very simple way out of an
    impossible situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A very horrible way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the good-natured old man shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of supreme
    indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Luke quietly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s late now, sir.
    You&rsquo;ll want to get to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted the other with quite a touch of joviality &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    an ill wind&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, my boy. How will you get back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, a taxi is the quickest. Edie might have heard something, and
    be anxious. I must hurry home now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa was standing in the hall at the top of the steps. Luke raised his
    hat to her and having shaken hands with Colonel Harris quietly turned to
    go, and was soon lost in the gloom beyond.</p>
  <p>No one who had been standing in the lobby of the hotel would have guessed
    that these three people who had talked and bowed and shaken hands so quietly
    were facing one of life&rsquo;s most appalling, most overwhelming tragedies.</p>
  <p>The world&rsquo;s puppets had been strung up again, because indifferent
    eyes were there to watch and gape, and in the presence of these modern Bulls
    of Bashan the puppets danced to the prevalent tune.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    And What Of The Secret?</b></h2>
  <p>When Luke arrived at his uncle&rsquo;s house early the next morning, he
    was met in the hall by Doctor Newington, who was descending the stairs and
    who gravely beckoned to the young man to follow him into the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They called me in last night,&rdquo; he said in reply to Luke&rsquo;s
    quick and anxious query. &ldquo;The butler&mdash;or whatever he may be&mdash;told
    me that he was busy fastening up the front door preparatory to going to bed
    when he heard a heavy thud proceeding from the library. He found his master
    lying full length on the floor: the head had come in violent contact, as
    he fell, with the corner of this table; blood was trickling from a scalp
    wound, and Lord Radclyffe himself was apparently in a swoon. The man is a
    regular coward and a fool besides. He left his master lying just as he had
    fallen, but fortunately he knew me and knew where to find me, and within
    ten minutes I was on the spot, and had got Lord Radclyffe into bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; asked Luke, &ldquo;anything serious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe has not been over strong lately. He has had a great
    deal to put up with, and at his age the system is not sufficiently elastic
    or&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;sufficiently recuperative to stand either
    constant nerve strain or nagging worries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; interposed Luke stiffly, &ldquo;that my
    uncle has had either nerve strain or worry to put up with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor, whose gruff familiarity seemed to
    Luke&rsquo;s sensitive ear to be tainted with the least possible note of
    impertinence, &ldquo;I am an old friend of your uncle, you know, and of all
    your family; there isn&rsquo;t much that has escaped my observation during
    the past year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not yet told me, doctor,&rdquo; said Luke, a shade more
    stiffly than before, &ldquo;what is the matter with Lord Radclyffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was distinct emphasis on the last two words.</p>
  <p>Doctor Newington shrugged his shoulders good-humouredly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your uncle has had something in the nature of a stroke,&rdquo; he
    said bluntly, and he fixed keen light-coloured eyes on those of Luke, watching
    the effect which the news&mdash;baldly and crudely put&mdash;would have on
    the young man&rsquo;s nerves. He was a man with what is known as a fashionable
    practice. He lived in Hertford Street and his rounds were encircled by the
    same boundaries as those of the rest of Mayfair. He had had plenty of opportunity
    of studying those men and women who compose the upper grades of English society.
    They and their perfect <i>sang-froid</i>, their well-drilled calm under the
    most dire calamities, or most unexpected blows had often caused him astonishment
    when he was a younger man, fresh from hospital work, and from the haunts
    of humbler folk, who had no cause or desire to hide the depth of their feelings.
    Now he was used to his fashionable patients and had ceased to wonder, and
    Luke&rsquo;s impassiveness on hearing of his uncle&rsquo;s sudden illness
    did not necessarily strike him as indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it serious?&rdquo; asked Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Serious. Of course,&rdquo; assented the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean that Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s life is in danger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At sixty years of age, life is always in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; rejoined Luke with a slight show
    of impatience.  &ldquo;Is Lord Radclyffe in immediate danger?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. With great care and constant nursing, he may soon rally, though
    I doubt if he will ever be as strong and hearty as he was this time last
    year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what about a nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one down to-day, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s present household is&mdash;well, hardly adequate
    to the exigencies of a long and serious illness&mdash;he ought to have a
    day and a night nurse. I can send both, but they will want some waiting on
    and of course proper meals and ordinary comforts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see to all that. Thank you for your advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good and reliable cook is also necessary&mdash;who understands
    invalid cooking&mdash;all that is most important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And shall be attended to at once. Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfect rest and quiet of course are the chief things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t worry him, you may be sure, and no one else is likely
    to come near him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except the police,&rdquo; remarked the doctor dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The grave events of the night before, and those that were ready to follow
    one another in grim array for the next few days had almost fled from Luke&rsquo;s
    memory in face of the other&mdash;to him more serious&mdash;calamity&mdash;his
    uncle&rsquo;s illness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah, yes!&rdquo; he said vaguely. &ldquo;I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The nurses,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor with a pompousness which somehow
    irritated Luke, &ldquo;will have my authorization to forbid any one having
    access to Lord Radclyffe for the present. I will write out the certificate
    now, and this you can present to any one who may show a desire to exercise
    official authority in the matter of interviewing my patient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay that I can do all that is necessary at the inquest and
    so on&mdash;Lord Radclyffe need not be worried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He mustn&rsquo;t be worried. To begin with he would not know any
    one, and he is wholly unable to answer questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That settles the matter of course. So, if you will write the necessary
    certificate, I&rsquo;ll see the police authorities at once on the subject.
    Would Lord Radclyffe know me, do you think?&rdquo; added the young man after
    a slight pause of hesitancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the doctor evasively, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
    I would worry him to-day. We&rsquo;ll see how he gets on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably ask for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is another matter, and if he does, you must of course see him.
    But unless there is a marked improvement during the day, he won&rsquo;t ask
    for any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke was silent a moment or two while the doctor sat down at the writing
    table and sought for pen and ink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said after awhile, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll leave
    it at that. Lord Radclyffe&mdash;I can promise you this&mdash;shall on no
    account be disturbed without permission from you. How soon will the nurse
    arrive?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within the hour. The night nurse will come after tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor Newington wrote out and signed the usual medical certificate to the
    effect that Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s state of health demanded perfect quietude
    and rest and that he was unable to see any one or to answer any questions.
    He read his own writing through very carefully, then folded the paper in
    half and handed it to Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will make everything all right. And
    I&rsquo;ll call again in a couple of hours&rsquo; time. You won&rsquo;t forget
    the cook?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t forget the cook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When the doctor had taken his leave, Luke stood for a moment quietly in
    the library: he folded up the medical certificate which he had received at
    the hands of Doctor Newington, and carefully put it away in his pocket-book.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget the cook?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think that ever in his life before had Luke realized the trivialities
    of life as he did at this moment. Remember that he was quite man of the world
    enough, quite sufficiently sensible and shrewd and English, to have noticed
    that the degree of familiarity in the doctor&rsquo;s manner had passed the
    borderland of what was due to himself; the tone of contemptuous indifference
    savoured of impertinence. And there was something more than that.</p>
  <p>Last night when Luke wandered up and down outside the brilliantly lighted
    windows of the Danish Legation, trying to catch a few muffled sounds of the
    voice he so passionately loved to hear, he heard the first rumours that an
    awful crime had been committed which, for good or ill, would have such far-reaching
    bearings on his own future; but he had also caught many hints, vague suggestions
    full of hidden allusions, of which the burden was: &ldquo;Seek whom the crime
    benefits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke de Mountford was no fool. Men of his stamp &mdash;we are accustomed
    to call them commonplace&mdash;take a very straight outlook on life. They
    are not hampered by the psychological problems which affect the moral balance
    of a certain class of people of to-day; they have no sexual problems to solve.
    Theirs is a steady, wholesome, and clean life, and the mirrors of nature
    have not been blurred by the breath of psychologists.</p>
  <p>Luke had never troubled his head about his neighbour&rsquo;s wife, about
    his horse, or his ass, or anything that is his; therefore his vision about
    the neighbour himself had remained acute.</p>
  <p>Although I must admit that at this stage the thought that he might actually
    be accused of a low and sordid crime never seriously entered his head, he
    nevertheless felt that suspicion hovered round him, that some people at any
    rate held it possible that since he would benefit by the crime, he might
    quite well have contemplated it.</p>
  <p>The man Travers thought so certainly; the doctor did not deem it impossible&mdash;and,
    of course, there would be others.</p>
  <p>No wonder that he stood and mused. Once more the aspect of life had changed
    for him. He was back in that position from which the advent of the unknown
    cousin had ousted him so easily&mdash;the cousin who had come, had seen,
    and had conquered the one thing needful&mdash;the confidence and help of
    Uncle Rad.</p>
  <p>By what means he had succeeded in doing that had been the great mystery
    which had racked Luke&rsquo;s mind ever since he felt his uncle&rsquo;s affection
    slipping away from him.</p>
  <p>Uncle Rad who had loudly denounced the man as an impostor and a blackmailer
    before he set eyes on him, was ready to give him love and confidence the
    moment he saw him: and Luke was discarded like an old coat that no longer
    fitted. The affection of years was turned to indifference; and what meant
    more still the habits of a lifetime were changed. Lord Radclyffe, tyrannical
    and didactic, became a nonentity in his own household. The grand seigneur,
    imbued with every instinct of luxury and refinement, became a snuffy old
    hermit, uncared for, not properly waited on, feeding badly, and living in
    one room.</p>
  <p>All this Philip de Mountford had accomplished entirely by his mere presence.
    The waving of a wand&mdash;a devil&rsquo;s wand&mdash;and the metamorphosis
    was complete! What magic was there in the man himself? What in the tale which
    he told? What subtle charm did he wield, that the news of his terrible death
    should strike the old man down as some withered old tree robbed of its support?</p>
  <p>Now he lay dead, murdered, only God knew as yet by whom. People suspected
    Luke, because Fate had given a fresh turn to her wheel and reinstated him
    in the pleasing position from which the intruder had ousted him.</p>
  <p>Luke de Mountford was once more heir presumptive to the earldom of Radclyffe,
    and the stranger had taken the secret of his success with him to the grave.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    It Would Not Do, You Know</b></h2>
  <p>Since Lord Radclyffe was too ill to attend to anything, or to see any one,
    it devolved upon Luke to make what arrangements he thought fitting for the
    lying in state and the subsequent obsequies of the murdered man. For the
    present, Philip de Mountford lay in the gloomy mortuary chamber of the Victoria
    police court. Luke had sent over massive silver candelabra, flowers and palms
    and all the paraphernalia pertaining to luxurious death.</p>
  <p>The dead man lay&mdash;not neglected&mdash;only unwatched and alone, surrounded
    by all the evidences of that wealth which he had come a very long way to
    seek, but which Fate and a murderer&rsquo;s hand had snatched with appalling
    suddenness from him.</p>
  <p>And in the private sitting room at the Langham, Louisa Harris sat opposite
    her father at breakfast, a pile of morning papers beside her plate, she herself
    silent and absorbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer tale,&rdquo; Colonel Harris was saying, &ldquo;the
    papers tell about that murder in Brussels a year ago&mdash;though I must
    say that to my mind there appears some truth in what they say. What do you
    think, Louisa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; she replied absently, &ldquo;what to think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The details of that crime, which was committed about a year ago,
    are exactly the same as those which relate to this infernal business of last
    night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are they really?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one could have said&mdash;and Louisa herself least of all&mdash;why she
    was unwilling to speak on that subject. She had never told her father, or
    any one for a matter of that, except&mdash;that she had been so near to the
    actual scene of that mysterious crime in Brussels, and that she had known
    its every detail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I must say,&rdquo; reiterated Colonel Harris emphatically, &ldquo;that
    I agree with the leading article in the <i>Times</i>. One crime begets another.
    If that hooligan&mdash;or whatever he was&mdash;in Brussels had not invented
    this new and dastardly way of murdering a man in a cab and then making himself
    scarce and sending the cab spinning on its way, no doubt Philip de Mountford
    would be alive now. Not that that would be a matter for great rejoicings.
    Still a crime is a crime, and if we were going to allow blackguards to be
    murdered all over the place by other blackguards, where would law and order
    be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was talking more loudly and volubly than was his wont, and he took almost
    ostentatiously quantities of food on his plate, which it was quite obvious
    he never meant to eat. He also steadily avoided meeting his daughter&rsquo;s
    eyes. But at this juncture she put both elbows on the table, rested her chin
    in her hands, and looked straight across at her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, dear,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use what?&rdquo; he queried with ungrammatical directness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use your pretending to talk at random and to be eating a hearty
    breakfast, when your thoughts are just as much absorbed as mine are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; he grunted evasively, but was glad enough to push aside
    the plateful of eggs and bacon which, indeed, he had no desire to eat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; she continued gently, &ldquo;read all the papers,
    just as I have, and you know as well as I do what to read between the lines
    when they talk of &lsquo;clues&rsquo;  and of &lsquo;certain sensational
    developments.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he retorted gruffly, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
    all nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course it is. But worrying nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how such rubbish can worry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for myself. But for Luke. He must have
    got an inkling by now of what is going on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course he has. And if he has a grain of sense he&rsquo;ll treat
    it with the contempt it deserves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, father. But just think for a moment. Place
    yourself in Luke&rsquo;s position. The very idea that you might be suspected
    must in itself be terrible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not when you are innocent,&rdquo; he rejoined with the absolute certitude
    of a man who has never been called upon to face any really serious problem
    in life.  &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care what the rabble said about me, if
    I had a clear conscience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa was silent for a moment or two, then she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke is different somehow. He has been different lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has a lot to put up with, with old Radclyffe going off his head
    in that ridiculous way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Louisa did not reply to that suggestion. She knew well enough that it
    was neither Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s unkindness, nor the arrogance of the new
    cousin that had changed and softened Luke&rsquo;s entire nature.</p>
  <p>The day that he had sat beside her on the stairs at Lady Ducies&rsquo; ball,
    the completeness of the change had been fully borne in on her. When Luke
    said to her: &ldquo;I would give all I have in the world to lie on the ground
    before you and to kiss the soles of your feet,&rdquo; she knew that Love
    had wrought its usual exquisite miracle, the absorption of self by another,
    the utter sinking of the ego before the high altar of the loved one. She
    knew all that, but dear old Colonel Harris had forgotten&mdash;perhaps he
    had never known.</p>
  <p>That knowledge comes to so few nowadays. Life, psychology, and sexual problems
    have taken the place of the divine lesson which has glorified the world since
    the birth of Lilith.</p>
  <p>All that Louisa now remarked to her kind and sensible father was&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know, dear, suspicion has killed a man before now. It was but
    a very little while ago that a noble-hearted gentleman preferred death to
    such dishonour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your head,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;full of nonsense,
    Lou. Try and be a sensible woman now, and think of it all quietly. Is there
    anything you would like me to do, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see Uncle Ryder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At Scotland Yard, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is at the head of the Criminal Investigation Department, isn&rsquo;t
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always understood so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would he see you, do you think, at his office?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom not see me?&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel Harris. &ldquo;Of course
    he would. What do you want me to see him about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He could tell you exactly how matters stood with regard to&mdash;to
    Luke, couldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He could. But would he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can but try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity your aunt is out of town; you might have
    heard a good deal from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Sir Thomas never tells aunt anything that&rsquo;s professional,&rdquo; said
    Louisa with a smile. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be forever making muddles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure she would,&rdquo; he assented with deep conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I might go with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? To Tom&rsquo;s? I don&rsquo;t think he would like that, Lou:
    and it wouldn&rsquo;t quite do you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she agreed with hardly even a sigh of disappointment.
    She was so accustomed, you see, to being thwarted by convention, whenever
    impulse carried her out of the bounds which the world had prescribed. Moreover,
    she expected to see Luke soon. He would be sure to come directly after an
    early visit to Grosvenor Square.</p>
  <p>She helped her father on with his coat. She was almost satisfied that he
    should go alone. She would have an hour with Luke, if he came early, and
    it was necessary that she should have him to herself, before too many people
    had shouted evil and good news, congratulations, opprobrium, and suspicions
    at him.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris, she knew, would get quite as much if not more information
    out of his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Ryder, than he could do if she&mdash;a
    mere woman&mdash;happened to be present at the interview. Sir Thomas would
    trust Colonel Harris with professional matters which he never would confide
    to a woman, and Louisa trusted her father implicitly.</p>
  <p>She knew that, despite the grumblings and crustiness peculiar to every Englishman,
    when he is troubled with domestic matters whilst sitting at his own breakfast
    table, her father had Luke&rsquo;s welfare just as much at heart as she had
    herself.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Not All About It</b></h2>
  <p>Colonel Harris sent in his card to Sir Thomas Ryder. He had driven over
    from the Langham in a hansom&mdash;holding taxicabs in even more whole-hearted
    abhorrence than before. He inquired at once if Sir Thomas was in his private
    sanctum, and if so whether he might see him.</p>
  <p>Curiously enough the chief, usually quite inaccessible to the casual visitor&mdash;whether
    relative or stranger&mdash;received his brother-in-law immediately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Will,&rdquo; he said by way of greeting, the way Englishmen
    have of saying that they are pleased to see one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; responded Colonel Harris in the same eloquent tone.</p>
  <p>And the two old boys shook hands.</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas then resumed his official chair behind his huge desk and motioned
    his brother-in-law to an arm-chair close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a cigar,&rdquo; said the host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; rejoined the other.</p>
  <p>The box was handed across, a Havana selected.</p>
  <p>The cigars were lighted, and for quite three minutes the two men smoked
    in silence. One of them had come here to find out how much of his daughter&rsquo;s
    happiness lay in jeopardy; the other knew what was in the balance, the danger
    to his niece&rsquo;s happiness, the terrible abyss of misery which yawned
    at her feet.</p>
  <p>But both sat there and enjoyed their cigars. They were dressed with scrupulous
    care, in the uniform prescribed by the world in which they lived as being
    suitable for gentlemen of their position and of their age; frock coats and
    dark gray trousers, immaculate collar, and tie with pearl pin. Both wore
    a seal ring on the little finger of the left hand, and a watch chain of early
    Victorian design. They might be twins but for their faces. Convention had
    put a livery on them which they would on no account have discarded.</p>
  <p>But the faces were very different. Colonel Harris carried his sixty years
    as easily as if they had been forty. There were not many lines on his round,
    chubby face, with its red cheeks, and round, child-like eyes. The heavy cavalry
    moustache, once auburn, now almost white, hid the expression of the mouth,
    but one felt, judging by the eyes and the smooth forehead, which continued
    very far now onto the back of his head, that if one were allowed a peep below
    that walrus-like face adornment one would see a mouth that was kind and none
    too firm, the mouth of a man who had led other men perhaps but who had invariably
    been led by his women folk.</p>
  <p>Now Sir Thomas Ryder was&mdash;or rather is, for he is still in perfect
    health and full vigour&mdash;a very different type of man. You have no doubt
    seen him about town&mdash;for he takes a constitutional in the park every
    day on his way to his work, and he goes to most first nights at the theatres&mdash;and
    if so you will have admired the keen, sharp face, the closely set eyes, the
    mobile mouth free from moustache or beard: the face is furrowed all over,
    especially round the eyes, yet he does not look old. That is because of the
    furrows; they form a wonderful net-work round his eyes, giving them an expression
    of perpetual keen amusement. The hair is pale in colour&mdash;not white but
    faded&mdash;and scanty. Sir Thomas wears it carefully brushed across the
    top of his head, with a parting on the left side.</p>
  <p>He has a trick when he is thinking deeply of passing his hand&mdash;which
    is white, slender and tapering&mdash;over that scanty covering of what, but
    for it, would be a bald cranium.</p>
  <p>Some people said that Sir Thomas Ryder was a man without any sentiment;
    others that he was a slave to red tape; but no one denied the uncontrovertible
    fact that he was the right man in the right place.</p>
  <p>He looked the part and always acted it, and fewer blunders had undoubtedly
    been committed in the detective department of the metropolitan police since
    Sir Thomas Ryder took the guiding reins in hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve come
    to see me about this de Mountford business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Colonel Harris simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not a pleasant business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that. The papers are full of it, and it&rsquo;s all a confounded
    damnable business, Tom, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;all about it,&rsquo;&rdquo; rejoined
    Sir Thomas dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Louisa says. Women are so queer about things of
    that sort, and the papers are full of twaddle. She is anxious about Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all nonsense, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris did not reply immediately; for one thing, he did not know
    exactly how to put his own fears and anxieties into words. They were so horrible
    and so farfetched that to tell them plainly and baldly to his brother-in-law,
    to this man with whom he was soberly smoking a cigar in a sober-looking office,
    whilst hansoms and taxicabs were rattling past in the street below within
    sight and hearing, seemed little short of idiocy. He was not a man of deep
    penetration&mdash;was Colonel Harris&mdash;no great reader of thoughts or
    of character. He tried to look keenly at Sir Thomas&rsquo;s shrewd face,
    but all he was conscious of was a net-work of wrinkles round a pair of eyes
    which seemed to be twinkling with humour.</p>
  <p>Humour at this moment? Great Heavens above!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he blurted out somewhat crossly at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
    help me out a bit, Tom. Hang it all, man, all this officialism makes me dumb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sir Thomas blandly, &ldquo;let it do that,
    Will,&rdquo; and the speaker&rsquo;s eyes seemed to twinkle even more merrily
    than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then tell me something about Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke de Mountford,&rdquo; mused the other as if the name recalled
    some distant impression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Luke de Mountford, who is engaged to Louisa, your niece, man,
    and she&rsquo;s breaking her heart with all the drivel these newspapers talk
    and I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer; so I&rsquo;ve come to you, Tom,
    and you must tell me what truth there is in the drivel, and that&rsquo;s
    all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas Ryder seemed, whilst the other thus talked volubly, to have suddenly
    made up his mind to say more than had originally been his intention. Anyway,
    he now said with abrupt directness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If, my good Will, by &lsquo;drivel&rsquo; you mean that in the matter
    of the assassination of Philip de Mountford, in a taxicab last night, grave
    suspicion rests on his cousin Luke, then there&rsquo;s a great deal of truth
    in the drivel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris received the sudden blow without much apparent emotion. He
    had been sitting in an arm-chair with one hand buried in his trousers pocket,
    the other holding the cigar.</p>
  <p>Now he merely glanced down at the cigar for a moment and then conveyed it
    to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;does that mean exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That unless Luke de Mountford will, within the next forty-eight hours,
    answer certain questions more satisfactorily than he has done hitherto, he
    will be arrested on a charge of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; protested Colonel Harris hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;hang it all, man! you know Luke de Mountford.
    Do you believe for a moment that he would commit such a dastardly crime?
    Why, the boy wouldn&rsquo;t know how to plan such villainy, let alone carry
    it through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Will,&rdquo; rejoined the other quietly, &ldquo;the many
    years which I have spent at this desk have taught me many things. Among others
    I have learned that every man is more or less capable of crime: it only depends
    what the incentive&mdash;the temptation if you like to call it so&mdash;or
    the provocation happens to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But here there was no provocation, no temptation, no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris paused abruptly. He felt rather than saw his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
    eyes in their framework of wrinkles resting with obvious sense of amusement
    upon his wrathful face. No temptation? And what of a peerage and a fortune
    lost, that could only be regained by the death of the intruder? No provocation?
    And what of the brother and sister turned out of the old home? The good,
    simple-minded man had sense enough to see that here, if he wished to speak
    up for Luke, he was on the wrong track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What questions,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;does Luke not answer
    satisfactorily?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How he spent certain hours of yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was dancing attendance on Louisa and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, was he? Well that&rsquo;s satisfactory enough. At what time did
    you part from him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! he escorted us to the Danish Legation where we were dining.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what time was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he was not dining at the Danish Legation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He came and fetched us again soon after eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, but between whiles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between whiles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Between eight and soon after eleven?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yes, of course,
    I do! What a stupid ass I am. Luke told me himself that he was going to see
    his uncle at the Something Club in Shaftesbury Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Veterans&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;the Veterans&rsquo;. Luke wanted to persuade
    old Radclyffe to go abroad for the benefit of his health&mdash;Algeciras&mdash;that
    was it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas dryly, &ldquo;and Luke de Mountford
    went to the Veterans&rsquo; Club in Shaftesbury Avenue, and he asked to see
    Lord Radclyffe, who was a more or less regular habitu&eacute; at that hour.
    On being told that Lord Radclyffe was not there that evening, but that Mr.
    de Mountford was in the smoking room, Luke elected to go in and presumably
    to have a talk with his cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Colonel Harris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, but we did. Let me tell you what followed. The hall porter of
    the club showed Luke into the smoking room, and less than five minutes later
    he heard loud and angry words proceeding from that room. That a quarrel was
    going on between the two cousins was of course obvious. One or two members
    of the club remarked on the noise, and one gentleman actually opened the
    smoking room door to see what was going on. He seems to have heard the words &lsquo;blackguard&rsquo; and &lsquo;beggar&rsquo; pleasingly
    intermingled and flying from one young man to the other. This witness knew
    Philip de Mountford very well by sight, but he had never seen Luke. But remember
    that Luke denies neither the interview nor the quarrel. The former lasted
    close on an hour, and Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s journey to Algeciras was the
    original topic of discussion. At about nine o&rsquo;clock Luke emerged from
    the smoking room. The hall porter saw him. He was then very pale and almost
    tottered as he walked. Men do get at times intoxicated with rage, you know,
    Will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, and I can well imagine what happened at that interview.
    Radclyffe had become such a confounded fool that he would not move or do
    anything without this Philip&rsquo;s permission: and Luke was determined
    to get him down to Algeciras at once. As Philip was at the club, he thought
    that he would tackle him then and there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so. He did tackle him. And equally of course the two men quarrelled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But hang it all, one&rsquo;s not going to murder every man with whom
    one quarrels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop a moment, Will. As you say, one does not murder every man with
    whom one quarrels. But you must admit that this is altogether an exceptional
    case. There was more than a mere quarrel between these two men. There was
    deadly enmity&mdash;justified enmity, I&rsquo;ll own, on Luke&rsquo;s side.
    We have already come across&mdash;it was not very difficult&mdash;two or
    three of the servants who were in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s house before Luke
    and his brother and sister were finally turned out of it. They all have tales
    to tell of the terrible rows which used to go on in the house between the
    cousins. You, Will, must know how Luke hated this Philip de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Colonel Harris was silent. What was the use of denying such an obvious
    truth?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wanted,&rdquo; continued the other man quietly, &ldquo;to hear
    the truth, Will, and you&rsquo;ve got it. For Louisa&rsquo;s sake, for all
    our sakes, in fact, I made up my mind to tell you all&mdash;or most&mdash;that
    is officially known to me at this moment. You must get Louisa out of town
    at once&mdash;take her abroad if you can, and keep English newspapers away
    from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Colonel Harris firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she will, if you put it the right way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which saying on the part of the acute chief of our Criminal Investigation
    Department was but a further proof&mdash;if indeed such proofs were still
    needed nowadays&mdash;of how little clever men know of commonplace women.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The case will be extremely unpleasant,&rdquo; resumed Sir Thomas
    who was quite unconscious of the ignorance which he had just displayed. &ldquo;It
    will be hateful for you, and quite impossible for Louisa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always supposing,&rdquo; retorted the other, &ldquo;that Luke is
    guilty, which neither I nor Louisa will admit for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas, &ldquo;is as you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put down his cigar, crossed one leg over the other, leaned back in his
    chair, and folded his tapering hands together, putting finger to finger,
    with the gesture of one who is dealing with a youthful mind, and has much
    to explain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Will,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;I have three men standing
    in my outer office at the present moment. Two of them have come back after
    having questioned the past servants of the Grosvenor Square household. There
    was the butler Parker, and an elderly housekeeper, both of whom are in service
    in the West End. The woman tried to screen Luke and to make light of the
    many quarrels which broke out between the cousins on all possible occasions;
    but she broke down under our fellows&rsquo; sharp questions. She had to admit
    that the arrogance of the one man often drove the other to unguarded language,
    and that she had on more than one occasion heard the men servants of the
    house say that they would not be astonished if murder ensued one day. Well,
    we have these two witnesses, and can easily get hold of the two or three
    footmen who expressed those particular views. So much for the past six months.
    Now for last night. The third man who is out there waiting for me to see
    him is Frederick Power, hall porter at the Veterans&rsquo; Club. The story
    which he told to our Mr. Travers is so important in its minutest detail,
    that I have decided to question him myself so that I may leave no possible
    loop-hole to doubt or to inaccuracy in the retelling. I am going to send
    for the man now. You come and sit round here, the other side of my desk;
    from this position you will be able to watch the man&rsquo;s face, as well
    as hear what he has got to say. Now, would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, Tom,&rdquo; was Colonel Harris&rsquo;s brief method
    of acknowledging his brother-in-law&rsquo;s kindness, in thus breaking a
    piece of red tape, and setting aside a very strict official rule. He did
    as Sir Thomas directed, and sat down in the recess behind the chief&rsquo;s
    desk, in a comfortable arm-chair with his back to the curtained window.</p>
  <p>He would not acknowledge even to himself how deeply stirred he was by all
    that he had heard, and now by the anticipation of what was yet to come. Emotion&mdash;like
    he was experiencing now&mdash;had never come his way before now. He had lost
    his only son on the Modder River&mdash;that had been sorrow of an acute kind;
    he had laid a much loved wife to rest in the village churchyard close to
    his stately home in Kent; and he had escorted his late beloved sovereign
    to her last resting place on that never-to-be-forgotten day close on five
    years ago now; those three events in his life had been the great strains
    to which his nerves and sensibilities had been subjected in the past.</p>
  <p>But this was altogether different. The sensations which the good man experienced
    were such that he scarcely knew them himself; he had faced sorrow before,
    never dishonour&mdash;some one else&rsquo;s dishonour, of course&mdash;still
    it touched him very nearly, for, though he might not be a very keen observer,
    he dearly loved his daughter, and dishonour seemed to be touching her, striking
    at her through Luke.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    And That&rsquo;s The Truth</b></h2>
  <p>Frederick Power was shown in.</p>
  <p>I won&rsquo;t have you think that there was anything remarkable about the
    man, or anything that would&mdash;even momentarily&mdash;distinguish him
    from any number of other hall porters, who wear a uniform and peaked cap,
    have the air of having seen military service, and wear a couple of medals
    on a well-developed chest.</p>
  <p>He was perfectly respectful, all the more so because Sir Thomas was General
    Sir Thomas Ryder, K.C.B.&mdash;a fact which impressed the ex-soldier far
    more than any other exalted title, non-military in character, would have
    done.</p>
  <p>He saluted and stood at attention, and as he gave answer to Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
    preliminary questions his words rang out clear and direct, obviously truthful,
    as if echoing in the barrack yard at 6 A.M. of a frosty spring morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your name is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick Power, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are hall porter at the Veterans&rsquo; Club in Shaftesbury Avenue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were in the lobby of the club last night as usual?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Mr. Philip de Mountford, who is a member of the club, was in
    the smoking room at eight o&rsquo;clock yesterday evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He came almost every evening, I understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone mostly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not often, sir. Lord Radclyffe was with him most evenings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Lord Radclyffe and Mr. de Mountford dined together on those occasions
    in the club dining-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But last night Mr. de Mountford was alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He had some dinner at about half past seven and then he
    went to the smoking room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later on a gentleman called to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir. It was about a quarter past eight. The gentleman
    asked to see Lord Radclyffe, but I said that &rsquo;is lordship &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t
    come to the club this night. Then the gentleman asked if Mr. de Mountford
    was in, and I said yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you showed him into the smoking room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;im he would find Mr. de Mountford in the smoking room;
    yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather against club rules to allow strangers to
    walk in and out of the rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, the Veterans&rsquo; is a new club&mdash;and the committee
    ain&rsquo;t very partik&rsquo;lar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far the questions and answers had followed on one another in quick succession.
    Sir Thomas Ryder, with his clever lean head held somewhat on one side, appeared
    to be reciting a well-learned lesson, so even and placid was the tone of
    his voice and so indifferent the expression of his furrowed face. One leg
    was crossed over the other and his tapering hands, white and wrinkled like
    his face, toyed with a large ivory paper knife hardly whiter in colour than
    they.</p>
  <p>He had not told Frederick Power to sit down, as he might have done in the
    case of a witness who was a civilian. He preferred to keep the man standing,
    and at attention, confident that he would thus get clearer and sharper replies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he resumed after a brief interval during which
    he had modified his position somewhat, but had not varied the placid expression
    of his face, &ldquo;you told the visitor that he would find Mr. de Mountford
    in the smoking room. What happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gentleman walked in, sir. And he shut the door, sir, after &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything that went on inside the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. I didn&rsquo;t pay no attention at first, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then afterward? After awhile, you did pay attention, didn&rsquo;t
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I did. The door of the smoking room is quite close to the
    entrance, sir, and presently I heard loud voices like as if the two gentlemen
    was quarrelling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear what was said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, not the words. But the voices they sounded awful. And one
    other gentleman &rsquo;e come along from the dining-room, and asked me what
    the noise was about. There ain&rsquo;t many members now at the Veterans&rsquo;,
    sir, and being a foggy night we was partik&rsquo;lar quiet. But this gentleman &rsquo;e
    was curious about the noise, so &rsquo;e just opened the smoking room door
    and peeped in, and then I did &rsquo;ear a few words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Abuse, sir, mostly. One gentleman was goin&rsquo; on awful, but I
    couldn&rsquo;t rightly say which one it was. I &rsquo;eard the word &lsquo;beggar&rsquo; and &lsquo;lazy,
    idling, good-for-nothing&rsquo;  but I couldn&rsquo;t rightly say &rsquo;oo
    said &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did this go on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, a long time, sir! I couldn&rsquo;t say for sure. After a bit
    it got quiet in the smoking room. And at about nine o&rsquo;clock or soon
    after the visitor come away, and &rsquo;e asked me for a light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he seem like then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought &rsquo;e&rsquo;d been drinking, sir. His face was all queer,
    and pale, and moist-like, and &rsquo;is &rsquo;and shook like anything when
    he lighted &rsquo;is cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. de Mountford did not come out with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, not just then, but &rsquo;e come out of the smoking room
    a moment or two later, whilst &rsquo;is visitor was still in the &rsquo;all.
    Mr. de Mountford &rsquo;e was quite calm, sir, didn&rsquo;t look at all as
    if &rsquo;e&rsquo;d been &rsquo;aving a quarrel. &rsquo;E&rsquo;d his cigar
    between &rsquo;is lips, his &rsquo;at on, and &rsquo;is overcoat over &rsquo;is
    arm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he speak to the visitor then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not right away, sir. &rsquo;E seemed to be &rsquo;esitating like
    at first, then  &rsquo;e came forward and &rsquo;e says: &lsquo;I am going
    back to Grosvenor Square now. Would you like to see Uncle Rad about this
    business yourself? But I warn you that &rsquo;e is of the same mind as myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did the other gentleman say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E just kind o&rsquo; laughed and shrugged his shoulders and
    said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then after that did they agree to go to Grosvenor Square together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know, sir, if the two gentlemen said anything
    about that, but the visitor &rsquo;e went out first, and Mr. de Mountford
    followed &rsquo;im into the outer lobby. Then &rsquo;e turned and spoke to
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. de Mountford, sir; the other gentleman wasn&rsquo;t a yard away
    from  &rsquo;im and must &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard every word &rsquo;e said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E said to me: &lsquo;Power, I say, you&rsquo;ve no business
    to allow people to enter the club rooms like that. You must keep them waiting
    in the &rsquo;all, one will get hopelessly pestered by beggars at this rate.&rsquo; Them
    were Mr. de Mountford&rsquo;s very words, sir, I&rsquo;d take my Bible oath
    to every one of &rsquo;em; and the other gentleman  &rsquo;e was in the outer
    lobby, sir, and &rsquo;e must &rsquo;ave &rsquo;eard every syllable. I caught
    sight of &rsquo;is face and, my word, there was murder in &rsquo;is eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Power,&rdquo; admonished Sir Thomas, thus checking
    the man&rsquo;s flow of excited eloquence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; replied the other humbly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after that what happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Both gentlemen went off, sir. I tried to look after &rsquo;em but
    the fog was that thick one couldn&rsquo;t see one&rsquo;s &rsquo;and before
    one&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you lost sight of them just outside the club-house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you see either of these two gentlemen since then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; And the man&rsquo;s voice dropped to a solemn whisper. &ldquo;Mr.
    de Mountford was murdered in a taxicab, sir&mdash;must &rsquo;ave been soon
    after &rsquo;e left the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very soon, I should say. But the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw the other gentleman this morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Travers from the police, sir, &rsquo;e called to see me at the
    club, and &rsquo;e took me in a taxicab to Grosvenor Square, and told the
    shoffer, sir, to pull up by the curb on the garden side. Then &rsquo;e told
    me to watch a partik&rsquo;lar &rsquo;ouse opposite and see &rsquo;oo was
    goin&rsquo; in or out. I didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;arf like it, sir, because I&rsquo;m
    not supposed to absent myself for very long of a morning, though the committee
    ain&rsquo;t very partik&rsquo;lar. But Mr. Travers &rsquo;e was of the police,
    sir, so I thought it was right to do as &rsquo;e told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite right. And what did you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much for close on an hour, sir; a carriage drew up to the
    door of the &rsquo;ouse and an elderly gentleman got out. Mr. Travers told
    me that it was the doctor. &rsquo;E rang the bell and went into the &rsquo;ouse.
    Then after a bit &rsquo;oo did I see walking down the street and straight
    up to the front door of the partik&rsquo;lar  &rsquo;ouse, I&rsquo;d been
    told to look at, but Mr. de Mountford&rsquo;s visitor of last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You recognized him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t mistake &rsquo;im, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you call Mr. Travers&rsquo;s attention to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I told &rsquo;im that was the gentleman &rsquo;oo&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad
    an awful quarrel with Mr. Philip de Mountford at the club last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, Power. I won&rsquo;t trouble you further now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your position at the club is a permanent one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are always to be found there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Always, sir, whenever you want me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, send a line to the chief superintendent at Scotland Yard in
    case your plans get suddenly modified and you are no longer to be found at
    the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not likely, sir. Thank you, sir. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas touched the electric button in the wall behind him, and a man
    in a dark blue uniform appeared. Frederick Power was dismissed. He saluted
    both gentlemen and turning on his heel in proper military fashion, he marched
    out of the room, obviously delighted with his own importance and with the
    adventure which varied so pleasantly the monotonous evenness of his existence.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    Have Another Cigar</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, William, what do you think of it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men had sat in silence for quite a considerable time after Frederick
    Power had marched out of the room. Colonel Harris buried in thought was in
    no hurry to talk things over. Sir Thomas Ryder&mdash;a very busy man&mdash;was
    the more impatient of the two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must tell you,&rdquo; he said, seeing that his brother-in-law seemed
    disinclined to speak, &ldquo;that our man Travers, as soon as Power had pointed
    Luke out to him, went and rang the bell at Radclyffe&rsquo;s house and quickly
    enough established beyond a doubt that the man who had just entered it was
    Mr. Luke de Mountford. I tell you this now, so as to disabuse your mind once
    and for all in case you should imagine that this might be a case of mistaken
    identity. Moreover you yourself know and have admitted to me that Luke&rsquo;s
    intention was to seek out his uncle and his cousin at the Veterans&rsquo;  Club,
    after he parted from you at eight o&rsquo;clock last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Colonel Harris, &ldquo;I know that. I was not thinking
    of mistaken identity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; rejoined the other, &ldquo;were thinking of Luke, and
    so am I. I have thought little of any one else since first the crime was
    reported to me last night. And long before Travers gleaned the outlines of
    the story which Power has just amplified for us, I vaguely guessed at the
    broad lines of it. Now that I know it in all its details, I can see the whole
    scene in the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club before me. You may believe
    me or not as you like, but as a matter of fact I know quite a good deal about
    Luke de Mountford. I have often met him, of course, and though we have never
    been very intimate&mdash;for I am a busy man and have but little time for
    intimacy with my fellow-men&mdash;I have had many opportunities of studying
    him. He has a very curious power of self-control&mdash;almost an abnormal
    one I call it, and a morbid hatred of public scenes or scandal. This of course
    he shares with a great many men of his class, and his self-control is all
    the more remarkable as he is not by any means the impassive young man about
    town which he pretends to be. Well, that same power, I suppose, stood him
    in good stead in the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club. In Power&rsquo;s
    picturesque parlance &lsquo;there was murder in his eye.&rsquo; Of course
    he had been provoked beyond the bounds of endurance, and if he had rushed
    at Philip de Mountford and strangled him then and there, no one would have
    been astonished. I should,&rdquo; continued Sir Thomas with emphasis, &ldquo;because
    it would not have been like the Luke whom I had studied. The picture of two
    gentlemen at fisticuffs like a pair of navvies would not have been an edifying
    one, and Luke&mdash;as I know him&mdash;would above all wish not to make
    a spectacle of himself before the hall porter or before a crowd in the ante-room
    of a second-rate club. He naturally&mdash;for that sort of thing becomes
    second nature&mdash;pulled himself together and walked out into the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You must not think for a moment that Sir Thomas Ryder was habitually a talkative
    man. Englishmen of his class and type are rarely talkative, and Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
    position and occupation had rendered him less communicative than most. But
    Colonel Harris and he had been brother officers, friends long before family
    ties were closely knit by marriage, and he considered the present crisis
    a very serious one.</p>
  <p>He had had enough to do with crime in the past few years since he had obtained
    the interesting post which he now occupied, but never with a crime which
    affected him personally as this one did. Luke de Mountford was of course
    nothing to him, except in connection with Louisa Harris. But this was a strong
    tie. Louisa was his own wife&rsquo;s niece; she was the daughter of a friend,
    of a brother officer. No one who is not in some manner or other in touch
    with military men can have the slightest idea of how much those two magic
    words mean: &ldquo;brother officer&rdquo;: what magnetism lies in them: what
    appeal they make to all that is most loyal, most willing, most helpful in
    a man.</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas felt that the mud of irretrievable disgrace which was bound to
    smirch Luke de Mountford would in no small measure redound on Louisa too.
    Instinctively too all his sensibilities recoiled against the idea of a gentleman,
    one of his own caste, being dragged in this peculiarly loathsome mire. It
    seemed impossible that that type of man should commit a murder&mdash;a murder&mdash;just
    an ordinary, brutal, commonplace murder, such as the rough and tumble herd
    of humanity commit when under the stress of vulgar passions: greed, avarice,
    jealousy. It was this juxtaposition of the mean and sordid against his own
    class that revolted Sir Thomas Ryder. He was loyal to his brother officer
    in his endeavour to induce him to keep out of all that mud which would be
    scattered all round presently, when the papers came out with their sensational
    headlines; but he was also&mdash;perhaps more so&mdash;loyal to his caste:
    his was the <i>esprit de corps</i>, not only of militarism but of birth and
    breeding. He would not, if he could, have a gentleman held up to opprobrium,
    and if this could be avoided by the unfortunate criminal&rsquo;s flight from
    justice&mdash;well, Sir Thomas was ready and willing to take upon his shoulders
    the burden of contempt and ridicule, which the press and the general public
    would presently be hurling at him and at his department for their hopeless
    incompetence in allowing a murderer to escape.</p>
  <p>Therefore he was putting the case against Luke more clearly and with a greater
    wealth of detail before his brother-in-law than the conscientious discharge
    of duty should have allowed. In fact we see Sir Thomas Ryder&mdash;a hard
    disciplinarian, a hide and tape bound official&mdash;freely transgressing
    the most elementary rules which duty prescribes. He was sitting in his private
    office with his brother-in-law, giving away secrets that belonged not to
    him but to his department, conniving through the words which he spoke at
    the fleeing from justice of a criminal who belonged not to him but to the
    State.</p>
  <p>He was making the case against Luke de Mountford to appear as black as it
    was in effect, so that Colonel Harris and Louisa might take fright and induce
    the unfortunate man to realize his danger in time and to shrink from facing
    the consequences of his own terrible deed.</p>
  <p>But Colonel Harris&mdash;with the obstinacy of those who throughout life
    have never led but have always been ruled&mdash;would not see the case through
    his brother-in-law&rsquo;s spectacles. He clung to his own repudiation of
    the possibility of Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s guilt. He behaved quite unconsciously,
    just as Louisa would have wished him to behave, had she been present here
    to prompt him.</p>
  <p>To Sir Thomas&rsquo;s most convincing <i>expos&eacute;</i> of the situation
    he lent an attentive ear, but the shrug of his shoulders when the other man
    paused to take breath was in itself a testimony of loyalty to Luke&rsquo;s
    cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang it all, man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are not going to sit
    there and tell me that Luke de Mountford&mdash;the man whom I myself would
    have chosen as a son-in-law had Lou not forestalled me&mdash;that Luke would
    commit a deliberate murder? In the name of common-sense, Tom, why it&rsquo;s
    unthinkable! Do you mean to say that you actually believe that Luke, after
    he left that God-forsaken club, joined his cousin again as if nothing had
    happened; that he got into a taxicab with him, and poked him through the
    neck whilst the man was looking another way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Roughly speaking,&rdquo; assented Sir Thomas, &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s
    what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you call yourself a shrewd detective!&rdquo; exclaimed Colonel
    Harris hotly. &ldquo;And you hold the lives of men practically in the hollow
    of your hand! Why, man! have you forgotten one thing?&rdquo; he continued,
    his gruff voice assuming a note of triumph, &ldquo;the most important in
    all this damnable business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I forgotten, Will?&rdquo; asked the other not at all ruffled
    by the gallant colonel&rsquo;s sudden tone of contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The weapon, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the weapon,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas
    calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have! Do you mean to tell me that Luke de Mountford
    habitually walks about the streets of London with an Italian stiletto in
    his trousers pocket? for I am told that it was with a thing of that sort
    that the murder was committed. Or according to you did Luke escort Louisa
    to a dinner-party with the avowed intention at the back of his mind of committing
    a murder later on if occasion offered? Did he bring an Italian stiletto from
    home when he came to meet his fianc&eacute;e at the Langham Hotel, or did
    he buy one on the way to the Veterans&rsquo; Club? Which of these cock-and-bull
    theories do you hold, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; admitted Sir Thomas with a placid smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; concluded Colonel Harris contemptuously, &ldquo;you
    think that Luke was&mdash;as I said&mdash;in the habit of carrying an Italian
    stiletto in his trousers pocket?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; rejoined the other, still unruffled, &ldquo;but I know
    that Luke de Mountford is in the habit of carrying a snake-wood walking stick,
    which he once bought&mdash;years ago&mdash;somewhere abroad, and the top
    of which contains a short pointed dagger which fits into the body of the
    stick. And what&rsquo;s more you know that stick too, Will; you have often
    seen it. Are you prepared to swear that Luke hadn&rsquo;t it with him last
    night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t it with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are prepared to swear to that?&rdquo; insisted the other earnestly.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris was silent. For the first time since the beginning of this
    long interview he felt as if all the blood in his body was receding back
    to his heart causing it to beat so wildly that he thought it was about to
    choke him. The colour fled from his cheeks and the cigar dropped from between
    nerveless fingers. Swift as lightning a recollection came back to him&mdash;a
    vision of Luke entering the sitting-room of the Langham Hotel with his coat
    on and his hat and stick in the left hand.</p>
  <p>But he would not give in even now&mdash;not on such paltry surmises. Any
    number of men he knew carried sticks that contained weapons of self-defence.
    He himself possessed a very murderous-looking swordstick which he had once
    bought in Paris. He fought down this oncoming attack of weakness, and blamed
    himself severely for it too. It savoured of disloyalty to Louisa and to Luke.
    He stooped and picked his cigar up and looked his brother-in-law boldly in
    the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;swear either way, whether
    Luke had his stick with him last night or not. I know that stick, of course.
    I have got one very like it myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas with his placid smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if that&rsquo;s one of the proofs on which you are going to accuse
    my future son-in-law of having committed a murder, then all I can say is,
    Tom, that you and I are seeing the last of one another to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Sir Thomas took this threat, as he had taken Colonel Harris&rsquo;s
    undisguised expressions of contempt, with perfect equanimity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I did accuse Luke de Mountford
    or any other man of murder on such paltry grounds as that, Will, you would
    be perfectly justified in turning your back on me, if for no other reason
    than that I should then be an incompetent ass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what more is there then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only this, Will. That the stick which you have so often seen in Luke
    de Mountford&rsquo;s hand, was found this morning inside the railings of
    Green Park; it bears unmistakable signs of the use to which it was put last
    night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;that it was stained&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How long a time elapsed between the beginning of that query and its last
    words Colonel Harris could not say. The uttering of the words was a terrible
    effort. They seemed to choke him ere they reached his lips. A buzzing and
    singing filled his ears so that he did not hear Sir Thomas&rsquo;s reply,
    but through a strange veil which half obscured his vision he saw his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
    slow nod of affirmation. For the first time in his life, the man who had
    fought against naked savages in the swamps or sands of Africa, who had heard,
    unflinching, the news of the death of his only son, felt himself totally
    unnerved. He heard as in a dream the hum of the busy city in the street below,
    hansoms and omnibuses rattling along the road, the cries of news vendors
    or hawkers, the bustle of humdrum, every-day life: and through it the ticking
    of his own watch in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
  <p>He remembered afterward how strangely this had impressed him: that he could
    hear the ticking of his own watch. He had never been conscious before of
    such an acute sense of hearing. And yet the buzzing and singing in his ears
    went on. And he was horribly, painfully conscious of silly, trivial things&mdash;the
    ticking of his watch which obsessed him, the irregularity in the design of
    the wall paper, the broken top of the inkstand on Sir Thomas&rsquo;s desk.</p>
  <p>The great, all-important fact had escaped momentarily from his consciousness.
    He forgot that Philip de Mountford had been murdered, and that Luke&rsquo;s
    stick, bloodstained and damning, had been found inside the railings of the
    park.</p>
  <p>A cycle of time went by&mdash;an eternity, or else a few seconds. Sir Thomas
    Ryder pulled open the long drawer of his monumental desk.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris watched him doing it, and long before Sir Thomas took a certain
    Something from out the drawer, the colonel knew what that something would
    be.</p>
  <p>A familiar thing enough. The colonel had seen it over and over again in
    Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s hand. A slender stick of rich looking, dark wood,
    only very little thicker at the top than at the base and with a silver band
    about six inches from the top. On the band the initials L. de M. daintily
    engraved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put it away, Tom, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; Colonel Harris hardly
    recognized his own voice; he had spoken more from a sudden instinct of shrinking
    from loathsome objects, than from any real will of his own. One glance at
    the stick had been enough. It was thickly coated with mud, and about six
    inches from the top there where the silver band showed a deep dark cleft
    between it and the length of the stick, there were other stains&mdash;obvious
    stains of blood.</p>
  <p>Yet Colonel Harris had seen worse sights than this in Zululand and at Omdurman.
    But on this stained stick, that discoloured silver band, he felt it impossible
    to look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have broken it to you, Will, as gently as I could,&rdquo; said
    Sir Thomas, not quite as placidly as before. He too was not unmoved by the
    distress of his old friend. &ldquo;You see that I had no option, but to tell
    you all. You must keep out of all this, old man, and above all you must keep
    Louisa out of it. Take her abroad, Will, as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; murmured the father, dully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;She has given her
    heart to Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon forget him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not she!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;ll be horrified&mdash;when she knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he is wise, he&rsquo;ll plead guilty&mdash;his solicitor will
    advise him to do that. It is his one chance. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His one chance?&rdquo; queried the other vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of escaping the gallows. If he pleads guilty, many extenuating circumstances
    will be admitted&mdash;his own spotless reputation&mdash;and also intense
    provocation. He&rsquo;ll get a life sentence, or even perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But with a loud oath, the most forcible one he had ever uttered in his life,
    Colonel Harris had jumped to his feet and brought a heavy fist crashing down
    upon the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And by the living God, Tom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
    believe it. No! not for all your witnesses, and your cross questionings,
    and your damnable proofs. No! I&rsquo;ll not believe it, and I know that
    my girl will not believe it either&mdash;not until we hear the word &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; spoken
    by Luke&rsquo;s own lips. And we&rsquo;ll not leave London, we&rsquo;ll not
    go abroad, we&rsquo;ll not desert Luke; for I swear, by God that I don&rsquo;t
    believe that he is an assassin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Men who have always been accounted weak often have moments of unexpected
    strength. Colonel Harris now seemed to tower morally and mentally over his
    brother-in-law. The passion of loyalty was in him, and caused his eyes to
    sparkle and his cheeks to glow. The oath he uttered he spoke with fervour:
    there would be no faltering, no wavering in his defence of Luke.</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas waited a minute or two, allowing his old friend to recover his
    normal self-control as well as his breath, which was coming and going in
    quick gasps. Then he said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will, old man. Have another cigar.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    Then The Miracle Was Wrought</b></h2>
  <p>When Colonel Harris once more arrived at the Langham he found Luke and Louisa
    comfortably installed in front of the fire in the private sitting-room up
    stairs. She was leaning back against the cushions, her head resting in her
    hand, he at the foot of the sofa, his hands encircling one knee, gazing now
    and then into the fire, now and then into her face.</p>
  <p>Not troubled creatures these, not man and woman fighting a battle against
    life, against the world, for honour, for peace, and for love; not souls racked
    by painful memories of the past or grim dread of the future: only two very
    ordinary human beings, with a life behind them of serene contentment, social
    duties worthily performed, a smooth lake whereon not a ripple of sorrow or
    disgrace ever dared to mar the shiny surface.</p>
  <p>And the ruling passion strong in death was stronger still in face of this
    new life to be led: the life of to-morrow, full of the unknown, the ugly,
    the sordid and mean, full of nameless dangers, and of possible disgrace.
    The puppets were still dancing, moved by the invisible strings held by the
    hand of the implacable giant called Convention: they danced even as though
    no gaping and ravenous lions, no Bulls of Bashan, were there to see. Even
    before each other they hid the secret mysteries of their hearts; he his overwhelming
    passion for her, she her dread for his immediate future.</p>
  <p>They had not forborne to talk of Philip de Mountford&rsquo;s death; they
    would not have admitted that there was anything there that could not be discussed
    with perfect indifference&mdash;she, reclining against the cushions, and
    he in immaculate morning coat, with hair smoothly brushed, and speckless
    tie and linen, talking of things which meant life or death for them both.</p>
  <p>He had told her all he knew, his visit to Philip at the Veterans&rsquo; Club,
    his quarrel with him, the hatred which he bore to the man that was dead.
    He made no secret of the police officer&rsquo;s questionings, nor of Doctor
    Newington&rsquo;s extraordinary attitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One would think those fellows had a suspicion that I had murdered
    Philip,&rdquo; he said quite lightly.</p>
  <p>And her face never moved whilst she listened to these details, analyzing
    them in her mind, comparing them with those at which the morning papers had
    hinted, the &ldquo;clues&rdquo; and &ldquo;startling developments,&rdquo; to
    obtain confirmation of which her father had gone out to seek Sir Thomas Ryder.</p>
  <p>Luke de Mountford would no more have dreamed of telling Louisa of the dark
    suspicions which really threatened him, than he would have laid bare before
    her some hideous wound, if he happened to be suffering from one. The police
    officer&rsquo;s insolence and the doctor&rsquo;s easy contempt had sounded
    a note of warning of what was imminent, but beyond that he had no fear. Why
    should he have? And having none, why worry Lou with plaints that might agitate
    her?</p>
  <p>Remember that he individually was quite convinced that Philip&rsquo;s murderer
    would soon be discovered. He too had read his morning paper, and knew as
    well as anybody that for the moment suspicion rested upon him. &ldquo;Seek
    whom the crime will benefit!&rdquo; was a phrase freely used in the press
    this morning. But it was only a question of time; an unpleasant phase to
    be traversed, some mud that presently would have to be brushed off. No use
    to worry Louisa with it. Fortunately she took it lightly, too. She was far
    too sensible to attach importance to such nonsense.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless mud thrown in such boundless profusion was apt to hurt very
    considerably. Luke had to set his teeth this morning when he perused the <i>Times</i> and
    even now there was in him a sensation of having been bruised all over, after
    his second interview with Travers, and his talk with Doctor Newington in
    the library. Louisa did him good. She was calm and sensible and a woman of
    the world. She never puzzled Luke, nor had she that vague longing to be misunderstood,
    the peculiar attribute of the woman of to-day. In face of her serenity he
    almost despised himself for the intensity of his own passion. She was so
    pure, so womanly in her tenderness, a girl still, she was hardly conscious
    of passion. But she knew that he was in pain&mdash;morally and mentally in
    pain&mdash;and that worse was yet to come; and she, the commonplace, sensible
    girl, brought forth her full array of calm and of triviality, checking by
    a placid smile the faintest onrush of passion in him, for passion could but
    torture him now, when his very soul was troubled and every nerve on the jar.</p>
  <p>And thus Colonel Harris found them.</p>
  <p>When he entered, Louisa was recounting to Luke the menu of last night&rsquo;s
    dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;Homard &agrave; la Danoise&rsquo; was a perfect dream,&rdquo; she
    was saying. &ldquo;I suppose it would not be etiquette to ask Her Excellency
    for the recipe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke rose as the colonel entered and passed his hand across the back of
    his smooth head, a gesture peculiarly English and peculiarly his own. The
    older man was undoubtedly the most troubled of the three.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damnable business this,&rdquo; he said as soon as he
    had shaken Luke by the hand and thrown off hat and coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does Sir Thomas Ryder,&rdquo; asked Luke lightly, &ldquo;also think
    that I have murdered Philip?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He knew where Colonel Harris had been. Louisa had not thought of keeping
    this from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s a fool!&rdquo; retorted the colonel involuntarily.</p>
  <p>It was tantamount to an avowal. Luke never flinched; he even contrived to
    smile. Louisa sat up very straight, and with an instinctive movement gave
    the sofa cushions a nervy shake up. But her eyes were fastened on Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, sir,&rdquo; said Luke very quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    get out of it all in good time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you will! Damn it all!&rdquo; ejaculated the other fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The inquest you know is to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Luke who spoke and Colonel Harris looked up quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;surely some light will be thrown on
    this mysterious business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Luke dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has Uncle Ryder told you anything fresh, father? Anything that we
    don&rsquo;t yet know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris did not reply, and Louisa knew that there was something that
    Uncle Ryder had said, something awful, which had caused her father to wear
    the troubled look which had terrified her the moment he came in.</p>
  <p>Something awful!&mdash;which would affect Luke!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell us, father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what Uncle
    Ryder told you? Luke ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; rejoined Luke, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no hurry I&rsquo;m
    sure. Colonel Harris will tell me presently. Lou, you were coming to the
    park this morning. I suppose we can&rsquo;t go to the Temple Garden Show
    very well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not very well, I think,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
    come for a walk after lunch with pleasure. Father must tell us now what Uncle
    Ryder said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Colonel Harris still seemed to hesitate, she became more insistent,
    and her voice more firm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must know as well as Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man took a turn up and down the room, with hands behind his back.
    He would not look either at Louisa or at Luke, for it would be easier to
    tell them everything without meeting their eyes. And he had to tell them
    everything. To her as well as to him. It was no longer any use trying to
    avoid the subject, pretending that it was trivial, unworthy of discussion.</p>
  <p>Facts had to be faced at last, like the dervishes at Omdurman, and a plan
    of campaign decided on in the event of momentary defeat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ryder,&rdquo; he began quite abruptly at last, &ldquo;had the hall
    porter of that confounded club up to his room while I was there, and questioned
    him before me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He could,&rdquo; suggested Luke, &ldquo;only repeat the story which
    we all know already. I never denied seeing Philip at the club or quarrelling
    with him for a matter of that. Hang it all! I have often quarrelled with
    him before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rejoined the colonel, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve ferreted out
    the old servants of your uncle&rsquo;s household, and heard innumerable stories
    of quarrels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exaggerated, I expect. But what of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that hall porter didn&rsquo;t mince matters either. Damn him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; remarked Luke dryly, &ldquo;shouted pretty loudly.
    I did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The porter said that when you left the club you had &lsquo;murder
    in your eye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had overheard Philip&rsquo;s last remark to the porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;something about pestering beggars. I was ready to make
    him swallow his words, but I loathe a scene, before people like those who
    frequent the Veterans&rsquo;  Club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you had gone for him then and there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This accursed business would not have occurred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it would&mdash;sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip must have had an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who murdered him last night, you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An enemy,&rdquo; assented Luke, &ldquo;who evidently laid in wait
    for him, and murdered him last night. It is bound to come out at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About this enemy?&rdquo; queried Colonel Harris vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; rejoined Luke a little impatiently, &ldquo;surely
    the police have made other investigations. They are not just fastening on
    me and on no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Could you,&rdquo; asked Louisa, &ldquo;help the police in that, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I know absolutely nothing about Philip
    or about his past life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Lord Radclyffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has been questioned, has he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is too ill to see any one. Doctor Newington declares that he must
    not attempt to see any one. His condition is critical. Moreover, he is only
    partly conscious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Philip&rsquo;s lawyer, Davies,&rdquo; said Luke; &ldquo;the
    police ought to be in communication with him. It is positively ridiculous
    the way they seem to do nothing in the way of proper investigation, but only
    make up their minds that I have killed my cousin. Why! they don&rsquo;t even
    seem to trouble about the weapon with which the murder was committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The weapon&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ejaculation, spoken hardly above a whisper, had come from Colonel Harris.
    Once more the old man felt&mdash;as he had done in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
    office&mdash;that every drop of blood in him had receded back to his heart,
    and that he would choke if he attempted to utter another word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; continued Luke quietly, &ldquo;that Philip was killed
    by the thrust of a sharp dagger or stiletto, right through the neck. Well,
    where is that dagger? Have they found it? Or traced it to its owner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Colonel Harris was still silent he reiterated once more:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Sir Thomas tell you if they had found the weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Colonel Harris nodded and murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Actually found the weapon?&rdquo; insisted Luke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Behind the railings&mdash;in Green Park&mdash;close to Hyde Park
    corner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it a stiletto? Or a dagger? Or what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a stick with a dagger fitting into it. A snake-wood stick.
    It was covered with mud and&mdash;other stains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the room now for the space of a few brief seconds.
    A silence solemn and full of meaning. All through this rapid succession of
    questions and answers between Colonel Harris and Luke, Louisa had kept her
    eyes fixed upon the younger man&rsquo;s face, had seen light indifference
    at possible danger alternating with impatience at the singular obstinacy
    of his accusers. Throughout this time the face she knew so well, mirrored
    that perfect calm which she understood and admired, since it was the reflex
    of a calm, untroubled soul.</p>
  <p>But now there came a change in the face: or rather not in the face but in
    the soul behind it. The change came at Colonel Harris&rsquo;s last words;
    a change so subtle, so undetermined, that she was quite sure her father had
    not perceived it. But movement there was none; one mere, almost imperceptible,
    quiver of the eyelids&mdash;nothing more. The mouth beneath the slight fair
    moustache had not trembled, the brow remained smooth, the breath came and
    went as evenly as before.</p>
  <p>But the change was there, nevertheless! The gray tint just round the eyes,
    the stony look in the pupils themselves a tiny speck of moisture round the
    wing of each nostril. Colonel Harris had not looked at Luke whilst he spoke
    of the stick. He was staring straight in front of him, hardly conscious of
    the silence which had cast a strange and mystic spell on these three people
    standing here in the banal atmosphere of a London hotel.</p>
  <p>It was Luke who broke the silence. He said quite quietly asking the question
    as if it related to a most trivial, most indifferent matter:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Sir Thomas show you the stick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The colonel nodded in acquiescence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was my stick, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The query was so sudden, so unexpected that Colonel Harris instinctively
    uttered an exclamation of amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke! By God, man! Are you mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa said nothing. She was trying to understand the un-understandable.
    Luke almost smiled at the other man&rsquo;s bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not mad I think. I only want to know
    how I stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How you stand, man?&rdquo; ejaculated Colonel Harris with uncontrolled
    vehemence.  &ldquo;Great Heavens, don&rsquo;t you realize that here is some
    damned conspiracy as mysterious as it is damnable, and that you will have
    to look this seriously in the face, if you don&rsquo;t wish to find yourself
    in the dock before the next four and twenty hours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Luke simply, &ldquo;looking the matter squarely
    in the face, sir, but I don&rsquo;t quite see how I can avoid standing in
    the dock as you say, before the next four and twenty hours. You see I had
    quarrelled with Philip, and my stick&mdash;which contained a dagger&mdash;was
    found in the park, covered with mud, as you say, and other stains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, hang it all, man! you did not murder your cousin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was not a query but an assertion. Colonel Harris&rsquo;s loyalty had
    not wavered, but he could not contrive to keep the note of anxiety out of
    his voice: nor did he reiterate the assertion when Luke made no answer to
    it.</p>
  <p>Once more the latter passed his hand over the back of his head. You know
    that gesture. It is so English! and always denotes a certain measure of perturbation.
    Then he said with seeming irrelevance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I had better go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His eyes sought Louisa&rsquo;s, trying to read what she thought and felt.
    Imagine the awful moment! For he loved her, as you know, with that intensity
    of passion of which a nature like his&mdash;almost cramped by perpetual self-containment&mdash;is
    alone capable. Then to have to stand before her wondering what the next second
    would reveal, hardly daring to exchange fear for certitude, because of what
    that certitude might be.</p>
  <p>He sought her eyes and had no difficulty in finding them. They had never
    wandered away from his face. To him&mdash;the ardent worshipper&mdash;those
    eyes of hers had never seemed so exquisitely luminous. He read her soul then
    and there as he would a book. A soul full of trust and brimming over with
    compassion and with love. Colonel Harris was loyal to the core; he clung
    to his loyalty, to his belief in Luke as he would to a rock, fearful lest
    he should flounder in a maze of wonderment, of surmises, of suspicions. God
    help him! But in Louisa even loyalty was submerged in a sea of love. She
    cared nothing about suspicions, about facts, about surmises. She had no room
    in her heart for staunchness: it was all submerged in love.</p>
  <p>There was no question, no wonderment, no puzzle in the eyes which met those
    of Luke. You see she was just a very ordinary kind of woman.</p>
  <p>All she knew was that she loved Luke: and all that she conveyed to him by
    that look, was just love.</p>
  <p>Only love.</p>
  <p>And love&mdash;omnipotent, strange, and capricious love&mdash;wrought a
    curious miracle then! For Colonel Harris was present in the room, mind you,
    a third&mdash;if not an altogether indifferent&mdash;party, there where at
    this moment these two should have been alone.</p>
  <p>It was Colonel Harris&rsquo;s presence in the room that transformed the
    next instant into a wonderful miracle: for Luke was down on his knees before
    his simple-souled Lou. She had yielded her hand to him and he had pressed
    an aching forehead against the delicately perfumed palm.</p>
  <p>In face of that love which she had given him, he could only worship: and
    would have been equally ready to worship before the whole world. And therein
    lay the miracle. Do you not agree, you who know Englishmen of that class
    and stamp? Can you conceive one of them falling on his knees save at the
    bidding of omnipotent Love, and by the miracle which makes a man forget the
    whole world, defy the whole world, give up the whole world, driven to defiance,
    to forgetfulness, to self-sacrifice, for the sake of the torturing, exquisite
    moments of transcendental happiness?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    Why All This Mystery?</b></h2>
  <p>I have often smiled myself at the recollection of Luke de Mountford walking
    that selfsame afternoon with Louisa Harris up and down the long avenue of
    the Ladies&rsquo; Mile: the selfsame Luke de Mountford who had knelt at his
    Lou&rsquo;s feet in humble gratitude for the love she gave him: the selfsame
    Luke de Mountford who stood under suspicion of having committed a dastardly
    and premeditated murder.</p>
  <p>The puppets were once more dangling on the string of Convention. They had
    readjusted their masks and sunk individuality as well as sentiment in the
    whirlpool of their world&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
  <p>Louisa had desired that Luke should come with her to the park, since convention
    forbade their looking at chrysanthemums in the Temple Gardens, on the day
    that Philip de Mountford lay dead in the mortuary chamber of a London police
    court: but everybody belonging to their own world would be in the park on
    this fine afternoon. And yet, the open air, the fragrance of spring flowers
    in the formal beds, would give freedom to the breath: there would not reign
    the oppressive atmosphere of tea-table gossip; the early tulips bowing their
    stately heads would suggest aloofness and peace.</p>
  <p>And so they went together for a walk in the park, for she had wished it,
    and he would have followed her anywhere where she had bidden him to go.</p>
  <p>He walked beside her absolutely unconscious of whisperings and gossip which
    accompanied them at every step.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I call it bad form,&rdquo; was a very usual phrase enunciated by
    many a rouged lip curled up in disdain.</p>
  <p>This was hurled at Louisa Harris. The woman, in such cases, always contrives
    to get the lion&rsquo;s share of contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Showing herself about with that man now! I call it vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say he&rsquo;ll be arrested directly after the inquest to-morrow.
    I have it on unimpeachable authority.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I understand that he has been arrested already,&rdquo; asserted
    a lady whose information was always a delightful mixture of irresponsible
    vagueness and firm conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see he is only out on&mdash;what do they call it?&mdash;I
    mean he has had to give his word that he won&rsquo;t run away&mdash;or something.
    I heard Herbert say something about that at lunch&mdash;oh! what lovely tulips!
    I dote on that rich coppery red, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then does he go about in Black Maria escorted by a policeman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This somewhat more vaguely, for the surmise was doubtful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand Louisa Harris, can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she thinks it&rsquo;s unconventional to go about with a murderer.
    She only does it for notoriety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Countess of Flintshire, who wrote novels and plays under the elegant <i>nom
      de plume</i> of Maria Annunziata, was deeply interested in Luke and Louisa,
      and stopped to talk to them for quite a considerable time. She said she
      wanted &ldquo;to draw Luke de Mountford out.&rdquo; So interesting to get
      the impressions of an actual murderer, you know.</p>
  <p>The men felt uncomfortable. Englishmen always do when the unconventional
    hovers about in their neatly ordered atmosphere. Common-sense&mdash;in their
    case&mdash;whispered loudly, inking that this man in the Sackville Street
    clothes, member of their own clubs, by Jove! could not just be a murderer!
    Hang it all! Harris would not allow his daughter to go about with a murderer!</p>
  <p>So they raised their hats as they passed by Louisa Harris and said,  &ldquo;Hello!
    How de do?&rdquo; to Luke quite with a genial smile.</p>
  <p>But Luke and Louisa allowed all this world to wag on its own irresponsible
    way. They were not fools, they knew their <i>milieu</i>. They guessed all
    that was being said around them and all that remained unspoken. They had
    come here purposely in order to see and to be seen, to be gossiped about,
    to play their r&ocirc;le of puppet before their world as long as life lasted,
    and whilst Chance and Circumstance still chose to hold up the edifice of
    their own position of their consideration, mayhap of their honour.</p>
  <p>The question of the crime had not been mooted between them again: after
    the understanding, the look from her to him, and his humble gratitude on
    his knees, they had left the mystery severely alone. He had nothing to say,
    and she would never question, content that she would know in good time; that
    one day she would understand what was so un-understandable just now.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris alone was prostrated with trouble. Not that he doubted Luke,
    but like all sober-sensed Englishmen he loathed a moral puzzle. Whilst he
    liked and trusted Luke, he hated the mystery which now met him at every turn,
    just as much as he hated the so-called problem plays which alien critics
    try to foist on an unwilling Anglo-Saxon public.</p>
  <p>He would have loved to hear Luke&rsquo;s voice saying quite frankly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I did not kill my cousin. I give you my word, colonel,
    that I am incapable of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the only grievance which the older man of the world had against
    the younger one. The want of frankness worried him. Luke was innocent of
    course; but, d&mdash;n it, why didn&rsquo;t he say so?</p>
  <p>And how came that accursed stick behind the railings of the park?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    A Herd Of Cackling Geese</b></h2>
  <p>When at ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning Louisa Harris entered the Victoria
    coroner&rsquo;s court accompanied by her father, the coroner and jury were
    just returning from the mortuary at the back of the building whither they
    had gone, in order to look upon the dead.</p>
  <p>Already the small room was crowded to its utmost holding capacity. Louisa
    and Colonel Harris had some difficulty in making their way through the groups
    of idlers who filled every corner of the gangway.</p>
  <p>The air was hot and heavy with the smell of the dust of ages which had gathered
    in the nooks and crannies of this dull and drabby room. It mingled with irritating
    unpleasantness with the scent of opoponax or heliotrope that emanated from
    lace handkerchiefs, and with the pungent odours of smelling salts ostentatiously
    held to delicate noses.</p>
  <p>Louisa, matter-of-fact, commonplace Louisa looked round at these unaccustomed
    surroundings with the same air of semi-indifferent interest with which she
    would have viewed a second-rate local music hall, had she unaccountably drifted
    into one through curiosity or desire.</p>
  <p>She saw a dull, drabby paper on the wall, and dull, drabby hangings to the
    single window, which was set very high, close to the ceiling; the latter
    once whitewashed was now covered with uneven coatings of grime.</p>
  <p>In the centre of the room, a long table littered at one end with papers
    tied up in bundles of varying bulk, with pieces of pink tape, also a blotting
    pad, pen, ink, and paper&mdash;more paper&mdash;the one white note in the
    uniform harmony of drabby brown: and in among this litter that encumbered
    the table a long piece of green baize covering a narrow formless something,
    which Louisa supposed would be revealed in due course.</p>
  <p>On each side of the table were half a dozen chairs of early Victorian design
    upholstered in leather that had once been green. To these chairs a dozen
    men were even now making their way, each taking his seat in solemn silence:
    men in overcoats and with velvet collars somewhat worn at the back of the
    neck&mdash;it seemed to Louisa as if they were dressed in some kind of uniform
    so alike did their clothes appear. She looked at their faces as they filed
    in&mdash;haggard faces, rubicund, jolly faces, faces which mirrored suspicion,
    faces which revealed obstinacy, the whole of middle class England personified
    in these typical twelve men all wearing overcoats with shabby velvet collars,
    who were to decide to-day how and when Philip de Mountford, heir presumptive
    to the Earl of Radclyffe, had been done to death.</p>
  <p>Louisa and her father were able at last to reach the fore-front of the crowd,
    where chairs had been reserved for them immediately facing the table, at
    the farther end of which the coroner already sat. Louisa recognized Mr. Humphreys,
    one of Mr. Dobson&rsquo;s clerks, who did his best to make her and Colonel
    Harris comfortable. Farther on sat Mr. Davies, who had been Philip de Mountford&rsquo;s
    solicitor when he had first desired an interview with Lord Radclyffe. Louisa
    knew him by sight&mdash;Luke had on one occasion pointed him out to her.</p>
  <p>Luke and Mr. Dobson were even now making their way to the same group of
    seats. They had&mdash;like the jury and the coroner&mdash;been in the mortuary
    to have a last look at the murdered man. Louisa thought that Luke looked
    years older than he had done yesterday. She saw him standing for a moment
    right against the dull, drabby background of the court room wall; and it
    seemed as if something of that drabbiness had descended upon his soul. Youth
    seemed to have gone out of him. He appeared to be looking out onto a dreary
    world through windows obscured by grime.</p>
  <p>There was a look not so much of dejection as of absolute hopelessness in
    the face. No fear, or anxiety&mdash;only a renunciation. But this was only
    for one moment; the next he had caught sight of her, and the look of blank
    dejection in his eyes suddenly gave place to one of acute and intolerable
    pain. The face which usually was so calm and placid in its impassive mask
    of high-bred indifference was almost distorted by an expression of agony
    which obviously had been quite beyond control.</p>
  <p>The whole thing was of course a mere flash, less than a quarter of a second
    perhaps in duration, and already Luke was just as he had always been: a correct,
    well-born English gentleman, perfect in manner, perfect in attitude and bearing,
    under whatever circumstances Fate might choose to place him.</p>
  <p>Mr. Dobson spoke to him, and he at once followed his friend and solicitor
    across the body of the court room to the row of reserved chairs in front
    of the crowd.</p>
  <p>A whisper went round the room, and Louisa with cool indifference turned
    to greet those among the crowd whom she had recognized as acquaintances and
    friends. Some were sitting, others standing back against the walls in the
    rear. Lady Ducies was there, excited and over-dressed, with a large hat that
    obstructed the view of a masculine-looking woman who sat immediately behind
    her, and who seemed quite prepared to do battle against the obstruction.</p>
  <p>Farther on sat the Countess of Flintshire, novelist and playwright, eager
    and serious, note-book in hand and a frown between her brows, denoting thought
    and concentration of purpose. She bowed gravely to Louisa, and contrived
    to attract Luke&rsquo;s attention, so that he turned toward her, and she
    was able to note carefully in indelible pencil in a tiny note-book that a
    murderer about to meet his just fate may bestow an infinity of care on the
    niceties of his own toilet.</p>
  <p class="note">(N. B. The next play written by the Countess of Flintshire, better known
    to the playgoing public as Maria Annunziata, had an assassin for its principal
    hero. But the play found no favour with actor-managers, and though it subsequently
    enjoyed some popularity in the provinces, it was never performed on the London
    stage.)</p>
  <p>Louisa looked on all these people with eyes that dwelt with strange persistency
    on trivial details: the Countess of Flintshire&rsquo;s note-book, Lady Ducies&rsquo;  hat,
    the masculine attire of the militant suffragette in the rear&mdash;all these
    minor details impressed themselves upon her memory. In after years she could
    always recall the vision of the court room, with its drabby background to
    a sea of ridiculous faces.</p>
  <p>For they all seemed ridiculous to her&mdash;all these people&mdash;in their
    obvious eager agitation: they had pushed one another and jostled and fought
    their way into this small, stuffy room, the elegant ladies with their scent
    bottles, the men about town with their silk hats and silver-topped canes:
    they were all ready to endure acute physical discomfort for the sake of witnessing
    the harrowing sight of one of their own kind being pilloried before the mob:
    it was just a pinch of spice added to the savourless condiment of every-day
    life. Then there were the others: those who had come just out of idle curiosity
    to hear a few unpleasant details, or to read a few unwholesome pages in the
    book of life of people who lived in a different world to their own.</p>
  <p>Ridiculous they seemed, all of them! Louisa felt a sudden desire to laugh
    aloud, as she realized how very like a theatre the place was, with its boxes,
    its stalls, and its galleries. But in this case those who usually sat in
    stalls or boxes, displaying starched shirt-fronts, bare shoulders, and bad
    manners, they were the actors now made to move or dance or sing, to squirm
    or to suffer for the delectation of pit and gallery.</p>
  <p>On the left a group of young men with keen young faces, all turned toward
    Luke and toward Louisa and her father. Note-books protruded out of great-coat
    pockets, fountain pens and indelible pencils snuggled close to hand. Lucky
    the lightning artist who could sketch for the benefit of his journalistic
    patrons a rough outline of the gentleman with more than one foot in the dock.
    Close by, a couple of boys in blue uniform, with wallet at the side and smart
    pill-box cap on the head, stood ready to take messages, fractions of news,
    hurried reports to less-favoured mortals whose duty or desire kept them away
    from this scene of poignant interest.</p>
  <p>Louisa saw them all, as in a vivid dream. Never afterward could she believe
    that it had all been reality: the coroner, the jury, the group of journalists,
    the idle, whispering, pushing crowd, the loud murmurs which now and again
    reached her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you may take it from me that to-morrow he&rsquo;ll stand in the
    dock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such brazen indifference I&rsquo;ve never seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve actually found the dagger with which he murdered
    the wretched man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brrr! it makes me feel quite creepy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he was at your At Home, dear, wasn&rsquo;t he? a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! one had to ask him for form&rsquo;s sake, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Lord Radclyffe, what a terrible blow for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say he&rsquo;ll never recover his speech or the use of his limbs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cackling herd of geese stopped its whisperings, astonished at being
    thus reproved. Louisa again felt that irrepressible desire to laugh, they
    were so funny, she thought, so irresponsible! these people who had come to
    gape at Luke.</p>
  <p>Now they were silent and orderly at the bidding of authority. An old woman,
    with black bonnet and rusty jacket, was munching sandwiches in a corner seat:
    a young man at the farther end of the room was sharpening a lead-pencil.</p>
  <p>By the door through which a brief while ago coroner and jury, also Luke
    and Mr. Dobson had filed out&mdash;the door which apparently gave in the
    direction of the mortuary&mdash;a small group in shabby clothes had just
    entered the court room, escorted by one of the ushers. The latter made his
    way to the coroner&rsquo;s table and whispered to that gentleman somewhat
    animatedly. Louisa could not catch what he said, but she saw that the coroner
    suddenly lost his morose air of habitual ennui, and appeared keen and greatly
    interested in what he heard.</p>
  <p>He gave certain instructions to the usher, who beckoned to the group in
    the shabby clothes. They advanced with timid, anxious gait, a world of unspoken
    apologies in their eyes as they surveyed the brilliant company through which
    they had to pass. The feathers on Lady Ducies&rsquo; hat attracted the attention
    of one of them&mdash;a young girl with round black eyes and highly decorated
    headgear: she nudged her companion and pointed to the gargantuan hat and
    both the girls giggled almost hysterically.</p>
  <p>The man in front led the way. He was pale and cadaverous looking with scanty
    hair and drooping moustache: in shape he was very like a beetle, with limbs
    markedly bowed and held away from his stooping body. There were five of them
    altogether, three women and two men. Louisa was interested in them, vaguely
    wondering who they were.</p>
  <p>That they were personages of importance in this case was apparent from the
    fact that the usher was bringing some chairs for the women and placing them
    close to those on which sat the solicitors, and Luke and Louisa herself.
    The men were made to stand close by and remained just where they had been
    told to stay, tweed cap in hand, miserably conscious of the many pairs of
    eyes that were fixed upon them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are these people, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Ducies was leaning forward and had contrived to catch Luke&rsquo;s
    ear.</p>
  <p>He turned round very politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. de Mountford,&rdquo; she continued in her shrill
    treble, which she took no trouble to subdue, &ldquo;you hadn&rsquo;t seen
    me, had you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Lady Ducies,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I had not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; she commented placidly, &ldquo;you must
    feel so anxious. Who are these common people over there, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of your late cousin&rsquo;s former associates perhaps?&rdquo; suggested
    Lady Flintshire, &ldquo;Maria Annunziata,&rdquo; who sat close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear, how can you suggest such a thing,&rdquo; retorted the other, &ldquo;they
    are so common.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And once more the cackling geese were still.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    The Fog Was Dense, I Couldn&rsquo;t Rightly See</b></h2>
  <p>The curtain went up on the first act of the play. It was not perhaps so
    interesting from the outset as the audience would have wished, and the fashionable
    portion thereof showed its impatience by sundry coughings and whisperings,
    which had to be peremptorily checked now and again by a loud:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, there!&rdquo; and a threat to clear the court.</p>
  <p>The medical officer was giving his testimony at great length as to the cause
    of death. Technical terms were used in plenty, and puzzled the elegant ladies
    who had come here to be amused. The jury listened attentively, and the coroner&mdash;himself
    a medical man&mdash;asked several very pertinent questions:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The thrust,&rdquo; he asked of Doctor Blair, who was medical officer
    of the district, &ldquo;through the neck was effected by means of a long
    narrow instrument, with two sharp edges, a dagger in fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dagger or a stiletto or a skewer,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;Any
    sharp, two-edged instrument would cause a wound like the one in the neck
    of the deceased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was death instantaneous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Almost so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He explained at some length the intricacies of the human throat at the points
    where the murderer&rsquo;s weapon had entered the neck of his victim. Louisa
    listened attentively. Every moment she expected to see the coroner&rsquo;s
    hand wandering to the piece of green baize in front of him, and then drawing
    it away disclosing a snake-wood stick with silver ferrule stained, and showing
    the rise of the dagger, sheathed within the body of the stick. Every moment
    she expected to hear the query:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this the instrument which dealt the blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this apparently was not to be just yet. The opaque veil of green baize
    was not to be lifted; that certain long Something was not to be revealed,
    the Something that would condemn Luke irrevocably, absolutely, to disgrace
    and to death.</p>
  <p>Only one of the members of the jury&mdash;Louisa understood that he was
    the foreman&mdash;asked a simple question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the witness explain whether in his
    opinion the&mdash;the unknown murderer&mdash;the&mdash;I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He floundered a little in the phrase, having realized that in his official
    capacity he must keep an open mind&mdash;and in that open mind of an English
    juryman there could for the present dwell no certainty that a murderer&mdash;an
    unknown murderer&mdash;did exist.</p>
  <p>They were all here&mdash;he and the others and the coroner&mdash;in order
    to find out if there had been a murder committed or not.</p>
  <p>The coroner, one elbow on the table, one large hand holding firmly the somewhat
    fleshy chin, looked at the juryman somewhat contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean?&rdquo; he queried with an obvious effort at patience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; resumed the man more firmly, &ldquo;in this present
    instance, would a certain medical or anatomical knowledge be necessary in
    order to strike&mdash;er&mdash;or to thrust&mdash;so precisely&mdash;just
    on the right spot to cause immediate death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With amiable condescension the coroner put the query to the witness in more
    concise words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the doctor quickly, now that he had understood
    the question, &ldquo;the thrust argues no special anatomical knowledge. Most
    laymen would know that if you pierce the throat from ear to ear suffocation
    is bound to ensue. It was easily enough done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When the deceased&rsquo;s head was turned away?&rdquo; asked the
    coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;to look out on the fog, perhaps; or at a passer-by.
    It would be fairly easy if the would-be murderer was quick and determined
    and the victim unsuspecting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Doctor Blair, with long tapering fingers, pointed toward his own throat,
    giving illustration of how easily the deed might be done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Given the requisite weapon of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a few more courteous questions of a technical kind, the first witness
    was dismissed&mdash;only momentarily, for he would be required again&mdash;when
    the green baize would be lifted from the hidden Something which lay there
    ready to hand, and the medical man be asked to pronounce finally whether
    indeed the dagger stick was the requisite weapon for the deed which had been
    so easy of accomplishment.</p>
  <p>The chauffeur who had driven the taxicab was the next witness called. A
    thick-set man, in dark blue Melton coat and peaked cap, he came forward with
    that swinging gait which betrayed the ex-coachman.</p>
  <p>He gave his evidence well and to the point. He had been hailed on the night
    in question by two gentlemen in evening dress. It was in Shaftesbury Avenue,
    just opposite the Lyric Theatre, and a little while after he had heard St.
    Martin&rsquo;s Church clock strike nine o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;The fog was
    so dense,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you could not see your hand before your
    eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had just put down at the Apollo and had crossed over to the left, going
    down toward Piccadilly, when the two swells hailed him from the curb. He
    couldn&rsquo;t rightly see them, because of the fog, but he noticed that
    both wore high hats and the collars of their overcoats ware turned up to
    their ears. He hardly saw their faces, but he noticed that one of them carried
    a walking stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or it might &rsquo;ave been a umbrella,&rdquo; he added after a moment&rsquo;s
    hesitation,  &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t rightly say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must have seen the faces of your fares,&rdquo; argued the coroner, &ldquo;if
    you saw that one of them carried a walking stick&mdash;or an umbrella. You
    must have seen something of their faces,&rdquo; he reiterated more emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the man gruffly. &ldquo;Was you out
    in that there fog, sir? If you was, you&rsquo;d know &rsquo;ow you couldn&rsquo;t
    see your &rsquo;and before your eyes. I saw the point of the stick&mdash;or
    the umbrella, I couldn&rsquo;t rightly say which&mdash;only because one of
    them gents waved it at me when &rsquo;e was &rsquo;ailing me&mdash;that&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow
    I seed the point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coroner allowed the question of identification to drop: clearly nothing
    would be got out of the man. The gentlemen, he declared, entered the cab,
    and then one of them gave directions to him, putting his head out of the
    right hand window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t turn to look at &rsquo;im,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;I
    could &rsquo;ear &rsquo;is voice plain enough&mdash;so why should I take
    a look at &rsquo;im? &rsquo;Ow did I know there was a goin&rsquo; to be murder
    done in my cab, and me wanted to say what the murderer looked like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked round the room defiantly, as if expecting applause for this display
    of sound common-sense, opposed to the coroner&rsquo;s tiresome officialism.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what directions,&rdquo; asked the latter, &ldquo;did the gentleman
    give you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To go along Piccadilly,&rdquo; replied the witness, &ldquo;till &rsquo;e
    told me to stop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And when did he tell you to stop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the railings of Green Park, just by &rsquo;Yde Park Corner. One
    of &rsquo;em puts &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead out of the window and calls to me
    to pull up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which you did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which I did, and one of &rsquo;em gets out and standin&rsquo; on
    the curb &rsquo;e leans back to the interior of the cab and says: S&rsquo;long&mdash;see
    you to-morrow,&rsquo; and then &rsquo;e says to me: &lsquo;No. 1 Cromwell
    Road,&rsquo; and disappears in the fog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely you saw him then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. The fog was like pea soup there, though it looked clearer on
    Knightsbridge away. And &rsquo;e got out left side of course. I was up on
    my box right &rsquo;and side&mdash;a long way from &rsquo;im. I could see
    a man standin&rsquo; there, but not &rsquo;is face. &rsquo;Is &rsquo;at was
    pulled down right over &rsquo;is eyes, and &rsquo;is coat collar up to &rsquo;is
    ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had he his stick&mdash;or umbrella&mdash;with him then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. With &rsquo;is &rsquo;ands in &rsquo;is pockets, and the tip
    pointing upward, like a soldier&rsquo;s bayonet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You saw that and not his face?&rdquo; once more insisted the coroner,
    making a final effort to draw some more definite statement out of the man.
    It would help justice so much if only this witness were less obstinate! No
    one would believe that he really saw nothing of the face of the man who had
    twice spoken to him. He may not have seen it clearly, not the upper part
    of the face perhaps, but surely he saw the mouth that had actually framed
    the words!</p>
  <p>But the chauffeur was obstinate. He was not going to swear away the life
    of a man whom he had not rightly seen, only through a fog as thick as pea
    soup: this was the fortress behind which after awhile he entrenched himself.</p>
  <p>In vain did the coroner, pleased at having gained this slight advantage,
    try to draw him further, explaining to him with the quiet patience of a man
    moved by official ambition that, far from jeopardizing the life of any man,
    he might be saving that of an innocent one, falsely accused through circumstantial
    evidence. In vain did he press and argue, the man was obstinate. After a
    very long while only, and when the coroner had almost given up arguing and
    cross-examining, he admitted that he did think that the gentleman who directed
    him to No. 1 Cromwell Road had a moustache.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, mind,&rdquo; he added hurriedly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t swear
    to it, for I didn&rsquo;t rightly see&mdash;the fog was that dense in the
    park. And &rsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t the same as the one  &rsquo;oo told me to
    go along Piccadilly until &rsquo;e stopped me. The dead man done that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know,&rdquo; came as a quick retort from the coroner, &ldquo;since
    you declare you could not see the faces?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first gent &rsquo;oo spoke to me,&rdquo; replied the chauffeur
    somewhat sullenly now, &ldquo;&rsquo;ad no &rsquo;air on &rsquo;is face;
    the second one I think &rsquo;ad&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t rightly say. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    swear to neither. And I won&rsquo;t swear,&rdquo; he reiterated with gruff
    emphasis.</p>
  <p>A sigh went round the room, a tremor of excitement, the palpitation of many
    hearts, and in-drawing of many breaths. No one spoke. No one framed the thought
    that was uppermost in the mind of every one of the interested spectators
    of this strange and un-understandable drama. The dead man who lay in the
    mortuary chamber was clean-shaved, but Luke de Mountford wore a moustache.</p>
  <p>Lady Ducies&rsquo; feathers nodded in the direction of the literary countess
    who went by the name of Maria Annunziata and the latter made hasty notes
    in her diminutive book.</p>
  <p>But Louisa leaned slightly forward so as to catch fuller sight of Luke,
    and she encountered his eyes fixed steadily upon her.</p>
  <p>After that the driver of the cab concluded his evidence more rapidly. There
    was little more there than what every one had already learned from the newspapers.
    The second pulling up in Cromwell Road this time: the silent fare, the descent
    from the box, the discovery of the huddled figure in the far corner of the
    cab, the call for the police.</p>
  <p>People listened with less attention; thoughts were busy with the contemplation
    of a picture: two men, one clean-shaved&mdash;the dead man of course&mdash;and
    the other wearing a moustache. The first link in the chain of evidence against
    the assassin had been forged and was ready to be rivetted to the next.</p>
  <p>The crowd in the body of the court could only obtain a view of the top of
    Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s head. It was smooth and fair, of that English fairness
    of tint which is golden when the light catches it. And the group of elegantly
    dressed women who came here to-day in order to experience an altogether novel
    sensation shuddered with delightful excitement as they thought of Black Maria,
    and handcuffs, and crowds of police officers in blue. A jumble of impressions
    ran riot in frivolous and irresponsible minds, foremost amongst which was
    one that the public was not longer allowed to witness a final scene on the
    gallows.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    The Next Witness Please</b></h2>
  <p>The air grew more and more heavy as the morning dragged on. It was now close
    on twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>Frederick Power, hall porter of the Veterans&rsquo; Club had finished his
    evidence. With the precision of a soldier he had replied curtly and to the
    point to every question put to him, and had retold all that had occurred
    on that foggy night, in the smoking room and the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club
    in Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>
  <p>It was but a repetition of what he had told Sir Thomas Ryder in Colonel
    Harris&rsquo;s presence the day before. Louisa had had it all at full length
    from her father; she had drawn the whole story out of him, point by point,
    just as the man had told it originally. Colonel Harris, reluctant to tell
    her, was gradually driven to concealing nothing from her. Moreover, since
    she had made up her mind to attend the inquest she might as well hear it
    all from him first, the better to be prepared for the public ordeal.</p>
  <p>Though she knew it all, she listened attentively to every word which Frederick
    Power uttered, lest her father had&mdash;in telling her&mdash;omitted some
    important detail. She heard again at full length the account of Luke&rsquo;s
    visit to the Veterans&rsquo;  Club, his desire to see Philip de Mountford,
    the interview in the smoking room behind closed doors, the angry words of
    obvious, violent quarrelling.</p>
  <p>Then Luke&rsquo;s return to the lobby, his departure, the final taunt spoken
    by Philip and the look of murder in his eye, sworn to by the hall porter.
    She listened to it all, and heard without flinching the last question which
    the coroner put to the witness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Mr. de Mountford&rsquo;s visitor carry a stick when he left the
    club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E &rsquo;ad a stick, sir, when &rsquo;e came,&rdquo; was the
    porter&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;and I  &rsquo;anded it to &rsquo;im myself when &rsquo;e
    left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa had been sitting all this while at the extreme end of the row of
    chairs, right up against the wall. She sat with her back to the wall, her
    head leaning against it, her hands hidden within the folds of a monumental
    sable muff lying idly in her lap. She had her father on her right, and beyond
    him Mr. Dobson and his clerk; she saw them all in profile as they looked
    straight before them, at the coroner and at each succeeding witness.</p>
  <p>Luke sat farther on, and, as he was slightly turned toward her, she could
    watch his face all the while that she listened to the hall porter&rsquo;s
    evidence. It was perfectly still, the features as if moulded in wax; the
    eyes which actually were a clear hazel appeared quite dark and almost as
    if they had sunk back within their circling lids. He sat with arms folded,
    and not a muscle in face or body moved. No stone-carved image could have
    been more calm, none could have been so mysterious.</p>
  <p>Louisa tried to understand and could not. She watched him, not caring whether
    the empty-headed fools who sat all round saw her watching him or not.</p>
  <p>When the coroner asked the hall porter about the stick and the man gave
    his reply, Luke turned and met Louisa&rsquo;s fixed gaze. The marble-like
    stillness of his face remained unchanged, only the eyes seemed as if they
    darkened visibly. At least to her it seemed as if a velvety shadow crept
    over them, an inscrutable, an un-understandable shadow, and the rims assumed
    a purple hue.</p>
  <p>It was her fancy of course. But Luke&rsquo;s eyes were naturally bright,
    of varying tones of gray, blue, or green, with never a shadow beneath them.
    Now they appeared cavernous and dark, and again as he met her gaze, that
    swift flash of intense misery.</p>
  <p>No longer had she the feeling that she was living in a dream, no longer
    that this was a theatre wherein she and Luke and the dead man were puppets
    dancing and squirming for the benefit of shallow-hearted dolts. That sense
    of unreality left her together with the hysterical desire to laugh which
    had plagued her so in the earlier part of the proceedings. On the contrary,
    now an overwhelming feeling of intense reality oppressed her, so that she
    could have screamed with the awful soul agony which the sight of Luke&rsquo;s
    misery had caused her.</p>
  <p>All her nerves were on the rack, her every faculty concentrated on the one
    supreme desire to understand and to know.</p>
  <p>Love, the omnipotent, had encountered an enemy&mdash;grim, unexplained Mystery&mdash;and
    he sat pondering, almost cowed by this first check to his supreme might.
    Louisa had sought and compelled Luke&rsquo;s gaze, and Love had gleamed in
    one great flash out of her eyes. Yesterday, at her glance, he had knelt at
    her feet and buried his sorrow with his aching head in the scented palm of
    the dearly loved hand.</p>
  <p>To-day the look of Love brought but a surfeit of misery, an additional load
    of sorrow. The eyes in response remained tearless and hard and circled with
    the dark rings of utter hopelessness.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll grant you that if Louisa Harris had been an extraordinary woman,
    a woman endowed with a wonderfully complex, wonderfully passionate, or wonderfully
    emotional nature&mdash;if, in fact, she had been the true product of this
    century&rsquo;s morbid modernity&mdash;she would, whilst admitting Luke&rsquo;s
    guilt, have burned with a passion of self-sacrifice, pining to stand beside
    him pilloried in the dock, and looking forward to a veritable world of idealistic
    realism in the form of a picturesque suicide, after seeing the black flag
    hoisted over Newgate prison.</p>
  <p>But Louisa, though a modern product of an ultra-modern world, was an absolutely
    ordinary woman&mdash;just a commonplace, sensible creature who thought and
    felt in a straight and essentially wholesome manner. Though she had read
    Tolstoi and Dostoyefsky and every Scandinavian and Russian crack-brain who
    has ever tried to make wrong seem right, black appear white, and animalism
    masquerade as love, yet she had never been led away from her own clean outlook
    on life.</p>
  <p>She loved Luke and would have given&mdash;did in fact give&mdash;her whole
    life to him: but she loved him without analysis or thought of self. It never
    entered her mind at this moment to wonder if he were guilty or not guilty,
    if he was capable or not of committing a crime to gain his own ends. All
    that troubled her was his misery, which she would have given her very soul
    to alleviate, and the hopelessness in him which she had given the world to
    console.</p>
  <p>The mystery troubled her, not the sin: the marble-like rigidity of his face,
    not the possibility of the crime.</p>
  <p>For the moment, however, she was brought back quickly enough to present
    realities. The coroner&mdash;satisfied with Frederick Power&rsquo;s answers&mdash;was
    giving him a moment&rsquo;s breathing space. The grating of fountain pens
    against paper was heard from that corner of the room where sat the journalists:
    the crowd waited silent and expectant, for&mdash;unversed though most people
    there present were in proceedings of this kind&mdash;yet instinctively every
    one felt that one great crucial moment was just about to come; one great,
    leading question was just about to be put.</p>
  <p>The coroner had fingered the papers before him for the space of a few seconds,
    then he looked up once more at the witness, his elbow resting on the table,
    his fleshy chin buried in his hand, in an attitude which obviously was habitual
    to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This visitor,&rdquo; he said speaking loudly and clearly, &ldquo;who
    called the night before last at the Veterans&rsquo; Club and had an interview
    with the deceased, you saw him well, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would know him again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looking round this room now, should you say that he was present?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man looked across the room straight at Luke and said pointing to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; the gentleman sitting there, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As every one had expected the reply, no one seemed astonished. The many
    pairs of eyes that turned on Luke now expressed a certain measure of horrified
    compassion, such as might be bestowed on some dangerous animal brought to
    earth by a well-aimed gun shot.</p>
  <p>The coroner made no comment. He turned to the jury, glancing along either
    row of solemn faces, on both sides of the long table. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would any of you gentlemen like to ask this witness a question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Receiving no reply, he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next witness, please!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    And People Went Out To Luncheon</b></h2>
  <p>And now it was Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s turn at last. A wave of excitement
    swept over the crowd, every neck was craned forward, every eye fixed on this
    next witness, as he rose from his seat and with courteous words of apology
    to those whom he disturbed in passing made his way to the centre table.</p>
  <p>An absolute embodiment of modern London society, Luke stood there, facing
    the crowd, the coroner and jury, as he would have faced friends and acquaintances
    in the grand stand at Ascot or in the stalls of a West End theatre. There
    are hundreds and thousands of young Englishmen who look exactly as Luke de
    Mountford looked that morning: dress is almost a uniform, in cut, style,
    and degree of tone; hair and even features are essentially typical. Luke
    de Mountford, well-born, well-bred, behaved just as Eton and Oxford had taught
    him to behave, concealing every emotion, raising neither voice nor gesture.
    An Englishman of that type has alternately been dubbed hypocritical, and
    unemotional. He is neither; he is only conventional. Luke himself, facing
    the most abnormal condition of life that could assail any man of his class,
    was so absolutely drilled into this semblance of placidity that it cost him
    no effort to restrain himself, and none to face the forest of inquisitive
    eyes levelled at him from every side. And since there was no effort, the
    outward calm appeared perfectly natural: an actor who has played one part
    two hundred times and more does so night after night until the role itself
    becomes reality, and he in ordinary every-day life seems even to himself
    strange and unnatural.</p>
  <p>Now Luke was given the Bible to kiss and told to take the oath. From where
    he stood he could see Louisa and a number of faces turned toward him in undisguised
    curiosity. Mocking eyes and contemptuous eyes, eyes of indifference and of
    horror, met his own as with quick glance they swept right over the crowd.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think that he really saw any one except Louisa; no living
    person existed for him at this moment except Louisa. Hypocritical or unemotional
    nature&mdash;which? None could say, none would take the trouble to probe.
    All that the crowd saw was a man to all intents and purposes accused of a
    horrible murder, confronted at every turn with undeniable proofs of his guilt,
    and yet standing there just as if he were witnessing the first act of some
    rather dull play.</p>
  <p>Hypocrisy or effrontery were the two alternatives which the idle and the
    curious weighed, whilst anticipating the joy of seeing the mask torn from
    this wooden image before them.</p>
  <p>The coroner was asking the witness his name, and Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s
    voice was quite steady as he gave reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; continued the coroner, &ldquo;until quite recently
    and are again now heir-presumptive to the Earl of Radclyffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was supposed at one time,&rdquo; replied Luke, &ldquo;that besides
    myself there was no other heir to my uncle&rsquo;s title.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deceased, I understand, arrived in England about six months ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made claim to be the only son of Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to all appearances was able to substantiate this claim in the
    eyes of Lord Radclyffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Apparently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much so that Lord Radclyffe immediately accorded him that position
    in his household which you had previously occupied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe accorded to the deceased the position which he thought
    fitting that he should occupy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know that the servants in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s household have
    informed the police that in consequence of Mr. Philip de Mountford&rsquo;s
    advent in the house, you and your brother and sister had to leave it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My brother, sister, and I now live at Fairfax Mansions, Exhibition
    Road,&rdquo; said Luke evasively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the relations between yourself and the deceased have remained
    of a very strained nature, I understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of an indifferent nature,&rdquo; corrected Luke.</p>
  <p>There was a pause. So far these two&mdash;the coroner and the witness&mdash;had
    seemed almost like two antagonists going through the first passes of a duel
    with foils. Steel had struck against steel, curt answers had followed brief
    questions. Now the combatants paused to draw breath. One of them was fighting
    the preliminary skirmish for his life against odds that were bound to overwhelm
    him in the end: the other was just a paid official, indifferent to the victim,
    interested only in the issue. The man standing at the foot of the table was
    certainly interesting: the coroner had made up his mind that he was the guilty
    party&mdash;a gentleman and yet a cowardly assassin; he amused himself during
    this brief pause with a quick analysis of the high-bred, impassive face&mdash;quite
    Saxon in character, fair and somewhat heavy of lid&mdash;in no way remarkable
    save for the present total lack of expression. There was neither indifference
    nor bravado, neither fear, remorse, nor defiance&mdash;only a mask made of
    wood, hiding every line of the mouth, and not allowing even the eyes to show
    any signs of vitality.</p>
  <p>Beyond that the whole appearance was essentially English: the fair hair
    neatly groomed, with just a suspicion of curl here and there, and a glint
    of gold in the high lights, the stiff neck encased in its immaculate collar,
    the perfectly tailored clothes, the hands, large but well-formed and carefully
    tended, which lightly interlaced, hung in marble-like stillness before him.</p>
  <p>When a man happens to be out in mid-winter with a stout stick in his hand,
    and he comes across a layer of ice on the top of a pool or a trough of water,
    he always&mdash;or nearly always&mdash;is at once a prey to the silly desire
    to break that layer of ice. The desire is irresistible, and the point of
    the stick at once goes to work on the smooth surface, chipping it if not
    actually succeeding in breaking it.</p>
  <p>The same desire exists in a far stronger degree when the ice is a moral
    one&mdash;one that covers the real nature of another man: the cold impassiveness
    that hides the secret orchard to which no one but the owner has access. Then
    there is an irresistible longing to break that cold barrier, to look within,
    and to probe that hidden soul, if not within its innermost depths, at any
    rate below the ice-bound surface; to chip it, to mark it and break its invincible
    crust.</p>
  <p>Some such feeling undoubtedly stirred at the back of the coroner&rsquo;s
    mind. The hide-bound, red-tape-ridden official was more moved than he would
    have cared to admit, by a sense of irritation at the placidity of this witness,
    who was even now almost on his trial. Therefore he had paused in his questionings,
    afraid lest that sense of irritation should carry him beyond the proper limits
    of his own powers.</p>
  <p>And now he resumed more quietly, with his voice less trenchant and his own
    manner outwardly more indifferent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;did you last see the deceased?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club,&rdquo; replied Luke, &ldquo;the
    night before last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had called there to see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To discuss certain family matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You preferred to discuss these family matters at a club rather than
    in your cousin&rsquo;s own home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For private reasons of my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would help this inquiry if you would state these private reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have no bearing upon the present issue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You refuse to state them?&rdquo; insisted the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coroner was silent for a moment: it almost seemed as if he meant to
    press the point at first, then thought differently, for after that brief
    while, he merely said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he resumed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. de Mountford, on the night in question, you say you went
    to see the deceased at the Veterans&rsquo; Club. You were, I understand,
    shown into the smoking room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the simple answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your cousin was in the room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how long did your interview with him last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About an hour or less, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it of an amicable character?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This question was identical to the one already put to Luke on the actual
    night of the crime, by the detective charged to elucidate its mysteries.
    And Luke&rsquo;s reply was identical to his former one:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of an indifferent character,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no quarrel between you and the deceased gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our interview was of a private nature,&rdquo; rejoined Luke with
    unalterable calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But other witnesses,&rdquo; retorted the coroner sharply, &ldquo;heard
    angry voices issuing from the smoking room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That no doubt is for those other witnesses to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You deny then that you quarrelled with the deceased on the night
    when he was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I deny nothing. I am not on my trial, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again a pause. The coroner closed his eyes and stroked his heavy chin. He
    had not yet succeeded in chipping the smooth surface of the ice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At what precise hour then did you last see the deceased alive?&rdquo; he
    asked, allowing his voice once more to appear harsh and his manner more peremptory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock or thereabouts, the night before last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was in the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo; Club and I just outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made certain remarks to the hall porter at that moment, which
    offended you very deeply, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Philip de Mountford was not always guarded in his speech when
    he spoke to servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his remarks offended you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My opinion on this point is of no consequence, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You then left the door step of the Veterans&rsquo; Club, and a moment
    later the deceased joined you in the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I finally left the club soon after nine, but I did not again see
    Mr. Philip de Mountford alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The deceased suggested that you should come with him then and there
    to see Lord Radclyffe at Grosvenor Square; he hailed a taxicab and you entered
    it with him,&rdquo; insisted the coroner with sudden, slow emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I last saw Mr. Philip de Mountford alive in the lobby of the Veterans&rsquo;  Club,&rdquo; reiterated
    Luke calmly, &ldquo;soon after nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He overtook you in the street outside the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And hailed a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may have done so, but not in my company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You entered the cab with him, and he told the driver to follow along
    Piccadilly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may have done so,&rdquo; once more reiterated Luke in the same
    calm and even voice, &ldquo;but not in my company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You parted from him in the lobby of the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told you so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never saw him again after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were not with him when he came out of the club?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he hailed a taxicab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were not with him when he entered the cab and put his head out
    of the window, telling the driver to go along Piccadilly until he was stopped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The answers had come clear, sharp, and distinct, quick ripostes of the foils
    against the violent attack. Now the adversary drew breath. The pause was
    dramatic in its effect, far-reaching in its significance. The coroner with
    eyes steadily fixed on the witness made a quick movement with his hand. He
    drew away the long narrow strip of green baize in front of him, revealing
    a snake-wood stick, with ferrule stained and tarnished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this your stick?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my stick,&rdquo; replied Luke.</p>
  <p>He had not flinched, yet there were many scores of pairs of eyes fixed upon
    him, when that green baize covering was removed. But not one of those who
    gazed so steadily upon him could boast that he or she had seen the slightest
    tremor of the lids or the merest quiver of the mouth. The voice sounded perfectly
    clear, the cheeks, though pale, had assumed no grayish hue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well. That will do,&rdquo; said the coroner quietly.</p>
  <p>What more was there to say? The dagger-stick, stained and rusty, told the
    most graphic tale there was to tell. Yet Luke de Mountford stepped quietly
    away from the table looking neither self-conscious nor dazed. He went back
    to his seat, beside Mr. Dobson, and leaning toward him answered some whispered
    questions which the solicitor was putting to him. He folded his arms before
    him and after awhile allowed his head to fall forward a little, closing his
    eyes as he did so. He seemed a little tired, but otherwise unperturbed, even
    though the hall porter now was recalled and was busy identifying the stick
    which lay across the coroner&rsquo;s table with the one which he himself
    had handed to Mr. de Mountford&rsquo;s visitor at nine o&rsquo;clock the
    night before last.</p>
  <p>And the police too added its share to this work that was going on of enmeshing
    a criminal. There was the constable who had found the stick inside the railings
    of Green Park and had taken it straight away to his chiefs at Scotland Yard
    before the stains on it had been further disturbed; and there was finally
    Doctor Blair, the district medical officer, also recalled, who examined the
    dagger which fitted into that snake-wood stick.</p>
  <p>He had been shown it yesterday it seems and found how accurately it fitted
    the wound in the murdered man&rsquo;s throat. To this he swore now in open
    court, for the <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, the production of the
    dagger-stick, had been kept back until now, in order that it should work
    its fullest and most dramatic effect.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris, sitting near his daughter, would have given worlds to know
    what she thought. He himself did not know what to think. His simple, unsophisticated
    mind was in a maze. The question of Luke&rsquo;s possible guilt had suddenly
    loomed up before him, dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship
    and loyalty. Mr. Dobson too looked puzzled, the old family solicitor who
    had seen Luke and his brothers and sister grow up, who a few hours, nay minutes,
    ago would have sworn to his client&rsquo;s innocence before the entire world,
    he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt.</p>
  <p>Not one other person in the room either, believe me, who was not convinced
    of Luke&rsquo;s guilt. Louisa knew that well enough as her aching eyes wandered
    over the sea of faces, meeting hollow compassion, morbid curiosity, at best
    a certain sympathetic horror, in the glances round. She knew that every one
    here, the officials, the jury, the police, the public, believed that Luke
    struck his cousin in the dark; she knew that Mr. Dobson had begun to doubt;
    and that her father had begun to fear.</p>
  <p>And she, with all the fervour of unconquered Love, prayed in her heart that
    she might understand. She prayed to Love to open the eyes of her mind, for
    it was her reason which did not understand, which yearned to understand.</p>
  <p>Her heart cared nothing, cared for nothing except for the man she loved
    and the bitter, bitter sorrow which he endured alone, shut away from all,
    even from her.</p>
  <p>There was general stir in the court room, the coroner had risen, also the
    jury. The journalists were holding agitated parlance with the boy messengers.
    Louisa&mdash;like one who had received a sharp blow on the head&mdash;wondered
    what all this stir meant.</p>
  <p>Was it all over? Had Luke irretrievably lost himself in that secret orchard
    of his, into which he was obviously determined that even she should not enter?</p>
  <p>Then she found out that the stir only meant the luncheon hour. All these
    people were going to eat and to chatter. Heavens above! how they would chatter!</p>
  <p>Her father said something about getting a cab, and trying to find a decent
    hotel in which to have luncheon. But she scarcely heard. She had just seen
    Luke disappearing through the crowd in company with Mr. Dobson, and he had
    not even glanced back to look at her.</p>
  <p>Every one whispered round her. Lady Ducies&rsquo; nodding feathers worried
    her almost to distraction. She allowed her father to lead her away, and to
    make way for her through the crowd.</p>
  <p>Presently she found herself sitting near him in a cab. He was silent and
    would not look at her. He had begun to think that Luke had killed his cousin;
    once she heard him repeating the word, &ldquo;damnable!&rdquo; twice under
    his breath. Thus she knew that his loyalty was on the point of giving way.</p>
  <p>It seems that they had luncheon somewhere together. She did not take the
    trouble to inquire where she was: an old-fashioned hotel somewhere in Kensington,
    with table-cloths that looked as if they had been used for several previous
    luncheons, and foreign waiters who wore weird-looking shoes and trousers
    frayed at the edges.</p>
  <p>To please her father she ate a little, though she thought that eating must
    choke her. But it was wearisome to argue, and he&mdash;poor dear&mdash;looked
    so miserable.</p>
  <p>Time was precious and luncheon interminably slow: it was past two o&rsquo;clock
    when Louisa saw Luke again in the court room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
    Which Tells Of An Unexpected Turn Of Events</b></h2>
  <p>It seems that coroner and jury had not spent quite so much time over luncheon
    as the more or less interested spectators. When the crowd began to file back
    again into the seats, the coroner had already examined and dismissed one
    witness and was questioning another.</p>
  <p>The past and present servants of the Grosvenor Square household would all
    have to pass before the coroner during the course of this long afternoon.
    It was only two o&rsquo;clock and already the gas had to be lighted&mdash;two
    incandescent burners just above the coroner&rsquo;s table&mdash;hard, uncompromising
    lights, that threw a sickly green tinge on every face and cast deep black
    shadows under every eye.</p>
  <p>It was this light no doubt that made Luke&rsquo;s face seem positively ghastly
    to Louisa: it looked almost like a death-mask, so deep and cavernous did
    the eyes appear, and so hollow the cheeks. He was sitting in his usual attitude,
    with arms folded, between Mr. Dobson and one of the women in seedy black
    whose presence here had puzzled every one.</p>
  <p>Old Parker, ex-butler to Lord Radclyffe, was giving evidence. He had a tale
    to tell, how Mr. de Mountford &ldquo;went on awful&rdquo; when he&mdash;the
    innocent, well-drilled servant&mdash;had thought it his duty to introduce
    Mr. Philip into his lordship&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just think of it, your honour,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;his lordship&rsquo;s
    rightful heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he added with calm effrontery:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Luke &rsquo;e give me the sack then and there! He was that wild!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just a paltry, silly, meaningless revenge. The death-mask on Luke&rsquo;s
    face relaxed for a moment when he looked on the fat creature standing before
    the jury, vainly trying to look pompous and self-righteous, and only succeeding
    in being a liar.</p>
  <p>The evidence would have been of little worth, but for the corroboration
    from other servants of the Grosvenor Square household. The present two&mdash;man
    and wife&mdash;wastrels and drunkards, counted for nothing: they had only
    entered Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s service recently when all visitors had ceased
    from calling at the inhospitable house, and they had seen little or nothing
    of Luke; but the others&mdash;those whom Philip&rsquo;s arbitrary temper
    had driven out of the house&mdash;they had many a tale to tell of the dead
    man&rsquo;s arrogance, his contemptuous treatment of his younger kinsman,
    and the bitter words that often flew between the cousins, when doors closed
    and eavesdroppers were behind the key-holes.</p>
  <p>These witnesses&mdash;an ex-housekeeper, a footman, a maid&mdash;were trying
    their best, poor things, to &ldquo;do the right thing by Mr. Luke,&rdquo; little
    guessing how ill they succeeded. They had been dragged into this much against
    their will. As a class they hated the police and its doings, even though
    the cook might occasionally show a preference for the local guardian of peace
    and order. As for the detective in plain clothes, the man who wore a peaked
    cap instead of the familiar helmet, him they hated and feared, especially
    since he seemed to mean mischief for Mr. Luke.</p>
  <p>They gave their evidence unwillingly; every admission had to be dragged
    out of them, once they realized that the revelations of past quarrels between &ldquo;the
    gentlemen&rdquo; would not be to the detriment of the dead, only perhaps
    to the undoing of the living.</p>
  <p>The hours wore on wearily. The atmosphere now surcharged with the heat from
    the gas brackets had become intolerably oppressive. Opoponax and white heliotrope
    waxed faint to the nostrils. Through the badly fitting window frame something
    of the outward fog had penetrated into the room. It hung about in the air,
    round the gas that burned yellow and dim through it, and obscured the far
    corners of the place, throwing a veil over the twelve mutes in uniform overcoats
    with threadbare velvet collars, over the eager and perspiring journalists
    whose fountain pens had scraped the paper incessantly for so long.</p>
  <p>Hot, tired, and oppressed humanity made its warm breath felt in the close,
    ill-ventilated room. Smelling-salts would not dispel the unpleasantly mingling
    odours of damp clothes and muddy boots which rose from the plebeian crowd
    in the rear.</p>
  <p>But nobody stirred; no one would have thought of leaving before the last
    act of this interesting play. The chief actor was not on the stage for the
    moment, but his presence was felt. It was magnetic in its appeal to excitement.
    Every question put by the coroner, every reply given by the witnesses, had,
    as it were, Luke de Mountford for its aim: every word tended toward him,
    his undoing, the enmeshing of his denials in the close web of circumstantial
    evidence.</p>
  <p>Then a diversion occurred.</p>
  <p>The man in the shabby clothes, who looked like a beetle, and who had marshalled
    his companions into the court room early in the day, was called upon by the
    usher to come forward. His strange, poorly-clad figure detached itself from
    the groups immediately round him, his long, loose limbs seeming to swing
    themselves forward.</p>
  <p>His four companions&mdash;the three women and the other man&mdash;were seized
    apparently with great agitation and whispered eagerly among themselves. No
    one in the crowd could guess why these people had been called. They seemed
    so completely out of the picture which had its invisible frame in Grosvenor
    Square.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Jim!&rdquo; whispered one of the young women, &ldquo;they
    can&rsquo;t do nothing to ye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the beetle-like creature shambled forward, with arms gangling beside
    him, a humble, apologetic look on his care-worn face. He might have been
    any age from thirty to sixty; time and a perpetual struggle for existence
    had wiped way all traces of actual age. The cheeks were hollow, and eyes,
    mouth, and moustache had a droop which added to the settled melancholy of
    the face.</p>
  <p>He was obviously very nervous and looked across at his own friends, who
    strove to encourage him by signs and whispers.</p>
  <p>He nearly dropped the Bible when it was handed to him, and no one could
    really hear the oath which he repeated mechanically at the usher&rsquo;s
    bidding.</p>
  <p>At last he mustered up a sufficient amount of courage to state his name
    and address.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James Baker,&rdquo; he said in answer to the coroner&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Bricklayer
    by trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At 147 Clapham Junction Road, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, scarcely
    above a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak up, please,&rdquo; admonished the coroner, &ldquo;the jury
    can&rsquo;t hear you. You came here, I understand, prepared to make a statement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of what nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man shifted his position from one leg to the other. Heavy beads of perspiration
    stood out on his pallid forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Jim; don&rsquo;t be afeeard,&rdquo; came from the body of
    the court.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence there!&rdquo; commanded the usher.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wished to say, sir,&rdquo; resumed the man, trying to steady his
    voice,  &ldquo;that the deceased whom I saw lying in the coffin yonder is
    my own son, Paul Baker, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your son!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son, sir,&rdquo; asserted the man somewhat more steadily, &ldquo;my
    son, and  &rsquo;is mother&rsquo;s, as is sitting over there. My son, Paul
    Baker, as left &rsquo;ome two year ago come next Christmas. We all come &rsquo;ere,
    sir, to-day, me and &rsquo;is mother and sister an&rsquo; Smith an&rsquo; Jane&mdash;we
    all come &rsquo;ere to swear to &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your son!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The exclamation once more came from the coroner, but had any one else dared,
    that exclamation would have been echoed and re&euml;choed by every mouth
    in the court room, coupled with emphatic ejaculations of incredulity.</p>
  <p>It was as if in a new castle of some grim, sleeping monster a magic wand
    had touched every somnolent spirit. Smelling salts and scented handkerchiefs
    were forgotten: the jurymen leaned forward half across the table, oblivious
    of their own dignity, in their endeavour to obtain a fuller view of this
    wielder of the magic wand: the beetle-like creature with the sad eyes and
    pale, hollow cheeks. Even the reporters&mdash;accustomed to sensational events&mdash;gave
    up scribbling in order to stare open-mouthed at the shabby figure standing
    by the table.</p>
  <p>At first, of course, the predominant sensation was one of sweeping incredulity.
    Coroner and jury had met here to-day in this stuffy room in order to conduct
    an inquiry on the death of Philip de Mountford, heir presumptive to the earldom
    of Radclyffe. The crowd of fashionable and idle gapers had pushed and jostled
    in order to hear the ugly story of how wealth and position are fought for
    and intrigued for even at the cost of crime.</p>
  <p>And now to think that the man who lay dead was just a bricklayer&rsquo;s
    son! It was absolutely incredible. Not till a few moments later did the spectators
    realize that, if the seedy man at the table spoke truly, then they were witnessing
    a drama even more poignant than that of the original murder; a drama of deception
    and of fraud, and a mystery far deeper than that which had originally confronted
    the sensation mongers.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, incredulity died down, and died down very quickly. A subtle
    wave filled the murky atmosphere compelling every mind to belief, long before
    the man&rsquo;s assertions were proved to be correct. The most indifferent
    became conscious of an overwhelming conviction that the witness was speaking
    the truth.</p>
  <p>This conviction was absolutely paramount in the minds of the chief actors
    in the play. To them all, to Colonel Harris and to Louisa, to Mr. Dobson
    and the solicitors, the truth of the statement was never in question. An
    unerring instinct forced them to believe: and such beliefs are as unconquerable
    as they are overwhelming. Truth that is an absolute, unquestionable truth
    finds its way to the mind, when the latter is attuned to subtle or psychic
    impressions.</p>
  <p>And as the truth was borne in upon these people, so did they realize the
    fulness of its meaning, the deep significance of its portent.</p>
  <p>To some of them it seemed as if in a brilliantly illuminated world, all
    the lights had suddenly been extinguished: to others, as if in a dark and
    intricate cavern, full of black, impenetrable shadows, dazzling lights had
    been suddenly switched on.</p>
  <p>Louisa, looking across at Luke, saw that to him it meant the latter, and
    that some of the new, dazzling light had illumined the darkness of his soul.</p>
  <p>Something of the tense rigidity of his attitude had gone from him: not the
    sorrow perhaps, but the blank hopelessness of a misery that flounders in
    a sea of the unknown.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
    The World Is So Large</b></h2>
  <p>As for the man who had made the extraordinary assertion, he seemed quite
    unconscious of the effect which it had produced: as if the fact that the
    supposed heir to an earldom, being actually the son of a Clapham bricklayer,
    was one that found its natural place in every-day life.</p>
  <p>He had his cap in his hand&mdash;a shabby, gray tweed cap&mdash;and he was
    twirling it between his fingers round and round with an irritatingly nervous
    gesture. His eyes now and again were furtively raised at the coroner, as
    if he were wondering anxiously what punishment would be meted out to him
    for having created so much commotion, and then with equal furtiveness he
    dropped them again. His shoulders were bowed and his knees parted company
    from each other, thus giving him more than ever the appearance of a beetle.</p>
  <p>Of course the coroner had to recover his official manner as quickly as possible.
    But even to him the statement had come as a surprise. He had only known very
    vaguely that a witness had come forward at the eleventh hour, having only
    just had time to communicate with the police before the opening of the inquest.</p>
  <p>In view of the importance of the evidence, the witness was called as soon
    as possible; what he had to say would materially affect the whole trend of
    the inquiry; he had, it seems, brought others with him&mdash;members of his
    own family among them&mdash;in order that they might corroborate the truth
    of what he said.</p>
  <p>Quite a minute or so had elapsed in the meanwhile; then at last was the
    coroner able to resume with at least a semblance of official indifference:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let the jury understand a little more
    clearly what you said just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I said?&rdquo; rejoined the man vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, what you said. Let us understand it clearly. You went to the
    mortuary this morning, and saw the body of the deceased?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you state here on oath that in the deceased you recognized your
    own son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear to &rsquo;im!&rdquo; replied the witness simply. &ldquo;Ask &rsquo;is
    mother there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a long, thin finger, generously edged with grime, he pointed to
    the woman in seedy black hat and shabby tweed jacket who sat quite close
    to Luke de Mountford.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about his mother just now,&rdquo; admonished the coroner. &ldquo;We
    want your statement first. You realize that you are on oath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ve sworn my Bible oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you understand the importance of an oath?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you swear that the body of the murdered man whom you saw in the
    mortuary chamber this morning is that of your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear to that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I believe that had coroner and jury and practically every man there present,
    dared to put their thoughts into words at that moment, the ejaculation:  &ldquo;Well!
    I am blowed!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d!&rdquo; as the case might
    be&mdash;would have been generally heard throughout the room. The women,
    on the other hand, were far too excited even to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed the coroner, &ldquo;tell the jury please when
    you first identified the deceased as your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the mortuary chamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had not seen the body before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know that other witnesses have sworn that the body is that
    of a gentleman called Philip de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I knew that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do you mean to assert that those other witnesses have sworn
    false oaths?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; rejoined James Baker with an apologetic smile
    of self-deprecation,  &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say such a thing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They was mistaken, sir, that&rsquo;s all. Paul was that clever, sir;
    ask  &rsquo;is mother there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And once more the lean and grimy finger pointed to the seedy-looking matron
    who nodded a melancholy head, half in pride, half in regret.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clever, did you say?&rdquo; asked the coroner, more briskly now.
    At last he held a thread in this extraordinary tangled skein. &ldquo;Then
    do you mean to assert that your son&mdash;Paul Baker&mdash;went about the
    world calling himself Philip de Mountford?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That must &rsquo;ave been it, sir, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deceiving people?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! &rsquo;e was ever a bit o&rsquo; no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think he imposed upon his lordship, the Earl of Radclyffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E must &rsquo;ave done, sir, mustn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e now? seein&rsquo; as &rsquo;ow &rsquo;is
    lordship must &rsquo;ave been took in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You helped him in the deception, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me, sir? Lor&rsquo; bless ye no! Me an&rsquo; &rsquo;is mother ain&rsquo;t
    clever enough for such things! We knew nothin&rsquo; of Paul&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s,
    and &rsquo;e allus went &rsquo;is own way, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But at least you knew that this fraud was going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean &lsquo;not exactly?&rsquo;&rdquo; retorted the coroner
    sharply. &ldquo;You seem to be unconscious of the fact that this story which
    you are telling the jury is a very serious matter indeed. If it is true,
    you are not only making a grave accusation against your dead son, but with
    this accusation you may be involving yourself or some other member of your
    family in an exceedingly serious charge of fraud, the penalty for which if
    proved would be very severe indeed. On the other hand if the story you tell
    is nothing but a cock-and-bull tale, which further evidence would presently
    demolish, then you lay yourself open to a charge of perjury and of conspiracy
    to defeat the ends of justice. I have thought best to give you this word
    of warning&mdash;the last which you will get from me&mdash;because really
    you do not seem to be fully conscious of the extreme gravity of your position.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bricklayer from Clapham had listened to this admonition, delivered with
    solemn emphasis and no small measure of severity, with a kind of stolid indifference.
    He retained his humble, apologetic attitude, but clearly the coroner&rsquo;s
    threats did not affect his simple equanimity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir, kindly,&rdquo; he said when the coroner had ceased
    speaking,  &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp it. Paul would go on &rsquo;is
    own way. Ask &rsquo;is mother there. &rsquo;E never would be spoken to, wouldn&rsquo;t
    Paul. And me and &rsquo;is mother allus said &rsquo;e&rsquo;d come to mischief
    some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you know anything at all of this fraud?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. We knew nothin&rsquo; of it really. You see Paul left &rsquo;ome
    nearly two year ago come Christmas. &rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t tell us nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you last saw your son alive two years ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. That&rsquo;s the last me and &rsquo;is mother seed of &rsquo;im.
    Christmas Day, sir, &rsquo;twas two year ago nearly. Paul &rsquo;e said then &rsquo;e&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad
    enough of knockin&rsquo;  about in London. &rsquo;E was goin&rsquo; abroad, &rsquo;e
    was, that&rsquo;s what &rsquo;e said. And &rsquo;e left &rsquo;ome, sir,
    the next day. Bank &rsquo;oliday &rsquo;twere, and that&rsquo;s the last
    me and &rsquo;is mother seed of &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had told this with all the simple fatalism peculiar to his class. The
    son went &ldquo;abroad,&rdquo; and &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; to a Clapham labourer
    is a very vague term indeed. It means so many things: geographically it means
    any place beyond a twelve-mile radius from home; the Antipodes are &ldquo;abroad,&rdquo; but
    so is Yorkshire. Domestically it means that the traveller passes out of the
    existence of those that are left behind as surely as if he had stepped into
    the grave. Financially, it means a mouth less to feed, seeing that the intending
    traveller is nearly always a wastrel at home. In any event the proposed journey &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; is
    taken with quiet philosophy by family and friends. The traveller starts for &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; as
    easily, as simply, as he would for the nearest public house. He has no impedimenta,
    nothing to burden him or to cause him regret. Strangely enough, no one ever
    has any idea where the money comes from that pays for the journey &ldquo;abroad.&rdquo; The
    traveller being a wastrel never has any himself, and the family is invariably
    too poor to provide it. But the wastrel goes, nevertheless.</p>
  <p>And life within the narrowed precincts of the family circle goes on just
    as it had done before. Sometimes news comes from the traveller&mdash;a picture
    post-card from &ldquo;abroad,&rdquo; usually a request for pecuniary assistance.
    Seldom does good news arrive; still more seldom does the traveller come back
    home.</p>
  <p>But it is all very simple. Nothing to make a fuss about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the coroner, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t tell you where
    he meant to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Jim Baker, &ldquo;he just was going abroad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know where he went?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever try to find out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Where &rsquo;ad been the use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Where indeed? The world is so large! and the Baker family so insignificant!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t write to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor communicate with you in any way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had no idea what had become of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not until last summer, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His sister, sir, our Emily, she was out walkin&rsquo; with Harry
    Smith&mdash;young Smith from next door to us, sir &mdash;and she was down
    in the West End o&rsquo; London with  &rsquo;im one day, and &rsquo;oo should
    they meet, sir, but Paul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they speak to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. They says, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Paul, we didn&rsquo;t know
    as &rsquo;ow you was &rsquo;ome,&rsquo;  and &rsquo;e seemed upset like at
    first, and pretended &rsquo;e didn&rsquo;t know &rsquo;em, and that they&rsquo;d
    made a mistake. But they chaffed &rsquo;im and went on talkin&rsquo;, so
    I suppose Paul &rsquo;e thought it best to make a clean breast of it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that he told his sister and his friend that he
    was carrying on a criminal fraud against the Earl of Radclyffe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir; not all that. &rsquo;E only told &rsquo;em that &rsquo;e
    was in for a good thing. A gentleman&rsquo;s gentleman &rsquo;e told &rsquo;em &rsquo;e
    was and doin&rsquo; well for hisself. &rsquo;E said &rsquo;e would come and
    see the fam&rsquo;ly&mdash;&rsquo;e meant me and &rsquo;is mother, sir&mdash;some
    day soon. But &rsquo;e never come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he say where he was living?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. &rsquo;E gave &rsquo;is address to Emily. Up &rsquo;Ampstead
    way it were. A long way, sir. Me and &rsquo;is mother never seemed to &rsquo;ave
    the time to go and look  &rsquo;im up; but Emily she went with young Smith
    one Sunday, but they never found the street, not where Paul said &rsquo;e
    was livin&rsquo;. There weren&rsquo;t no such street in &rsquo;Ampstead,
    sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never thought of making further inquiries?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; This again with that quiet philosophy, the stolid
    fatalism, peculiar to those who live from day to day, from hand to mouth,
    who have neither leisure nor desire to peer outside the very circumscribed
    limits of their own hearths.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never made any effort to know more about what your son was doing
    or how he was living?&rdquo; suggested the coroner, who, though accustomed
    to this same quiet philosophy in men and women of that class, was nevertheless
    strangely moved in this instance by the expression of a fatalism that carried
    in its train such extraordinary consequences.</p>
  <p>But Jim Baker, mildly astonished at the coroner&rsquo;s insistence over
    so obvious a matter, explained meekly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We knew that Paul was doin&rsquo; well, you see, sir. &rsquo;E was
    that splendidly dressed when Emily and young Smith seed &rsquo;im they was
    quite respectful like to &rsquo;im. So we knew &rsquo;e was all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never troubled any further about your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to interfere with &rsquo;im, sir. Gentlemen
    don&rsquo;t allus like their servants to be &rsquo;aving visitors, or to &rsquo;obnob
    with poor people like us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More calm philosophy not unmixed with a delicate sense of pride this time,
    and a sublime if unconscious vein of selflessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined the coroner, not unkindly this time&mdash;the
    man who looked so like a beetle, who was so humble and apologetic, compelled
    quite a certain amount of regard&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll leave that matter
    for the moment, Mr. Baker. Now will you tell the jury what made you come
    to this court to-day? What led you to think that the man who had been murdered
    in a cab the night before last, and of whom all the newspapers spoke as Mr.
    Philip de Mountford&mdash;what made you think that he was your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Baker by way of a reply plunged one of his thin hands in the pocket
    of his shabby coat and drew out a portion of very grimy newspaper carefully
    folded up quite small. He undid the folds until his eyes lighted on that
    which they sought. Then he held the paper out toward the coroner and pointed
    to a picture sandwiched in among the letter-press.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> yesterday.
    It&rsquo;s the picture of Paul, I says to myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coroner took the paper from the witness and laid it down on the table,
    glancing at it casually. There had been innumerable portraits of the murdered
    man published both in the morning and the evening papers of yesterday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Paul to the life,&rdquo; insisted Jim Baker. &ldquo;I
    was at my work, you understand, when I seed the paper in one o&rsquo; the
    other chaps&rsquo; &rsquo;ands. I couldn&rsquo;t give up my work then. I &rsquo;ad
    to wait till evenin&rsquo; to speak to my missus. Then we talked it all over,
    and young Smith &rsquo;e took a day off and me too, and Mrs. Baker and Emily
    and Jane Smith, they all come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you looked on the face of the dead man, and you swear that it
    is your son?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I take my oath, sir. Ask &rsquo;is mother there. She knows &rsquo;er
    own son. She&rsquo;ll tell you just what vaccination marks &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad
    on &rsquo;is arm, and about the scar on &rsquo;is leg and all. The ladies,
    sir, they are that sharp&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Baker&mdash;feeling no doubt that his ordeal was nearly over&mdash;was
    losing his nervousness, or perhaps it took a new form, that of jocularity.
    The coroner thought it best to check his efforts at humour in the bud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do!&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>And the Clapham bricklayer at once retired within his shell of humble self-deprecation.
    He answered a few more questions that the coroner put to him, but clearly
    his own circle of vision was so circumscribed that, willing as he undoubtedly
    was, he could throw no light whatever on the unknown events which led up
    to the extraordinary fraud practised on the Earl of Radclyffe and which culminated
    in the mysterious murder in the taxicab.</p>
  <p>The father of the strangely enigmatic personality, who indeed had taken
    many a secret with him to the grave, was far too indifferent, too fatalistic,
    to put forth any theory as to his son&rsquo;s motives, or the inducements
    and temptations which had first given birth to the astoundingly clever deception.</p>
  <p>Wearied and impatient at last the coroner gave up his questionings. He turned
    to the jury with the accustomed formula:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would any of you gentlemen like to ask this witness any questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The foreman of the jury wanted to know if the witness&rsquo;s son had any
    birthmarks on him, or other palpable means of identification.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Jim Baker, &ldquo;but &rsquo;is mother&rsquo;ll
    tell you better&rsquo;n me&mdash;she knows best&mdash;about the vaccination
    marks and all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The foreman then asked the coroner whether the jury would be allowed to
    identify the marks. On being assured by the coroner that after adjournment
    this very day every means would be taken to corroborate Jim Baker&rsquo;s
    statement, the jury seemed satisfied.</p>
  <p>And the corner called the next witness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
And Then Every One Went Home</b></h2>
  <p>Though the hour was getting late, no one among the crowd thought of leaving
    the court. Even the desire for tea, so peculiarly insistent at a certain
    hour of the day in the whole of the British race, was smothered beneath the
    wave of intense excitement which swept right over every one.</p>
  <p>Although the next witnesses&mdash;who each in their turn came forward to
    the foot of the table&mdash;swore to tell the truth and faced the coroner
    with more or less assurance, they could but repeat the assertions of the
    head of the family; nevertheless the public seemed ready to listen with untiring
    patience to the story which went to prove that the man whom everybody believed
    to be the heir of one of the oldest titles and richest rent-rolls in England
    was the son of a Clapham bricklayer, a master of audacity and of fraud.</p>
  <p>The mother&mdash;a worthy and simple soul&mdash;was the first to explain
    that Paul, her only son, had always been something of a gentleman. He had
    done very well at school, and never done a stroke of work like &rsquo;is
    father. When he was fifteen he was quite stage-struck. &ldquo;Always play-acting,&rdquo; as
    the mother put it, &ldquo;and could recite poetry beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Baker seemed distinctly proud of her son&rsquo;s deeply rooted horror
    of work. She thought that all the instincts of a gentleman were really in
    him. When he was a grown lad, he went as footman in a gentleman&rsquo;s family
    somewhere in the Midlands. The mother loftily supposed that it was there
    that Paul learned his good manners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a perfect gentleman, sir,&rdquo; she reiterated complacently.</p>
  <p>It appeared too that the wastrel had had a period in his career when the
    call of the stage proved quite irresistible, for he seemed to have left the
    gentleman&rsquo;s family in the Midlands somewhat abruptly and walked on
    as super for a time in the various melodramas produced at the Grand Theatre,
    Nottingham, whenever a crowd was required on the stage. There seems also
    to have existed a legend in the heart of the fond mother and of the doting
    sister that Paul had once really played a big part in a serious play. But
    this statement was distinctly wanting in corroboration.</p>
  <p>What was obviously an established fact was that the man had a certain spirit
    of adventure in him, and that he had been a regular rolling stone, a regular
    idle, good-for-nothing wastrel, possessing a certain charm of manner which
    delighted his family and which was readily mistaken by the simple folk for
    that of a gentleman.</p>
  <p>They were all called in turn; the sister, and young Smith &ldquo;from next
    door,&rdquo; and the latter&rsquo;s sister. Not one of them swerved for a
    moment from the original story told by Jim Baker. Emily and young Smith told
    of the meeting which occurred on a fine summer&rsquo;s afternoon between
    themselves and Paul. By the strange caprice of wanton coincidence the meeting
    occurred inside Green Park. Paul seemed a little worried, thinking that the
    passers-by would see him talking to &ldquo;poor people like us,&rdquo; as
    Emily Baker had it, &ldquo;although,&rdquo; she added proudly, &ldquo;I &rsquo;ad
    me new &rsquo;at on, with the pink roses.&rdquo; Otherwise he was quite pleasant
    and not at all &ldquo;off-&rsquo;and.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The account of this interview was fully corroborated by young Smith  &ldquo;from
    next door.&rdquo; Jane Smith, who at one time had considered herself engaged
    to Paul Baker, had a few tender reminiscences to recount. She had seen the
    prodigal once on the boards of the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre, Lewisham, and she
    declared that he looked  &ldquo;a perfect gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The day wore on, or rather the commencement of evening. The evil-smelling
    fog from outside had made its home inside the dismal room. People there only
    saw one another through a misty veil; the corners of the room were wrapped
    in gloom. Exciting as was the story which had been unfolded this afternoon,
    one or two among the audience had given way to sleep. Lady Ducies&rsquo; feathers
    nodded ominously, and the old dame who had munched sandwiches was inclined
    to give forth an occasional snore.</p>
  <p>Louisa&rsquo;s eyes were aching. Constant watching had tired them; they
    even ceased to see clearly. Her brain too had become somnolent. She was tired
    of hearing these people talk. From the moment that Jim Baker had stated that
    the murdered man was his own son, Louisa had known that he had spoken the
    truth. Instinct was guiding her toward the truth, showing her the truth,
    wherever possible. She listened at first&mdash;deeply interested&mdash;to
    the scrappy evidence which told of Paul Baker&rsquo;s early life, but the
    family from Clapham Junction Road had marvellously little to relate. They
    no more understood their adventurous- spirited son than they would have been
    capable of aiding and abetting the fraud which he concocted.</p>
  <p>They themselves were far too simple and too stupid to be dangerously criminal.
    And so the evidence quickly lost its interest for Louisa. She herself, with
    the fragmentary statements which she heard, could more easily surmise the
    life history of Paul Baker than could the doting mother, who retailed complacently
    every mark on the skin and on the body of her son, and knew nothing whatever&mdash;less
    than nothing&mdash;of his thoughts, his schemes, of the evil that was in
    him, and the ambition which led to his end.</p>
  <p>And now the last of the Baker contingent was dismissed. Jane Smith, the
    sweetheart of the murdered man, was the last to leave the coroner&rsquo;s
    table. She did so in a flood of tears, in which the others promptly and incontinently
    joined.</p>
  <p>The coroner, somewhat impatient with them all, for their vague notions on
    the most important bearings of the case had severely tried him, adjourned
    the inquiry until the morrow.</p>
  <p>He ordered the jury to be present at a quarter before ten, and gave the
    signal for general withdrawal.</p>
  <p>After which every one went home.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
    And There Are People Who Do Not Care</b></h2>
  <p>For the first time in the whole course of her life Louisa Harris felt that
    convention must be flouted and social duties could not be fulfilled.</p>
  <p>When the coroner, rising from his seat, gave the signal for general exodus,
    she had felt her father&rsquo;s firm hand grasping her arm, and leading her
    out of the fog-ridden, stuffy room into the cold, gray passages outside.</p>
  <p>The herd of cackling geese were crowding round her. Heavens above, how they
    cackled and gossiped! It seemed as if the very floodgates of a noisy, bubbling
    stream had been torn asunder, and a whirlpool of chattering women been let
    loose upon the earth.</p>
  <p>Convention, grim and untractable, tried to pull the string to make all puppets
    dance. But for once Louisa Harris rebelled. She closed her ears to insinuating
    calls from her friends, responding with a mere curt nod to the most gushing &ldquo;Oh,
    Miss Harris! how are you?&rdquo; which greeted her from every side.</p>
  <p>She turned her back resolutely on convention. The slave for once rebelled
    against the taskmaster: the puppet refused to dance to the ever-wearying
    monotonous tune.</p>
  <p>She had lost sight of Luke the moment the court rose. She supposed that
    his solicitor, Mr. Dobson, knowing the ropes, had got him away from the reach
    of cackling geese by leading him through some other more private way. But
    she was far too dazed, too numb, either to wonder or to be disappointed at
    this. She felt as if she had pitched head foremost down a long flight of
    stairs, and had only just had sufficient strength to pick herself up, and
    not to let other people see quite how severely she had been bruised.</p>
  <p>Mentally, morally, even physically, she felt bruised from head to foot.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris contrived to steer her through the crowd: at the gate outside
    even the smoke-laden atmosphere seemed pure and invigorating in comparison
    with that stuffy pen, wherein the herd of cackling geese had found its happy
    hunting ground. Louisa drew in a long breath, filling her lungs with fog,
    but feeling a little freer, less choked in spite of the grime which she inhaled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Colonel Harris now, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d
    better go straight back to the Langham, and get some tea. You&rsquo;ll feel
    better when you&rsquo;ve had your tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I feel all right, dear,&rdquo; she said, trying to smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; he retorted with an equal effort at cheerfulness.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    come along as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you off to, dear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go and have a talk to Tom,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you. I can wait in the cab. I don&rsquo;t suppose
    that you&rsquo;ll be long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to protest, but obviously she had made up her mind. Perhaps she
    did not like the idea of going back to the hotel alone. So he hailed a passing
    cab and told the man to drive to Scotland Yard.</p>
  <p>He had deliberately&mdash;and despite former prejudices &mdash;selected
    a taxicab. He wanted to see Tom as soon as was possible.</p>
  <p>Louisa leaned back in the corner of the vehicle silent and motionless. Father
    and daughter did not exchange a single word whilst the cab rattled through
    the crowded streets of London. Hansoms, omnibuses, innumerable other taxis,
    rattled along the selfsame way, just as they had always done before this,
    just as they would go on doing to the end of time. People walked along, busy
    and indifferent. Many went past the shrieking news vendors without even stopping
    to buy a paper.</p>
  <p>Luke stood accused, almost self-convicted, of a horrible crime, and there
    were thousands, nay millions, of people who didn&rsquo;t even care!</p>
  <p>The taxicab flew past the railings of the Green Park, there where another
    taxicab had drawn up a couple of evenings ago, and where a snake-wood stick
    marked with tell-tale stains had been found clumsily buried in the mud. Louisa
    peered out of the window of the cab. People walked past that spot, indifferent
    and busy. Two girls were standing close to the railings chatting and giggling.</p>
  <p>And Luke to-morrow, or perhaps to-night, would be under arrest&mdash;charged
    with murder&mdash;horrible, cruel, brutal murder&mdash;a vulgar, cowardly
    crime! The snake-wood stick had told a tale which he had not attempted to
    refute.</p>
  <p>Presently the cab drew up and Colonel Harris jumped down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be longer than I can help,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will
    you be all right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father dear,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right.
    Don&rsquo;t hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She saw her father disappearing through the wide open door, above which
    a globe of light shone yellow through the fog. She remained huddled up in
    her furs, for she felt very cold. Her feet were like ice, and the fog seemed
    to have penetrated to her very marrow. Few people were to be seen in the
    narrow roadway, and only an occasional cab rattled past.</p>
  <p>From the embankment close by came the cry of news vendors rushing along
    with late editions of the evening papers.</p>
  <p>A church clock not far away slowly struck six, but she held no count of
    time. A kind of drowsiness was upon her, and the foggy atmosphere, coupled
    with intense, damp cold, acted as a kind of soporific.</p>
  <p>She may have waited years, or only a few minutes; she did not know, but
    presently her father came back. His presence there under the lintel of the
    door seemed to have roused her from her torpor, as if with a swift, telepathic
    current. As he stood for a moment beneath the electric light, adjusting the
    collar of his coat, she saw his face quite distinctly: its expression told
    her everything. Luke&rsquo;s arrest was imminent. It was but a question of
    a few hours, moments perhaps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to Exhibition Road at once,&rdquo; he said, speaking quickly,
    like a man deeply troubled.</p>
  <p>And without waiting for her assent, which was a foregone conclusion, he
    gave the chauffeur the address: &ldquo;Fairfax Mansions, Exhibition Road&rdquo;;
    and added,  &ldquo;drive as fast as you can!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he jumped in beside Louisa. The taxicab moaned and groaned whilst it
    man&oelig;uvred for turning; then it rattled off once more at prohibited
    speed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;only a question of time, I
    suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The warrant is out,&rdquo; he replied curtly. &ldquo;Any moment now
    the police may be at his door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Ryder is convinced of Luke&rsquo;s guilt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beyond that what does he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That unless Luke chooses to make a bolt of it, he had better plead
    guilty and intense provocation. But he thinks Luke would be wise to catch
    the night boat for Calais.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d get him back on extradition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom says they won&rsquo;t try very hard. And if Luke keeps his wits
    about him, and has a sufficiency of money he&rsquo;ll be able to get right
    through to Spain and from thence to Tangiers. With money and influence much
    can be done, and Tom says that if Luke will only get away to-night he himself
    is prepared to take all the blame and all the responsibility of having allowed
    a criminal to escape. It&rsquo;s very decent of Tom,&rdquo; added the colonel
    thoughtfully, &ldquo;for he risks his entire future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the sorely troubled father did not tell his daughter all that Sir Thomas
    had told him in the course of the brief interview.</p>
  <p>In effect the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department had given a
    brief alternative by way of advice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A ticket to anywhere via Calais at once&mdash;or a revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he had added dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see nothing else for it. The man has practically confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this Colonel Harris would not admit, and so the two men parted. Louisa&rsquo;s
    father, thinking a great deal of his friend but still more of his daughter,
    wanted above all things to have a final talk with Luke.</p>
  <p>Louisa in the meanwhile sat silent in the corner of the cab.</p>
  <p>She was trying to visualize this new picture: Luke&mdash;a fugitive from
    justice!</p>
  <p>The taxicab was making a slight detour as Whitehall and the Mall were closed
    for road repairs. The chauffeur was driving round by St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane.
    At one of the theatres there, a popular play was filling the house night
    after night with enthusiastic crowds. It was only half past six now, and
    in a long queue extending over two hundred yards away from the pit and gallery
    doors of the lucky playhouse, patient crowds waited for the evening&rsquo;s
    pleasure.</p>
  <p>People were going to theatres, they laughed at farces, and wept at tragedies.
    Was there ever such a tragedy enacted inside a theatre, as now took place
    in the life of a commonplace man and woman?</p>
  <p>Luke&mdash;a fugitive from justice! Money and influence could do much! They
    could enable a wealthy criminal to escape the consequences of his own crime!
    They could enable him to catch express trains unmolested, to fly across land
    and sea under cover of the night, to become, Cain-like, a wanderer on the
    face of the earth without rest and without peace.</p>
  <p>Could they prevent him from seeing ever present at his elbow the grim Angel
    of Remorse, holding in one hand the glass wherein relentlessly flowed the
    sands of time, and in the other, the invisible sword of a retarded but none
    the less sure vengeance? Could they prevent his hearing the one word, Nemesis?</p>
  <p>Luke&mdash;a fugitive from justice! Accused of a crime which he did not
    commit, self-convicted, almost self-accused, and fleeing from its consequences
    as he would from Remorse!</p>
  <p>And people went to theatres, and laughed and cried. People ate and danced
    and sang. News vendors shrieked their wares, the latest sensational news;
    the gentleman criminal who had money and influence and with their help evaded
    the grip of justice.</p>

    A Man Must Act As He Thinks Best</b></h2>
  <p>Louisa knew the flat in Exhibition Road very well. She had helped Edie to
    furnish it, and to make it pretty and cosey, for Edie&rsquo;s passion was
    for dogs and for golf; drawing-room chairs and saucepans were not much in
    her line. So Louisa had chosen practically everything&mdash;the piano, as
    well as the coal-scuttles, and every stick of furniture in Luke&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>To-night she went up the well-known stairs very slowly: she ached so in
    every limb that she could scarcely walk. She seemed to have aged twenty years
    in two days.</p>
  <p>Edie was sitting alone in the pretty drawing room buried in a capacious
    arm-chair, her hands folded before her. The room was in darkness save for
    the glow of the firelight. She jumped up when Colonel Harris and Louisa were
    announced and the neat servant in black dress and smart cap and apron switched
    on the electric light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said poor little Edie impetuously, &ldquo;I am so thankful
    you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ran up to Louisa and put her arms round her, kissing her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do come and sit with me,&rdquo; she continued, loath to relinquish
    Colonel Harris&rsquo;s hand after she had shaken it, &ldquo;I feel that in
    this solitude I shall go dotty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst she spoke, she detached with nervous, febrile movements Louisa&rsquo;s
    fur from round her neck, and dragged the older woman nearer to herself and
    to the fire. Then she threw herself down on the hearth rug, squatting there
    in front of the fire, with nervy fingers picking at the fringe of the rug.
    Her cheeks were red and blotchy with traces of recent tears, her hair, towzled
    and damp, clung to her moist temples. Suddenly she burst into a torrent of
    weeping.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lou! what does it all mean?&rdquo; she exclaimed between heavy
    sobs.  &ldquo;What does it all mean? They say Luke has murdered that odious
    Philip! and I have been cooped up here for two days now, not daring to go
    out! ashamed to face any one! and Luke&mdash;Luke&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The outburst was almost hysterical. The young girl was obviously fearfully
    overwrought, and had endured a severe nerve-strain by not having the means
    of giving vent to her feelings. Colonel Harris, with all an Englishman&rsquo;s
    horror of feminine scenes, was clearing his throat, looking supremely uncomfortable
    all the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sh!&mdash;sh!&rdquo; admonished Louisa impatiently, &ldquo;be quiet,
    Edie, you mustn&rsquo;t go on like that! Be quiet now!&rdquo; she added more
    severely seeing that the girl made no effort to control herself. &ldquo;What
    will your servants think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; retorted Edie, &ldquo;that I care what they
    think? They can&rsquo;t think more, can they? when they all talk of Luke
    as if he were a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do for God&rsquo;s sake be silent, Edie. This is too awful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Louisa, almost roughly, dragged herself away from the girl&rsquo;s hysterical
    embrace. She had tried so hard for two days and two nights to keep herself
    together, and her nerves in check. All day to-day had been one long con tinuous
    battle against the danger of &ldquo;breaking down,&rdquo; that bugbear of
    the conventional woman of the world.</p>
  <p>Now this danger, backed up by this poor child&rsquo;s grief, loomed greater
    than ever, now&mdash;now&mdash;that &ldquo;breaking down&rdquo; would become
    a positive sin, the most abject form of cowardice. But Edie&rsquo;s bewilderment,
    her loneliness, were intensely pathetic. Louisa had tried to be severe, and
    insisted on checking the access of hysteria, but her heart went out to the
    child, and to her puzzlement in face of this awful, un-understandable riddle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Edie,&rdquo; she said gently, putting her own kind arms
    round the quaking shoulders of the younger girl, &ldquo;you are just going
    to show father and me how brave you can be. You are Luke&rsquo;s nearest
    and dearest one on earth; you must not add to his troubles by this exaggerated
    show of grief. We&rsquo;ll all have to be brave&mdash;all of us&mdash;but
    Luke will have to be the bravest of us all, and so we must all do our best
    to keep up our courage, and help his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was not accustomed to making such long speeches, nor yet to preach and
    to admonish. Life, before now, had never placed her in the necessity of admonishing
    others: everybody round her&mdash;the people with whom she came in contact
    always behaved very much as they should&mdash;in the proper conventional
    worldly manner. People she had hitherto to do with, did not give way to hysterical
    tears, nor had they occasion to display fortitude in the face of an overwhelming
    moral shock.</p>
  <p>Therefore Louisa was not sure if her words would carry weight, or if they
    would produce the effect she desired. She gazed anxiously at Edie whilst
    she spoke, looking with hopeful yet fearful eyes in the poor girl&rsquo;s
    face, wondering if she had succeeded in calming the hysterical outburst.</p>
  <p>Edie hung her head, wilfully veiling her eyes beneath the drooping lids.
    She twirled her gossamer handkerchief into a tight wet ball and toyed with
    it nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much good,&rdquo; she said at last, in very low tones
    so that Louisa had some difficulty in hearing what she said, &ldquo;my trying
    to be brave&mdash;when Luke is such a coward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Edie,&rdquo; retorted Louisa, all her kindness and sympathy
    gone, and pushing the girl roughly away from her. &ldquo;You have no right
    to talk like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Colonel Harris,&rdquo; rejoined Edie, turning to the man in
    her distress,  &ldquo;I ask you, if it isn&rsquo;t just cowardice to run
    away now, and leave me and Jim to face the whole thing alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To run away? What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Louisa, placing her
    hand on the girl&rsquo;s shoulder, forcing her to turn round and to face
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s running away?&rdquo; queried Colonel Harris with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; said Edie hotly, &ldquo;is running away. He came home
    just now, and calmly told me that he was going off abroad to-night, and since
    then he has been shut up in his room, packing his things. I have been all
    alone here all day. Jim won&rsquo;t be home till late to-night. Poor old
    Jim! what a fearful home-coming it will be for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But to this renewal of Edie&rsquo;s lamentations, Louisa had not listened,
    only to the words: &ldquo;Luke said that he was going abroad to-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Luke&mdash;fugitive from justice! The monstrous, unbelievable picture which
    she had tried to visualize just now had become a mirror reflecting awful,
    hideous reality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Luke?&rdquo; asked the colonel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better
    see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; interposed Louisa quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner
    speak to Luke. Can I go to him, Edie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
    that he has locked his door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louisa,&rdquo; said her father gently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
    you&rsquo;ll be doing any good, dear. A man must act as he thinks best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;going to interfere with
    Luke&rsquo;s plans. I only want to speak to him. Don&rsquo;t bother, Edie.
    I know my way.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
    If You Would Only Let Yourself Go</b></h2>
  <p>Luke was sitting at a desk, writing, when Louisa entered his room. Only
    one lamp shaded with yellow silk hung above the desk, throwing golden light
    on paper and blotting pad and on the hand which held the pen.</p>
  <p>When Luke turned at the sound of the opening door his face remained in deep
    shadow. He could not of course see her distinctly, as her figure was silhouetted
    against the light in the passage behind her; that was no doubt the reason
    why he did not rise to greet her when she entered, but remained seated at
    his desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I come in, Luke?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was just writing to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then give me your unfinished letter, and tell me what else you were
    going to write.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I had only got as far as your name,&rdquo; he said, pointing
    to the empty page before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it so difficult then,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to tell me everything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had come forward into the room, and stood beside his desk, one hand
    resting upon it, her face looking down at the letter which he had not yet
    begun to write. He still made no attempt to rise, for now her face was in
    full golden light, and he could see its every feature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is so difficult,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not to write drivel when
    one is saying good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are going abroad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This last question came abruptly, in harsh, trenchant tones, altogether
    different to those of her smooth contralto voice. He turned his eyes away
    from her face, and looked down at his own hands, which were clasped in front
    of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replied without the slightest hesitation, &ldquo;I
    cannot face what lies before me if I remain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For many reasons. There&rsquo;s Uncle Rad to consider first and foremost,
    then Edie, and Jim, and Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have they to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything. After the evidence at the inquest to-day a warrant will
    be out for my arrest within the next few hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The evidence against me is overwhelming. I should be tried, perhaps
    hanged, for murder, at best sent to penal servitude for life. I cannot chance
    that. I must think of Uncle Rad, of Edie, of Jim and of Frank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have yourself to think of first and foremost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he retorted simply, &ldquo;I have thought of myself,
    and I do not see how with my own dagger-stick brought up in evidence against
    me, and my ill-feeling toward &mdash;toward the dead man so well-known, I
    can possibly escape condemnation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke in such even and perfectly natural tones, that just for a moment&mdash;it
    was a mere flash&mdash;Louisa wondered if he were absolutely sane. It seemed
    impossible that any man could preserve such calm in face of the most appalling
    fate that ever threatened human being. She, too, like the indifferent, hide-bound
    official this afternoon was seized with an irrepressible desire to break
    through that surface of ice. The outer covering must be very thin, she thought;
    her presence must have melted all the coldness that lay immediately below
    the surface. Without saying another word, quietly and simply she came down
    on her knees. Her skirts had not swished as she did so, not a sound from
    her revealed the movement. When he looked up again, her face was on a level
    with his, and her eyes&mdash;those great luminous eyes that shed no tears
    at moments such as this&mdash;looked straight into his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, Lou,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make
    a drivelling coward of me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he rose, pushing his chair aside, leaving her there, kneeling beside
    the desk, humbled and helpless. And he retreated within the shadow of the
    room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said, imploring him, &ldquo;you are going to tell
    me all that troubles you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied curtly, &ldquo;troubles me. You are wasting
    your sympathy, you know. And I have a train to catch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not going, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You condemn yourself for a crime which you have not committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am already as good as condemned. But I do not choose to hang for
    the murder of the Clapham bricklayer&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed. It almost sounded like a natural laugh&mdash;would have done
    so, no doubt, to all ears except hers. Then he added dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such a purposeless crime too. Fancy being hanged for killing Paul
    Baker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to realize
    how you are hurting me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One ejaculation, &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; escaped him then. He stood quite
    still, in the shadow, and presently his hand wandered with the old familiar
    gesture down the smooth back of his head. She remained on her knees and after
    awhile he came back to her, and sat down on the chair beside the desk, his
    eyes on a level with hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Lou,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I have got to go and
    that&rsquo;s all about it. I have got to, do you understand? The consequences
    of this crime cannot be faced&mdash;not by any one&mdash;not by me. There&rsquo;s
    Uncle Rad to think of first. He is broken and ill; he has more than one foot
    in the grave. The trial and the scandal couldn&rsquo;t be kept from him;
    it would be bound to leak out sooner or later. It would be too big a scandal,
    and it would kill him outright. Then, you see, Lou, it would never do! I
    should be Earl of Radclyffe and a felon&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t do, now would
    it? Who has ever heard of a peer undergoing a life sentence&mdash;or being
    hanged? It wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;you know it wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reiterated this several times, with quaint insistence, as if he were
    discussing with her the possibility or impossibility of attending a race
    meeting, or a ball in Lent, she proving obstinate.</p>
  <p>She did not reply, leaving him to ramble on in his somewhat wild speech,
    hoping that if she let him talk on uninterruptedly, he would sooner or later
    betray something of that enigma which lay hidden behind the wooden mask which
    he still so persistently wore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he continued, still arguing, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    Frank to think of&mdash;the next heir to the title. I believe that people
    in penal servitude live an unconscionable time&mdash;especially if they are
    wanted to die. Think of poor old Frank waiting to come into his own&mdash;into
    an old title held by a felon. It is all much too much of a muddle, Lou. It
    is simpler that I should go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, really trying now to speak as simply, as calmly
    as he did himself, &ldquo;all these arguments which you are using now, Luke,
    will equally apply if you make yourself a fugitive from justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t be that for very long!&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are thinking of suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied simply, &ldquo;I am not. Only of the chances
    of a wandering life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to look at every chance, Luke, except one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which one is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That though you might be arrested, though you might be accused and
    even tried for the murder of&mdash;of that man&mdash;truth might come out,
    and your innocence proved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would be impossible, Lou,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;in Heaven&rsquo;s name, Luke!&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately, &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dagger-stick was found inside the railings of the park&mdash;and
    the stains on it are irrefutable proofs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only circumstantial evidence,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;you
    can demolish it, if you choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I should plead guilty&mdash;Mr.
    Dobson says that if I plead guilty, counsel can plead extenuating circumstances&mdash;intense
    provocation and so forth&mdash;and I might get a more lenient sentence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said, looking him straight in the face, compelling
    his eyes to meet hers, for in their clear depths she meant to read the truth,
    to compel the truth at last. He had never lied in his life. If he lied now
    she would know it, she would read it in his face. &ldquo;Luke! you are shielding
    some one by taking the crime on your own shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But his eyes remained perfectly clear and steady as they gazed straight
    into hers. There was not a shadow in them, not a quiver, as he replied quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Lou, I am shielding no one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was you who killed that man&mdash;Philip de Mountford&mdash;or
    Paul Baker&mdash;whoever he may be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he answered her firmly, looking steadily into her face:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said nothing more then, but rose to her feet, and went quite close up
    to him. With a gesture that had no thought of passion in it, only sublime,
    motherly love, she took Luke&rsquo;s head in both her hands and pressed it
    to her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My poor old Luke!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>She smoothed his hair as a mother does to an afflicted child; the motherly
    instinct was up in arms now, even fighting the womanly, the passionate instinct
    of a less selfless love. She bent down and kissed his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;it would do you such a lot of
    good if you would only let yourself go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had contrived to get hold of her hands: those hands which he loved so
    dearly, with their soft, rose-tinted palms and the scent of sweet peas which
    clung to them. His own hot fingers closed on those small hands. She stood
    before him, tall, elegant&mdash;not beautiful! Louisa Harris had never been
    beautiful, nor yet a fairy princess of romance&mdash;only a commonplace woman!
    A woman of the world, over whose graceful form, her personality even, convention
    invariably threw her mantle&mdash;but a woman for all that&mdash;with a passion
    burning beneath the crust of worldly <i>sang-froid</i>&mdash;with heart attuned
    to feel every quiver, every sensation of joy and of pain. A woman who loved
    with every fibre in her&mdash;who had the supreme gift of merging self in
    Love&mdash;of giving all, her soul, her heart, her mind and every thought&mdash;a
    woman who roused every chord of passion in a man&rsquo;s heart&mdash;the
    woman whom men adore!</p>
  <p>And now as Luke de Mountford held her hands, and she stood close beside
    him, her breath coming and going in quick gasps, with the suppressed excitement
    of latent self-sacrifice, her eyes glowing and tearless, he half slid from
    the chair on which he was sitting, and one knee was on the ground, and his
    face turned up to hers.</p>
  <p>He almost smiled, as she repeated, with a little sigh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you would only let yourself go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I would let myself dwindle down to the level of drivelling fools,&rdquo;  he
    said. &ldquo;God knows, Lou, it would be easy enough now, when I hold those
    lovely little hands of yours, and the scent of sweet peas which comes from
    your dear self reminds me of summer, of old-fashioned gardens of enduring
    peace. Lou! I dare not even kiss your hands, and yet my whole body aches
    with the longing to press my lips on them. You see how easily I drift into
    being a drivelling fool? Would to God I could lie on the ground here before
    you, and feel the soles of your feet on my neck. How lucky slaves were in
    olden days, weren&rsquo;t they? They could kneel before their mistress and
    she would place her naked foot upon their necks. I am a drivelling fool,
    you see&mdash;I talk and talk and let the moments slip by&mdash;I am going,
    Lou, and this is the vision which I am taking with me, the last impression
    which will dwell in my memory, when memory itself will seem only a dream.
    You, Lou, standing just here, so close to me that your sweet breath fans
    my cheek, your dear hands in mine, the scent of sweet peas in my nostrils.
    The light of this lamp throws a golden radiance over you, your lips are quivering&mdash;oh!
    ever so slightly, and your eyes reveal to me the exquisiteness of your soul.
    Lou, I am a lucky mortal to have such a vision on which to let my memory
    dwell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She listened in silence, enjoying the delight of hearing him unburdening
    his soul at last. His love for her! Never had it seemed so great and so pure,
    now that he spoke of parting! And there was a quaint joy in hearing him thus
    rambling on&mdash;he, the reserved man of the world. Convention had so often
    sealed his lips, and restrained his passion when he was still wandering happily
    with her on the smooth paths of Love. Now Fate had hurled stone upon stone
    down that path. The way was rugged and difficult, parting too, was close
    at hand; all the restraint of past months tore at the barrier of convention.
    Luke about to lose the mortal presence of his love, allowed his lips to say
    that which he had hidden in his heart for so long. The man of the world lost
    himself in the man who loved.</p>
  <p>When he had ceased speaking she said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk, Luke, as if we were going to part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night, Lou. I must catch the night boat to Calais.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My luggage can be sent on,&rdquo; she rejoined simply. &ldquo;I am
    quite ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To start?&rdquo; he repeated vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Luke,&rdquo; she replied with a smile, &ldquo;if you go
    to-night, or at any time, I go with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot, Lou!&rdquo; he stammered, almost stupidly, feeling quite
    bewildered, for he had been forcibly dragged back from a happy dreamlike
    state, to one of impossible reality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have said it yourself, Lou. I shall be a fugitive from justice
    . . . a man with whom no decent woman would care to link her fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us admit then,&rdquo; she said almost gaily, &ldquo;that I am
    not a decent woman, for my fate is irretrievably linked with yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is preposterous . . .&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>But already she had interrupted him, speaking quietly in that even, contralto
    voice of hers which he loved to hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must try and understand. You must,
    because I have so fully made up my mind, that nothing that you could say
    would make me change it, unless you told me that you no longer loved me.
    And this,&rdquo; she added with the ghost of a smile, &ldquo;you cannot now
    pretend, Luke, after all that you said just now. It is not that my mind
    wanted making up. My mind has very little to do with it all. It knows just
    as my heart does that I could not now live without you. I&rsquo;m not talking
    nonsense, Luke, and I seem to be too old for mere sentimental twaddle; therefore,
    when I say that I could not now live parted from you, I say it from the innermost
    conviction of my heart. Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;dear,&rdquo; she whispered, seeing
    that he wished to interrupt her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try and say anything
    just yet&mdash;not just yet&mdash;until I have told you everything. I want
    you to remember, Luke, that I am no longer very young, and that ever since
    I can remember anything, I have loved you. I must have loved you even though
    I did not know it. But if you had never spoken of love to me, if you had
    never written that letter which I received in Brussels, I probably would
    have been satisfied to go on with my humdrum life to the end of time; who
    knows? I might have found contentment if not happiness, by and by with some
    other man. We women are meant to marry. Men are fond of telling us that our
    only mission on earth is to marry. But all this possible, quiet content one
    letter has dissipated. I could never be happy now, never, save in continuing
    to love you. Life to me would be unspeakably hideous without you and your
    love. Therefore, I say, Luke, that you have no longer any right to keep me
    at arm&rsquo;s length. You have no right, having once come into my life,
    having once given substance and vitality to my love, to withdraw yourself
    away from me. Love, dear, is a bond, a mutual bond, as sacred, as binding
    as any that are contracted on this earth. You&mdash;when you wrote that letter,
    when first you spoke to me of love&mdash;entered into a bond with me. You
    have no right to force me to break it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mellow tones of her contralto voice died down in the heavy atmosphere
    of the room. They echoed and re-echoed in the heart of the man, who was now
    kneeling before Louisa, as he would before the Madonna, dumb with the intensity
    of emotion which her simple words, the sublime selflessness of her sacrifice
    had brought to an almost maddening pitch. She stood there near him, so devoted,
    so noble, and so pure, do you wonder or will you smile, when you see him
    with fair, young head bowed to the ground pressing his lips on the point
    of her shoe?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke! don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried in passionate sympathy.</p>
  <p>She understood him so well, you see!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kiss your feet, dear?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I would lie down in
    the dust for your dear feet to walk over me. I only wonder why God should
    love me so that he gave you for this one beautiful moment to me. Lou, my
    dearest saint, I cannot accept your sacrifice. Dear heart! dear, dear heart!
    do try and believe me, when I say that I cannot accept it. As for imagining
    that I don&rsquo;t understand it and appreciate it, why as soon think that
    to-morrow&rsquo;s sun will never rise. I worship you, my saint! and I worship
    your love&mdash;the purest, most tender sentiment that ever glorified this
    ugly world. But its sacrifice I cannot accept. I cannot. I would sooner do
    that most cowardly of all deeds, end my life here and now, than be tempted
    for one single instant into the cowardice of accepting it. But the memory
    of it, dear, that I will take with me. Do not think of me in future as being
    unhappy. No man can be unhappy whose heart is fed on such a memory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had her two hands imprisoned in his, the scent of sweet peas floating
    gently to his nostrils. As he buried his lips in their fragrant soft palms
    he was entirely happy. The world had floated away from him. He was in a land
    of magic with her; in a land where the air was filled with the fragrance
    of sweet peas, a land of phantasmagoria, the land of Fata Morgana, which
    none can enter save those who love. Time sped on, and both had forgotten
    the world. The fire crackled in the hearth, the clock alone recorded the
    passing of time. The noise of the great city&mdash;so cruel to those who
    suffer&mdash;came but as faint echo through the closely drawn curtains.</p>
  <p>There was a discreet knock at the door, and as no reply came from within,
    it was repeated more insistently.</p>
  <p>Luke jumped to his feet, and Louisa retreated into the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Luke.</p>
  <p>The door was opened, quite softly from outside, and the well-drilled servant
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two gentlemen to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are they, Mary?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the hall, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they give their names?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Edie, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the drawing room, sir, with Colonel Harris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Then show the two gentlemen into the dining-room. I&rsquo;ll
    come in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the discreet little maid retired, closing the door after her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
    Which Speaks Only Of Farewells</b></h2>
  <p>The door had scarcely closed, and already she was near him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she whispered, and her voice was hoarse now and choked, &ldquo;the
    police!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought that they
    meant to let me get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So father understood from Sir Thomas Ryder. What will you do, Luke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything, I am afraid. I wanted to get away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I have kept you&mdash;and now it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A very little while ago she had hated the idea of his going. Luke&mdash;a
    fugitive from justice&mdash;was a picture on which it was intolerable to
    look. But now the womanly instinct rose up in revolt, at the very thought
    that he should be arrested, tried, and condemned! What mattered if he were
    a fugitive, if he were ostracized and despised? what mattered anything so
    long as he lived and she could be near him? A very little while ago, she
    would have done anything to keep him from going; she almost longed for his
    arrest and the publicity of the trial. She was so sure that truth would surely
    come out, that his innocence would of necessity be proved.</p>
  <p>But now, woman-like, she only longed for his safety, and forgetting all
    the tradition of her past life, all the old lessons of self-restraint, forgetting
    everything except his immediate danger, she clung to him with all the true
    passion in her, which she no longer tried to keep in check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Luke,&rdquo; she murmured in quick, jerky tones, &ldquo;it is
    not too late&mdash;not at all too late. You stay in here quietly and I&rsquo;ll
    ask father to go and speak to them. He&rsquo;ll tell them that you haven&rsquo;t
    come home yet, and that he is waiting here for you himself. Father is well
    known; they won&rsquo;t suspect him of shielding you; and in the meanwhile
    you can slip out easily; we&rsquo;ll send your luggage on. You can write
    and let us know where you are&mdash;it is quite easy&mdash;and not too late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whilst she spoke, she was gradually edging toward the door. Her voice had
    sunk to a hoarse whisper, for maddening terror almost deprived her of speech.
    With insistent strength she would not allow him to detain her, and he, whilst
    trying to hold her back, was afraid of hurting her. But at the last when
    she had almost reached the door, he contrived to forestall her, and before
    she could guess his purpose he had pressed a finger on the button of the
    electric bell.</p>
  <p>She heard the distant tinkle of the bell, and this made her pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Luke?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why did you ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For your father, dear,&rdquo; he replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you will do what I want you to?&rdquo; she rejoined eagerly, &ldquo;you
    will go away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave no immediate answer, for already the maid&rsquo;s footstep was heard
    along the passage. The next moment she was knocking at the door. Luke went
    up to it, gently forcing Louisa back into the shadow behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, with his hand on the latch of the door, holding
    it slightly ajar, &ldquo;just ask Colonel Harris to come here, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl was heard turning away, and walking back briskly along the passage.
    Then Luke faced Louisa once again.</p>
  <p>He went up to her and without a word took her in his arms. It was a supreme
    farewell and she knew it. She felt it in the quiver of agony which went right
    through him as he pressed her so close&mdash;so close that her breath nearly
    left her body and her heart seemed to stand still. She felt it in the sweet,
    sad pain of the burning kisses with which he covered her face, her eyes,
    her hair, her mouth. It was the final passionate embrace, the irrevocable
    linking of soul and heart and mind, the parting of earthly bodies, the union
    of immortal souls. It was the end of all things earthly, the beginning of
    things eternal.</p>
  <p>She understood and her resistance vanished. All that had been dark to her
    became suddenly transfigured and illumined. With the merging of earthly passion
    into that Love which is God&rsquo;s breath, she&mdash;the pure and selfless
    woman, God&rsquo;s most perfect work on earth&mdash;became as God, and knew
    what was good and what had been evil.</p>
  <p>Neither of them spoke; the word &ldquo;farewell&rdquo; was not uttered between
    them. His final kiss was upon her eyes, and she closed them after that, the
    better to imprint on her memory the vision of his face lit up with the divine
    fire of an unconquerable passion.</p>
  <p>The entrance of Colonel Harris brought them both back to present reality.
    He, poor man, looked severely troubled, and distinctly older than he usually
    did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you want me, Luke?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;the police are here,
    and I thought that perhaps you and Louisa would be so kind as to take Edie
    along with you. Jim is going to sleep in barracks to-night, and Edie ought
    not to stay here alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ll take Edie,&rdquo; said the colonel curtly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
    be all right with us. Are you ready, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>And she passed out of the door without another word, or another look.</p>
  <p>The supreme farewell had been spoken. Further words&mdash;even another kiss&mdash;would
    have almost desecrated its undying memory.</p>
  <p>The two men remained alone, and Colonel Harris without any hesitation held
    out his hand to Luke de Mountford.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police are here, sir,&rdquo; said Luke, without taking the hand
    that was offered him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know they are,&rdquo; muttered the other, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no
    reason why you should refuse an old friend&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Luke&mdash;hesitating no longer&mdash;placed his burning hand in
    that of his friend, Colonel Harris said quietly, almost entreatingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a temporary trouble, eh, my boy? You can easily refute
    this abominable charge, and prove your innocence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think not, sir,&rdquo; replied Luke. &ldquo;I cannot refute the
    charge and my innocence will be difficult to prove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you are mad, man!&rdquo; retorted the older man hotly. &ldquo;You
    are mad! and are breaking a woman&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me for that, sir. It is the greatest crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris smothered a powerful oath. Luke&rsquo;s attitude puzzled
    him more and more. And his loyalty had received such a succession of shocks
    to-day that it would have been small wonder if it had begun to totter at
    last.</p>
  <p>He turned away without another word. But at the door he paused once more&mdash;in
    obvious hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else I can do for you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you were not thinking&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of what, sir?&rdquo; asked Luke.</p>
  <p>Then as he saw the other man&rsquo;s eyes wandering to the drawer of the
    desk, he said simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of suicide, you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; rejoined Luke. And he added after a slight pause: &ldquo;Not
    at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that I shouldn&rsquo;t exactly hang for the murder of the
    Clapham bricklayer. I shouldn&rsquo;t let it come to that. I am sorry I did
    not manage to get away to-night. I thought they meant to let me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think they did mean to. Some blunder I suppose on the part of the
    subordinates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Luke,&rdquo; said Colonel Harris with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I
    have known you ever since you were a child, but, by G&mdash;d, man! I confess
    that I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kindly put, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Luke with the
    semblance of a smile. &ldquo;You have every right to call me a confounded
    blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall only do that after your trial, my boy,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;When
    I have heard you confess with your own lips that you killed that d&mdash;d
    scoundrel in a moment of intense provocation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had better not keep the police waiting any longer, sir, had I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! that&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll take my poor Lou away
    at once, and we&rsquo;ll see after Edie, and Jim&mdash;we&rsquo;ll look after
    them&mdash;and Frank, too, when he comes home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;long my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Colonel Harris&mdash;puzzled, worried, and miserable&mdash;finally went
    out of the room. On the threshold he turned, moved by the simple and primitive
    instinct of wishing to take a last look at a friend.</p>
  <p>He saw Luke standing there in the full light of the electric lamp, calm,
    quite serene, correct to the last in attitude and bearing. The face was just
    a mask&mdash;marble-like and impassive&mdash;jealously guarding the secrets
    of the soul within. Just a good-looking, well-bred young Englishman in fact,
    who looked in his elegant attire ready to start off for some social function.</p>
  <p>Not a single trace either on his person or in his neat, orderly surroundings
    of the appalling tragedy which would have broken the spirit of any human
    creature, less well-schooled in self-restraint.</p>
  <p>Convention was triumphant to the end.</p>
  <p>The man of the world&mdash;the English gentleman, hypocritical or unemotional?
    which?&mdash;was here ready to face abject humiliation and hopeless disgrace
    as impassively as he would have received the welcome of an hostess at a dinner-party.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
    Which Tells Of Pictures In The Fire</b></h2>
  <p>It did not take poor little Edie very long to get her things on and to make
    ready to go away with Colonel Harris and with Louisa. Something of the truth
    had to be told to her, and we must do her the justice to state that when
    she understood the full strength of the calamity which had befallen her and
    Luke, something of her brother&rsquo;s calm dignity showed itself in her
    own demeanour.</p>
  <p>She pulled herself together with remarkable vigour, and before Mary, the
    maid, she contrived to behave just as if nothing of great importance had
    occurred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to dine out to-night, Mary,&rdquo; she said quite calmly, &ldquo;and
    I mayn&rsquo;t be home until sometime to-morrow. So don&rsquo;t sit up for
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, miss,&rdquo; replied Mary demurely, who kept her own counsel,
    like the well-drilled, good-class servant that she was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And tell cook that Mr. de Mountford won&rsquo;t be in either, nor
    Mr. Jim. I&rsquo;ll see her to-morrow and let her know when we all come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, miss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa gave ungrudging admiration, and whispered praise to the young girl.
    She was proud of Edie&rsquo;s behaviour, and grateful to her too. This atmosphere
    of reserve did her good. She could not have endured a scene of weeping, and
    keep her own nerves in check all the while.</p>
  <p>It was close upon eight o&rsquo;clock when at last they reached the Langham
    Hotel. Colonel Harris ordered the dinner to be served in the private sitting
    room. Of course none of them could eat anything. Their inward thoughts were
    following Luke de Mountford along that weary Calvary which he had set himself
    to mount.</p>
  <p>Soon after dinner Edie elected to go to bed. The poor child had a vague
    desire to be alone, and also a vague, unhappy feeling that she was in the
    way. She was quite woman enough now to understand how much more acutely Louisa
    Harris must be suffering, than she was herself, and since she&mdash;the sister&mdash;longed
    for solitude, how much keener must be that longing in the heart of the woman
    who loved and had lost Luke.</p>
  <p>So she went quietly off to bed. Louisa kissed her with real affection. Edie
    seemed like something of Luke: like a tender bequest made by a dying man.</p>
  <p>After that she herself said &ldquo;good night&rdquo; to her father. Colonel
    Harris was obviously in such acute distress that Louisa felt that, above
    all things, he must have the companionship of those of his own sex. The atmosphere
    of woman&rsquo;s sorrow was essentially bad for him. He was not a young man,
    and the last two days had tried him very severely. Louisa hoped that if she
    pretended to go to bed early, he would perhaps be induced to go to his club
    for an hour.</p>
  <p>If he only sat there for an hour, reading the papers, and nodding to his
    many friends, it would take him out of himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am very tired, dear,&rdquo; she said, after she had seen Edie safely
    tucked up amongst the blankets. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll follow Edie&rsquo;s
    good example. It&rsquo;s no use sitting here, staring into the fire. Is it,
    dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of use, Lou. And I suppose you would like to be alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go to bed, dear, unless you go to the club.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Lou. It seems the right thing to do, doesn&rsquo;t it?
    You go to bed, and I&rsquo;ll go to the club for an hour. As you say, it&rsquo;s
    no use sitting staring into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her room gave on one side of the sitting room, and her father&rsquo;s on
    the other. She waited until Colonel Harris went away, having helped him on
    with his overcoat. After he left she felt a little twinge of remorse. The
    night was cold and raw and he really had not wanted to go out. He would have
    been quite willing to sit in front of the fire, smoking and reading. He had
    only gone because his own innate kindliness and tact had suggested to him
    that Louisa wished to remain alone.</p>
  <p>He too, like Edie, felt a little in the way. His daughter&rsquo;s grief
    was of a nature that a father&rsquo;s love cannot soothe. The greatest solace
    for it now would be solitude. So, in spite of the fog, in spite of the unpleasantness
    that met Colonel Harris on every page of every newspaper, he sallied out
    of the hotel and got into a hansom, with the avowed intention of spending
    a couple of hours at his club.</p>
  <p>Louisa left alone in the sitting room, in front of the cheery fire, sat
    down for a moment on the sofa and rested her head against the cushions. There
    was memory even in that, for when she closed her eyes, she could imagine
    that Luke was sitting at the foot of the sofa; she could see him almost,
    with his eyes turned ever toward her, and that quaint gesture of his when
    he passed his hand over the back of his neatly groomed head.</p>
  <p>The memory was intolerable now. She rose&mdash;restless and feverish&mdash;and
    stood by the fire, one hand on the high mantel-shelf, her forehead resting
    against that hand, one foot on the fender, and her aching eyes gazing into
    the red hot glow.</p>
  <p>It was one of those big red fires, partly made up of coke and partly of
    coal, wherein only here and there tiny blue flames flit waywardly, and in
    the building up of which hotel servants are usually past masters. The glowing
    coal heaped up high in the old-fashioned grate presented a wonderful picture
    of mysterious architecture: streets and lanes of crimson incandescence, palaces
    and towers of molten heat, and the little blue flames dancing and peeping
    out from the fiery depths, mocking and wayward, twirling and twisting as
    with the joy of life.</p>
  <p>Louisa gazed into this city of brilliant crimson and gold, the streets,
    the palaces, and the towers. And as she gazed&mdash;with eyes almost seared&mdash;these
    same streets of fire assumed different shapes; they became stately and wide,
    with rows of trees forming an avenue along the middle, and tall houses on
    either side. One or two people were walking along the pavement, but quickly,
    as if they had business to transact and did not care to loiter. One figure,
    that of a woman, in neat ulster and serviceable hat&mdash;was walking briskly
    between the row of trees.</p>
  <p>The blue flames danced, and disclosed a few vehicles hurrying past swiftly
    in the night, huge tramways lumbering along, and one or two flying motor
    cabs. And far ahead &mdash;right in the heart of the glow&mdash;the distant
    lights of a more busy thoroughfare. Now the wide street was more dark and
    lonely than before, only the solitary female figure appeared in the fiery
    picture, walking among the trees. The last of the lumbering tramways had
    been merged in the distant lights: only from afar came flying on the blue
    flames, a taxicab at lightning speed.</p>
  <p>It came along, its headlights burning more and more brightly, it rattled
    past the solitary female pedestrian. Then it stopped in the dark angle made
    by a huge piece of coal: the blue flames gave a hiss and from every corner
    of the grate crowds of people came rushing to the spot where the taxicab
    had halted. The solitary female pedestrian also hurried to the spot. She
    stopped on the outskirts of the crowd, and yet she saw everything that went
    on in and round the motor, the horror-stricken driver, the bustling gendarmes,
    the huddled up mass in the darkest corner of the vehicle.</p>
  <p>Then the coal, consumed by its own power, fell together in a formless heap
    and the picture vanished. Louisa closed her eyes, for the heat in them was
    intolerable. But only for a moment: for now her mind was made up.</p>
  <p>Ever since she had parted from Luke, one thought had been dominant in her
    mind, one memory had obtruded itself beyond all others, taking definite shape
    in the visions conjured up by the glowing embers of the fire&mdash;that night
    in Brussels!&mdash;the great unforgettable night, on which her whole life&rsquo;s
    history seemed to find its birth-time.</p>
  <p>One great resolve, too, had now taken definite shape.</p>
  <p>Louisa rang for her maid, and asked for hat and cloak. The maid&mdash;somewhat
    horrified that her mistress should think of going out alone at so late an
    hour&mdash;was too well drilled to offer advice or make comment. She brought
    a warm wrap and a closely fitting, simple hat, and respectfully wished to
    know when she should expect her mistress home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In about an hour&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; said Louisa. &ldquo;Come down
    into the hall with me, and tell the porter to call me a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she went down, accompanied by her maid. A cab was called, and she directed
    the driver to 56 Chester Terrace.</p>
  <p>The address was that of Lady Ryder&rsquo;s town house. The maid&mdash;feeling
    more satisfied&mdash;went up stairs again.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
    People Don&rsquo;t Do That Sort Of Thing</b></h2>
  <p>Lady Ryder was out of town. She was staying at a country house in the Midlands,
    chaperoning her nieces&mdash;Louisa&rsquo;s twin-sisters&mdash;but Sir Thomas
    Ryder was at home.</p>
  <p>It was for him that Louisa had asked when the butler opened the door in
    answer to her ring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas is in the library, miss,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Will
    you come into the drawing room? and I&rsquo;ll tell Sir Thomas you are here,
    miss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t announce me. I&rsquo;ll go
    to the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas put down the paper which he had been reading, when his niece
    entered. He did not seem at all astonished to see her. No doubt the exercise
    of his profession had taught him never to be surprised at anything in life.
    He rose when he recognized who it was, and carefully folded his eyeglasses
    and slipped them into their case and into his waistcoat pocket. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Louisa, this is quite unexpected! Is your father with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I came alone. May I sit down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear child,&rdquo; he said genially, and himself wheeled
    a capacious arm-chair round to the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not disturbing you, Uncle Ryder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Take off your cloak, won&rsquo;t you? I was only at the evening
    paper, preparatory to turning in early.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She glanced at the paper on the table: that page was uppermost that bore
    the startling headline, in unusually large type: &ldquo;The Murder in the
    Taxicab. Sensational Developments.&rdquo; The chief of the Criminal Investigation
    Department studied the accounts in the newspapers, the opinion of pressmen
    and reporters. Everything interested him: he weighed everything in his mind;
    no silly advice, no empty tittle-tattle, was ever dismissed by him without
    its due meed of consideration.</p>
  <p>Uncle and niece now sat opposite each other, facing the hearth. He looked
    straight into the fire, knowing that she would not wish him to see the misery
    in her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you have something, Lou?&rdquo; he asked kindly. &ldquo;A cup
    of tea or something?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, uncle. We had dinner, and father has gone to the club.
    I came to see you about Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All along,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;ever since father saw you
    yesterday, I wanted to speak to you. Silly conventionality kept me back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It certainly is not usual&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she broke in quickly, &ldquo;I know it is not. But this
    is an unusual case, far too serious for silly ideas of tact or convention
    to creep in. The man whom I love best in all the world is falsely accused
    of a most abominable crime. He was arrested&mdash;by your orders I suppose&mdash;about
    an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put up his hand in gentle deprecation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop a moment, my dear,&rdquo; he said quite kindly, but very decisively.  &ldquo;If
    you have any idea at the back of your head, that I, personally, have any
    influence at my command with regard to Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s fate, then
    the sooner you get that idea out of your head the better. If you came here
    to-night with the notion that by pleading with me you could save Luke from
    the consequences of his crime, then get that notion out of your head, my
    dear, and save us both from a very painful interview. Luke de Mountford was
    not arrested by my orders: I am only an automaton of the law, which takes
    its own course, without any personal interference on my part. Officially
    I&mdash;as an automaton&mdash;did just as duty and the law of this country
    directs. Personally, I sent through your father some sound advice to Luke
    de Mountford.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She listened, impassive and silent, to his reproof, and then said simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Uncle Ryder: I must have expressed myself badly.
    I knew quite well that you, personally, bear no animosity against Luke: why,
    indeed, should you? I had no intention whatever, in coming to see you to-night,
    of making a scene of lamentation and supplication. On the contrary I knew
    quite well that&mdash;acting from the best of motives&mdash;you advised Luke
    to fly from justice, since in your opinion his condemnation is a foregone
    conclusion. Father hadn&rsquo;t the chance of passing your advice on to Luke,
    because when we got to Fairfax Mansions, Edie told us that he was packing
    up his things, meaning to catch the night boat to Calais.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why the dickens did he miss his train?&rdquo; exclaimed Sir
    Thomas gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not altogether his fault,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Our arrival
    delayed him a little, but he would have had plenty of time even then, only
    the police came, you see, and it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know. It was silly, officious blundering on the part of one of
    my subs. I meant de Mountford to have plenty of time to get away, and I could
    have managed it somehow to leave him unmolested if he kept some distance
    away from England. The whole thing has been most unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, uncle,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I
    am glad, very glad, that Luke has been arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; he retorted dryly. &ldquo;The outlook for him is
    not pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that. But at any rate now there is a chance that he can prove
    his innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas Ryder gave a quick sigh of impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;do try and be reasonable
    about that. You only lay up for yourself further stores of misery and of
    disappointment. De Mountford is guilty, I tell you. He practically confessed
    at the inquest, and he practically confessed to our fellows after his arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Practically,&rdquo; she said with strong emphasis, &ldquo;but not
    really. Luke has never confessed that he committed a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he admits that the stick with which the murder was done was
    his stick; that he had it in his hand the night that the murder was committed;
    that he went out, with it in his hand, five minutes before the other man
    was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;but let me tell you
    this, Uncle Ryder. Luke has admitted all that, as you say; but he has never
    admitted that he killed Philip de Mountford&mdash;or Paul Baker&mdash;whoever
    he may be. Luke, Uncle Ryder, is allowing the awful accusation to rest upon
    him, because he wishes to shield the real perpetrator of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; broke in Sir Thomas curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because, my dear Lou,&rdquo; he said slowly and firmly, &ldquo;people
    don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing. The consequences of having taken another
    person&rsquo;s life&mdash;otherwise a murder&mdash;are so terrible that no
    one will bear them for the sake of any one else on earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet I tell you, uncle,&rdquo; she reiterated with firmness at least
    equal to his own, &ldquo;that Luke never killed that man, and that he pleads
    guilty to the crime in order to shield some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom?&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I do not know&mdash;as yet. But that is the reason why I came
    here to-night, uncle: because you must help me to find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas abruptly rose from his chair, and took his stand on the hearth
    rug, with legs apart, and slender hands buried in the pockets of his trousers,
    in the attitude dear to every Englishman.</p>
  <p>His eyes in their framework of innumerable wrinkles looked down, not unkindly,
    at the pale, serious face of the girl before him.</p>
  <p>He, who was accustomed to give every scrap of advice, every senseless piece
    of title-tattle its just meed of attention, was not likely to leave unheeded
    the calm assertions of a woman for whom he had great regard, and who was
    the daughter of a brother officer and one of his best friends. Of course
    the girl was in love with de Mountford, so her judgment on him was not likely
    to be wholly unbiassed: at the same time Sir Thomas&mdash;like all men who
    have knocked about the world a great deal, and seen much of its seamy side&mdash;had
    a great belief in woman&rsquo;s instinct, as apart from her judgment, and
    he was the last man in the world to hold the sex in contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, my dear,&rdquo; he said after a little while, during which
    he had tried to read the lines in the interesting face turned up toward him, &ldquo;I
    honour you for your sense of loyalty to de Mountford, just the same as I
    honour your father for the like reason. And in order to prove to you that
    I, individually, would be only too happy to see the man&rsquo;s innocence
    established beyond a doubt, I am going to argue that soberly and sensibly
    with you. You hold the theory that Luke de Mountford is shielding some one
    from the consequences of an awful crime by taking the burden on himself.
    Now, my dear, as I told you before, people don&rsquo;t do that sort of thing
    nowadays. In olden times, the consequences of a crime&mdash;especially where
    the aristocracy was concerned&mdash;were quite picturesque: the Tower, the
    block, and all that sort of thing. But to-day the paraphernalia of vengeful
    justice is very sordid, very mean, and anything but glorious. It means the
    lengthy inquiry before a police magistrate, then the trial, the past dragged
    up to the light, the most private secrets thrown to the morbid curiosity
    of the million. In order to face that sort of thing, my dear, a man must
    be either guilty&mdash;then he cannot help it; or wrongfully accused&mdash;then
    he hopes for the establishment of his innocence. But a man does not prepare
    himself to face all that out of Quixotic motives alone, knowing himself to
    be innocent and because he desires that another should be spared those awful
    humiliations and the chance of a disgusting and shameful death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by all that, Uncle Ryder,&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that if we are going to admit this Quixotic motive in de Mountford&rsquo;s
    attitude now, there can only be one mainspring for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is perhaps a little difficult&mdash;&rdquo; he said somewhat hesitatingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she interposed quietly, &ldquo;that if Luke is taking
    this awful crime upon himself for the sake of another, that other can only
    be a woman whom he loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted Sir Thomas, &ldquo;it is not you, my dear,
    I presume, who killed this bricklayer from Clapham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not reply immediately: but her lips almost framed themselves into
    a smile. Luke and another woman! To Sir Thomas Ryder that seemed indeed a
    very simple explanation. Men have been known to do strange things, to endure
    much and to sacrifice everything for the sake of woman! But then Sir Thomas
    knew nothing of Luke, nothing more than what the latter chose to show of
    his inward self to the world. The memory of those few moments in the room
    in Fairfax Mansions laughed the other man&rsquo;s suggestion to scorn. Louisa
    shook her head and said simply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Uncle Ryder, I did not kill the Clapham bricklayer in the cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t admit that Luke may be shielding another woman?&rdquo; said
    Sir Thomas, with just the faintest semblance of a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; she replied gravely. &ldquo;You see,
    I don&rsquo;t really know. I would take a dying oath at this moment&mdash;if
    I were on the point of death&mdash;that Luke never committed that abominable
    crime. I won&rsquo;t even say that he is incapable of it. I&rsquo;ll only
    swear that he did not do it. And yet he is silent when he is accused. Then,
    to me, the only possible, the only logical conclusion is that he is shielding
    some one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you questioned him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put the question directly to him, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That his own stick condemns him, and that he would plead guilty at
    his trial.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never told you directly or indirectly that he killed the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the space of one second only did Louisa hesitate. She had asked Luke
    the direct question: &ldquo;Was it you who killed that man?&rdquo; and he
    had replied:  &ldquo;It was I.&rdquo; She had asked it then, determined to
    know the truth, convinced that she would know the truth when he gave reply.
    And she did learn the truth then and there, not as Luke hoped that she would
    interpret it, but as it really was. He had never really lied to her, for
    she had never been deceived. Now, she did not wish to hide anything from
    Sir Thomas Ryder, the only man in the whole world who could help her to prove
    Luke&rsquo;s innocence in spite of himself: therefore, when her uncle reiterated
    his question somewhat sharply, she replied quite frankly, looking straight
    up at him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He told me directly that it was he who had killed the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And even then you did not believe him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew that he tried to lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You firmly believe that de Mountford knows who killed that Paul Baker&mdash;or
    whoever he was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that he means to go through his trial, and to plead guilty to
    a charge of murder, so that the real criminal should escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that he is prepared to hang&mdash;to hang, mind you!&rdquo; reiterated
    Sir Thomas with almost cruel bluntness, &ldquo;if he is condemned in order
    to allow the real criminal to escape?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you yourself have no notion as to who this person maybe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there anybody, do you think, who is likely to know more about
    Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s past and present life than you do yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Lord Radclyffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Radclyffe?&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Lord Radclyffe adored Luke before this awful man came between
    them. He had him with him ever since Luke was a tiny boy. There&rsquo;s no
    one in the world for whom he cared as he cared for Luke, and the affection
    was fully reciprocated. My belief is that Lord Radclyffe knows more about
    Luke than any one else in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But old Rad is very ill just now, unfortunately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would kill him,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;if anything happened
    to Luke, whilst he was being coddled up as an invalid, almost as a prisoner,
    and no news allowed to reach him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas was silent for a moment, obviously buried in thought. That he
    was still incredulous was certainly apparent to Louisa&rsquo;s super-sensitive
    perceptions, but that he meant to be of help to her, in spite of this incredulity
    was equally certain. Therefore she waited patiently until he had collected
    his thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
    what I will do. To-morrow morning I&rsquo;ll go and see if I can have a talk
    with old Rad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; she broke in gravely, &ldquo;Luke will
    be dragged before the magistrate&mdash;the first stage of that awful series
    of humiliations which you yourself say, Uncle Ryder, that no man who is innocent
    can possibly endure!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, my dear,&rdquo; he said almost apologetically, &ldquo;but
    I don&rsquo;t see now how that can be avoided.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We could see Lord Radclyffe to-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nearly ten
    o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In matters of this sort, time does not count.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But old Rad is an invalid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may be a dead man to-morrow, if he hears that Luke&mdash;Luke,
    who was the apple of his eye, who is the heir to his name and title, is being
    dragged in open court before a police-magistrate, charged with an abominable
    crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the doctor, I understand, has forbidden him to see any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that the matter has passed the bounds of a doctor&rsquo;s
    orders. I would go and force my way into his presence without the slightest
    scruple. I know that any news that he may glean about Luke, within the next
    few days, will be far more fatal to him, than the few questions which I want
    to ask him to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That may be, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas dryly, &ldquo;but
    this does not apply to me. Old Rad is a very old friend of mine, but if I
    went with you on this errand to-night, I should be going not as a friend,
    but in an official capacity, and as such I cannot do it without the doctor&rsquo;s
    permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll ask Doctor
    Newington&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a little while yet Sir Thomas Ryder seemed to hesitate. Clearly the
    girl&rsquo;s arguments, her simple conviction, and her latent energy had
    made a marked impression upon him. He was no longer the sceptical hide-bound
    official: the man, the gentleman, was tearing away at the fetters of red
    tape. All the old instincts of chivalry, which at times might be dormant
    in the heart of an English gentleman&mdash;but which are always there nevertheless,
    hidden away by the mantle of convention&mdash;had been aroused by Louisa&rsquo;s
    attitude toward the man she loved, and also by the remembrance of Luke&rsquo;s
    bearing throughout this miserable business.</p>
  <p>After all what the girl asked was not so very difficult of execution. There
    are undoubtedly cases where the usual conventional formulas of etiquette
    must give way to serious exigencies. And there was unanswerable logic in
    Louisa&rsquo;s arguments: at any time in the near future that old Rad&mdash;either
    through his own obstinacy, or the stupidity or ill-will of a servant&mdash;got
    hold of a newspaper, the suddenness of the blow which he would receive by
    learning the terrible news without due preparation, would inevitably prove
    fatal to him. Sir Thomas Ryder prided himself on being a diplomatist of the
    first water: he did believe that he could so put the necessary questions
    to Lord Radclyffe, with regard to Luke, that the old man would not suspect
    the truth for a moment. The latter had, of course, known of the murder before
    he had been stricken with illness; he had at the time answered the questions
    put to him by the police officer, without seeming to be greatly shocked at
    the awful occurrence; and it was not likely that he would be greatly upset
    at a professional visit from an old friend, who at the same time had the
    unravelling of the murder mystery at heart.</p>
  <p>All these thoughts mirrored themselves on Sir Thomas&rsquo;s wrinkled face.
    He was taking no trouble to conceal them from Louisa. Soon she saw that she
    had won her first victory, for her uncle now said with sudden determination:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear! you have certainly got on the right side of me. Your
    aunt always said you had a very persuasive way with you. I&rsquo;ll tell
    you what we will do. It is now a quarter to ten&mdash;late enough, by Jingo!
    We&rsquo;ll get into one of those confounded taxis, and drive to Doctor Newington&rsquo;s.
    I&rsquo;ll see him. You shall stay in the cab; and if I can get his permission,
    we&rsquo;ll go and have a talk with old Rad&mdash;or rather I&rsquo;ll talk
    first and you shall pretend that our joint visit is only a coincidence. As
    a matter of fact he knew all about the murder before he got ill, and he won&rsquo;t
    think it at all unnatural that I have obtained special medical permission
    to question him myself on the subject. Then you must work in your questions
    about Luke as best you can afterward. Is that agreed now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed it is, Uncle Ryder,&rdquo; said Louisa, as she rose from her
    chair, with a deep sigh of infinite contentment. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she
    added gently, and placed her neatly gloved hand upon his arm.</p>
  <p>With a kind, fatherly gesture, he gave that little hand an encouraging pat.
    Then he rang the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A taxi&mdash;quickly!&rdquo; he said to his man. &ldquo;My fur coat
    and my hat. I am going out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa had gained her first victory. She had put forward neither violence
    nor passion in support of her arguments. Yet she had conquered because she
    believed.</p>
  <p>A few moments later she and Sir Thomas Ryder were on their way to Doctor
    Newington&rsquo;s in Hertford Street.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
    It Is One Human Life Against The Other</b></h2>
  <p>Once more Louisa was sitting in the dark corner of a cab, seeing London
    by night, as the motor flew past lighted thoroughfares, dark, narrow streets,
    stately mansions and mean houses. The same endless monotony of bricks and
    mortar, of pillars and railings; the same endless monotony of every-day life
    whilst some hearts were breaking and others suffered misery to which cruel,
    elusive death refused its supreme solace.</p>
  <p>She waited in the cab whilst Sir Thomas Ryder went in to see the doctor.
    Fortunately the latter was at home, and able to see Sir Thomas.</p>
  <p>At first he was obdurate. Nothing that the high officer of police could
    say would move his medical dictum. Lord Radclyffe was too ill to see any
    one. He was hardly conscious. His brain was working very feebly. He had not
    spoken for two days, for speech was difficult.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Doctor Newington in his habitual pompous manner, &ldquo;he
    had the least inkling now, that that favourite nephew of his was guilty of
    this awful murder, why, my dear sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t answer for the consequences.
    I believe the feeble bit of life in him would go out like a candle that&rsquo;s
    been blown upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who talks,&rdquo; retorted Sir Thomas somewhat impatiently, and assuming
    a manner at least as pompous as that of the fashionable physician, &ldquo;of
    letting Lord Radclyffe know anything about his nephew&rsquo;s position. I
    don&rsquo;t. I have no such intention. But de Mountford&rsquo;s plight is
    a very serious one. There are one or two points about his former life that
    Lord Radclyffe could elucidate if he will. I want your permission to ask
    him two or three questions. Hang it all, man, de Mountford&rsquo;s life is
    in danger! I don&rsquo;t think you have the right to oppose me in this. You
    take a most awful responsibility upon your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A medical man,&rdquo; said Doctor Newington vaguely, &ldquo;has to
    take upon himself certain grave responsibilities sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but not such a grave one as this. You must at least give me
    the chance of interrogating Lord Radclyffe. Supposing he knows something
    that may throw light on this awful affair, something that may go to prove
    de Mountford&rsquo;s innocence or guilt&mdash;either way&mdash;and suppose
    that owing to your prohibitions, all knowledge of his nephew&rsquo;s fate
    is kept from him until it is too late, until de Mountford is hanged&mdash;for
    he risks hanging, doctor, let me tell you that!&mdash;suppose that you have
    stood in the way, when some simple explanation from your patient might have
    saved him! What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the patient is too ill, I tell you. He wouldn&rsquo;t understand
    you, probably. I am sure he couldn&rsquo;t answer your questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor&rsquo;s original pompous manner had left him somewhat. He was
    now more like an obstinate man, arguing, than like a medical man whose pronouncements
    must be final. Sir Thomas Ryder&mdash;one of the keenest men to note such
    subtle changes in another&mdash;saw that he had gained an advantage. He was
    quick enough to press it home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me try at all events,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The whole matter
    is of such enormous importance! After all, doctor, it is a question of one
    human life against the other. With regard to de Mountford, let me tell you
    that unless we can get some very definite proof as to his innocence, it is
    bound to go hard with him. Say that a few weeks hence Lord Radclyffe, recovering
    from this severe illness, is confronted with the news that his nephew is
    being tried for murder, or that he has been condemned&mdash;I won&rsquo;t
    even mention the final awful possibility&mdash;do you think that you or any
    one will save the old man&rsquo;s life then, or his reason perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doctor Newington was silent for awhile. Clearly he was ready to give way.
    Like most men who outwardly are very pompous and dictatorial, his blustering
    was only veneer. The strong will power of a more determined intellect very
    soon reduced him to compliance. And all that Sir Thomas Ryder said was logical.
    It carried a great deal of conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the doctor at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
    you permission to interview my patient. But on two conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the interview takes place in my presence, and that at the first
    word from me, you cease questioning my patient, and leave his room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented Sir Thomas, without any hesitation, content
    that he had gained his point, and quite satisfied that the two conditions
    were perfectly reasonable and such that the doctor was really compelled to
    impose. &ldquo;I must tell you that I came to see you to-night at the in
    stance of my niece, Louisa Harris, who was fianc&eacute;e to de Mountford
    before this unfortunate business. It was she who adduced certain arguments
    which she placed before me, and which led to my strong desire to question
    Lord Radclyffe to-night, before de Mountford is brought up before the magistrate
    to-morrow. She is down below in the cab, waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot allow her to see my patient also,&rdquo; protested the doctor
    quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no. She shall not see him, unless you give permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send her home right away then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; retorted Sir Thomas tartly, &ldquo;you might give
    that permission, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The argument between the two men had lasted close on half an hour. It was
    long past ten o&rsquo;clock when at last Louisa saw them emerging through
    the lighted door-way. The next moment they were seated in the cab with her,
    Sir Thomas having given the chauffeur the address of Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s
    house in Grosvenor Square.</p>
  <p>The doctor tried to be bland and polite, but he was not over successful
    in this. He did not like being opposed, nor hearing his pronouncements combated.
    In this case he had been forced to give way, somewhat against his better
    judgment, and all the way in the cab he was comforting himself with the thought
    that at any rate he would keep women away from his patient, and that he would
    in any case cut the interview very short, and demand its abrupt cessation
    very peremptorily. He would then be backed up by two nurses, and we must
    do him the justice to say that he was honestly anxious about his patient.</p>
  <p>Louisa took no notice of the fashionable doctor&rsquo;s efforts at conversation.
    She preferred to remain quite silent for those few minutes which elapsed
    between the departure from Hertford Street and the arrival at the east side
    of Grosvenor Square. When she saw her uncle coming down the steps of the
    doctor&rsquo;s house in company with the doctor himself, she knew that the
    second victory had been won to-night: that Sir Thomas Ryder would be allowed
    to interview Lord Radclyffe. She had, of course, no suspicion of Doctor Newington&rsquo;s
    conditions to the interview, but the victory gained was an important one,
    and for the moment she was content.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38<br>
    The Hand Of Death Was On Him Too</b></h2>
  <p>A respectable looking butler opened the door in answer to Doctor Newington&rsquo;s
    pull at the bell.</p>
  <p>Luke had had time&mdash;on the day preceding the inquest&mdash;to put some
    semblance of order in his uncle&rsquo;s household. The doctor had sent in
    the nurses, and he had seen to a nice capable housekeeper being installed
    in the house. She took the further management at once in her own hands. She
    dismissed the drunken couple summarily and engaged a couple of decent servants&mdash;a
    butler and a cook.</p>
  <p>The house, though no less gloomy, looked certainly less lonely and neglected.</p>
  <p>Mr. Warren, who had been Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s secretary for years, but
    who had been speedily given his cong&eacute; when the imposter took up his
    permanent abode in the house, was installed once more in the library, replying
    to the innumerable letters and telegrams of inquiry which poured in with
    every post.</p>
  <p>Louisa and Sir Thomas were shown into the room where the young man was sitting.
    He rose at once, offering chairs and pushing his own work aside. In the meanwhile
    the doctor had gone up stairs.</p>
  <p>Several minutes elapsed. No one spoke. Mr. Warren, who had always been deeply
    attached to Luke de Mountford, was longing to ask questions, which, however,
    he was too shy to formulate. At last there was a knock at the door and one
    of the nurses came in to say that Lord Radclyffe would be pleased to see
    Sir Thomas Ryder up stairs.</p>
  <p>Louisa rose at the same time as her uncle, but the latter detained her with
    a gesture full of kind sympathy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not just yet, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you
    as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she asked anxiously, &ldquo;I shall be allowed to see
    him, shan&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he replied evasively. &ldquo;But even if you do
    not see him, you can trust to me. Oh, yes! you can,&rdquo; he added insistently,
    seeing the deeply troubled look that had crept into her face at his words. &ldquo;I
    am going to do to-night what I often have to do in the course of my work.
    I am going to borrow your soul and your mind and allow them to speak through
    my lips. When I go up stairs, I shall only outwardly be the police officer
    searching for proofs of a crime: inwardly I shall be a noble-hearted woman
    trying to discover proofs of her fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s innocence. That will
    be right, dear, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She nodded acquiescence, trying to appear content. Then she pleaded once
    again, dry-eyed and broken-voiced: &ldquo;You will try and get permission
    for me to see Lord Radclyffe, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I give you my word,&rdquo; he said solemnly.</p>
  <p>Then he went up stairs.</p>
  <p>Mr. Warren, quiet and sympathetic, persuaded Louisa to sit down again by
    the hearth. He took her muff and fur stole from her, and threw a log on the
    fire. The flames spurted off, giving a cheerful crackle. But Louisa saw no
    pictures in this fire, her mind was up stairs in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s room,
    wondering what was happening.</p>
  <p>Mr. Warren spoke of the murdered man. He had not been present at the inquest,
    and the news that the tyrant who had ruled over Lord Radclyffe for so long
    was nothing but an impostor came as a fearful shock to him.</p>
  <p>There was the pitifulness of the whole thing! The utter purposelessness
    of a hideous crime. So many lives wrecked, such awful calamity, such appalling
    humiliation, such ignominy, and all just for nothing! A very little trouble,
    almost superficial inquiry, would have revealed the imposture, and saved
    all that sorrow, all the dire humiliation, and prevented the crime for which
    the law of men decrees that there shall be no pardon.</p>
  <p>The man who lay ill up stairs&mdash;and he who was lying in the public mortuary,
    surrounded by all the pomp and luxury which he had filched by his lies&mdash;alone
    could tell the secret of the extraordinary success of the imposture. Lord
    Radclyffe had accepted the bricklayer&rsquo;s son almost as his own, with
    that same obstinate reserve with which he had at first flouted the very thought
    of the man&rsquo;s pretensions. Who could tell what persuasion was used?
    what arguments? what threats?</p>
  <p>And the man was an impostor after all! And he had been murdered, when one
    word perhaps would have effaced him from the world as completely and less
    majestically than had been done by death.</p>
  <p>Mr. Warren talked of it all, and Louisa listened with half an ear even whilst
    every sense of hearing in her was concentrated on the floor above, in a vain
    endeavour to get a faint inkling of what went on in Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s
    room. She had heard her uncle&rsquo;s step on the landing, the few hurried
    sentences exchanged with the doctor before entering the sick chamber, the
    opening and shutting of a door. Then again the lighter footsteps of the nurses,
    who had evidently been sent out of the room, when Sir Thomas went in. Louisa
    heard the faint hum of their voices as they descended the stairs, even a
    suppressed giggle now and then: they were happy no doubt at the few moments
    of respite from constant watching, which had apparently been accorded them.</p>
  <p>They ran quickly down the last flight of stairs, and across the hall toward
    the servants&rsquo; quarters. Their chattering was heard faintly echoing
    through the baize doors. Then nothing more.</p>
  <p>Less than a quarter of an hour went by, and again she heard the opening
    and shutting of a door, and men&rsquo;s footsteps on the landing.</p>
  <p>Louisa could not believe either her eyes which were gazing on the clock,
    or her ears, which heard now quite distinctly the voice of Sir Thomas descending
    the stairs, and Doctor Newington&rsquo;s more pompous tones in reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The interview,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Warren, &ldquo;did not last very
    long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already she had risen from her chair, desperately anxious, wondering
    what the meaning could be of the shortness of the interview. She was not
    kept long in suspense, for a moment or two later Sir Thomas Ryder came in
    followed by Doctor Newington. One glance at her uncle&rsquo;s face told her
    the whole disappointing truth, even before he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was useless, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Doctor Newington
    was quite right. Lord Radclyffe, I am sorry to say, is hardly conscious.
    He is, evidently, unable to understand what is said, and certainly quite
    incapable of making any effort to reply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was afraid so,&rdquo; added Doctor Newington in his usual conventional
    tones, &ldquo;the patient, you see, is hardly conscious. His mind is dormant.
    He just knows me and his nurses, but he did not recognize Sir Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louisa said nothing: the blank, hopeless disappointment following on the
    excitement of the past two hours was exceedingly difficult to bear. The ruling
    passion&mdash;strong even in the midst of despair&mdash;the pride that was
    in her, alone kept her from an utter breakdown. She was grateful to her uncle,
    who very tactfully interposed his tall figure between her and the indifferent
    eyes of the doctor. Mr. Warren looked more sympathetic than ever, and that
    was just as trying to bear as the pompousness of Doctor Newington.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, Louisa had absolutely ceased to think. The whole future
    from this moment appeared as an absolute blank. She had not begun to envisage
    the possibility of going back to the hotel, having utterly failed in accomplishing
    that which she had set mind and heart to do: the throwing of the first feeble
    ray of light on the impenetrable darkness of Luke&rsquo;s supposed guilt.
    She certainly had not envisaged the going to bed to-night, the getting up
    to-morrow, the beginning of another day with its thousand and one trivial
    tasks and incidents, all the while that she had failed in doing that which
    alone could prevent the awful catastrophe of to-morrow!</p>
  <p>Luke standing in the dock, like a common criminal!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just see about getting a cab, dear,&rdquo; said her uncle
    kindly.</p>
  <p>The first of those thousand and one trivialities which would go on and on
    from now onward in endless monotony, whilst Luke prepared for his trial,
    for his condemnation, perhaps for death.</p>
  <p>It was indeed unthinkable. No wonder that her mind rebelled at the task,
    refusing all thoughts, remaining like a gray, blank slate from which every
    impression of past and future has been wiped out.</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas Ryder went out of the room, and Mr. Warren went with him. They
    left the door ajar, so she could hear them talking in the hall. Mr. Warren
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out, Sir Thomas. It&rsquo;s a horrid night. Fletcher
    will get you a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Sir Thomas replied: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; said the younger man, &ldquo;wait in the
    library?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had apparently rung a bell, for the man servant came into the hall and
    was duly told off to whistle for a cab.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go into another room, for a moment, Mr. Warren,
    if I may,&rdquo;  said Sir Thomas. &ldquo;There are just one or two little
    questions I would like to put to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, Sir Thomas,&rdquo; replied Mr. Warren with alacrity.</p>
  <p>The two men went together into the dining-room. Louisa by shutting her eyes
    could almost see them sitting there in the stately and gloomy room, which
    she knew so well. She could call to mind the last occasion on which she had
    lunched there, with Lord Radclyffe and Luke, and Edie, and Jim. It was the
    day on which the impostor first forced his way into the house. Louisa had
    a clear vision of him even now, just as she had seen him standing that day
    in the hall, before his interview with Lord Radclyffe. Parker was helping
    him with his coat and Louisa had seen his face: the bricklayer&rsquo;s son
    who had come forward with his marvellous array of lies, and who had been
    so implicitly believed, that he himself had to pay for his lies with a most
    horrible death.</p>
  <p>For that death now&mdash;and because of the impenetrable mystery which the
    impostor had taken with him to his humble grave&mdash;Luke stood in danger
    of being punished with death that was even more horrible than that caused
    by a stab in the neck under cover of darkness and of fog.</p>
  <p>The one chance that there had been of finding a clue to the mystery had
    been dissipated by the silence of the sick man up stairs. The hand of death
    was upon him too. He also would take the secret of the bricklayer&rsquo;s
    son, silently with him to the grave.</p>
  <p>Louisa&rsquo;s eyes, vacant and tearless, wandered aimlessly round the room.
    Doctor Newington was sitting at the desk, writing either a letter or a prescription
    which apparently required a considerable amount of thought. He seemed deeply
    absorbed in what he wrote and from time to time referred to a small note-book
    which he took out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>The scratching of his stylo against the paper was the only sound that struck
    Louisa&rsquo;s ear, the rest of the house seemed lonely and still. Only from
    far away came the shrill screeching of the cab-whistle.</p>
  <p>Louisa rose and went to the door, peeping out into the hall. It was deserted
    and the dining-room door was shut. She slipped out into the hall. Doctor
    Newington apparently did not trouble himself about her. Very softly she closed
    the library door behind her.</p>
  <p>Then she ran swiftly up stairs.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39<br>
    A Mere Woman Fighting For The Thing She Loved</b></h2>
  <p>Louisa reached the landing slightly out of breath. She knew her way about
    the old house very well. Two doors now were opposite to her. One of these
    had been left ajar&mdash;intentionally no doubt. It was the one that gave
    on a smaller morning room, where in the olden days Lord Radclyffe used to
    have his breakfast and write his private letters: the library being given
    over to Mr. Warren and to official correspondence.</p>
  <p>From this side of the house and right through the silence that hung over
    it, Louisa could hear very faintly rising from the servants&rsquo; quarters
    below, the sound of women&rsquo;s voices chattering and giggling. The nurses
    then had not returned to their post. With the indifference born of long usage
    they were enjoying every minute of the brief respite accorded them, content
    to wait for the doctor&rsquo;s call if the patient had immediate need of
    them.</p>
  <p>Through the chink of the door, the red glow of a shaded lamp came as a sharp
    crimson streak cutting the surrounding gloom.</p>
  <p>Louisa pushed open the door that was ajar and tip-toed softly in.</p>
  <p>The little room had been transformed for present emergencies. The desk had
    been pushed aside, and a small iron bedstead fitted up for the night nurse.
    A woman&rsquo;s paraphernalia was scattered about on the massive early Victorian
    furniture: a comb and brush, a cap and apron neatly folded, a couple of long
    pins, littered the table which used to look so severe with its heavy inkstand
    and firm blotting-pad. The piano had been relegated into a corner, and the
    portrait of Luke which always hung over the mantlepiece had been removed.</p>
  <p>The door into the bedroom was wide open, and without any hesitation Louisa
    went in. The bed was immediately in front of her, and between it and the
    hanging lamp beyond a screen had been placed, so that the upper part of the
    sick man&rsquo;s figure was invisible at first in the gloom, and the light
    lay like a red patch right across the quilt at the foot.</p>
  <p>Louisa advanced noiselessly and then halted beside the bed. The room was
    pleasantly warm, and the smell of disinfectants, of medicines, and of lavender
    water hung in the air&mdash;the air of a sick room, oppressive and enervating.</p>
  <p>Gradually Louisa&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness. She
    fixed them on the sick man who lay quite still against the pillows, his face
    no less white than the linen against which it rested. Louisa had no idea
    that any man could alter so in such brief while. It almost seemed difficult
    to recognize in the white emaciated figure that lay there with the stillness
    of death, the vigorous man of a few months ago.</p>
  <p>The face had the appearance of wax, deep lines from the nostrils to the
    corners of the mouth accentuating its hollow appearance: the hair was almost
    snow-white now and clung matted and damp to the forehead and sunken temples.</p>
  <p>Lord Radclyffe seemed unconscious of Louisa&rsquo;s presence in the room,
    but his eyes were wide open and fixed on a spot high upon the wall immediately
    opposite to the bed. Louisa looked to see on what those eyes were gazing
    so intently, and turning she saw the splendid portrait of Luke de Mountford
    painted by the greatest living master of portraiture, which we all admired
    in the rooms of the Royal Academy a few years ago. It had been taken away
    from the boudoir, and brought in here so that the sick man might have the
    semblance now that he was parted from the reality.</p>
  <p>Only a feeble breath escaped Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s parted lips: there was
    no distortion in the face, and the hands lay still, waxen-white, against
    the quilt. Louisa looked down on the sick man without, at first, attempting
    to speak. She looked down on this the last cord of hope&rsquo;s broken lute,
    the frail thread on which hung Luke&rsquo;s one chance of safety: this feeble
    life almost ended, this weak breath which alone could convey words of hope!
    For the moment Louisa&rsquo;s heart almost misgave her, when she thought
    of what she meant to do: to bring, namely, this wandering spirit back to
    earth, in order to make it conscious of such misery as no heart of man could
    endure and not break. It seemed like purposeless, inhuman cruelty!</p>
  <p>Even if she could call that enfeebled mind back to the hideous realities
    of to-day, what chance was there that the few words which this dying man
    could utter would be those that could save Luke from the gallows?</p>
  <p>Was it not better to let the broken heart sink to rest in peace, the weakened
    mind go back to the land of shadows unconscious of further sorrow?</p>
  <p>Uncertain now, and vaguely fearful she looked up at the portrait of Luke.
    The eyes in the magnificently painted portrait seemed endowed with amazing
    vitality. To the loving, heart-broken woman it seemed as if they made a direct
    appeal to her. Yet, what appeal did they make?</p>
  <p>To let the old man&mdash;&ldquo;Uncle Rad&rdquo;&mdash;die in peace, ignorant
    of the awful fate which must inevitably befall the man whom he loved with
    such strange, such enduring affection?</p>
  <p>Or did those eyes ask for help there, where no other human being could lend
    assistance now?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words escaped her suddenly, almost frightening her, though all along
    she knew that she had meant to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know me, Lord Radclyffe?&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;it
    is Louisa Harris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No reply. The great eyes with the shadow of death over them were gazing
    on the face on which they had always loved to dwell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe,&rdquo; she reiterated, and the deep notes of her
    contralto voice quivered with the poignancy of her emotion, &ldquo;Luke is
    in very great danger, the gravest possible danger that can befall any man.
    Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again no reply. But the great eyes&mdash;sunken and glassy&mdash;slowly
    fell from the picture to her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; she repeated, dwelling on the word, &ldquo;I must speak
    to you about Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the lips, stiff and cold, opened slightly and from between them escaped
    the word, feebly, like the breath of a dying man:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is in grave danger. Lord Radclyffe,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;in
    danger of death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And this time the faded lips framed the word distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke&mdash;in danger of death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hands which had lain on the quilt up to now, still and waxen as those
    of a lifeless image, began to tremble visibly, and the eyes&mdash;those great,
    hollow eyes&mdash;had a searching, anxious expression in them now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Philip de Mountford has been murdered,&rdquo; said Louisa. &ldquo;You
    knew that, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sick man nodded. Life and consciousness were slowly returning and with
    them understanding and the capacity for suffering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Luke is accused of having murdered him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The trembling of the hands ceased. With a quick, jerky movement they were
    drawn back against the figure, then used as a leverage. With a sudden accession
    of strength, the sick man slowly but steadily drew himself up, away from
    the pillows, until he was almost sitting up in bed. There was understanding
    in the eyes now, understanding and an awful look of horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not true!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Luke was known to have quarrelled
    with Philip de Mountford, and the dagger-stick with which the crime was committed
    was found in the park&mdash;stained with blood&mdash;the dagger-stick which
    belonged to Luke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; murmured the sick man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied firmly, &ldquo;but
    he pleads guilty. He owns that the stick was his, and will give no denial,
    no explanation. He is taking upon himself the crime of another&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not true!&rdquo; once more murmured the sick man.</p>
  <p>Then he fell back exhausted against the pillows.</p>
  <p>There he lay once more, with that awful stillness of death: the hands rested
    on the quilt as if modelled in wax. The eyes were closed, and from between
    the pale, parted lips not the faintest breath seemed to escape. Helpless
    and anxious, Louisa looked round her. On a table close by stood an array
    of bottles. She went up to it, trying to read the labels, wondering if there
    was anything there that was a powerful restorative. She found a small bottle
    labelled &ldquo;brandy&rdquo; and took it up in her hand, but as she looked
    up again, she saw Doctor Newington standing in the doorway of the boudoir.
    One of the nurses was with him, and he was armed with his most pompous and
    most professional manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked sternly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she replied, trying to master her excitement, &ldquo;that
    Lord Radclyffe has fainted. I did not know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should think not indeed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and why did you
    not ring for the nurse? and why are you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wished to see Lord Radclyffe myself,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without my permission?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would have refused it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I should. And I must request you to leave the sick room
    at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Baffled and miserable, she stood for a moment hesitating, vaguely wondering
    if she could rebel. Indeed, she had no option but to obey. The doctor was
    well within his rights: she, utterly in the wrong.</p>
  <p>She turned toward the door ready to go, but in order to reach it from where
    she stood, she had to go past the foot of the bed.</p>
  <p>The nurse was busy administering restoratives, and Doctor Newington had
    taken up the attitude dear to every Englishman: his stand upon the hearth
    rug, and his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers. He was treating
    Louisa like a disobedient child, and she had no one to appeal to in this
    moment of complete helplessness.</p>
  <p>One moment only did she debate with herself. The nurse just then had gone
    to a side table to fetch some brandy. The patient, so Louisa heard her tell
    the doctor, had not actually fainted; he was merely in a state of exhaustion.</p>
  <p>Swift and furtive, like some small animal in danger of its life, Louisa
    slipped in between the screen and the bed, and before the doctor or nurse
    could prevent her, she had bent right over the sick man and whispered close
    to his ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe, unless you make an effort now, to-morrow Luke will
    be standing in the dock&mdash;branded as a felon. Make an effort for Luke&rsquo;s
    sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the spirit which had gone wandering in the land of shadows came back
    to earth at sound of that one name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Luke, my boy. I am strong. I can
    help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss Harris&mdash;&rdquo; interposed the doctor sternly.</p>
  <p>But the sick man&rsquo;s words had put new strength into her. She was ready
    to fight the doctor now. The conventional woman of the world was transformed
    into just a mere woman fighting for the thing she loved&mdash;child, lover,
    or husband, it is all the same when that womanly instinct of combat is aroused.</p>
  <p>Doctor Newington would have had to take Louisa Harris by the shoulders now
    if he meant to eject her: for until the patient spoke, here she meant to
    remain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she quietly, &ldquo;you have another duty to perform
    than that of watching over your patient. An innocent man is accused of a
    terrible crime. Lord Radclyffe, though very weak, is fully conscious. If
    he can save his nephew by a word that word must be spoken to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send for Tom Ryder,&rdquo; murmured the sick man, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
    understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words came in gasps, but otherwise fairly distinctly. Doctor Newington,
    in all his professional experience, had never been placed in such an extraordinary
    dilemma. He was not quite so obstinate about the whole thing as he had originally
    been, and a kind of hopeless bewilderment showed itself upon his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you send for Sir Thomas, doctor?&rdquo; asked Louisa. &ldquo;You
    see that Lord Radclyffe wishes it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. The responsibility was getting all too
    heavy for him. Besides being a fashionable physician, he was also a man,
    and as such not altogether inhuman. He had seen much acute suffering, both
    mental and physical, throughout the length of his career, but never had he
    been brought face to face with such an acute psychological problem, and&mdash;frankly&mdash;he
    did not know how to deal with it.</p>
  <p>So he sent the nurse to ask Sir Thomas Ryder once more to step up stairs,
    whilst he himself went up to his patient, and with the mechanical movement
    born of life-long habit, he placed his white, podgy fingers on the feebly
    fluttering pulse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God only knows what will be the issue,&rdquo; he said almost inaudibly.  &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sick man, on the other hand, seemed to be husbanding his strength.
    He had most obediently taken the brandy which had been given him, and now
    he lay back quietly among the pillows, with eyes closed and lips slightly
    parted. The hands wandered somewhat restlessly along the smooth surface of
    the quilt, otherwise Lord Radclyffe lay perfectly still. It even seemed&mdash;to
    Louisa&rsquo;s super-sensitive gaze&mdash;as if an expression of content
    had settled over the pale face. Once the sick man opened his eyes and looked
    up at the portrait: the lips murmured the one word:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luke!&rdquo; and slowly, very slowly, two tears formed in the sunken
    eyes and trickled down the wan cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better,&rdquo; said the doctor curtly, &ldquo;leave the patient
    to me and to Sir Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait in the next
    room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas will call you, no doubt, if your presence is desirable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was ready enough to obey now: her uncle&rsquo;s footstep was heard on
    the landing outside. Quietly she relinquished her place beside the bed, and
    as she did so she bent down and kissed the poor old hand, that wandered so
    restlessly along the folds of the quilt.</p>
  <p>As Sir Thomas entered the room, she was just leaving it. They met under
    the lintel of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seems stronger,&rdquo; she whispered pointing to the sick man. &ldquo;I
    think that he will make an effort&mdash;for Luke&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She waited a moment in the door-way, until she saw Sir Thomas Ryder installed
    on one side of the bed, and the doctor on the other side, with his finger
    on the patient&rsquo;s pulse. Then she retreated into the morning room, and
    moved by some unaccountable impulses she went to the piano and opening it,
    she sat down, and with exquisite softness began to play the opening bars
    of one of her favourite songs.</p>
  <p>She sang hardly above a whisper: the velvety tones of her voice sounded
    like the murmur of ghosts through the heavy tapestries of the room. Whenever
    her voice died away in the intervals of the song she could hear the hum of
    men&rsquo;s voices, her uncle&rsquo;s low and clear, now and then a word
    from the doctor, and through it all the voice of the sick man, feeble and
    distinct, speaking the words that would mean life to Luke.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40<br>
    And Thus Her Hour Had Come</b></h2>
  <p>Half an hour had gone by. The fountain pen dropped from Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
    cramped fingers.</p>
  <p>He had been writing, slowly but incessantly, ever since he sat down beside
    the sick man, and put his first question to him. Lord Radclyffe, with the
    tenacity peculiar to a strong nature, had clung to his own strength and will
    power and had spoken clearly, so that Sir Thomas could not only understand
    but could write down what he heard, word for word&mdash;not omitting a phrase&mdash;accurately
    and succinctly.</p>
  <p>Once or twice Doctor Newington had to interfere. The patient was in danger
    of exhaustion, and brandy had again to be administered. Lord Radclyffe took
    it eagerly. What will power he had left was concentrated on the desire to
    keep up his strength.</p>
  <p>From the boudoir came the gentle murmur of a tender song, whispered by Louisa&rsquo;s
    appealing contralto voice. The sick man seemed to enjoy it: it seemed to
    soothe him too, for every now and again he lay quite still and listened attentively:
    and when he did so his eyes always sought the portrait of Luke.</p>
  <p>When all was finished, and the last word written, Sir Thomas rose and grasped
    his old friend&rsquo;s emaciated hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better to-morrow,&rdquo; he whispered cheerily, &ldquo;when
    you have your nephew with you. The doctor here must allow you to see him,
    if you see no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord Radclyffe must have rest now,&rdquo; said the doctor impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear sir,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Thomas. &ldquo;I need
    not trouble you any more. I can but hope that your patient will be none the
    worse for the effort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor did not reply. The patient after the great effort was in a dangerous
    state of collapse and required every attention.</p>
  <p>Sir Thomas Ryder took his leave and going through the smaller room, he beckoned
    to Louisa to follow him.</p>
  <p>A moment later the doctor was heard ringing for the nurses. Sir Thomas in
    the hall was struggling with his coat, whilst Louisa stood by, quite still
    and patient. She knew that her hour would come, and she was grateful to her
    uncle for taking her away from here so quickly.</p>
  <p>She had not asked a single question and Sir Thomas had not volunteered any
    information. But she was content to wait, until the time when he told her
    everything.</p>
  <p>The cab which had been called all that long while ago was still waiting
    at the door. It was now past eleven o&rsquo;clock. Silently Sir Thomas and
    Louisa Harris stepped into the cab, Mr. Warren, sympathetic and attentive
    to the last, giving the address to the chauffeur on their behalf.</p>
  <p>Less than five minutes later, they had arrived at the Langham Hotel, but
    they had not exchanged a single word during that time.</p>
  <p>Colonel Harris was in the sitting room, waiting for his daughter&rsquo;s
    return. The maid had told him that her mistress had gone to Sir Thomas Ryder&rsquo;s
    and had promised to be home again in about an hour, so he was not really
    anxious, only very worried about her. Personally, he saw no issue to the
    terrible tangle, and his heart ached for her, as much as it did for Luke.</p>
  <p>He found himself quite unable to sit at the club. Luke de Mountford&rsquo;s
    name was in every man&rsquo;s mouth. The obsession was unendurable, the countless
    arguments adduced by indifferent lips was positively nerve-racking. Colonel
    Harris after half an hour had enough of it, and went back to the Langham.</p>
  <p>He did not greet his brother-in-law very warmly: he did not feel very well
    disposed toward him, as he had a vague idea that Sir Thomas Ryder was in
    a measure responsible for Luke&rsquo;s terrible fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lou dear, it&rsquo;s very late,&rdquo; he said with gentle reproach
    when she came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to forgive her, Will,&rdquo; interposed Sir Thomas, &ldquo;she
    came over to have a talk with me, and we went on to try and see old Rad,
    who is dying, I am afraid, poor chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear,&rdquo; he added turning to Louisa whilst he dived into
    his breast-pocket, from which he extracted a note-book, &ldquo;go to your
    own room and read this through very quietly while I talk to your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave her the book, which she took without a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;take you very long to read.
    When you have finished, bring me the notes back, I want them to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She kissed her father before she went out of the room. He and she had both
    guessed&mdash;by that unexplainable, subtle intuition born of sympathy&mdash;what
    the pages of that note-book contained.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41<br>
    Which Tells Of The Contents Of The Note Book</b></h2>
  <p>Louisa sat beside the fire and read. The notes were written in Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
    clear caligraphy, in short, jerky sentences, just as the sick man had spoken
    them, usually in reply to questions put to him.</p>
  <p>As Louisa read on, she could almost hear Lord Radclyffe&rsquo;s whispered
    words, whilst she herself sang Tosti&rsquo;s melancholy song: &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not altogether ignorant of my brother Arthur&rsquo;s marriage
    over in Martinique, but he had always given me to understand that the marriage
    was not a strictly legal one, and that his son Philip had no right whatever
    to claim any possible succession to our family title and estates. Even on
    his deathbed Arthur assured me of this, and said to me most emphatically &lsquo;Luke
    is your heir! My son Philip has no legal claim!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never made the slightest effort to communicate with Arthur&rsquo;s
    widow or with his child, for Arthur had assured me that they were well provided
    for and quite happy amongst their own kindred. After the catastrophe of St.
    Pierre I completely lost sight of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then came a letter addressed to me from St. Vincent, the first inkling
    which I had that not only did Arthur&rsquo;s son know of his father&rsquo;s
    position in life, but that he had full and justifiable reasons for believing
    that he himself was heir presumptive to the family title and estates which
    would have been his father&rsquo;s, had the latter outlived the present holder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This letter was followed by several others about which neither Luke
    nor Mr. Warren knew anything, for I told them nothing. At last there came
    one from Brussels. By this time I had searched carefully through some letters
    which my brother Arthur had desired that I should destroy after his death,
    but which I had always kept by me, meaning one day to comply with his wish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had more than a suspicion then that my brother&rsquo;s marriage
    was a perfectly legal one, and that his son was the only true heir-presumptive
    to the title and estates which I had always fondly thought could only devolve
    upon Luke. I went over to Brussels determined to see this Philip before he
    set foot in England. The thought that he would supersede Luke was more than
    I could bear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I arrived in Brussels early one morning, having crossed over in the
    night. At once I drove to the mean hotel where he was lodging. He was sharing
    a room with a man with whom he had picked up a casual acquaintanceship on
    the sea voyage between the West Indies and Antwerp. The two men had come
    over together in the Belgian boat. They looked a pair of young blackguards,
    but it did not take me very long to be convinced that for some reason best
    known to himself my brother Arthur had deceived me and that his son Philip
    was indeed the legitimate and rightful heir to the title which I hold. The
    papers were authentic and undisputable. This much I knew and that Luke, whom
    I loved best in all the world, more than any father has ever loved his son,
    would never be Earl of Radclyffe so long as Philip de Mountford lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men will say that I am an abandoned criminal, and, indeed, it may
    be so. May God forgive me hereafter, for I killed my brother&rsquo;s son.
    I pretended to rejoice at his homecoming, and in half an hour had gained
    his confidence. In the afternoon we went out together and after a short walk
    we picked up a taxicab. Philip gave the driver the address of a restaurant
    at which I had asked him to dine with me. I kept carefully in the shadow,
    so that the man shouldn&rsquo;t see me. Then on the way in the cab, I killed
    him. When his head was turned away from me, I plunged an old Italian stiletto
    which I had carried about with me, ever since I had had letters from Philip,
    straight into his neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He died instantly without a groan, and I was sick to death, but I
    managed to sit quietly beside him until the cab pulled up: then I jumped
    out and told the chauffeur to drive my friend on to some remote place on
    the boulevards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I watched the cab until it was out of sight, then I hailed another,
    and drove straight to the Gard du Nord, and crossed back to England that
    night. I threw the stiletto overboard into the sea. I had spent twelve hours
    in Brussels, and I had killed Philip de Mountford, and made sure that Luke
    would be Earl of Radclyffe after me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not likely that in their search for the missing criminal who
    had stabbed an unknown stranger in a cab, the Belgian police would suspect
    an English peer. The mystery of that crime has remained impenetrable, because
    nothing was ever known of the stranger who was murdered. At the mean hotel
    where he lodged no one knew anything about him. Only one person knew and
    he was silent for purposes of his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before the police searched the unknown stranger&rsquo;s room, the
    room which he shared with the chance friend whom he had picked up on the
    Belgian boat, the latter already had found and concealed the papers which
    would have revealed the identity of the murdered man, if not that of his
    murderer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, at home in England, wondered how it was that the Belgian police
    had never discovered that the murdered man was named Philip de Mountford
    and that he claimed to be the heir to the earldom of Radclyffe. I expected
    paragraphs in the paper, some unpleasantness even, but none came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could not understand it, for I had forgotten the existence of the
    chance friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then one day last April I understood. Once more I had letters
    from abroad, from a man who claimed to be my brother&rsquo;s son. At first
    I thought the whole thing a silly imposture, until the day when a man confronted
    me in my own house, armed with every proof that I had killed Philip de Mountford
    in Brussels. He had the latter&rsquo;s passports, his birth and marriage
    certificates, his letters of identification, all, all the papers that he
    had filched from among the dead man&rsquo;s things, and which he now flaunted
    before me, daring me to prove him an impostor.  &lsquo;If I am not Philip
    de Mountford,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;then where is Philip de Mountford?&rsquo;  And
    from that hour, I was as wax in his hands. He held me and he knew it. I might
    have proved him an impostor, and he could prove me a murderer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven alone knows how I did not lose my reason then. I floundered
    in a sea of wild conjectures, wild projects, wild hopes of escape. But my
    tyrant held me, and I dared not rebel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And once more I was obsessed with the awful certitude that Luke would
    never be Earl of Radclyffe after me, while this man lived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had so taken upon himself the personality of Philip, the evidences
    which went to prove his identity with the late Arthur de Mountford&rsquo;s
    son were so strangely circumstantial, that, short of my proclaiming loudly
    that I had killed my brother&rsquo;s son with my own hand, nothing could
    prevent the impostor from succeeding in filching Luke&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And even if I had confessed then, it seemed to me that this man would
    still succeed in proving that I had murdered an unknown stranger&mdash;a
    chance friend, who was an English bricklayer&rsquo;s son&mdash;and that he
    and he only was Philip de Mountford, the late Arthur&rsquo;s son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did I first dream of killing him, as I killed the other? I could
    not tell you that. But it was some time ago, and I watched my opportunity
    with patience and perseverance. Then at last the opportunity came, following
    on terrible provocation. That dark, foggy November night that you all remember
    so well! I was to meet my tyrant at the Veterans&rsquo; Club at nine o&rsquo;clock.
    I drove up there and as I stepped out of the cab I came face to face with
    Luke. Something in the boy&rsquo;s manner told me what had happened. He didn&rsquo;t
    tell me, but I guessed. The two men had quarrelled and Luke had had to endure
    the other&rsquo;s arrogance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The news upset me. I felt faint and choked with the fog. Luke didn&rsquo;t
    like to leave me, and seeing how I tottered he gave me his stick to lean
    upon. We walked together for a little while up and down, and I felt stronger
    and better. I begged Luke to leave me. Presently, as the impostor came out
    at the club door, Luke obeyed at last, and said &lsquo;good night&rsquo; to
    me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul Baker&mdash;I knew that that was his name&mdash;wanted me to
    drive straight back to Grosvenor Square, but asked me to drop him first near
    the railings of Green Park. He often walked about there in the evenings.
    It was a curious fad which he had. We called a cab, and he told the driver
    where to pull up. When I was sitting next to him, I realized that I had a
    stick in my hand. I really had forgotten that it was Luke&rsquo;s. Whilst
    I toyed with it, I noticed that the top came out, and that a sharp dagger
    was concealed inside the body of the stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul Baker was looking out of the window at the fog, and inside the
    cab it was very dark, so he did not know what I was doing. I killed him,
    just as I had killed Arthur&rsquo;s son, with a dagger thrust through the
    neck. This time I did not feel sick, because I hated this man so. When the
    driver pulled up near Green Park I jumped out quite coolly and told the man
    to take my friend to some distant address in Kensington.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I threw the stick away behind the railings in the park. I had forgotten
    that the stick was Luke&rsquo;s: I knew that it was not mine, and that therefore
    they could not trace it to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not imagine for a moment that Luke could be accused of a crime
    which he had not committed. I did not think that justice could be so blind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All I wanted was to be rid of my tyrant, and that Luke&rsquo;s inheritance
    should not be filched from him.&rdquo;</p>

    Which Tells Once More Of Commonplace Incidents</b></h2>
  <p>The note-book fell out of Louisa&rsquo;s hands on to her lap. How simple
    the tragedy seemed, now that she knew. How understandable was the mystery
    of Luke&rsquo;s silence. He knew that &ldquo;Uncle Rad&rdquo; was guilty.
    There lay the awful difficulty!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Rad has been father, mother, brother, sister to us all! Bless
    him!&rdquo; that was Luke&rsquo;s feeling with regard to Uncle Rad.</p>
  <p>The un-understandable was so simple after all!</p>
  <p>Louisa went back to the sitting-room. The two men were sitting, smoking
    in silence. Colonel Harris, too, understood the mystery at last. His loyalty
    was crowned with the halo of justification.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>The public never knew, I think, that Luke de Mountford had actually been
    arrested for the murder of the Clapham Road bricklayer. The police the next
    day applied for a remand and then Luke was brought quietly before the magistrate
    and equally quietly dismissed.</p>
  <p>He was free to go and see Uncle Rad.</p>
  <p>Louisa did not see him the whole of that day, for he sat by the bedside
    of the sick man whose strange and perturbed spirit was slowly sinking to
    rest. Uncle Rad was at peace, for he held the hand and looked into the face
    of the man on whom he had lavished the storehouse of an affection that had
    known no bounds.</p>
  <p>The two men understood each other perfectly. He who had committed a crime,
    and he who was ready to bear its burden, both had done their share for the
    other&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>It was only after the magnificent obsequies of the Earl of Radclyffe that
    the truth about the murder of the bricklayer&rsquo;s son was made known to
    the public at large.</p>
  <p>It had to be done for Luke&rsquo;s sake. Colonel Harris insisted upon it
    with all the weight of his fatherly authority. Sir Thomas Ryder did likewise.</p>
  <p>For Louisa&rsquo;s sake, too, it had to be. But, twenty-four hours before
    the publication of the confession in the newspapers, Luke and Louisa had
    been quietly married by special license, and had gone abroad.</p>
  <p>Once more we must think of them as the commonplace, conventional man and
    woman of the world, who outwardly behaved just like thousands of English
    men and women of their class behave.</p>
  <p>When they came back from their honeymoon&mdash;which lasted one year abroad
    and all the rest of their lives after that&mdash;there was not a trace in
    them, in their appearance, their manner, their mode of life, of the terrible
    tragedy which had threatened to annihilate honour, life, and love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! those English!&rdquo; murmured the foreign excellencies who graced
    the English court, &ldquo;they have no heart, no sentiment! Lord and Lady
    Radclyffe! They behave just as if he had never been accused of murder! As
    if his uncle had never been the awful criminal that he was! They are hypocrites,
    these English, and they have no heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Convention was once more the master! Its giant hands held the strings which
    made the puppets dance.</p>
  <p>But at times his grip would relax, when Luke and Louisa were all alone,
    no prying eyes to watch, no indifferent gaze to see the unburdening of their
    hearts. Then Luke would lie at Louisa&rsquo;s feet, for his love was worship,
    and his passion uncontrolled. His arms would encircle the perfect form that
    he loved with such intensity, that at times the happiness of loving had in
    it an exquisite sense of pain. The tragedy of the past was never quite absent
    from them then: the ghost of a great crime and the shadow of a still greater
    renunciation threw a mystic halo over their love for each other. And at those
    times&mdash;like Paolo and Francesca&mdash;they read no more.</p>
  <p>But these English, they have no heart, you know!</p>
