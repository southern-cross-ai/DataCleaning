<h2><a name="ch1-1" id="ch1-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>The morning seemed to herald a glorious day. The motionless
silver of the sea was ruffled in irregular streaks like watered
satin. The light mists were rising from the horizon and the
islands. Sunlight from over the stone pines just touched the end of
the jetty so that there was a triangle of gold. A boat, anchored
beyond, brooded, motionless. On the translucent water it seemed to
be suspended in the air. It became vivid&mdash;a melon slice of
incandescent white, a curved stripe of scarlet. Another, parallel
below, was of azure. The boat should have caught the light first.
It was further out than the end of the little pier.</p>

<p>The phenomenon was no doubt occasioned by the irregular outlines
of the pines. Or perhaps a beam pierced an interstice in their
tops. The prow of the boat stood up, white, shaped like half an
open fan. The sail, untidily housed on the curving felucca-yard was
lambent maroon. Then all the light went out of the whole
caboodle.</p>

<p>It was as if he had been vouchsafed a chromolithographic
close-up of a prehistoric craft. In miniature the thing had been
one of the thousand ships that Helen's face had launched and Homer
catalogued.</p>

<p>What a thought for that moment!</p>

<p>He was suspended as this boat had been&mdash;between nothing and
nothing. There was nothing to think of but visible objects. The
sea, level: blue at the edges. The stone pines bent, red-trunked.
The umbrella pines brighter in colour.</p>

<p>The sunlight was falling on the islands now...a landscape
without mercy. It smiled with the heartless smile of syrens.
Infinitely without the quality of pity.</p>

<p>He imagined that Mile Simone, the chambermaid, would find his
bedroom tidier than usual. He was always tidy. Now there would be
not a scrap displaced. Not a cigarette paper. She would perhaps
think him considerate! Tuberculous: that was what she was. You
could not be so thin without being tuberculous. She might even
think that nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.</p>

<p>An aged man in improbably soiled ducks came down the inclined
plane leading from the Douane. Why should the white Douane building
be as large as the barracks for a detachment of soldiers? No other
house in the place was larger than a pill-box and the whole port
consisted of not more than twenty pill-boxes. The port was no
larger than the mainsail of a schooner-yacht. At one time bands of
smugglers had landed there. Coming from Corsica, their brows bound
with handkerchiefs. Long flint-lock muskets behind their backs.
They needed detachments of troops with which to drive off the
picturesque bandits. Picturesque days!-Helen! Homer! Bandits! Salee
rovers! Centurions! The landscape with its heartless smile had seen
them all with the same equanimity. With the same it regarded him:
him Henry Martin Aluin Smith: free, male and twenty-one. Rising
thirtysix, that is to say. It is all one, twenty-one or thirty-five
if you are called Henry Martin Aluin with 'Smith' to top it
off...If you are going...But a less grotesque name would have given
more dignity to the occasion or to a cross!</p>

<p>He was at least spared the indignity of Aluin-Smith. On his
passport, which, along with his letter to Alice, he had obligingly
wrapped in oiled silk that also enveloped a fifty franc note, 'I,
the undersigned, Secretary of State of these United States' had
boggled at the task of inserting a hyphen between his last two
names. That would perhaps let his grizzled boar of a father out.
Presumably his grizzled boar of a father would not like to have the
name 'Aluin-Smith' on a cheap metal cross looking over the
Mediterranean. His father had achieved the name Aluin-Smith with
some difficulty on his candy wrappers. Early specimens that Henry
Martin had seen had borne the legend 'Alcyone A. Faber.' That had
become, presumably as his father had lived himself into the life of
Springfield, Ohio, 'A. A. Smith.' <i>Faber</i> is after all the
Latin for the more American 'Smith.' At last, on marriage it stood
up boldly as: 'A. Aluin-Smith.'...Mother had been the daughter of a
'pharmacist' who in those old-fashioned days called himself Smith
the Chymist&mdash;with a 'y'. A rigid New Englánder he had been and
claimed to be a man of science, no tooth-brush or pop corn
pedlar.</p>

<p>Henry Martin wondered too about his tombstone. His father would
no doubt attend to that. He would probably waver between having the
remains thrown into the common fosse of the paupers of St. Jean du
Var and a lump of Vosges rock that would be smoothed to a glassy
finish as to one panel which would be inscribed: H.M.A.S. <i>UN
ETRANGER</i>. 15 AUG. MCMXXXI. His father would not be one to omit
the date. An orderly, if truculent, man fond of making memoranda!
His packets&mdash;even his one cent pre-war packets of Pisto-Brittle had
been decorated with a slip inviting the complaints of purchasers.
The slip would bear a facsimile of his father's signature, a number
running into millions and a date.</p>

<p class="cp">H.M.A.S.<br>
<i>UN ETRANGER</i><br>
NOYE<br>
3.<br>
Le 15 Août MCMXXXI</p>

<p>The inscription would be in good Roman capitals. 'Leaded caps'
was perhaps the technical word! Presumably there would be no
religious addition. That would be frowned upon by ecclesiastical
Authority. It was singular that his father had never become
Protestant Episcopal. It was held in Springfield that Catholicism
was a cult only for nursemaids. They gave to the priest their
hard-earned pennies out of little leather purses. This he had heard
time out of mind in prep-school where the boys had been nearly all
German Lutheran. Possibly it was Moravian. At any rate Springfield
was a great centre for the production of German Lutheran clergy.
The training college on its insignificant mound had had
architectural features. As a boy he had been awed by them...Well,
if Henry Alcyone Aluin had become Protestant Episcopal&mdash;or even
Moravian&mdash;he, Henry Martin Aluin, might have had a pious aspiration
carved on that polished granite panel. As it was, there would be
none now. It might as well run:</p>

<p class="cp">HIC<br>
EXIT<br>
SMITH'S<br>
PISTO-BRITTLE<br>
&mdash;drowned in the Mediterranean 15.8.31!</p>

<p>There would be no one to carry on that sticky dynasty. Brother
Hal as an engineer with a fine if laborious career in the Klondike
would not want to be bothered. Nor certainly would Heldenstamm,
Sister Carrie's husband. He would want to go on hunting wild boars
in Luxemburg...A precipitous country. All rocks, streams and trees.
That was why his father made his family tombs out of boulders. The
habit shocked the inhabitants of Springfield. When it had merely
been a matter of Aunt Hedwig, Comtesse de Pralinghem, it had not so
much mattered. But when father buried mother under a similar lump
Springfield had said that had been un-American. If mother had been
alive she would never have stood for it. But it had looked like
good publicity. When father had first come to the country he had
manufactured peanut brittle. Then mother&mdash;before the marriage&mdash;had
suggested that pistachios were more genteel than peanuts. But
father had continued to manufacture peanut brittle after he began
making the other. Henry Martin could remember as a tiny boy
standing behind the counter in the drug-store. His father would be
laughing at his attempts to wrap up tablets of Pisto-Brittle. They
were thinner than the peanut concoction, trays of which stood by
the first cash register. That you cut with fat, sharpened pincers
that opened like crocodile jaws and bit out chunks of the rocky
candy. There was another candy made with almonds. Some called it
almond rock.</p>

<p>On a Saturday afternoon he, Henry Martin, would be allowed to
cut up the candy for customers. The country folk came in and bought
it to take to their children though old folks said they liked
sucking it themselves. It reminded them of their courting days
before they had lost their teeth. They turned it round in their
toothless jaws and chuckled.</p>

<p>His father let him have on such Saturday afternoons every exact
ounce he could cut out with the pincers at one cut. He never
managed many. Hardly ever more than two cuts in an afternoon. Well
he was earning a large lump of almond rock! Really such a tombstone
much resembled that candy. When it was cut it had sides like
polished granite&mdash;for the inscription. The almonds on the other
side had the ruddled appearance of the reddish boulder from
Luxemburg.</p>

<p>The proudest moments of his life he had known, not inside but on
the sidewalks, on winter evenings, outside that drug-store. With a
woollen cap and mittens, a small sled dangling behind, the
parti-coloured lights falling on the trodden snow from the great
red, blue and yellow bottles. The other boys goggling up at them.
That was pride...his proprietary interest...those flaring
demijohns! Really of course they were mother's. Father had only
come into the drug-store on the marriage. That accounted for
mother's social ambition. She had to give father a hoist. She had
married below her even by American standards. Her father had been
Smith the Chymist! Father had started his career as far as
Springfield was concerned in a wooden shed with a shutter that
pushed up and displayed his candies. On a vacant lot on Main
Street.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be ashamed of in that. But it was kept in
the background. Only; when they took grave walks with father on
Sundays down Main Street he had been used to stop opposite what had
been successively Parke's, the butchers', Gurney's, the
booksellers', and the Ohio Electric Corporation's show-store. Henry
Martin believed it was now the First National. Or perhaps the First
National had failed. So many had in the last few months.</p>

<p>Father would point out that there he had started his career. In
a shed. Hal and Henry Martin in their creaking boots&mdash;Sister Carrie
in her rustling starched petticoats that stuck out all round her
tartan stockings&mdash;they would stand goggling whilst father pointed
his gold-knobbed cane at the shutters&mdash;at first of Parke's, then of
Gurney's. The Electric Corporation did not have shutters even on
Sunday. Nights, they had a light burning so that you saw the copper
wind fans and nickel irons! 'Ready for service,' night and day.
Father, with his top hat and white waistcoat with mother-of-pearl
buttons would expatiate on the fact that there he had had his first
shed. Occasionally he would stop a passer-by&mdash;two passers-by or
three&mdash;and tell them, too, the tale. He would swell&mdash;they would all
seem to swell and smile cordially&mdash;at the thought of the growth of
Springfield.</p>

<p>Presumably that was how the news of father's Sunday afternoon
habit had reached the ears of mother. At any rate father was told
that it would be better for the children's health if they were
taken into more rural surroundings on a Sunday. So, for a time they
were taken along the ridge where villas and porticos and stoops
were beginning to arise among the apple orchards.</p>

<p>So father, by all accounts, had been the better American, even
if his name had at first been Faber and even though mother had come
of one of the first families in New England. They heard that from
both father and mother often enough. Grandpa Smith had emigrated to
Springfield from Fall River...oh, a great many years ago. So mother
had been born over the coloured bottles in Springfield. But to be
born in a stable does not make you a mare if you are a lady and the
daughter of a scientist. It was said to have broken Grandpa Smith's
heart when, by the pressure of his wife and daughter, he was forced
to give up a section of a counter to his son-in-law's candies. At
any rate he had died within a year of the marriage, not living to
see Henry Martin who had come into the world two days after the old
gentleman's death.</p>

<p>If he had known that the Smith family would one day have two
visible countesses in it it might have heartened him up. No other
family in Springfield could show the like though nearly every one
of them had non-visible liens that attached them to Royalty,
Durchlauchts, Serenities, and Archdukes. Many of them, they
whispered in moments of expansion over their sewing, if they or
their husbands chose to exercise their rights, might well be sewing
coronets on their teacloths. But they were too democratic. Most of
mother's napkins and finer face towels did have coronets. That was
because they were presents from Aunt Hedwig and Sister Carrie.</p>

<p>But Aunt Hedwig had not arrived in Springfield until many years
after Grandpa Smith's death, though she had lived to see the
marriage of Sister Carrie to her nephew Van Heldenstamm who now, in
the Ardennes, hunted wild boars from a castle rejuvenated by
Pisto-Brittle profits.</p>

<p>Auntie Hedwig had arrived in Springfield as a refugee from
Luxemburg a very few months after the outbreak of the European war.
Apparently her husband, the Comte de Pralinghem, had had his
ancestral ruin desecrated by invaders and had died of apoplexy. A
certain veil had been drawn over that part of her career. Until the
United States had entered the unfortunate struggle Springfield had
been markedly Central Empire in complexion, and, after the Comtesse
de Pralinghem had made an incendiary speech in German about
atrocities committed in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, there had
been some talk of riding her on a rail out of town.</p>

<p>That at least had been Brother Hal's story. Henry Martin had
been at Dartmouth and, being at that time on bad terms with his
father, had not seen his relation till later. What he had seen of
her had not increased his pride of race. She had seemed a nasty,
toothless, dirty, very aged woman who took snuff, smelt of brandy
and talked French with a hideous accent. Hal said she had bought
her husband, the deceased Count, with money sent her by father and
he made disobliging surmises as to the Count's past.</p>

<p><br>
The aged man who had been descending the stone stade was clattering
on the flat rocks at Henry Martin's side. He was toothless,
wrinkled and aged like Aunt Hedwig. His neck was as deeply set in
his shoulders as a chimpanzee's, his arms as long. He squinted up
with difficulty at the skies and raising his arms as if they had
been a marionette's, flapped them, ill-jointedly, up and down, up
and down, with, at the end of them, hands like powerless hooks.</p>

<p>Henry Martin wondered whether it had not been the old man's
mahogany-coloured, wrinkled face that had reminded him of his aunt.
The wrinkles were ingrained with dirt. But they say that men about
to drown see their whole lives with extraordinary vividness. He had
certainly just seen Springfield much more plainly than he had ever
wanted to see it again after he first left it. He could have sworn
he had just been standing by the level-crossing over the railway
with the gates shut and the inextricable jumble, in that squalid
thoroughfare, of automobiles and horse-trucks that the cops never
succeeded in reconciling. There were all sorts of white marks and
lumps in the roadway. There were more of them pro rata in
Springfield than in all New York with Chicago thrown in. Why did
provincial cities have to go to these excesses?</p>

<p>Brother Hal said nothing in the world would induce him to drive
his Buick down those streets again. He himself would certainly
never again tread its unrepaired sidewalks. He had once or twice
returned there&mdash;at the dictates of conscience&mdash;after he had broken
irrevocably with the old man. Hal, he presumed, had inherited their
father's impetuous, wild boar's obstinacy. He himself had perhaps
more of his mother's New England conscience and determination. It
worked out at something very like irresolution. Few
people&mdash;certainly few young men of his generation, free and male,
had by the age of thirty-five made as much of a muddle of their
lives. He seemed never to have been free for a minute till that
moment. He presumed he might call himself male.</p>

<p>But at that moment he was being resolute enough. The old
man&mdash;Marius Vial, the proprietor of the inn and half the boats in
the harbour&mdash;was undoubtedly urging him not to go out. He was
reciting the long incomprehensible sorty of seventeen boats that
had been sunk by a <i>trombio</i> off the end of Cap Cépet, at the
end of the peninsula of St. Mandrier. Out there!...</p>

<p>He hooked a claw into Henry Martin's forearm and waved his other
flibbertigibbet arm at the distant promontory with its slopes of
fir woods.</p>

<p>Henry Martin considered that, to the old man, he must present an
aspect of inflexible Nordic valour. He had laughed, disengaged his
arm and continued striding towards the land end of the little pier.
The old man might be right&mdash;but again he might be wrong. He had
grappled himself to Henry Martin's side every day for an hour or so
during the past serene-weathered week and had recited the story of
the <i>trombio</i>&mdash;a local dialect version of the word
<i>trombe</i> which means a cloudbreak. And every day he had
dissuaded Henry Martin from going out. That might be sympathetic
fear. It might also be just business. Henry Martin had hired the
boat for a week from Olive, Marius Vial's grandson&mdash;but the boat,
like the hotel and every stick in it, belonged to the old fellow.
The old fellow might very well want him to get as little hire out
of it as the recital of the storm could make him. On first hearing
the story he had actually not gone out. But during the succeeding
twenty-four hours there had not been a breath of wind on the glassy
sea. This time he was going!</p>

<p>He was, however, worried about the boat. What would happen to
it? It was, it is true, insured. Old Marius Vial had seen to that
before he would begin to think of letting his grandson hire it out
to a visitor. He would be doing the Vials no harm. But the thought
of the boat, drifting empty, was very disagreeable to him. You
should not treat boats like that. A boat manned had a dignity, as
if a purpose. Even anchored or hitched to a buoy its dignity does
not desert it. It waits; it broods; it retains a personality. It is
all right hauled up on a beach. It has stability. But drifting,
lurching clumsily to an unexpected wave, exhibiting parts usually
hidden, a boat is degraded. You should not degrade boats any more
than you should mishandle tools or maltreat animals. A boat adrift
is like an ownerless dog, the tail and ears drooping, the gait
furtive.</p>

<p>The problem of the boat had worried him a great deal. A story he
had heard had returned to him again and again whilst he had been
pondering the problem at odd moments during the last six or seven
days. He had heard the story in Lowland Scotland&mdash;from a red headed
Scotsman married to a Chicago girl. The girl had had a name that in
Chicago stank of dollars and eatables. Henry Martin had wondered
that Ferguson had had an ancient and battered car of an extinct
model. Ferguson had explained that the chauffeur would not let him
have a new one. The car was the chauffeur's pride. He wanted to
drive it for ever, scattering nuts and bits of radiator all over
the countryside&mdash;to show what he could do! He said he would prove
that he could get more out of it than the chauffeur of the people
on the next estate who had a brand new, silver Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>Ferguson had told him the story as a comment on his chauffeur
and on how people regarded their implements and vehicles once they
had got attached to them and credited them with individualities. An
aviator&mdash;or at any rate a man who had owned a plane for a long
time&mdash;had also a wife to whom he was as attached as to his plane.
He found his wife had a lover. Life ended for him. He invited the
unsuspecting lover to take a flight with him. He intended to smash
the plane and put an end to both of them.</p>

<p>He couldn't do it&mdash;not because he was afraid of Death but
because he could not bear to put a slur on the fair fame of his
plane. People would think she had failed him. And, still more, he
could not bear to make her do wrong because she would feel
humiliation.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had felt the same about his boat. It is true that
he had run her only about a fortnight&mdash;but a fortnight of continual
society is ample to make you intimate with boats or people. He had
loafed, drifting all about such of the sea as was there visible,
doing nothing&mdash;as if he had been immured in the boat. Shut in on
himself! It had not perhaps been good for him. But what did that
matter? He was beyond good and evil.</p>

<p>He had chosen with great deliberation the place at which he
would step off the boat. The great harbour had a mole&mdash;if that was
what you called it?&mdash;a sea wall with two openings for the passage
of warships. At each opening was a little lighthouse with a
guardroom for signallers. It was their duty to watch events in the
harbour. Therefore Henry Martin had resolved to end it about fifty
yards from the left-hand lighthouse&mdash;fifty or a hundred.</p>

<p>A certain fastidiousness may be allowed to one in the choice of
the place of one's end! In any case he assumed that right, and
there was no one to stop him. He had passed over the chosen spot
several times in the course of the last week. Once he had put the
boat about three or four times on a course of a couple of hundred
yards. If it had been murder he was planning you could with full
warrant have said it was premeditated.</p>

<p>He had gone close in under the terrace of the little lighthouse.
The sentry had called to him to stop and had asked him if he were
practising for the speed boat races. That proved that they watched
the proceedings of even the smallest boats. For smugglers, no
doubt!</p>

<p>He had answered, No, he had dropped a pocketbook overboard and
had been trying to recover it...</p>

<p>Was one, then, as fastidious in lying as in the choice of the
place of one's end? Wouldn't it have been just as easy to accept
the lie the sentry had provided for him? It was in any case what
the Jesuits would justify as a lie of necessity. He could hardly
have told the fellow that he had been cruising back and forth over
the place where he intended to end his life. In order to insure
that the last landscape his eyes would see would be agreeable to
him. It would certainly be agreeable. On the one hand the island
towered up, near by, dark with pines and chestnuts because it was
the north slope. Close to him would run the white mole that kept
the heavier waves of the open sea from the harbour...and, far
beyond the waters of the outer harbour, the façades of houses,
irregular in height, white as a general colour and basking in the
sunlight. Arid mountains towered up behind.</p>

<p>He had disliked the cold sea that you saw from Nantucket or
Portland, Maine. That was perhaps due to his inland birth and
inland origins. You could hardly think of an inhabitant of
Springfield or the descendant of Luxemburgers as a sailor. But he
had had, in his time, a cruising yawl and then a speed boat on Lake
Michigan and, to the little, glassy, azure, sunlit Mediterranean
coves and harbours he had taken exactly as a duck takes to
water.</p>

<p>The sentry, leaning over the balustrade that surrounded the
lighthouse had jeered at him for letting his pocketbook go
overboard and, still more, for thinking he could recover it from
the sea. He had said that it might be washed on to the landing
steps and asked Henry Martin for his name and address. Henry Martin
had replied:</p>

<p>'Henry Martin Aluin Smith, Hotel Belle Vue, Carqueiranne,' and
the sentry had waved his hand as the boat drifted away.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fellow really took him for a smuggler trying to pick
up a buoy. Or a spy trying to observe details of the fort whose
semaphore showed white on the outline of the island. Well, he would
learn the truth if he ever walked in the cemetery above the railway
behind the town. There would be the name on the lump of almond
rock...Or perhaps the sentry would read of the case in the papers.
Or perhaps he had not caught the name at all. Or perhaps he would
see him, Henry Martin, male, free and thirty-six, step over the
side of the boat.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, his father might refuse to go to the expense of
the tombstone. There was no knowing what his father would do. In
his thirty-odd years of acquaintanceship he had never sized his
father up. He was like a wild boar&mdash;like a mountain. Slumped down
in his round-backed office chair as if he would never move again,
but occasionally lifting a heavy hand and dropping it. Behind his
little, watchful eyes his thoughts ran round and round&mdash;actively,
no doubt. He was tyrannical, cunning, intelligent, sentimental,
vindictive and completely without shame. He must be rising
sixty&mdash;but still of immense physical strength and very little
bowed.</p>

<p>He could not be said to have modelled himself on the old-school
American Merchant. He was too obtuse to model himself on anyone.
But it worked out like that. Perhaps the Europeans who came to
America had to be fitted to work out true to type if they were to
succeed. To the type, mental and physical. Father certainly made a
good, representative American of the old-school&mdash;even to the
remorseless, overhung jawbone. He was indomitable and
passionate&mdash;but Henry Martin had never felt settled in his mind as
to what was his father's ruling passion. It was no doubt centred in
Smith's Pisto-Brittle...But what did he see in that simple business
edifice? There was no knowing. He hardly seemed to wish to extend
its fame to the extreme corners of the continent. Once he had said
to Henry Martin:</p>

<p>'Don't you believe you're going to come into a lot of millions.
I shall never die worth more than a million and a half!' So that
even if Henry Martin pleased him to the day of his death he could
not expect to have more than three-quarters of a million. It was
not a great sum to receive after having played the sedulous
ape...for fifty years. There was no reason why father should not
see eighty.</p>

<p>The reward had not seemed good enough&mdash;either to Brother Hal or
himself. Hal had simply cut and run&mdash;into engineering. He seemed to
lead a riotous and successful life with a good humoured, healthy
Swedish girl he had picked up&mdash;mostly on the Alaska-Canada border.
When the couple of them hilariously descended on
Springfield&mdash;usually, of course, in the winter&mdash;they united in
windy vitality to make fun of that city, of the old man, of Henry
Martin, and of Sister Carrie if she happened to be there for
Christmas. How the old man regarded Hal and Greta there was no
knowing. When they actively displayed their satisfaction with each
other and turned the house upside down the old man merely
blinked&mdash;as if at sunshine in a high wind. He said nothing. Sister
Carrie kissed him good night on the bald forehead. He blinked. It
might be pleasurably; it might not.</p>

<p>But when he, Henry Martin, had had his tumultuous affair with
Wanda, the old man had said:</p>

<p>'One sixty-horse power Swedish nightingale is quite enough
sunshine in the American home.' So he might have been jeering at
Greta. But he might not. It might have been as if he had said&mdash;as
he did say&mdash;that such and such a proportion of milk-butter was a
good thing in Pisto-Brittle de luxe, but too much spoilt the
crispness.</p>

<p>Equally, you couldn't tell how he took the Van Heldenstamm
family. When Aunt Hedwig had imported that beetle-browed, lanky,
greasy-accented piece of Belgian aristocracy to Springfield with
the avowed intention of marrying him to Carrie, the old man had
uttered no objections. Mother had been delighted. Poor mother! She
had pointed out the analogies that existed between old New England
families and the European aristocracies. They&mdash;she and her
children&mdash;through the Huntingdons of Dorchester, Massachusetts,
were undoubtedly, if mysteriously, descended from the Earls of
Huntingdon. The most famous of that family had been the great Robin
Hood&mdash;who was certainly a democratic figure in that what he took
from the rich he gave to the poor.</p>

<p>But no doubt a great part of the pleasure that poor mother had
taken in the anticipated noble alliance had come from the fact that
it put her level with father. She was to have an authentic Countess
of her own blood to score against Aunt Hedwig. That some sort of
rivalry existed between poor father and mother was indubitable. It
manifested itself on her part in half tones of the voice; on his
part, in chuckles that were barely audible. These symptoms might be
presumed to occur when either had scored off the other&mdash;as if each,
on occasion, should say: 'I told you so!'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had not the least idea what it was all about...No
doubt about minute points in the housekeeping, the cooking,
father's indigestion. Or his clothes and behaviour on social
occasions. They were obviously the best of friends, but father's
tastes in ties and trouserings were flamboyant and he stuck to his
gold-headed cane long years after the habit of carrying such
articles had passed from the Middle West. If the cane had been of
malacca with smooth, rich-looking gold for its handle it might have
passed. But it was of ebony and had elaborate gold-chasings in the
worst style of the eighteeneighties. The perfectly genuine gold
extremity looked as if it were the cheapest of gilt brass.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the gorgeous wedding in the Roman Catholic
church was over, father let the cane be wrapped up in tissue paper
and put away in the mahogany chest of drawers in the bedroom. And
he gave up railing at the New England vegetable plates and
pot-roasts that poor mother insisted were essential to his health.
That was the symbol that poor mother was, for the rest of her life,
to dominate him completely.</p>

<p>It might have been indeed that he had lost all spirit when he
lost Carrie. He was probably deeply&mdash;deep-rootedly&mdash;attached to
her.</p>

<p>At any rate, before consenting to the marriage, he had called
her into his office and, fingering her necklace pathetically as she
stood before him, had asked her if she really knew what she was in
for if she married Van Heldenstamm. He drew for her vivid pictures
of the habits of the Belgian aristocracy. They were apparently the
only aristocracy left that were aristocratically outrageous in the
old style. They carried off each other's wives on coal-black
chargers, shot injured husbands across the moats of chateaux,
kidnapped the children awarded by courts to injured spouses,
flogged their butlers, maintained harems in Brussels, Ghent,
Antwerp or on their properties under the nose of their wives. They
had, the old man said, all the black properties of the old-time
Spaniards and Netherlanders from whom they drew their blood. And he
pointed out that if Van Heldenstamm proved an exception Sister
Carrie couldn't expect to find in Europe the freedom and the
affection that young American girls expected as theirs of right. At
best the life of a European chateau is one of unceasing calls on
you. There are the servants, the priests, the peasants, the poor
neighbours, making perpetual calls on your purse, your needle, your
poultry yard and, above all, your time. He would not want a
daughter of his, if she was to occupy a prominent position in a
country bordering on one that had been his own to occupy that
position with any want of dignity...</p>

<p>As far as Henry Martin could see, the old man had come with more
dignity himself out of that interview than out of any other that he
had had with his children. Perhaps he had felt it more! With Henry
Martin and Brother Hal he had never come off well. Brother Hal had
simply defied him at every turn. He had done what he wanted, never
asked his father for a penny and had prospered boisterously in
half-opened territories and markets. He had worked on bridges in
Spain, Mexico, Sweden, Buenos Aires, and New Mexico&mdash;on the
machinery of gold mines in Ballarat, South Africa and now, in the
Klondike. He had earned good money and had even now a good sum
invested in one or two inventions that, in spite of the times, were
beginning to do well.</p>

<p>His own career Henry Martin was shy of recalling in this his
final review of it. He was strolling desultorily along the pier.
Old Marius Vial, having given up the struggle to dissuade him, had
hobbled forward to gloat over the boat as he gloated over all his
property.</p>

<p>What was the good of reviewing a career that was so soon to run
inside a lump of pink granite with one polished side? As if it were
an automobile running into its last garage. He didn't want to think
of his perpetual wanderings with Springfield as a base&mdash;the town to
which he had as perpetually returned to make new beginnings. And
new excursions under the sardonic eyes of his father...Surely if
father had loved his wife he would have shown more sympathy with
the aspirations of her son!</p>

<p>He had never seemed to.</p>

<p>Their first wounding and atrocious quarrel had come just after
Henry Martin's return for the first time from Dartmouth. He had
still been a freshman and still had ambitions to become a writer.
Over that they had not directly quarrelled. Not ostensibly!</p>

<p>If he was now thirty-five he ought to have been born in 1896.
Actually he had been born in 1895. He would be thirty-six in three
months' time...But he would not, of course. 'He would have been'
was perhaps the way to express it. It was a mistake to have been
born in the nineteenth century when the whole of your life was to
be passed in the twentieth.</p>

<p>Carrie had been born on July 11th, 1894. It was just over a
month since he had sent her his last birthday telegram. Hal had
been born on January 9th, 1901...It was perhaps a mistake to have
been born between an early maturing, soft natured sister and a
brother much smaller than oneself. He had no doubt been rendered
soft by his sister's solicitude...It was not good for a boy to go
to his first socials under the wing of an elder sister. It had got
him into the early habit of relying on women for advice and
support.</p>

<p>Carrie had been married early in 1915&mdash;when she had been just
under twenty-one. He had been at Dartmouth...was it a year, then?
He was not certain. These dates confused themselves. There were too
many of them.</p>

<p>Mother had died in...yes, in late 1915. She had only had a
countess of her own blood for four months! And a son at Dartmouth
for fifteen.</p>

<p>He had come home for her death. She had, it then appeared, only
just kept up for the wedding and had been under opiates for most of
the time since then. The old man must have suffered like hell all
those months. But to Henry Martin he had seemed merely callous.</p>

<p>Coming home from the funeral he had gone straight to the kitchen
door and had shouted to the cook in Luxemburg Flemish that she
would cook Luxemburg fashion from then on. He had afterwards gone
up to his bedroom, opened the drawer and taken out from its tissue
paper his gold-knobbed cane.</p>

<p>Coming straight back from college triumphs Henry Martin had
regarded that as an offensive assertion of recovered freedom. At
Dartmouth he had been quite popular. He had had money to throw
away. He stood already six feet in his gym shoes and was very large
boned. Taking college life with immense seriousness he had united
to a studiousness sufficient to make him stand very well with the
English teaching staff, a zealous observance of fraternity
necessities. He had, too, a great devotion to athletics. He was
light of foot in spite of his weight, very muscular and of
remarkable balance for a cub. He knew that he was already under
observation for the Rhodes Scholarship list of 1916.</p>

<p>Three days after mother's funeral father had sent for him to the
office and had told him that he would not be going back to
Dartmouth. His blinking eyes had watched Henry Martin's face with
the effect of a medieval executioner taking stock of the emotions
of a victim to whom he had announced sentence of death. He had said
simply:</p>

<p>'You won't be going back to Dartmouth.' Without any breaking of
the news.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had stood like a pole-axed ox. Swaying.</p>

<p>After a long time father had added:</p>

<p>'You will be going to learn the business from the bottom.
American fashion. Stoking. Boiling. Cutting. Packing. Carting,
travelling, retail selling. Boy clerk. Head
cashier...Partner...Sole owner.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin did not think he had shown himself wanting in
resolution. Then, or ever! Then why did he seem like Hamlet to
himself? He was now bronzed to the shade of a quadroon, over six
feet in his stockings. He was perhaps too aware of his height, ft
had done him no good.</p>

<p>Conscious of his own prowess on the football field he had asked
his father: Was wrapping candy the job for a fellow who stood over
six feet? His father had heaved his great bulk humorously back in
his chair. Henry Martin had been conscious, then, that he had
behind him he did not know how many generations of ancestors all,
like his father, six feet two and over. And&mdash;back into the remotest
recesses of time!&mdash;they had all wrapped toffee in the Grand Duchy
of Luxemburg.</p>

<p>He had no instinctive repugnance for the trade. Even in the
social stiffness of Magdalen College, Oxford, England, he had not
felt ashamed of his descent. Not amongst the descendants of a
hundred belted earls.</p>

<p>He had got his Rhodes Scholarship all right&mdash;at the cost of
working as a dishwasher and cleaner in his off moments at
Dartmouth. Or a little perhaps because of it! The governing
authorities of that place of education had no doubt looked with a
kindly eye on that gentle six-footer who indomitably washed dishes
and scrubbed floors&mdash;in the determination of being a scholastic and
athletic honour to his Alma Mater.</p>

<p>He had got to Oxford all right. But he had not stayed there
long. He had found the dreaming spires as disagreeable as the
Lutheran College of Springfield, Ohio. Not as painfully sordid but
more minatory. He felt that he would turn pudding-faced and
rice-milky in the brain. The war had been on then, of course, and
the contents of the cloisters and courts was distinctly what was
there called off-colour&mdash;or too coloured. He had found himself a
lanky giant amongst copper, coffee, or saffron-hued midgets&mdash;from
Paraguay, the hinterlands of Bengal or Monrovia. Or else they were
odd-come-shorts from obscure London suburbs with grotesque
names.</p>

<p>Other colleges indeed had been more highly-coloured in spots.
Once the Queen had been dining at Balliol and the more truculent
spirits of Magdalen had paraded before that college shouting:
'Bring out your black man, Balliol.' Balliol had amongst its
undergraduates at the moment the coal blackest negro that those
climes had ever seen.</p>

<p>In the return party Balliol had paraded before Magdalen
yelping:</p>

<p>'Bring out your white man, Magdalen.'</p>

<p>And they had seized on tall, white Henry Martin and dragged him
along the High whilst little, yellow and particoloured fellows had
tried to rescue him.</p>

<p>He had frequently wondered whether that confusing experience had
not considerably influenced his life. For the worse! At any rate it
had been there that, as far as he could remember, he had for the
first time wished seriously to be someone else. He had wished
intensely to be a certain broad-faced Japanese&mdash;a little man with
an immense mouth over-filled with gigantic teeth!</p>

<p>It was the measure of his discontent with himself that he should
have wished to be something so completely unpresentable. To have
wished to be a Japanese was unthinkable. But to have wished to be
such an ugly one!...</p>

<p>Yet on the face of it he had at that date nothing to be ashamed
of. He might, had he wished it, have been Smith's Pisto-Brittle,
Junior. That was a position equivalent&mdash;not to that of a crown
prince or an archduke heir-apparent...But equivalent to that of a
quite considerable earl's eldest son. Or he might have been well in
the running towards representing his country at the next Olympic
Games&mdash;and so a world hero, though at that date the Olympic Games
had seemed remote enough.</p>

<p>But he could have had his father's money if he had chosen to
pretend enthusiasm for his father's business. Or if he had chosen
to take a little trouble in the way of wire-pulling he could have
had the support of the professional speculators in brawn and muscle
who turn you into the meat of which heroes are made...</p>

<p>On the face of it his record when he had again faced his father
and Springfield had been one of sufficient toughness! He had
toughly defied his father, the dons of Oxford, the sergeants of a
British regiment. He had toughly followed the true national
tradition in performing menial functions in a café whilst proving
himself a credit to the place of his education.</p>

<p>Where then was the snag?</p>

<p>He was walking along the pier...towards suicide. Suicide is an
act of despair. Still more it is a confession of
ineffectualness.</p>

<p>Yet it calls for resolution...No, he had never been wanting in
resoluteness...Then...</p>

<p>It was as if he were not all of one piece. It was perhaps that.
Born in the nineteenth and having lived the great part of his life
in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Resolution was the note of the nineteenth, mental confusion of
the twentieth. Perhaps it was that.</p>

<p>He remembered motoring in a public motorbus in the Pyrenees last
year. An incredibly arid region of bare, piled up rocks. He had
been even then not so far from his bedrock bottom dollar.
'Anacondas' were hovering at the thirty mark. He had bought at
115&mdash;as an investment. With the highest possible advice. The man
who had advised him was said to have lost seventy million&mdash;out of
one hundred and twenty. It was very likely true, too...'Kennecotts'
had been even worse than 'Anacondas'.</p>

<p>Well, that arid region like one of the circles of Dante's Hell,
had made him think prophetically of 'Anacondas' at 15...And passing
their dividend as like as not!...So he had said to the fortyish
lady next him in the bus.</p>

<p>'What would you do if you found yourself on the roadside here?
Without a cent!'</p>

<p>His mind had run through a number of expedients. You could wire
to people across the Atlantic for funds, you could find the nearest
American Consulate and apply for relief...At that time he could
still have cabled to the First National...</p>

<p>The grey, firm-looking lady with brown eyes had gazed at him
with amazement.</p>

<p>'Do?' she had answered. 'What should I do...I should find a
job!'</p>

<p>He had felt crushed to abashment...That was the nineteenth
century speaking. America of the nineteenth century...She was
five...or at the most seven years older than he. A few years more
spent in that hardier century had sufficed to give her the gift of
incisive resolution. And Valour. She was ready to take her life in
her hands and establish it in that arid waste. At a moment's
notice...</p>

<p>What then was the matter with him?...He had had quite-a time-a
full year, whilst Anacondas and the rest wavered slowly down
1015&mdash;14&mdash;13...like a flock of sheets of paper dropped from a
height and darting sideways; to right, to left, inward,
outward...but always down. He had had a full year in which
impatiently to watch that decline and to know that destitution
approached. He had known that he would ultimately find himself
where he now was...In a stern, if not arid, district of the
South...Without a cent...</p>

<p>That lady had looked out over the side of the bus at the pink
rocks and, without a moment's hesitation, had declared that she
would find a job...He had hardly so much as written a line. It had
been before the publication of his unfortunate book. Yet he had
gone to Paris and settled there...as a 'writer.'</p>

<p>On the occasion of his momentous and quivering interview in
1915&mdash;sixteen years ago&mdash;he had told his father he intended to
'write.'...He was going to get a Rhodes Scholarship and then with
the requisite culture behind him follow in the footsteps
of...Shakespeare...Goethe...Possibly Sainte-Beuve...</p>

<p>His father had looked at him with little, twinkling, chuckling
eyes. For a long time. Then he had said:</p>

<p>'My boy...if you want to hitch your wagon to a star you can. But
not on my money!' He had lifted his hand and dropped it heavily on
the desk. He had added:</p>

<p>'Never!'</p>

<p>Henry Martin, at Dartmouth, had found himself attracted to the
group that ran the collegiate periodicals. They had all announced
themselves as having the intention of 'writing.'...Just writing,
without much intimation of whether they intended to produce verse
or prose, novels or volumes on metaphysics.</p>

<p>His father had chuckled again and had repeated:</p>

<p>'Yes, my boy. Hitch your wagon to a star. But not on my
money...You come of an honourable line of sugar boilers...I assure
you they would all turn in their graves...Yes; turn in their graves
if they thought the tombstone of one of their family would say
"lousy ink-slinger"...Yes..."Lousy inkslinger."'</p>

<p>In his rare anti-American, or rather anti-New England moments
when debating with mother, father was accustomed to cite the phrase
about the wagon and the star with derision as proof of New England
craziness...It was the product of a New England writer...Holmes
maybe. Or Emerson.</p>

<p>'Hitch your wagon to a star!' he used to exclaim, rolling his
shoulders against the back of his chair. 'Who ever heard of such
nonsense! Ain't hitchin' posts good enough for Fall River?'</p>

<p>Poor mother, who was reduced to silence when father really
kicked over the traces, would say that the sentiment was
allegorical and beautiful. The old man would go on jerking in his
chair till he had become motionless and exclaimed earnestly,
leaning forward and demonstrating with his short fingers:</p>

<p>'Why, if you hitched your wagon to a star it would go flying
away. Maybe it would knock other stars out of their places. Then
your candy would fall all over the world...A nice figure you would
look! And they'd carve on your tombstone: "Phaeton of Fall River
fell in the river."'</p>

<p>His mind ran on tombstones. European Teuto-Frankish minds still
did. Father, in private, thought Holbein's 'Dance of Death' the
finest humour in the world....And, when Henry Martin came to think
of it, he was not averse from thinking of tombstones himself. There
was a mural inscription at Antibes, a few miles from where he then
stood. It was on the wall of the Roman Theatre&mdash;to the memory of a
boy dancer who had died young.</p>

<p class="cp">'SALTAVIT. PLACUIT. MORTUUS EST.'</p>

<p class="cp">'He danced. He gave pleasure. He is dead.'</p>

<p>It would be nice to have that on one's tombstone. But he never
would. That would no doubt make his real epitaph&mdash;that he had never
given pleasure. He had certainly danced. Only last night he had
danced&mdash;well enough. But he could feel that he gave no pleasure to
the little, depressed French <i>poule</i> who was in his arms...He
could not attribute many sins to himself. But he had never given
pleasure. Not to his father; not to his college friends: not to his
Magdalen tutor: not to the sergeants of his British regiment. Not
to Wanda...certainly not to Alice. Not on necking parties in the
corners of woods with girls who had to neck someone or socially
fade...Well, he had danced, he had given no pleasure. He would
certainly be dead. In an hour and a half maybe.</p>

<p>The sun was now gloriously up. He was at the end of the pier.
Long, glutinous flakes of brilliance were reflected from folds of
the glassy water. In its translucent depths beneath his nose the
negligible <i>oursins</i> were like remote doorknobs. One of them
was dead. It was not brown but skeleton grey. What could be more
negligible than a dead sea-urchin? The most negligible thing in the
world!</p>

<p>He was going to step off the half-deck above the motor of the
boat&mdash;a hundred yards from the opening through the mole...Step off.
Like a sentry on his beat. Stiff! In a soldierly manner.</p>

<p>That was how he had arranged it with himself.</p>

<p>You could not dive effectively off a boat. Or he could not. To
slip over the side would, considering the circumstances, be
undignified. Like shuffling out of the world...But to step stiffly,
find nothing for the foot and chance what came...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-2" id="ch1-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Hugh Monckton Allard Smith had strolled across the floor of the
little <i>dancing</i> to where Henry Martin had sat beside the
silent and depressed <i>poule</i>. Hugh Monckton, who had been
rolling a cigarette as he walked, looked down on them from his
considerable height, and, still rolling, had remarked nonchalantly
to Henry Martin:</p>

<p>'Met you somewhere, haven't I? Know your face. Because it's damn
like my own.' He added: 'Would you pay for my drinks? I find I've
left my note-case at home.'</p>

<p>Enviable!...That was what he was. He seemed to have no shadow of
a doubt that Henry Martin would produce the money for his bill.</p>

<p>'If I were that fellow!' Henry Martin had said to himself with a
sigh...He had been wishing for a couple of hours that he were&mdash;that
he could actually become&mdash;that easy fellow.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton had been all evening with Gloria Sorenson and her
glorious back. When she had strolled away from him every half hour
or so to take her turn in the Casino next door they would hear the
applause. She would be back beside the fellow before it had quite
ceased. He had gone on sitting easily in his place. He had the air
of a graceful bridegroom.</p>

<p>He had sat, when she was there, with his brown hair mixed in the
golden waves of hers. They had gone on talking ceaselessly, her
glorious bare shoulders against his admirable polychromatic tweeds.
Occasionally, as if enclosed within a sphere of their own, they had
got up and walked between the tables to the floor. At once the
crashing of the Russian Orchestra died to nothing.</p>

<p>There were four fellows, always laughing, at a table in the
corner of the floor. Two had violins, one a ukulele. He was a high
yellow. And one had a miniature saxophone. He was pure negro. The
violinists were white, but black haired. They laughed all the time
and all the time inaudibly played with their instruments. Only,
when Gloria Sorenson went to take her turn, they strolled after
her, still laughing. And when she stood up with Hugh Monckton you
suddenly heard their incredible music which had been going on all
the time beneath the coarser noises of the Russians. These became
as suddenly almost mute.</p>

<p>No wonder that fellow could dance. Those two moved in each
other's arms with rapt expressions, as if a transparent sphere
surrounded them. To the measure of those extraordinary, laughing
players.</p>

<p>Henry Martin thought: 'I dare say I dance as well as that
fellow.' But he had never had such music. Those two moved about
with their own musicians, ready to play to them at any moment, with
that little, low, lilting, exciting music that in no way interfered
with your talking. Except that it seemed of itself to lift your
feet off the floor. He couldn't keep his own feet still. He wanted
to kick his legs about like a nigger at a barn dance.</p>

<p>The little <i>poule</i> beside him made desultory and mournful
remarks about Gloria Sorenson when she danced. She deprecated her
gleaming shoulders, the great expanse of her white back. She
suggested that anybody could be Gloria Sorenson&mdash;if only they had
the chance to be born <i>une étrangère</i>...In a foreign country.
No one had any use for French women in France nowadays...</p>

<p>Decidedly the conversation of the young woman had not been
exciting.</p>

<p>She seemed to be suffering from the world depression as badly as
anyone between there and Wall Street. She had drunk two gin fizzes
in the course of the evening. The only spark they seemed to elicit
from her had been the surprising information that an unpresentable
figure who sat motionless the whole evening at a little table next
that of the glorious couple was Gloria Sorenson's husband.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had combated this idea. It seemed to him
unthinkable. But the girl had insisted on it with
vehemence...almost as if with vindictive pleasure. Gloria Sorenson
might be an <i>étrangère</i>. Her contemptible dancing and
exaggerated legs, her shamelessly bare back and the imbecility of
men might, in combination, have made her the cynosure of half the
world. But <i>that</i> was her husband. All the city knew it.</p>

<p>The man was unbelievable. He was bullet-headed, immensely obese,
with an expression of lachrymose despair. He sat over the table,
humped on one supporting elbow as if he had been a sack-like
marionette that someone had thrown down there. From time to time,
when Gloria Sorenson had been away, the glorious young man had
addressed smiling remarks to him. Before him was an immense beer
glass. That from time to time the young man would fill&mdash;half from a
champagne bottle and half from a bottle of stout. Neither the young
man nor Gloria had drunk anything all through the evening. Yet
there were three empty champagne bottles and three empty stout
bottles on the table in front of them. The old fellow gulped off
his liquor with extraordinary velocity, humping down in the same
attitude between chair and table as soon as he had finished it.</p>

<p>The presence of the husband&mdash;if it was indeed the
husband&mdash;seemed in no way to depress the young man. Nor did it make
Henry Martin in the least less inclined to wish that he and that
fellow could exchange idendties.</p>

<p>It occurred to him as odd that, hitherto, when he had wanted
intensely to be someone else that someone had always been of
ignoble position, or apparently rather unfortunate. At the time of
the Magdalen-Balliol rag he had wanted to be a Japanese; once he
had desired to be a French policeman; once, a man selling papers
outside the Metropolitan Opera...These obsessions had always come
to him vividly at times of immense depression. During the Oxford
rag, apart from the noise and confusion of the moment, he had been
worried by his tutor, by the thought that Oxford was bad for his
psychology, by his position in regard to the World War. He had
wished to be a Paris policeman at a time when he had made
simultaneously two disastrous discoveries. One had been that he was
not suited for the career of a writer, the other that Alice was
insupportable for vulgarity of mind, manners and elegance. The
newspaper seller had synchronized with the eighth or ninth month of
the Wall Street Crash...</p>

<p>In each of these cases he had desired to become someone
presumably humbler than himself...Now he found himself intensely
wishing that he were a lord of the earth...Why?</p>

<p>That was simple. Whilst he had possessed anything at all or any
hope of a future he had been willing to make a pact with
Providence. He had been ready to surrender his possessions and
future in exchange for fewer possessions and hopes. On condition
that he could be released...from the worry of the World War, of
Alice, and of the financial perplexities of the Stock Market
crashes and eddies...But now that he had nothing and no hopes there
was nothing left but to pray to Providence to give him something
for nothing. It was as easy for Omnipotence to make him a lord of
the earth as a crossing-sweeper...</p>

<p>He tried to lose himself in imagining what it would be like if
he became actually that fellow...There would be a feeling of
physical lightness...The numbing sensation of the brain and eyelids
would not be there. It came with worries connected with finance and
women. This fellow was undoubtedly immensely wealthy. In the gossip
of the town&mdash;as reflected by the little <i>poule</i> at his
side&mdash;the fellow was said to be negotiating the purchase of Madame
Hauvrant's celebrated <i>Le Secret</i>&mdash;the famous yacht whose very
tall spars and black hull were such a feature of those seas.
Possessed of that vessel he was going to assume final control of
the blazing Gloria and detaching her from both her contracts and
her husband, to sail away towards endless bliss and idleness. In
tropical seas...</p>

<p>Physical lightness...You could stretch your limbs. You could
command things to happen at a distance. You could feel as if you
possessed the wings...the wings of a dove, to flee away, flee away,
and be at rest!</p>

<p>No wonder you could give pleasure with your dancing...There was
not a thin, numbing stream of lead within all your limbs.</p>

<p>Who the fellow was Henry Martin did not then know. The
inhabitants of the city&mdash;the <i>poules</i>, waiters,
commissionaires, <i>chasseurs</i> knew him as Smeez, <i>un
américain</i>&mdash;which was no doubt 'Smith' phonetically rendered.
Like all bearers of that unfortunate name Henry Martin was
sensitive to the extent of tracking out distinguished 'Smiths.'
There were Smiths in America who were distinguished in all trades
and occupations. But he could not think of any that was
overwhelmingly distinguished. This fellow seemed to have the
consciousness of overwhelming distinction in every gesture.</p>

<p>Yet, ironically, Henry Martin imagined that they must be
physically very much alike. They must have been both almost exactly
six feet in height. They were both loose-limbed and erect. They
could both be said to have broad, as it were, frank brows, earnest,
slightly frowning, brownish eyes: brown hair waved slightly over
the foreheads and they had rather short-clipped brownish
moustaches...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had never had any but a vague idea of what he
himself would look like to an outsider. He was little given to
looking at himself in glasses though at times when he had still
considered himself as a 'writer' he had consciously scrutinized his
reflection to see if it showed any traces of genius or talent. Or
even of intelligence! He had never been able to discover any. But
when you look into mirrors you stiffen your features. When you
think you discover expressions of genius in others their faces are
usually in motion.</p>

<p>It occurred to him to consider that if he hadn't had the idea of
being a writer he would not be there. He would never otherwise have
settled in Paris. Alice would have had no excuse for urging him to
that step. It had seemed to offer to her unlimited chances of
highballs, exhibiting herself, and exchanging dubious stories with
dubious companions...And of embroiling him still more deeply with
his father...Pisto-Brittle was one of the few things that seemed to
have flourished all the more because of the Wall Street Crash. The
inhabitants of Springfield and the surrounding territory had by
chewing more candy consoled themselves for having to do without
more costly pleasures...</p>

<p>In any case, it had frequently in the old days occurred to him
that if he met himself in the street he might well not recognize
himself. On the other hand, if he met that other fellow he might
very well imagine it was himself he was meeting.</p>

<p>There was nothing very remarkable in that. They were both
ordinary&mdash;in the sense that they were of not unusual types and had
undergone identical trimmings and parings. They had probably sat
under the same manicurists, barbers, tailors, tutors and preachers.
He seemed certainly to have met the other sometime,
somewhere...That fellow was probably Princeton&mdash;a product that much
resembled what Dartmouth turned out...Princeton and then very
possibly Oxford, too. With just a touch of the World War...There
was certainly a slight look of the soldier about him. Indeed,
vaguely, Henry Martin found himself connecting him with the
associations of the short, troublesome period he had passed before
being turned out of the English Army...He had been perpetually in
trouble with the sergeants on parade. He had been in those days
stubborn and it had not seemed to him as of infinite importance in
the winning of the World War that a free born American
citizen&mdash;free, male, and twenty-one&mdash;should stand motionless with
his feet at an angle of forty-five degrees, his thumbs exactly in
contact with the seams of his trousers...until someone entirely
uneducated barked a noise that meant you to jump to it!</p>

<p>Fortunately it had been discovered that he wrote an excellent
hand, could add correctly, was sober, cleanly and athletic. So he
had gone little on parade but had been kept in what they called
orderly room, sitting on wooden benches covered with horse
blankets, making out endless returns. He had considered that that
in itself was a symptom of the way Fate was inexorably determined
to display him as ineffectual. He had enlisted in the British Army
with the idea of showing that America though officially neutral
was, at heart, just as ardently determined as anyone else to make
this a world fit for free men...But Fate decreed that he should be
put to almost exactly the same ignominious sort of job as that
offered him by his father.</p>

<p>He tried to take it out of Fate by being as undisciplined as he
could. But undiscipline had been difficult to exhibit. If he didn't
there call officers 'Sir,' they didn't bother about it. If he got
out of his bed late no one bothered as long as he did his returns
all right...and he did not get his breakfast. His buttons and kit
were always irreproachable because, at the very beginning of his
service, he offered a poor devil a dollar a week to look after
them. The poor devil had had an aged Welsh grandmother whom he
helped to support, so Henry Martin had never had the heart to take
away his employment. And as he was by a long chalk the most
redoubtable half-back of the battalion's football team and was
indeed spotted as quite likely to play for the Welsh against
England in the Army team, officers taking orderly room would merely
shake their heads at him if he were charged with being late
returning to barracks.</p>

<p>He had in those days&mdash;for the only time in his life!&mdash;been
something of a hero. The low-class scum who were his comrades
considered him a devil of a fellow&mdash;lawless, desperate&mdash;and as
wealthy as Croesus...He could at least say for himself that during
those months&mdash;<i>saltaverat</i>...he had jumped, in the football
field had given pleasure...to scum!...You could translate
<i>saltavit</i> by 'jumped' as well as 'danced.' The Roman youth
had no doubt done both.</p>

<p>He didn't know why, at that moment, these associations should
come so strongly over him...What was that absurd period of five
months to him...now? He was at the end of his trivial tether. If he
were going to commit suicide on the morrow it was as much perhaps
because of the dread of the French police as for any other reason.
Yet he was merely at the end of his money. And humiliated. He was
no kind of criminal. He did not suppose he would mind being a
criminal. He simply wasn't one!</p>

<p>In his army career&mdash;when he had won fame!&mdash;he had certainly
arrived at being a military criminal. He had been absent for a
whole night which he had passed in a hotel in Newport, Mon. The
military police had taken him back to his battalion under escort
and he had passed a week-end in cells&mdash;the bloody clink, as they
called it.</p>

<p>He had discovered that he had not liked that...And the discovery
had humiliated him. At the beginning of the exploit&mdash;whilst
throwing his money about in the Newport bars&mdash;he had been inclined
to regard himself as resembling his ancestor&mdash;by his mother's
account&mdash;Robin Hood, Earl of Huntingdon. He had imagined himself
defending the poor, bloody Welsh Tommies against the ignorant
brutal oppression of their English superiors. He could not see why
men should be made martyrs to spit and polish or why they should
have to jump to it when an English <span class=
"smcap">n.c.o."</span> barked. That seemed no way to make the world
free for Democracy. It had appeared to be merely aping the Enemy
Nation. He imagined that if the United States had entered it they
would have gone into it heads down, waving guns and swearing...as
Colonel Roosevelt's Rough Riders had done with satisfactory
results, at Guantamarro...or perhaps it was not Guantamarro...At
any rate in the war for the liberation of Cuba from tyranny...He
had boasted a good deal about that in the Newport saloons. And he
had boasted about it still more to the Red Caps&mdash;the regimental
military police&mdash;He had even said that he being an American citizen
they could do nothing to him.</p>

<p>But in the bloody clink he had got cold feet. The clink was
merely a perfectly impassive, clean, cube of space enclosed in
three-ply boarding. There was no cruelty about it: it was merely
impassive. The lightlybarred windows gave on to a green park where
the men did exercises. When they didn't, the white peacocks of the
Marquess of Bute walked about there. The Marquess had been a rather
nervous Tommy, employed like himself over accounts in the battalion
orderly room. He had been accustomed in secret to think it was some
orderly room. It employed not only the heir to Pisto-Brittle but
the premier Marquess of England.</p>

<p>Then, in the clink, looking at the white peacocks with their
mincing gait, he had suddenly had a revulsion of feeling...after
all, this system employed in its lowest jobs the great of the
earth...No doubt, since they were intelligent, sober, and since
noblesse oblige they ought to prove disciplined. Then they should
surely be given opportunities of distinction: of proving themselves
useful on a larger scale...His thought of that day had of course
been youthful. But he was already a little ashamed of himself. He
had arrived at the conclusion that the Ruling Classes should stick
together wherever they found themselves. After all it was they who
controlled the bloody clinks, whether in Springfield, Ohio, or
South Wales.</p>

<p>The orderly officer's usual round, inspecting prisoners, had
rather confirmed than interrupted his train of thought. He had
marched, he remembered, up the cinder path and had stood before him
at attention, a great deal more smartly than he had ever stood
before. The officer had looked at him rather sorrowfully after he
had asked him if he had any complaint. He had said, slightly
shaking his head:</p>

<p>'You're an American citizen, it appears...you allege it.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had enlisted as a Canadian to account for his
accent.</p>

<p>'Then,' the officer had said, 'you're obviously White Man Smith
of Magdalen.' He had added that he had been instructing the Balliol
O.T.C. at the time the rag had occurred. He said he would speak to
the colonel about it.</p>

<p>He remembered having envied the young officer&mdash;who nevertheless
appeared sad. He was also called Smith...Lieutenant Smith. He had
envied him&mdash;he had not wished to exchange identities with him. The
young fellow&mdash;just his own age&mdash;had had an ease, an assurance, he
himself appearing gawky and raw!...In the orderly room when he
pushed his hair back, puzzling over some return, you saw he had a
scar on his right temple&mdash;and some medals...</p>

<p>In front of the clink the fellow had talked to him sadly. Henry
Martin, he had said, was a man of some intelligence. Why did he
behave like this? He gave trouble to the officers who had enough,
God knew, on their hands. He gave trouble to the men, setting a bad
example...He was doing the work of the Enemy Nations...Every case
of insubordination that he put up might be said to make the Enemy
Nations or their sympathizers rejoice. He didn't suppose that Henry
Martin wanted that...</p>

<p>Henry Martin hadn't wanted that! The thought of the Teutonic
sympathizers of Springfield, Ohio, patting him on the back when
they heard of his exploits was remarkably distasteful to
him...Disagreeable old spectacled ladies and harsh-voiced Lutheran
novices...They would do that...The people who had proposed to run
his old Aunt Hedwig out of town on a rail...They were the great
majority in the city...He had not liked his old Aunt. She smelt of
brandy...Still...</p>

<p>He had said to the officer in front of clink that he certainly
did not want enemy sympathizers to rejoice.</p>

<p><br>
Some of his emotion in those days was even then very vivid in his
memory. He sat in a little dancing room of the Cote d'Azur, with
tinsel decorations and a Russian orchestra in white smocks with
scarlet embroidery. But he saw the green boughs of the trees over
the lightly barred windows of clink!</p>

<p>It had been a confused time...That was no doubt what was the
matter with him. He was perhaps one of the <i>génération perdue</i>
that the French talked of. The Lost Generation...They were said to
have been so disturbed in their equilibrium by the distortions of
the late war that they had no sense of the values of life...That
might of course be the case. But he could not see why he should
have been affected. He certainly had not taken the war hard. He had
shuffled, really, through it. Not of his own will. He had not asked
for easy jobs. They had just been given to him.</p>

<p>It came back to him as a period of fever. After fevers you do
not remember <i>what</i> has happened. Or you remember most things
only dimly. Then some things with great clearness...You wake up in
the night with an unbearable headache. The water glass is at a
great distance. You cannot get at it.</p>

<p>That had been just his case in the war. He could, he supposed,
disentangle its chronology if he tried. But he had never bothered
to try. He remembered the declaration of war in Springfield. Or
rather he didn't&mdash;because he had been recovering from a dull
carouse with some girl. Shut up in her father's house and afraid to
stir out in daylight for fear the neighbours saw him...And he
remembered the end of the war...Hearing of it in a mountain valley
in the Cevennes where he had been in charge of a saw mill and a
canning factory. Why should they have set up a canning factory in
the Cevennes? There was no knowing. Perhaps because of water power.
Most likely it was just a piece of graft. But why should he have
been in charge of it?...Well, that was because he had made for his
Captain a portrait that his Captain had found satisfactory...A fat
man with a blue grey walrus moustache&mdash;bulging out above and below
his new belt...The Captain had detailed him to look after the saw
mill and the cans...He had taken up Art by that time.</p>

<p>That had been to please Wanda...Or to please the memory of
Wanda. Because, of course, Wanda had given him up by then. At the
request of his father and her husband...Still he had gone on making
watercolours. Without enthusiasm...</p>

<p>There had not been any vividness about Armistice Day in the
Cevennes. Snow had already begun to fall up where the saw mill was.
One of the men had broken his leg and he had gone up with the
syphilis inspector to see about it. The saw mill had been higher up
in the mountains than the canning factory...Félicité had raised
Cain about his going up. Because of the snow and because he had
promised to take her in to Valence. She had raised Cain. She had
been certain he would fall down a ravine and be hidden by the snow
until next May. Then what would become of her if, as she
suspected?...</p>

<p>What in the world did they want with a U.S. Inspector of
Syphilis in Troops in a lost valley in the Cevennes? There weren't
any troops. Henry Martin had a corporal in charge of the saw mill.
That was the fellow who had broken his leg. And an artillery
quartermaster at the canning factory...Why artillery? Were they
going to use canned salmon for shells?...In the Argonne?...</p>

<p>The syphilis inspector had turned out to have no medical
qualifications. He was a poet by profession. Stoutish and
chuckling. He turned out doggerel about the local legends by the
hundred lines an hour...Legends about the religious wars of the
district...</p>

<p class="poem">'And so the battle this and that way
goes...<br></p>

<p>Hurrah for something in the mantling snows...'</p>

<p>The Inspector said that he had been marooned there because he
had discovered things that the Great Medical Staff had not wanted
spoken about. Henry Martin had strongly suspected they had put him
there because they could not bear his verse...</p>

<p>Anyhow their arts had done them proud...They had lived warm,
quartered in a good farm, low down. They had written verses and
made water-colour sketches and played craps and spit in the ocean
day after day. Félicité&mdash;who was well educated&mdash;would recite Victor
Hugo in her pink robe de chambre at bedtime.</p>

<p class="poem">'Enfant si j'étais roi je donnerais l'Empire<br>
Et mes flottes et mes something et mes something et mes
something...<br>
Pour un baiser de toi...<br>
Enfant si j'étais Dieu...'</p>

<p>He would give something else...It was Félicité's way of
suggesting that he did not requite her kisses with sufficient
passion. She wasn't mercenary. But her old mother would have
coerced him into marrying her if he hadn't kept his head. Or course
she hadn't been with child...</p>

<p>What had become of Félicité? A little clean browneyed filly. Or
the Syphilis Inspector? Or the Captain? Or all the
crowd?...Hundreds and hundreds with whom he had rubbed shoulders.
Friendly nearly all. Loud voiced. Roistering...Or even Wanda? She
did not appear to have made good. At Hollywood or anywhere else.
Yet undoubtedly she had talent...This Gloria Sorenson reminded him
of her&mdash;deep chested with luminous flesh, large nostrils and wide
mouth. She might have made a man of him if father hadn't butted
in.</p>

<p>Of all of them he had only kept track of Leopold Kuhn and, God,
he wished he hadn't...Though if it hadn't been Anacondus and
Kennecotts it would have been something else...As corporal in
charge of the Y.M.C.A. canteen in that accursed White Star
transport Kuhn had seemed a mighty potentate.</p>

<p>A hell of a ship with all those starving thousands on board! He
didn't even know whether it had been the fault of the shipping
company or merely of the grafters. He had had indignant ideas of
exposing the affair&mdash;but they had died away. He couldn't be said to
have suffered himself. His art had saved him. He had passed the
voyage on the poop&mdash;painting, in water-colour, portraits of the
officers of his regiment. That had cured him of ever wanting to
paint again. The sight of a tumbler of discoloured water still made
him inclined to vomit.</p>

<p>But his occupation had assured him of the right of access to the
canteen and the society of Mr. Leopold Kuhn when he wanted it. Kuhn
struck him as the calmest person and one of the greatest
<i>savoir-faire</i> that he had ever met. He cleaned his
canteen-zinc with great masterstrokes whilst talking of continental
literature. The impassivity with which he had his canteen cleared
of the starving, yelling soldiery by the Marines was enough to make
you respect him permanently. His canteen would be packed with the
upper parts of the poor doughboys six deep. They yelled and
gesticulated, their faces convulsed. Mr. Kuhn served them with
extreme deliberation in complete silence for the ten minutes that
the canteen was open. Then he would make a half-visible sign to the
Marine corporals and those pugilists would fall on the miserable
doughboys and heave them out of the confined space, down the pitch
black companion.</p>

<p>He would remove his great spectacles, close and open his eyes a
great many times, readjust his spectacles and begin throwing craps
with the Marines for who should cook the corned beef-hash or
<i>chile con carne</i> whilst the others played spoil five and
drank cocktails made from the applejack of which Mr. Kuhn had a
couple of casks beneath the zinc.</p>

<p>It wasn't till the vessel had been some days out that Henry
Martin had discovered the real state of affairs. Mr. Kuhn saw that
the Marine corporals who were detailed to help him and that Henry
Martin and one or two other fellows who were officially scheduled
to him as helpers but who really did odd jobs for the officers&mdash;Mr.
Kuhn saw that these were lavishly fed by the canteen. But there
were no stores at all on board for the soldiers. The holds were
completely filled with typewriters and sewing machines. Even some
of the cabins were occupied with that merchandise.</p>

<p>So that the men were actually starving. They had for dinner a
piece of bread&mdash;begged by the cooks from the British sailors&mdash;of
about the size and not much more than the thickness of a playing
card, and watergruel made with coarsely ground corn that the cooks
stole from the mangers of the horses on board. For supper they had
a couple of spoonsful of the same gruel.</p>

<p>The ships had been driven up north of Scotland in the evasion of
enemy submarines so even those rations had been halved. And when
Henry Martin had pleaded with Mr. Leopold Kuhn to let the canteen
be open a little more than for the two periods of ten minutes which
was all that he allowed, Mr. Kuhn answered phlegmatically that it
was forbidden by all the articles of his association and the
Secretary of State. Mr. Kuhn admitted that it seemed a shame. But a
deputation of the Women's Clubs of&mdash;Mr. Kuhn thought&mdash;Ohio,
Missouri and North Dakota&mdash;had waited on the department and
extracted that promise in the interests of the poor boys
themselves. The canteens were of course bone dry. But they purveyed
cigarettes. Some ladies of these states considered that cigarettes
were nearly as pernicious as drink...</p>

<p>The effect of that voyage, Henry Martin was now aware, had been
to cure him of all respect for the louder virtues...Perhaps for all
virtues! It&mdash;and all the enterprises connected with it&mdash;seemed to
be like a vast smudge across the landscape of his life...He could
almost mark the very moment when the sunshine of virtue&mdash;and of
vice&mdash;had gone out of it. That was of course unsophisticated. But
it had marked the last glow of conscious patriotism in him. Of
patriotism as a glow&mdash;and even of adultery as a glow!</p>

<p>It had been very shortly before his going out to France. He had
been sent as clerk to an officer who was supposed to arrange for
the embarkation of Ohio and Middle Western troops. At New York. As
the officer had not given more than half an hour a day to his
duties&mdash;which had been taken over obligingly by an officer once a
partner in the firm which belonged to the family to which Mr.
Leopold Kuhn belonged&mdash;Henry Martin had had the whole inside of a
week to himself. He had been very flush of money and having hired a
car had amused himself with exploring the State of New York.</p>

<p>It had occurred in a dilapidated village below Redding
Ridge&mdash;rather towards Danbury, Conn., than the other way. He had
persuaded Wanda to spend three days&mdash;and two nights&mdash;with him in a
summer boarding place on the Ridge. They had been waited on by the
most perfectly elegant coloured girl with a most amazing head of
unkinked hair. All around them at separate tables had sat elderly
ladies overflowing with sentiments of goodwill to the young hero
and his war bride. It had not been his first adultery. It had
certainly been his most glorious. Wanda had given to his nights
raptures that could only be read into the ends of fairy tales.</p>

<p>By day, a rather faded, blue woollen Norwegian garment masking
the extraordinary glow of her glorious flesh and most of her
amazing hair being hidden by a knitted purple cap like a tarn
o'shanter, she had resembled a bird of Paradise before it dressed
up for a party. She had a good, Scandinavian, utilitarian tinge to
her daytime personality. She believed in employing the shining
hours. Henry Martin had been compelled to paint in water-colours
the decayed villages that were sprinkled over the countryside,
whilst Wanda sat on a tree stump beside him and memorized a new
part in which she was understudying Miss.&mdash;&mdash; But Henry Martin
could not remember the name!...That gave to the last shining days
of his youth a feeling of duration and domesticity as well as of
glory.</p>

<p>He couldn't remember, either, the name of the village. It had
not been far from the Mark Twain homestead. They had smashed the
car up on the extraordinarily bad sunken road that ran along under
the ridge&mdash;near a pile of stones in a ragged little wood where a
huge bunch of rattlesnakes were sunning themselves. You might have
expected Norwegian Wanda to be scared of rattlesnakes. But she
hadn't been. She had pelted them with small rocks, leaning forward
to see where they fell and opening her large, healthy, rosy mouth
in great gusts of laughter when the sinister, dry, churning sounds
answered her efforts...She had been glorious, with her large mouth
and shining eyes that were in her moments of merriment, like those
of a fine dog that laughs when you wave a bit of stick as if you
were going to throw it...</p>

<p>They had walked on until they came to the village. They found a
farmer who agreed to take a couple of horses and tug the car after
them. Henry Martin had carried his colour and sketching board,
Wanda the bluepaper covered parts. The village had consisted of a
broad street of dust with, on each side of it, a border of grass
and then, beneath very tall, thin-leaved elms, the unusually high
gables of brown-shingled, dilapidated houses. As far as he could
remember the village had once been much more prosperous. It had
been the centre of a cotton-spinning industry that had long since
died. Or perhaps it had not been cotton. It might have been
wool&mdash;or lumber&mdash;or chair-making...But there were the high,
mournful, shadowed gables, suggesting very old European villages.
And Henry Martin remembered thinking that, if your prosperity had
departed, it was all one whether that had happened forty years ago
or four hundred. You were a relic of the past. There must, however,
have still been some inhabitants. In the street were a general
store, a drug store and a little one-windowed store where 'Miss
Twisden, Dressmaker,' manufactured and showed for sale, baby linen,
or at least crocheted caps.</p>

<p>Henry Martin wondered idly whether Pisto-Brittle could be bought
in either of the stores. But he remembered to have heard his father
say that he had never been able to penetrate into New England. And
they were just across the border of New York State&mdash;in
Connecticut.</p>

<p>An ice-cream wagon had come lumbering through the flat dust of
the road to the steps of the drug store. It had been then that
Henry Martin had felt his glow of patriotism. He did not believe
that any of the other nations taking part in the war had ice-cream
delivered daily in its remotest villages. This seemed to him the
high-water mark of civilization. The starving millions of Europe
could not any one of them show the like of that. Let alone the
other continents.</p>

<p>The episode remained among his other memories like a bright
spot.</p>

<p>Thunder had descended on his head immediately afterwards. One of
the old ladies at the boarding house had written to father to
congratulate him on his daughter in-law. The old man had stormed
down to war-time New York, seeming to add new noises to that
already sufficiently noisy city. He had however relapsed into his
wild boarish good humour as soon as he learned that Henry Martin
was not married to Wanda.</p>

<p>Henry Martin could not see what it mattered to his father whom
he married. Father let him go roaming about the world&mdash;or necking
in Springfield. He even appeared to have no views on masculine
sexual morality. His character did not hang together. When it came
to this marriage he got raging on to his hind legs. Why?</p>

<p>He blinked at Henry Martin with his inflexible little eyes and
said over and over again:</p>

<p>'No, sonny. It isn't this star that you're going to hitch your
wagon to. Not this star! You go find another...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had treated his father with cold indifference. He
did not see what his father could do about it. He was free, male
and still twenty-one. He imagined that, when the war was over, he
would be perfectly capable of supporting Wanda. In the meantime she
would be quietly getting her divorce. Her husband was a frank
undesirable&mdash;a possibly Norwegian violinist who led an unspeakable
life in Paris.</p>

<p>Two days later the troopship had sailed.</p>

<p>His father had seemed to get busy pretty soon. For quite a time
Wanda had written to Henry Martin every day. He had got her letters
in bundles in various odd corners of England and France to which
his military jobs had taken him. They were always connected,
ingloriously, with commissariat or supplies. He had never come
within two hundred miles of the enemy forces.</p>

<p>It had been difficult, even at first, to gather much about the
state of Wanda's feelings. She wrote singularly foreign English
considering that in her small parts on the stage she had no
noticeable accent. Her endearments which were unusually phrased
might have meant the deepest of passions; her assurances of
fidelity might have meant equally the deepest of passions...But
they might have meant nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Gradually her letters began to mention his father. The old man
seemed to have gone to Detroit to see her company play. They must
have become as thick as thieves. After all, they were both
European. It became a European sort of an intrigue. Father had
gradually persuaded her that the marriage could not possibly be a
success. Henry Martin had no means. He was a trifler. He was,
moreover, several years younger than the girl...</p>

<p>The effect of these conversations penetrated gradually to Henry
Martin in his Cevennes valley. They had driven him nearly mad. He
had written: he had cabled&mdash;two or three times a day...It was an
infamous lie to say that he was without means. Being of age he had
come into a third part of his mother's property. It consisted of
the drug store of her father and a small piece of real estate. The
drug store which was managed by a company was by now a good
property. He expected to draw from it as much as four or even five
thousand a year. On that they ought to be able to live comfortably
when these troubles were over...</p>

<p>Wanda's letters could not be said to grow colder. But they did
begin to allow weight to his father's arguments. She was certainly
three&mdash;nearly four&mdash;years older than he. At the time that seemed a
small matter. But as the years went by the difference would be more
perceptible. A young man of twenty-five married to a woman of
thirty was considerably handicapped.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had answered everything he could think of.</p>

<p>He remembered he had written frantically' and had indeed gone
almost out of his mind, shut up in the valley with his saw mill. At
the same time he was living with Félicité...If you had told him
that it was possible to be in love with one girl and live with
another he would have said that you lied. Yet the books were wrong.
Indeed when Wanda had come over to Paris definitely to break with
him he was already living with Alice.</p>

<p>Wanda had walked into the apartment on the Rue des Saints Pères
while Alice was laying the table for lunch. She had left her almost
incapable husband propped up against the wall outside, drumming a
tattoo with his hands behind him. The sun had shone into the
apartment and on the white, orange and blue of the Breton crockery
on the table.</p>

<p>A little, as he remembered, to his mortification she had hardly
taken any notice of the presence of Alice...though Alice was not
altogether unnoticeable. But Wanda had talked to him as if the
other did not exist. That was partly due to her stage habit of
mind, partly to her Scandinavian earnestness. She had not only
ignored the existence of all women who were not on the stage, she
ignored the existence of all human beings who did not practise one
or other of the arts. That point of view as a pious expression of
opinion was not unknown to Henry Martin. He had heard it at
Dartmouth amongst young men who intended to 'write' and at Magdalen
from a small clique who had called themselves the Ten, but were
better known as the Yellow Pants. These choice souls had all
expressed the opinion that a person who did not practise one of the
arts belonged to the outer darkness and was merely stuff to fill
graveyards. All these young men, however, had either gone into
their fathers' businesses or one or other trade or calling that
they would once have called bourgeois. So that, with the exception
of two who had stuck together and become reporters on a Brooklyn
paper, Henry Martin was the only one who had so much as used the
Arts as an excuse for a purposeless life.</p>

<p>It was upon that that Wanda had pitched as an excuse for
breaking with him. She had said that if he had followed the writing
career he had first professed to desire, or that of a painter into
which she had tried to urge him, the idea of breaking with him
would never have occurred to her. Henry Martin had reminded her
that there had been a war and that he had been a soldier. The war
indeed was still in being and he still in the service. It was the
period of the Armistice and he was doing commissariat work for such
American troops as remained in Paris, escort work for funerals or
at state appearances of diplomats. It was not glorious employment,
but, such as it was, it was his duty to see it through. He was at
the moment engaged on a laborious correspondence between the Army
Department and the French Authorities as to payment for the sewing
machines and typewriters that had filled the hold and cabins of the
transport in which he had come over. Mr. Leopold Kuhn had indeed
turned up again looking extraordinarily slim, athletic and graceful
in a handsome, modified, staff-officer's uniform. It had by now
reached Henry Martin's intelligence that his presence on board that
vessel had been far more connected with seeing these munitions of
war through the European Customs Houses&mdash;where, of course, they
paid no duty&mdash;than with the supply of cigarettes and coca cola and
stationery to the unfortunate troops. He was now interested in
making the French authorities pay for them, but in the meantime
found plenty of leisure for compiling a work on copper as employed
in German industries...</p>

<p>To the various excuses that he got out of his present
occupations, Wanda blazing in the bright room had replied merely
that she had been shocked...She pronounced it: 'Stchocked!' from
which he gathered that she was actually feeling some emotion. When
she was quite calm she watched her English accent very
carefully.</p>

<p>She had been shocked by the nature of his arguments in his
letters. When he had replied to his father's statements that he
would be unable to support her properly he had never once mentioned
his pen or his brush. He had proposed to keep her out of his four
or five thousand dollars a year. For what did he take her? She was
an actress in demand. Perfectly well able to support herself with
considerable luxury, but perfectly ready to leave the stage had
Henry Martin's career as either artist or writer needed that she
should remain beside him. But she was not ready to sit at his side
in an apartment in the Bronx or a suburb of Christiania. Nor yet
whilst he pursued the career of a stockbroker.</p>

<p>She had gone out several times during her long harangue or his
interruptions to place her husband in different positions&mdash;against
the wall, against the banisters, or on the stairs.</p>

<p>She said that if Henry Martin had proposed to follow an artist's
life&mdash;in a garret, a cottage in the wood or beside a glacier&mdash;she
would contentedly have followed him. She would even, if the
necessaries of life had proved lacking, have returned temporarily
to the stage to keep them going for a period.</p>

<p>She broke off to go and fetch in her husband whom she deposited
in a roundbacked armchair. He was an extraordinarily emaciated
fellow. He came back to Henry Martin as having had whitish rings
round sootblack eyes. He stood apparently for the arts and looked
very nasty, sunk down in his chair, his hands incessantly drumming
on its legs as they drooped beside them. A violinist he was. A
marvellous violinist. And doped to the eyelids.</p>

<p>She appeared to have brought him there as an exhibit. Exhibit A.
The sort of man a woman ought to devote herself to. He, Henry
Martin, was Exhibit B&mdash;the sort of man to whom a woman ought not to
devote herself.</p>

<p>It seemed queer to Henry Martin. There he was: free, male and
twenty-one. Six feet in his stockings. The picture of health and
moderation. He had indeed been thinking of taking up athletics
again and had lately visited several training places in Paris.</p>

<p>The other fellow just gibbered, leaning forward in his chair,
smiling as if with intense friendliness at the rest and making gay
remarks in an entirely unknown tongue.</p>

<p>It was no doubt the mothering instinct in Wanda.</p>

<p>She had eventually removed her husband and Henry Martin had
understood that the separation was to be final.</p>

<p>He had not even had time to make a remark to the completely
silent Alice. She had gone on laying and relaying the table. During
the intervals of Wanda's apostrophes he had been conscious of her
moving a tablespoon or putting the jug of yellow flowers in another
place on the table. With an abstracted manner, as if she had been
reflecting deeply upon the pattern made by the table service or
weighing in her mind the arguments put forward by Wanda.</p>

<p>They would no doubt have talked. But before the sound of Wanda's
voice was quite out of Henry Martin's ears the door which she had
left ajar was pushed open by the shoulder of Henry Martin's
father.</p>

<p>He stood in the doorway, a round, Dutch-looking pillow of
tightly encased flesh. His eyes rolled. He was exceedingly out of
breath. At last he brought out triumphantly the words:</p>

<p>'Another star!'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had never made up his mind whether by that father
had meant that Henry Martin would now be pressed to find another
star or that in Alice he had found one...He stayed to lunch,
lumping down into the chair that had been vacated by Wanda's
husband and wolfing down great quantities of the <i>blanquette de
veau à l'ancienne</i> that had been admirably made by the <i>femme
de ménage</i>...Henry Martin had to attend a parade at the Arc de
Triomphe at two. He went, leaving the old man with Alice.</p>

<p>He had by then been promoted to the rank of topsergeant, but,
since he had great difficulty in remembering which was his right
hand and which was his left, appearances on parades&mdash;which at that
time were rather frequent as A.E.F. troops were returned home&mdash;were
rather disagreeable to him.</p>

<p>The old man spent nearly two months in Paris. He had seemed to
have the time of his life which, for a Luxemburger in Paris, was
not difficult. There he had a rustic air which was not noticeable
in Springfield, Ohio. He looked like an enriched farmer from one of
the French northern departments and he showed&mdash;for a gentleman who
had not seen Europe for over thirty years&mdash;an astonishing knowledge
of how to amuse himself in Paris.</p>

<p>The mainsprings of his character had remained enigmatic to Henry
Martin in spite of that period during which they were together for
large parts of the day. His father and Alice were alone together
even more often, but Henry Martin never quite knew, either, how
they got on. They visited museums, galleries, theatres, operas,
variety shows. When Henry Martin could get leave for sufficiently
long they hired motors and visited such of the battlefields as were
then visible. Those of the Argonne where the A.E.F. had been so
mercilessly hammered were not available, Henry Martin believing
till the present moment that the French wanted to clear up those
spots a little so that Americans should not too plainly discern how
remorselessly Mangin had used up their troops. So Henry Martin
never saw scenes of patriotic interest to him. But they got once as
far as Luxemburg, a queer, suburban principality that very little
stirred the pulses of Henry Martin. His father&mdash;and indeed
Alice&mdash;had nevertheless what his father called a high old time
there amongst the friends of his boyhood and their sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>Sister Carrie came into the town to see them. Her husband,
because of a presumably too great toleration of the occupation of
the Grand Duchy by the late enemy, was not encouraged to visit the
capital of a state that was now enthusiastically pro-Ally. On the
other hand, as an American, Sister Carrie did not seem to have had
too good a time, at any rate after the United States had declared
war. She appeared worried, or at least abstracted. But, if she
confided in her father, he did not transfer her confidences to
Henry Martin. She was beginning to acquire the European veneer of
the great lady that was afterwards for a time to make her seem
disagreeable to Henry Martin.</p>

<p>In the Grand Duchy Alice was accepted as&mdash;or at any rate
presumed to be&mdash;the fiancee of Henry Martin.</p>

<p>What the old man thought about it there was no knowing. After
his first visit to the apartment in the rue des Saints Peres he had
never come there again. They on the other hand never penetrated
further than the entrance hall of a magnificent hotel in the Champs
Élysées where the old man installed himself. It was rather
presumed by Alice and Henry Martin that he had there found some
sort of feminine companionship. There seemed to be no reason why he
should not have. He led a lonely enough life in Springfield. Once,
from the promenade of the Folies Bergeres they saw him in a box in
company with a platinum-haired blonde who was covered with
diamonds. He began to grow obviously tired and to talk of
Springfield with some complacency...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-3" id="ch1-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>It had flashed suddenly through Henry Martin's mind that the
fortunate young man was the Lieutenant Smith who had interrogated
him outside the regimental clink...That, then, was why his thoughts
had taken their tone of wartime reminiscence...The curves of his
features must have awakened them.</p>

<p>Henry Martin's definite wish that he could become that
accomplished and elegant fellow redoubled itself. He at least had
knowledge of the world, assurance, and, in the companionship of
Gloria Sorenson, indisputable good fortune. How differently he
could look around the room and how differently the room with its
bright papery decorations and shining floor must seem to him!
Worry&mdash;more particularly financial worry&mdash;and the curse of
ineffectiveness can take the brightness out of any colours. To the
other Smith the scarlets of the Japanese paper umbrellas and the
Chinese lanterns must be a blaze&mdash;a gay, vivifying blaze.</p>

<p>And Gloria Sorenson...the idol of a dozen capitals!...By the
quick pang at his heart every time he caught sight of her without
having looked for her, he knew that Wanda, in his memory, had lost
none of her physical glow. He had been astonished by that
unsuspected constancy in himself. It pleased him momentarily
because he thought it must make him an interesting figure. He had
apparently cherished a passion for twelve&mdash;nearly
thirteen&mdash;years...But he should not have been pleased. It was
nothing to write home about. It was merely that the four or five
women with whom he had more or less transitorily to do since then
had been mentally and physically mediocre. Except perhaps Mrs.
Percival...But he had never...'enjoyed her favours,' was the
phrase. She might have married him, though,...if Anacondas had
stopped say at 75...</p>

<p>But mediocre persons would be his lot, drifting into bored or
warmed-up adultery because it was the fashion of the times.
Passion...that was not for him or for his day.</p>

<p>That fellow Smith...Molesworth Smith...Moulton Smith...no, it
was Monckton Smith because he was connected with the
Shreiner-Monckton aero-engines...Monckton Smith had always for
Henry Martin gone about in an atmosphere of awe...</p>

<p>A draught from a wind-fan raised the fellow's brown hair from
his tanned right brow. There was the jagged weal of an old
wound...It immediately brought back to Henry Martin the Cockney
pronounced words:</p>

<p>'E'll come into er million an a arf, E will. What price our
chanstesses of a million an er arf?'</p>

<p>Evans, one of his fellow clerks in the battalion orderly room
had said those words and they had, even then, filled Henry Martin
with envy. They had been looking at Monckton Smith sitting at the
adjutant's table with his elbows on the grey blanket that covered
it. His fingers were pushed into his hair. He had been frowning
over some incomprehensible order from headquarters...The jagged
scar had become visible.</p>

<p>'Bloomin' Fortunatus!' the clerk Evans had said. 'Some 'as
<i>hall</i> the luck.'</p>

<p>'A million an er arf' represented at that date seven and a half
million dollars. Father had told Henry Martin that he never
expected to cut up for more than a million and a half at his
death...Not more than five hundred thousand apiece for Sister
Carrie, Brother Hal and himeself. Even if they got it!...And the
Monckton engines had gone ahead like blazes since that day...They
had extended most extraordinarily in times when nothing else had.
The extremely wealthy put down their Packards and Napiers. And
bought Moncktons...When all the world...all the <i>bloody</i>
world...dreaded starvation, that fellow was scooping in more
millions...What a hope!</p>

<p>Some 'as indeed hall the luck! That fellow had had the luck to
go out with the first battalion of the regiment, to distinguish
himself in the petty little war of movements that began the game.
And to have a piece of his skull clipped off by a cavalry sabre.
Nothing less! Other men had to be hit by pieces of shell or old
tin. That fellow could be incapacitated after a month or two of fun
in fine weather. By a sword wound...Gallantry and romance! With
three or four ribbons, bright on his tunic. And the sword wound to
give him for ever the chance that women would say of him:</p>

<p>'One of the Old Contemptibles, my dear. One of the Old
Contemptibles.'</p>

<p>That was the swanky title that those fellows gave to themselves
who had gone out with the first hundred thousand British troops.
Because the enemy leader had called them in the earliest days: 'The
contemptible little British army.' He should not of course have
done it. It gave them a chance of exciting awe. Even Henry Martin
felt a certain awe as he looked at Monckton Smith!</p>

<p>It was awe, of course, not for that military achievement but for
that amazing continuance of good fortune. From a sword-cut on the
Marne to the bed of Gloria Sorenson...And who knew how many others!
An immensely powerful God must be behind that fellow. If you came
within his sphere you might be under the cognizance of that
tremendous Power. For good or ill!...</p>

<p>He himself had come into the town that night which was to be his
last night on earth with the hope of some of the glory that
attached to sharing the bed of someone with some of Gloria
Sorenson's blazing flesh. For her flesh seemed to give off lights
of its own. And no doubt incandescent heat and perfume. As Wanda's
had done. She was extraordinarily like Wanda. Larger as it were, in
the way that in ancient hieratic pictures the important personages
were represented as large, the less important as exactly the same
shape but smaller.</p>

<p>Wanda's fate had been even similar, if smaller, too. From
paragraphs or inspired articles in entertainment columns during her
rare visits to Paris Henry Martin had gathered that she made
starring tours in Scandinavian, Dutch, or North German towns and in
the smaller cities of the United States where the populations were
mainly German or Scandinavian. She travelled with her husband, the
distinguished violinist called Pipperogios or something like it.
Apparently a Greek. Apparently he conducted the small travelling
orchestra that she took about with her. Sometimes he played solos
between her turns. The French papers said that she was noted for
the 'seriousness' of her conduct, her avoidance of the fashionable
world and the devotion to her career that her husband, Mr.
Pipperogios, displayed. According to the photographs she had become
astonishingly more beautiful...She had danced...had given
pleasure...It was he that was to be dead.</p>

<p>The last time he had seen her she had come bearing white flowers
because she thought he was dead. Well, he hadn't been. He had tried
to see her after that. On the stage of a theatre on the outer
boulevards when she was being unusually successful. Presumably
because she was so <i>sérieuse</i>, avoided the fashionable world
and no doubt because of her husband, Paris had never taken to her
like Berlin or Copenhagen or, say, Chesterton, Indiana...He had not
been able to go and see her. Alice had been away visiting. But the
woman to whom he had been temporarily attached had taken grippe and
he had taken it from her. That was the sort of thing that would
have happened to him. But never to Monckton!...</p>

<p>He examined critically the <i>poule</i> at his side. She had a
cold. That was all you could say about her...There were much better
looking girls in the room. Dark creatures with high colours and
hat-brims that hid flashing eyes. If you wanted to go out in a
blaze of sexual glory you could have taken one of them. At least he
supposed you could have. He was really unacquainted with the
etiquette of the place. They were perhaps only dancing partners. He
didn't know. In New York he had once penetrated into a public
dancing hall on the corner of Twenty-Third Street and Sixth Avenue.
They had handed you out rolls of strip tickets at a quarter apiece.
Each ticket gave you the right to dance with a girl for three
minutes. Or to sit out and treat her to soft drinks for three. He
did not exactly know. He had danced with a rather pretty, fairish
girl in a pink dress, though he could not remember how it had been
cut. Only it was pink. Or perhaps mauve. Apparently he had not
given much pleasure to her with his dancing. Because, after a
couple of turns they had sat at a table for a long time and
talked...About Estonia. She was an Estonian by birth. In Estonia
she had had a swing that her father had put up between two fir
trees. And a cat called something or other. He could not remember
what. It was a peculiar name. After he had talked with her for some
time about Estonia he had handed her his roll of strip tickets. It
had cost four dollars. He had expected her to take what she was
entitled to, but she had put the roll into her bag and gone away
without thanking him. Four times four were sixteen. He did not
think he had talked about Estonia for forty-eight minutes. At any
rate he still did not know where Estonia was. Somewhere in the
north of Europe, very likely. Fie didn't equally know whether he
was expected to invite the lady home with him.</p>

<p>He didn't even know whether the present <i>poule</i> wanted him
to go home with her. He had given her drinks and danced desultorily
with her two or three times already. That was his luck. He didn't
know that world any more than he knew the world of lower Sixth
Avenue dancing saloons. He did know that she was the last person in
it that he would want to go home with. But he began to think that
he knew nothing in the world about anything&mdash;or at least about
life. People's lives. How did they live?...Even where! He was
pretty sure he had given up the novel he had once begun because of
that. He could imagine characters but not how they lived. He could
not imagine their surroundings at home. Of course the novel had
been about the war. And if you write a novel about the war there
will have to be lots of characters in it. But he didn't know
anything about the war. From the inside. He had seen nothing of
it.</p>

<p>This girl now. What sort of room did she live in? He had not the
ghost of an idea. She was tidy. Neat about the ankles. Then perhaps
her room&mdash;in the Red Light quarter no doubt&mdash;was very neat. He had
once gone home with a French <i>poule</i>. Her room had been
unusually clean. Its chief adornment had been a first communion
card. Her own! Except for that it had seemed to be nearly all wax
flowers. There had been hundreds of wax flowers of every colour and
shade. And the astonishing thing was that there had not been a
speck of dust on any of them. She must have gone over them,
probably every day, with a feather duster if not with a polishing
cloth...But he had never had much to do with that class. They said
that it had died out in America. They said that amateurs had put up
too much competition for the professionals to be able to make a
living any more. That had certainly been his dreary experience. The
amateurs had seemed to stand like a wall between him and the
professionals. He imagined that that particular underworld might
have proved amusing if he could have tried it. Perhaps it wouldn't.
The samples he had seen had been dreary enough. But he might have
been unlucky.</p>

<p>He seemed to have a knack&mdash;it was perhaps merely a weakness&mdash;for
forming attachments. People attached themselves to him. Then it was
hard to get rid of them. It had been the case with Alice; with Mr.
Kuhn, with the miscellaneous collection of people at his
hotel...And now with this young woman...The dreariest sort of
attachments.</p>

<p>If he ever came to this world again he would see that he kept
out of them.</p>

<p>He had picked out this uninteresting young woman three weeks
ago. He gave her gin fizzes and danced with her once or twice in
the course of each evening. He had picked her out for these
invitations because he had been feeling depressed, and to-night she
looked depressed. She had proved so. She accepted his invitations
without smiles or any evidence of satisfaction. He wondered whether
he ought to have given her money. He presumed it to have been
unnecessary because she had continued to dance and sit with him
without either comment or unwillingness.</p>

<p>So he was cut off from any blaze of physical enjoyment on the
last evening of his life. There was a girl in the hall&mdash;with
quivering nostrils, dark&mdash;very dark tragic in expression. She might
have fulfilled the requirements. He looked at her at intervals. She
was well dressed&mdash;in black with an attractive hat. Her looks
certainly moved him. She sat with other girls rather disdainfully
or talked to men without obviously throwing herself at them. She
was different&mdash;as if she knew unusual things. His <i>poule</i> told
him that that girl had lately come out of prison after six months.
She had been engaged with others in selling 'snow.'...It was not on
the face of it a repulsive offence...</p>

<p>But his <i>poule</i> stood like a damp wall between him and the
other. The other sat most of the evening alone. Part of the time
she was at a table with a little old man with grey curly hair and a
rather sulky countrifiedlooking other girl...As the evening went on
she seemed to grow in attraction. He thought of going over, asking
her to dance, and in the course of the dance suggesting that he
should go home with her...But he had heard of ensanguined scenes in
the Red Light quarter of the town. A man he knew, called Preston
Hartman, from Lincoln, Nebraska, had had his nose nearly cut off
there. It is true that he had innocently hired a room in a house of
ill fame, taking it for a respectable boarding house. The rest of
the affair had been wrapped in mystery...</p>

<p>But French women of that class certainly did fight for the man
they considered themselves to have a claim on. He had seen it
happen at the Dôme in Paris. He had at least witnessed the row and
was told that was what was the matter. An American woman in a
slightly canned state had smiled at a man sitting with a French
Woman. They and their sympathizers on the one side and the other
had broken quite a lot of furniture and a district call had had to
be given for the police and fire brigades. He didn't want to
distinguish his last night on earth by an affray of that sort.</p>

<p>Besides he did not want to hurt the feelings of his
<i>poule</i>. She might consider that she had established a claim
to him. She probably had as these things go. He began to wish that
he had given her something or that he had something to give her
now. He literally hadn't. His entire wealth was reduced to three
hundred and ninety-four francs. He couldn't die without a
<i>sou</i> in his pockets.</p>

<p>He wanted to leave, wrapped in a piece of oiled silk, in his
identity card case, a fifty franc note. And a memorandum asking
whoever found his body to send a cable&mdash;deferred&mdash;to his father.
And a wire to Alice in Paris. Thirty-seven francs for his father:
ten or eleven for Alice. Perhaps the finder would just steal the
fifty francs. Then they would have to learn it from the paper...or
perhaps the papers would not consider the matter of sufficient
importance to notice it. A down-and-out young American drowns
himself. Thousands of bundle-stiffs got rid of themselves every
year unsung&mdash;between the California desert and&mdash;oh, say Fall
River.</p>

<p>Fifty francs for the oiled sack...He was paid up till after
lunch at the hotel. Forty-five francs in lieu of
notice...Ninety-five&mdash;he had meant to give the dark girl a hundred
and fifty...Much more than the current rate there. But as far as
<i>poules</i> were concerned he wanted to think of himself that
nothing in life became him like the leaving of it...</p>

<p>But he wasn't going to die in the dark girl's arms after
all...It was perhaps just as well. Perhaps going out in a blaze of
physical glory might turn out to be an overrated pleasure. You
obviously couldn't&mdash;as a gentleman&mdash;really die in the lady's arms.
You would have to go out and do it somewhere else. In the tide of
reaction...<i>Post coïtum tristia</i>&mdash;As if she had danced. And
had not given pleasure. And he had died.</p>

<p>Besides, it might be held up against the girl. They might jeer
at her. They would say he had enjoyed her favours and immediately
gone out and drowned himself. That would not be fair. Especially to
a girl who had just come out of prison for supplying
stupefiants...As if the narcotic had been inefficient...</p>

<p>Across the room the dark girl was using her vanity case&mdash;with
quick, impatient dabs. Her lips blazed scarlet. Her cheeks glowed.
He felt he was ready to throw all these considerations to the wind.
He would pay for the gin fizzes and throw all that remained into
the dark girl's lap.</p>

<p>The depressed <i>poule</i> would be all the more depressed. He
couldn't help that. Just before going out of the world you owed it
to Providence to say that you had used your body gloriously. It was
the cock due to Aesculapius...He might even give pleasure to the
dark girl. Then indeed nothing in life would have become him like
the leaving it!</p>

<p>She was pulling on her suède gloves. She was going. He would pay
the bill. He tried to attract the attention of the waiter. That
nonchalant man in the white coat walked out at the back of the
hall...It was always like that. By the time he had got that bill
paid the girl would be gone...He would follow her out into the
street: he would hurry up one street and down another. But there
would be no trace of her. His life would be robbed of its last
glory!...By a waiter...It had always been like that with him. That
was his life. In epitome!</p>

<p>It had been at that point that Hugh Monckton had strolled
over.</p>

<p>The little paper slip that he dropped nonchalantly on the table
showed a total of three hundred and twentyone francs...Three
bottles of champagne and three small ones of stout. With the tip
say three hundred and fifty. And his own bill: thirty...Three
hundred and eighty...He could just do it.</p>

<p>He pointed to the chair on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' he said, 'have a drink.'</p>

<p>The dark girl had not gone. He wasn't however going to go with
her. The duties of hospitality come before the duty to the body
that Providence has given you! If he didn't go with the girl it was
because he had to pay the bill for this Godhead. He must be Apollo
at least. It was the story of Philemon and Baucis...Without Baucis,
of course...</p>

<p>The least the fellow could do would be to reward him with an
inexhaustible cruse...A self-filling beer jug....He wouldn't, of
course.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Thanks. Can't. Wish I could. Ever since I stopped one! Mine for
the water-wagon. As I believe you'd say.'</p>

<p>He was of course referring to the wound on his forehead...It was
as if there were that drop of bitter in his sweet cup. But no doubt
it wasn't. After all it's a blessing not to drink. You feel
brighter. Henry Martin was pretty abstemious. But even at that he
felt better when he had drunk nothing at all for a
week...Better...Fitter...</p>

<p>'A very little drop,' Hugh Monckton said, 'gives me
sometimes...Not always...Sometimes. What you'd call precious like
an epileptic fit. No knowing what you mayn't do...Better not to
chance it in these tiring times.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'You don't look tired!...You're Lieutenant Hugh Monckton
Smith.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm tired enough,' Hugh Monckton said. 'No end tired...of
the whole bally old game.'</p>

<p>He sank gracefully down on to the vacant chair. Henry Martin
asked the <i>poule</i> if she would like another drink and called
the waiter. The <i>poule</i> said: 'No.' Then 'Yes. Geen feez is
beneficial to a cold.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Rum is better. But gin's good, too, mademoiselle.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin was piqued to see that the girl bridled pleasantly
before the other's amiable nonchalance.</p>

<p>'For us who desire to remain <i>plutôt maigre</i>,' she said,
'gin is better if less efficacious. Mademoiselle Gloria can no
doubt drink rum. She will no doubt exercise herself. All day and
all night.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps she will,' Hugh Monckton said. 'No doubt perhaps she
will.' He added. 'You're of course White Man Smith of Magdalen. You
got out of that old show early. Some people have all the luck.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin dropped the ineffectual-looking French notes on the
table...Three hundred and fifty for Hugh Monckton's bill: forty for
his own and four more francs to the unimpressed waiter. Three
hundred and ninety-four francs! He was penniless. Literally <i>sans
le sou</i>. The long downward course of Anacondas and Kennecotts
was finished. It had begun in the Algonquin Hotel on the fifth of
August two years before. Mr. Kuhn had brought his famous uncle to
gaze on the literary heroes. And to give him, Henry Martin, a
financial tip or two. The great man had said:</p>

<p>'Buy Anacondas at 115. They will go up to 135 by Christmas. Sell
out and buy New York Central Bonds. You'll be settled for life. If
that's what you want...'</p>

<p>With his usual aloofness a little tempered by the aweinspiring
presence, so that he had the air of a distinguished top-salesman in
an expensive department store, Kuhn had asked his uncle if there
was no chance of copper dropping. Germany was coming into the
market as a producer. Cape copper was being reorganized under
American auspices so that its production might expect to be
doubled.</p>

<p>The great man had said flatly:</p>

<p>'I've given you my advice. You can take it or leave it. It's
good. Unless the bottom of the world falls out. But sell out at
Christmas.'</p>

<p>The bottom of the world had fallen out. The last penny of his
mother's legacy had gone. He had sold out his shares in the
drug-store and followed that advice. Two years and ten days ago. By
Christmas, 1929, Anacondas had been at 95. Now they were 13. He had
not even a few francs to give the depressed <i>poule</i>. When she
learned of his death&mdash;if she did learn of it&mdash;she would be more
depressed still. Not because of his loss. That would probably mean
nothing to her. But because the last chance of getting something
out of him would be gone for good.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'If you'll walk down with me to the Port I'll give it you
back.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said it was nothing. It didn't matter.</p>

<p>'You American Croesuses!' Hugh Monckton exclaimed
good-humouredly. 'You must not corrupt us beggared Europeans with
charity. I'll go and get the money.'</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>'Oh, but walk down with me. I'd be glad to talk with you...About
old times, of course!' he added rather hastily...'Unless,' he began
again and he waved his hand toward the <i>poule</i>...'In that case
if you'll tell me where you're going, I'll send the money there in
two two's after I get to the Port.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin rose wearily.</p>

<p>'I'm coming,' he said.</p>

<p>As he put up his hand to open the swing door he noticed his
signet ring on his little finger. It had been mother's gift to him
on his fourteenth birthday. For twenty-three years it had hardly
been off his finger. Except for once when he had had it enlarged.
It was so part of himself that till that moment he had never
thought of it as a separate entity.</p>

<p>It was no doubt worth some dollars. It might give him two or
three more days of life. But he was not sure that he wanted two or
three days more of life. Besides, you should not pawn your mother's
presents. On the other hand,'how would the ring like visiting the
bottom of the sea? His body might drift out and never be found.
There was a strong outward current under St. Mandrier...That was no
way to treat a ring. A ring was meant to be kept warm by human
flesh. It wouldn't like the ooze of the sea-bottom.</p>

<p>He asked Hugh Monckton to wait and went back into the hall. The
dark girl was making herself up again. Gazing rather fiercely into
the mirror in the flap of her bag. He dropped the ring under her
nose. It spun round, the hoop of gold gleaming. The bloodstone was
like an oval of red candy. She looked up at him enigmatically.</p>

<p>'I have seen you throwing glances at me, 5 she said.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'It is because you danced and gave pleasure.'</p>

<p>She laughed and said:</p>

<p>'Oh! Oh!...I have not danced since I came out of the...the cruel
place.'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'It was before then...Fifteen hundred years before then.'</p>

<p>She laughed again.</p>

<p>'A thousand and half a thousand...' she said. 'You cannot escape
that inscription here. If you came to my room you would see it on
the wall...All the same I am not yet dead.'...She said.
'<i>Saltavit et placuit</i>...But not <i>mortuus est</i>...It is
<i>mortua</i> in the feminine.'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'I shall be dead before I come to your room.'</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'Courage, mon vieux...Courage, my friend...I am not so
repulsive. I have a little friend, a seamstress...She became the
mistress of the governor of Cochin-Annam...But before then...Elle
m'adorait!...She crocheted me some curtains...If you came to my
room you would see them. The likeness of the tomb...In
crochet-work...<i>Saltavit: Placuit: Mortuus Est</i>...'</p>

<p>She pronounced it:</p>

<p>'Schltahvee...Plahssuee...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'I regret...I have a friend waiting...'</p>

<p>She laughed again: throwing her head back. Her teeth were white
but reddened by her lipstick.</p>

<p>'Naturally,' she said. 'We have all of us friends waiting.'</p>

<p>He thought to himself:</p>

<p>'If I were Hugh Monckton Allard Smith and had all the wealth of
the Indies I might pass ravishing hours with that creature...'</p>

<p>The Russian orchestra with their white blouses, scarlet
stitching and black top boots were playing 'Frankie and
Johnnie'...</p>

<p>'It is astonishing, the education of these creatures,' he said.
He was crossing the floor. He had in his ears her words:</p>

<p>'Vous êtes gentil, quand même,' as she put his ring on to her
reticule.</p>

<p>He seemed to have given pleasure.</p>

<p>Probably her education was not so astonishing. That was the
motto of that region. Naturally she would know it. Her little
friend had been the mistress of the governor of French
Cochin-Annam. A romantic but steel-hard commercial region where you
danced and gave pleasure. If you didn't give pleasure you went down
into the ooze of the sea-bottom. But if you did you become
immortal. On a tombstone or as Lais Corinthiaca...a once
fashionable prostitute.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-0" id="ch2-0"></a>PART TWO</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-1" id="ch2-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Do you know anything of the Foreign Legion?...</p>

<p>You're a man of the world. I daresay you know everything.'</p>

<p>They were walking in the tepid sirocco night, in the solitary
blaze of the electric lights, down the Place du Theatre.</p>

<p>'Romantic spot,' he continued. 'Palm trees and painted house
fronts...What does <i>Aux Délices</i> mean?'</p>

<p>Across the salmon-pink upper part of a house that had a chrome
yellow <i>rez-de-chaussée</i> had been painted the words '<i>Aux
Délices</i>' in immense black capitals.</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'It's a tart shop. A very good tart shop...<i>Aux Délices</i>
means...oh, that you'll be delighted with their candies...'</p>

<p>'Ah,' Hugh Monckton said: 'Some people have all the luck...You
can pronounce French like a...oh, a French actress you know...You
fellows are so educated...Rose Scholars and all...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Rhodes...Rhodes was an Englishman...I don't know a great deal
about the Foreign Legion...'</p>

<p>'The point is,' Hugh Monckton asked, 'is it an escape?...A means
of escape?...You fellows are so damned modest...You get it both
ways...'</p>

<p>They plunged, across the light of the Rue Jean Jaurès, into the
deep shadows of old houses in a black canyon.</p>

<p>'Of course I can say <i>arma virumque cano</i>...And
<i>conticuere omnes intentique ora tenebant</i>...oh, five or six
hundred lines of the <i>Aeneid</i>....But you...</p>

<p>'I can say...<i>Saltavit...Placuit</i>...Henry Martin said
grimly.</p>

<p>His face invisible in the shadows, Hugh Monckton caught his
arm:</p>

<p>'That's it,' he said, 'You know all those queer things...The
Greek Anthology, I dare say...And yet you manage to look like us.
That's a damn nice suit of Harris tweeds you've got on. I wish I
had known your tailor. It might have made a difference.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Good God...It's a reach-me-down from the Galeries
Lafayette.'</p>

<p>Their footsteps echoed from the high fronts of the houses, black
beneath bright stars. They walked with regular steps as if
marching.</p>

<p>'That's precisely it,' Hugh Monckton said. 'You fellows&mdash;no, you
in particular...American Croesuses can go into any jolly old
department store...That's what you call it, isn't it?'...Henry
Martin could go into the Galeries Lafayette and say: 'Give me any
jolly old suit.' And at once he looked like one of us...Damned
smart!...But of course Henry Martin had been in the Forty-First.
Not a bad regiment...But there it was...Several millions was a good
thing to have. But not the equal of...Oh, <i>savoir-faire!</i> Some
people had all the luck.</p>

<p>He himself had pots of money rolling in. You couldn't stop it.
Henry Martin and his Johnnies&mdash;if Henry Martin would excuse
him&mdash;were duds at accumulating the shekels. He himself, Hugh
Monckton, would be...oh, pots...richer next week. If he were alive
next week. Which he didn't plan to be. Unless information about the
Foreign Legion seemed satisfactory...</p>

<p>Henry Martin said he knew a man who had been in the Foreign
Legion. William Budells. He had written a book about it.</p>

<p>They had come out on the <i>rade</i>&mdash;the platform of stone
level with the harbour water. The reflections of lights quivered in
an infinite, black placidity.</p>

<p>'There you are,' Hugh Monckton said. 'You have all the books at
your fingertips...And all the...department stores, isn't it?...You
can't make money. As my people make it for me. But if my people
make more money in a week than you will see in your life you can
have your shoulders padded in a way to attract the neatest little
filly...a damn neat little filly...I ought to thank you for being
walking with me instead of...'</p>

<p>He broke off and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I'm not drunk...I've not had a drink in a week of Sundays. But
I'm going to be. And...what do your French friends say&mdash;<i>Vogue la
galère</i>...Which means: take it hot and chance your innards...But
you can get a nicely padded-shouldered suit at the Galeries
Lafayette and pick up a neat little filly...and I...Oh, damn
it...You're not a business man. You don't know what business is.
I...my people...could make...double...triplicate...your fortune
between now and sunrise...Yet I can be shown the door by a...a
large-mouthed...oh, female descendant of the Viking who discovered
your country...Your jolly old country...'</p>

<p>He broke away from Henry Martin's arm and marched to gaze into
the depths of the water that was blackly and gluttonously lapping
the stones of the quay. The regularly architectured houses went up
into blackness. He hurried back and said:</p>

<p>'Sorry, old bean...I'm going to give you some <i>Fine de la
Republique</i> your friends the French call it. I bought it in your
city...I suppose you're a New Yorker...Of a fellow whose
great-grandfather had been ambassador to
Napoleon...Seventeen-ninetytwo...I brought it down for...Oh, a
large mouth that likes good liquor...I beg your pardon for...what
is it?...intruding intimate details on your attention...But we may
as well finish it...The Republican Fine, I mean. Good stuff,
<i>fine</i> if you haven't had a jolly old crack on the skull...If
you have it's not so good...But if you've been shown the
door...Well then, it's good.'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Escape...Means of escape from your jolly old self...They say
there are books called literature of escape...I have not found
any...'</p>

<p>He spoke low, earnestly and with great distinctness. He was
certainly not drunk. There was not much light on the quay. That is
to say, there were lights that looked bright but had practically no
illuminative quality. So his face was not very plain. But he seemed
as calmly smiling as he had been in the dancing hall.</p>

<p>He said: 'Come along here,' and went away, a hundred yards or so
to the edge of the quay. His firm footsteps echoed. The English
don't wear rubber heels. Henry Martin's footsteps were
noiseless.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton was gazing at a vessel moored stern-on to two
cannon in the dockside. Four or five French bluejackets were also
gazing at her, their hands in the pockets of their tight trousers.
The water lapped musically on the squared stone and on the side of
the ship.</p>

<p>'Means of escape,' Hugh Monckton said. 'The world's full of
them. Only one is genuine.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin read the gilt inscription on the black stern above
the rudder.</p>

<p>'It's <i>Le Secret</i>,' he said. 'It's always seemed to me her
spars were terribly tall.'</p>

<p><i>Le Secret</i>, tall and black hulled, was one of the most
familiar vessels of those seas. Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'If you only use canvas in the lightest breezes it doesn't
matter. They say she has the finest auxiliary engines in the world.
I don't know, of course. You can have her for me. You would
know.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'You're going to buy her...They say so...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Buy your grandmother...I'm not going to!'</p>

<p>He went on again:</p>

<p>'What should I do? On a yacht? I don't care for the sea. Not to
yearn for it. Scandinavians do. But if you're not a Scandinavian
and not going to have one with you...What a hope!'</p>

<p>His vast, dim bedroom in the mouldering hotel, was mountainous
with leather luggage and some packing cases. He stood astride a
grip and looked absently around him.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Ah, the Republican <i>fine</i>...It's...Not here.' And bent
over another grip. He could bend with a straight back from his
hips. And undo straps with the back still unbent. He said:</p>

<p>'What's your jolly old name?...It's like mine...And your jolly
old business? And address?'</p>

<p>He kept his face averted, over the grip he was opening.</p>

<p>He handed Henry Martin a polished leather case, shaped to fit
over a bottle. He said:</p>

<p>'Amuse yourself with that...It's the <i>Fine de la
Republique</i>...1792! I want to write a note.'</p>

<p>He sat at a rickety bureau and pulled out letters and letter
paper. He smiled at Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'Try it,' he said. 'It isn't dope...There aren't three quarts
left in the world...There's half a pint there...Take a sip and keep
the rest...For special whoopee...With your best girl...You unscrew
the top with a right hand turn...That's my device for dealing with
butlers.'</p>

<p>He began to write scratchily. He said whilst he wrote:</p>

<p>'Of Monckton-Warminster,' and some name Henry Martin did not
catch, then: 'Salop, England...'</p>

<p>He said: 'By Jove, you've no glass...'</p>

<p>He produced from a round-topped blue closet two vast, thin
tumblers, gleaming bell-shaped on their stems.</p>

<p>'I've got amazing things in that valise. You wouldn't
believe...I'll drink with you when I'm finished...Akervit I call
it...But the proper name is Akvavit...Made by trolls. Bogys, you
know...In the something mountains. I can't pronounce 'em...Amazing
things...A pint of attar of roses...Haschisch made for the last
Shah but one...He was a connoisseur...'</p>

<p>He smiled friendlily down on Henry Martin who was sitting on a
horsehair sofa. He could see through the windows the searchlights
of battleships. He had got the curious square bottle of old, dim
glass out of the new leather case. About an eighth of the contents
remained.</p>

<p>'"And I on honeydew have fed,"' Hugh Monckton said, '"and drunk
the milk of..." Oh, I don't mean me. They were meant for other
lips...Pour a little...a very little...'</p>

<p>He held the tumbler under the bottle. Henry Martin poured a few
drops. Odour rose from the glass. Astonishingly it made Henry
Martin see the line of villas with the white pillars and stoops at
the top of Main Street in Springfield, Ohio.</p>

<p>Astonishingly, because when he had first smelt brandy in the
breath of his Aunt Hedwig, Comtesse de Pralinghem&mdash;and it was of
that of course that he was being reminded&mdash;those family hives had
not yet been built. Alice came from one of them.</p>

<p>'Amazing things!' Hugh Monckton said. He waved a hand towards
his luggage...</p>

<p>'Good stuff that <i>fine</i>...Take a tiny sip. Close your
mouth. Swallow. Breathe out through your nose...That's the way to
taste liquor...' He said: 'You see: when you swallow there's no
sensation in the throat...No burning...You might be drinking
perfume...Amazing things...The folly of me!...And having them
turned down. As if they were modern Japanese...'</p>

<p>He began:</p>

<p>'Why, there's a Nuremberg Bible...And a psalter from Mount
Athos...And a quite good Second Folio...The best that was on the
market...And an Ibsen manuscript...That's for the highbrow
side...The highbrow travellers...Must have something highbrow for a
long voyage.'</p>

<p>He paused and swung his body round without moving his
feet&mdash;looking vaguely at the packing cases.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes...Adornment...Art...I tell you I looked through the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> for the headings...There are some
jewels of jolly old Tutankhamen and a tiara of the Empress
Eugénie...Then Art...There's two...Oh, Simone Martini's...And a
Raphael drawing of a jolly old Pope...And paintings of the South
Seas by that fellow...You know: We were making for the South Seas
by the way of the Islands of the Blest.'</p>

<p>He drifted again towards the ramshackle desk.</p>

<p>'You don't have to laugh,' he said to Henry Martin. 'You're man
of the world enough to know that it's wise to be provided with
objects of interest if you're going to...filer le parfait amour as
your French friends say.'</p>

<p>He sat down again, stiff and long and again took up his red
cornelian pen.</p>

<p>'Well, well...Filer le parfait amour,' he said...He asked: 'Ever
do it?...I never did...Some people have all the luck...Try the
'fifty-seven brandy on the table. It'll taste like paraffin after
the other. But it'll get better as you drink it till you think it a
damn fine brew...Le parfait amour, indeed!'</p>

<p>He re-read what he had already written.</p>

<p>'You see,' he said, 'everything ought to be...oh, rich and
strange...Try that '57. There's no reason why you should not get a
bit blotto...I mean to...I won't be two minutes. Then I'll run you
to Carqueiranne in under the quarter...'</p>

<p>He began to write in earnest, muttering:</p>

<p>'Rich and strange: rich and strange...Shall suffer a jolly old
sea-change.'</p>

<p>He seemed to be able to mutter these things whilst writing
something else; for he looked around at Henry Martin and said:</p>

<p>'Henry Martin Aluin...one "l"...Smith...No "y" or "e" nonsense.
Of course not...Of Highcrest...Springfield, State of Ohio, United
States of America and the Pisto-Brittle Works, same place, same
state, at present...Oh, residing at the Hotel Bellevue,
Carqueiranne, Var, France...' He repeated, 'Henry Martin Aluin&mdash;one
"1."...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin supposed him to be writing to an aunt and
describing his meetings. It seemed a queer job to be doing at
nearly midnight...But the <i>Bremen</i> was sailing on Saturday. It
was no doubt an American aunt to whom he was writing. These fellows
intermarried no end...Going where money was...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said suddenly:</p>

<p>'Henry Martin Aluin Smith...Hugh Monckton Allard Smith...We
could pass as cousins with the French authorities...If there were
any trouble about Death duties...' Then he said: 'But what two
jolly old names for tombstones!'</p>

<p>He began to write again, his pen scratching in the silence. The
searchlights whirled and whirled behind him.</p>

<p><br>
The shock to Henry Martin had been quite considerable. It was as if
that fellow had been spying on him and knew his plan. That, of
course, was absurd. He had confided in no one. It had been only
that afternoon that he had received his father's jeering cable.
Certainly none of the friendly old maids at the little hotel could
consider that he had been depressed. He imagined that to them he
must seem as unconcerned&mdash;as fortunate even&mdash;as Hugh Monckton. They
were extremely poor maiden ladies&mdash;three English, one French, one
American: they crocheted and pawkily twitted him with having
designs on old Marius Vial's granddaughter-in-law. The
granddaughter-in-law was an extremely tightly dressed Parisienne,
always in brand new black even at half-past seven in the morning,
with remarkable black curls <i>à la d' Artagnan</i> and always with
a perfect, artificial strawberries and cream complexion. She was
sharper on the <i>sous</i> than an Airedale terrier on rats, and in
secret sighed for Paris. That is to say, that unknown to the grand
father she unceasingly nagged at her husband, young Olive Vial,
because she had to superintend the linen and the <i>caisse</i> of
the tiny hotel instead of one just as tiny in the rue du Cherche
Midi, in the metropolis. Henry Martin would just as soon have
designs on her as on a beautiful, stuffed parakeet&mdash;but the jocular
old maids insisted that nothing else could keep him&mdash;gay, young and
Pisto-Brittle apparent in a tiny nest. At that season the little
port was malodorous on account of the myriads of dead Portuguese
men-of-war that the east wind drove in. That at least was how the
Vials accounted for the odour. They said it was salubrious&mdash;as
witness the vigour of old Marius who was eighty-two and had the
sight of a hawk and the volubility of a radio announcer. As was
singularly the way with him, all these people except the French old
maid had attached themselves to him. As if he had been a member of
all their families. They confided in him so, all their incomes and
the troubles of their married sisters and nieces&mdash;but they knew
nothing about his complete lack of income or that he had a married
sister&mdash;the Comtesse Van Heldenstamm with troubles of her own.</p>

<p>So that there could have been no leak from that little port and
that fellow's speech about tombstones must have been made merely to
pass the time away.</p>

<p>You couldn't think of that fellow as contemplating suicide. He
was perfectly cool, as ruddy as a peach and as good-humoured as a
nice dog. Besides the coincidence would be too absurd&mdash;that about
midnight between the fourteenth and fifteenth of August there
should be in the same room two Smiths, each contemplating suicide
and each considering how similar names would look on a
tombstone.</p>

<p>He didn't know how popular the contemplation of their own
tombstones might be with the inhabitants of Europe. He had spent a
great deal of time in Europe of the last fifteen years he must have
passed nine, possibly ten there. Nevertheless he knew next to no
Europeans...Well enough to get at their psychologies. Americans he
knew avoided the thought of death...of passing over. About three
years ago the papers and more particularly the magazines had had
lots of articles asserting that America had abolished death. That
did not of course mean that no one died. But the whole country sang
in chorus: 'Oh, death where is thy sting?...' Europeans apparently,
arranged life with an eye to death. They built, still, rather for
their heirs, put down wines that would only come to their best
after they themselves had passed over. They wrote books for
posterity; attempted to establish dynasties or by their testaments
to cabine with iron bands the careers of their descendants.</p>

<p>All that was very un-American. The trouble with Henry Martin was
that he could not satisfy himself as to precisely how American or
un-American his father was. He, Henry Martin, free, male and over
twenty-one sat there, will-less, numbed, in the presence of a
stranger because of some manifestation of his father's will. That
was indisputable.</p>

<p>He sat there, rather improbably, because his father had numbed
him. Exactly what he was doing there he didn't know. That
fellow&mdash;Hugh Monckton&mdash;scribbled furiously away as if he were
rapidly finishing some job before the two of them set out upon some
piece of concerted whoopee. But nothing had been concerted between
them. Ostensibly he had come up to Hugh Monckton's vast, maritime
room in the maritime hotel in order to receive 394&mdash;no, 350 francs.
But why did the fellow keep him waiting?</p>

<p>He did not himself care. He didn't even want the money. To be
completely&mdash;absolutely and completely without a <i>sou</i> had a
not disagreeable, chloroforming effect. As long as he had had that
small sum, action of a sort had been open to him. He could have
cabled to his father for 37 francs 50: 'Must irrevocably suicide if
no remittance received twenty-four hours.' Or he could have bought
several sacks of oranges from the Spanish schooner in the harbour
and have retailed them in the babbling market place. Or he could
have bought the favours of the dark girl whose face was still vivid
to him. Or have lived for four days longer in the little hotel&mdash;and
had the use of the boat. As it was there was nothing that he could
do. He could not indeed even pay for a taxi back to
Carqueiranne&mdash;twenty-eight kilometres. Well, he could just as well
spend that stifling night in walking back. Twenty-eight kilometres
was nothing in particular to him...Then why was he waiting? He
didn't want the money.</p>

<p>He made a movement half to rise. The horsehair hissed under him,
the wood creaked dryly. Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'A minute or two more and we'll have a good drink. After that
I'll run you to your bugwalk. It's very good of you to wait.' He
ran his eyes over what he had been writing, pointed with the end of
his pen at the packing cases behind him.</p>

<p>'Those,' he said, 'are to go to the London Museums, you
understand...South Kensington. The National Gallery. The British
and so on. According to common sense and their needs...I understand
the National Gallery is short in the article...Gauguin...That's
that painter's name, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'You aren't going to take them in the <i>Secret?</i>' Henry
Martin asked. 'Oh, come...If you'll excuse me...Gloria...Mrs.
Sorenson...'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Excuse <i>me</i>...For my private affairs getting in your
way...'</p>

<p>He broke the long carnelian holder of his pen and tossed the end
in among the valises.</p>

<p>'No sea-change for them,' he exclaimed. He was still smiling.
'As we used to say, you remember. <i>Na poo finny</i>. Mamma say
<i>no bong</i>!...The poor bloody Huns used to say
<i>Kaput</i>...Cut is the branch that might have grown full
straight.' He hesitated and said:</p>

<p>'And the least little sensation brings you those perfectly
damnable headaches...You wouldn't believe...'</p>

<p>He ran his hand round the dim blue cornice of the room.</p>

<p>'Rum sort of place to be in,' he said, 'Pico della Mirandola or
Pavlova...Or it may have been Casanova used to hang out here. Or
perhaps it was Melozzo da Forli or Taglioni...So I had to put up
here...To represent the artistic side of the party...Our Norwegian
friend&mdash;Bjumstumja Bjumblepupple don't room here, of course. They
have to go to the Grand for his poor dear health. The fiddler
fellows room in the Golfe at Hyères...Catch them rooming in this
rat-trap of a place. But someone had to do honour to Pico and the
rest...Try it on the dog, you know...<i>In corpore vili</i>...I'd
prefer Duke Street, Cardiff, at any time...Remember Duke Street on
a Saturday night?...With the miners coming up from the Rhondda
Valley...Gay by comparison. Seemed rotten then...But I can't
believe there was ever a poet in Cardiff.'</p>

<p>He wrote three words: then he said:</p>

<p>'His name isn't Bjumstumje Bjumblepple of course. That's what I
call him. He's really someone else. But the only Scandinavian poet
one ever heard of was called Bjornstjerne Bjornson. Of course there
were Thorwaldsen and Andersen...and Ibsen. All Scandinavian
glories. Northern lights...This poet has to be...<i>dorloté</i>
your French friends call it...Done up in cotton wool...But all this
doesn't interest you. Laugh and the world laughs with you: weep and
you weep alone...Damned alone...Not chick nor child nor light o'
love shall charm thee to that sweet sleep that thou owedst
yesterday...You don't know the feeling...Remember the three dropped
goals you kicked against the 7th Monmouthshires? You were heavier
then...'</p>

<p>He asked suddenly:</p>

<p>'Doesn't the world seem duller to you now?...Like the
half-warmed fish that Spooner Johnny said when he meant half-formed
wish?...Not much fun in women...Too easy to come by...Not much kick
in wine...So they say...I don't know much about it...But you're an
authority...What do you say?...Try that '57 cognac...It won't taste
so bad now...'</p>

<p>It was true that the '57 cognac did not now taste so bad. It was
almost as oleaginous as the <i>Fine de la Republique</i>. Left
almost as little sting in the throat. And it was much more warming.
You could feel it go all through your limbs&mdash;like courage.</p>

<p>He suddenly found himself wishing intensely that he were that
fellow...More intensely than before...By now Hugh Monckton seemed
less of a demi-god...But it was more reasonable to wish to be
something less than a demi-god...Apparently he had lost Gloria
Sorenson. To her husband. There was nothing very singular in that.
Married women in Europe seemed to think they still had duties to
their legitimate spouses. It made them no doubt more piquant.
Apparently if you had an affair with a European woman the husband
always had a fifty-fifty chance. Or more. Seventy-thirty, say.</p>

<p>He himself had had an exactly similar experience. Wanda, of
course, was a European in the end. Though the European men were
fish-like enough, the women made up for it. Their manners and
customs were singular, apparently...</p>

<p>The '57 <i>fine</i> was certainly warming...He had read a book
by a Frenchman, Beadle, or something like that. About Scandinavian
women.</p>

<p>Yes, it made that fellow a more human person to want to be...He
had lost his Gloria...Or no doubt she was only holding out on him
for a higher allowance for her husband...Apparently that lump was a
Scandinavian poet...Very like himself and Wanda&mdash;their affair. She
seemed to have told him...<i>just</i> like Wanda&mdash;that she must
look after the old man...Like thousands of European women...Like
Madame de Récamier. <i>She</i> had to go back to Recamier. After
Prince Henry of Prussia, and Benjamin Constant...and a doctor
fellow...He had lately been reading a life of Madame Recamier.</p>

<p>No doubt if he were in that fellow's skin at the present moment
it would not be exactly gay. He would be feeling it outrageous that
she should have left his muscular six feet to return to that
five-foot-eight lump...But he would have the conviction that he
could buy her back at any time. With all that wealth...It was only
complete want of wealth that rendered you impotent.</p>

<p>When he went to the window Hugh Monckton looked round at him
disquietedly.</p>

<p>'Only ten minutes more,' he said. 'I assure you not more than
ten...You can be in bed by one. One's not late for a whole
man...I'm supposed to be in bed at ten...'</p>

<p>The searchlights waved desperately. When they were at certain
angles the black water of the harbour existed because of their
reflection. At other times it was completely invisible. Then all
the great arms converged. Where they met was a tiny, golden
dragon-fly. They had spotted their plane...They performed these
exercises ceaselessly in those waters. The mass of a battleship
showed itself in the harbour against pale glow...A dull business,
spotting planes in a world that had lost glory.</p>

<p>It was certainly a duller world. It had been the eve of the
Assumption, but you would hardly have noticed it...There were the
small figures of small French bluejackets. Down on the quays their
absurd white caps and tight white trousers ran about. They lifted
their arms noiselessly in the glare of the arc-lights...That was
all there was to the eve of the Assumption, as far as he could see.
Small bluejackets had late leave...What was the good of them? Even
war had appeared a dull affair...</p>

<p>Dull wars; dull women; dull wine...Hostilities lacking glory;
adultery lacking sin; drink a mere means to a hangover...Hugh
Monckton was undoubtedly right...But if you were in a position to
do these things very expensively!...That might give an edge to
dullness...He wished himself again, intensely, Hugh Monckton.</p>

<p>It wasn't such a terrible affair to lose a Norwegian...He had
done it himself...</p>

<p>Wanda had expected&mdash;in Paris, that time&mdash;that he would commit
suicide, the same evening. He hadn't. When Wanda had come next
morning with a sheaf of white flowers to lay upon his bier he had
been&mdash;dully of course&mdash;in bed with Alice. He could not remember
what his feelings had been like but Wanda had thrown back her head
and laughed for five minutes. He and Alice had watched her with the
sheet up to their chins. No doubt they had felt awkward. Then Wanda
had thrown the flowers on their feet.</p>

<p>She had been laughing at herself...Presumably for having
expected passion and despair from him...But the modern man was
incapable of passion. He could know despair. When Anacondas dropped
to 12 and passed their dividends...But passion...Europeans might
know what it was. But you couldn't call them modern.</p>

<p>It had been whilst arranging Wanda's flowers in a yellow faience
jug that Alice had first asked him to regularize their union. She
said it was disagreeable to have strange women walking into your
bedroom. Not to have authority to tell them to go away. That was
apparently what the sacrament of marriage meant for her. There had
been nothing to their union, regularized, or before.</p>

<p>It had come about&mdash;had been drifted into&mdash;on the Christmas after
the Armistice. Leopold Kuhn had a staff-car. A great Packard. He
had suggested that they should spend Christmas day and the day
after at Chartres. And take a couple of girls.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had known only one girl. And she had not been
available. He had not been long in Paris at the time and knew few
people. Leopold Kuhn on the other hand moved in expensive, peopled
circles, mostly American. Paris was full of Americans then. Kuhn
was at the time attached to a dark girl from Baltimore. But his
attachments had not lasted long.</p>

<p>He had turned up with the Packard at the door of the apartment
in the rue des Saints Péres. When Henry Martin had gone down, Kuhn
had been standing by the door of the car with two girls&mdash;the dark
Baltimorean and a fair, small, rather sulky-looking younger girl.
She was introduced to Henry Martin as Miss Alice Heinz of
Springfield, Ohio...She had given only one look at him from rather
resentful blue-grey eyes and they had all got into the car. The men
were in the front seat. Kuhn said that he had chosen for Henry
Martin a girl from his home town so that he might feel safer and
have a more Christmassy feeling.</p>

<p>As soon as they were outside the city they changed places. The
Baltimorean sat with Leopold Kuhn who embraced her from time to
time while he drove. In the rear seats Henry Martin and Alice Heinz
had told each other their middle names. That used to be the phrase
in those days.</p>

<p>Of her associates in Springfield he had known very few. Of his
she had known practically none. That was hardly astonishing.
Springfield was a small city; they had nevertheless moved in
entirely different spheres, hers having been one that his mother's
associates would have called almost the underworld...until three
years or so before. Her father had been a North German farmer who
had emigrated to Indiana before her birth. He had done badly.
Having had insufficient capital to last out three bad grain years
he had found himself reduced to a four-horse team as almost his
only possession. He had made an indifferent living by taking
hauling jobs for neighbouring farmers and small townsmen until
horses had been nearly superseded. He had then acquired a heavy
motor lorry and had continued at his work. That might have been in
'97 or '98. The bad times were passing. Hermann Heinz came with a
load to Springfield. He had come across the mother of Alice&mdash;a
cook, from Hamburg. He had never liked the neighbourhood of
Chesterton, Indiana, where, till then, he had been settled. There
were too many Swedes and Norwegians there: not enough Germans. He
had removed himself and his lorry to Springfield. With the good
times the building trade had revived. Springfield was growing by
leaps and bounds. His lorry was never idle. With the savings of his
wife he bought another lorry. A brother of Alice's mother drove
that. The two men remained simple peasants. Alice's mother ran the
office. She was a master woman with a head for figures and social
ambitions. She had served in the best families in Springfield and
knew their ways.</p>

<p>By the birth of Alice they had five motor lorries and were the
foremost transporters in the city. Mrs. Heinz was already an
official of the Americanization League. She was very active in
turning hyphenated Americans into hundred-per-centers. Her husband
and brother remained rather obstinately peasant in speech and
appearance. They were at least neither Irish, Negro, Jew, nor
Catholic and could on occasion be got to assert that they despised
the lot. Mrs. Heinz would explain that Hamburgers were not like
other Germans. They were more like Anglo-Saxons. Cosmopolitan.
Resembling English and Americans of pure blood. Because of their
independence and descent from the Hanseatic traders. She herself
was a Hamburger.</p>

<p>Alice had been to school and high school in Springfield&mdash;but she
had just gone to Chicago University when the war broke out. In 1917
she had been nineteen. She was extraordinarily lazy and more than a
little untidy&mdash;but not at all unpopular in Chicago. In Springfield
she had not got on very well. The girls had not asked her to belong
to any of their clubs. That was perhaps because of the uncouthness
of her father or because her mother had cooked for the mothers of
other girls at her schools. One day she had appeared with the
initials B.Y.C. on her tunic. She had refused to explain them for a
long time. Then she said they were the initials of a powerful
secret club. A little later she had explained that to be a member
you had to be able to hang from the bough of a certain tree by your
toe-nails. This assertion, together with her complete reserve as to
any other details had gained her a certain notoriety.</p>

<p>The explanation was this...Being more or less ostracized she had
passed the greater part of her time in her backyard with her cat.
She had formed herself and her cat into a club&mdash;the Back Yard Club.
The cat could hang by its claws from a bough of the one hickory
tree in the yard. Alice herself, as perpetual president, did not
have to possess this qualification for membership.</p>

<p>Apparently Alice had had no idea of the humorous aspects of this
arrangement. She had no sense of humour. She had had a deeply
serious desire for revenge and for mortifying those of her school
comrades who could be mortified at being unable to penetrate her
secret. To be extraordinarily taciturn was no trouble to her. The
greater part of her mental broodings were even at that day unknown
to Henry Martin himself. It was only when she was very drunk on
alcohol that she would at all open her mind and then only to a
female intimate&mdash;hardly ever to Henry Martin. It was only when one
or other of these intimates openly or unwittingly had discussed her
with him that he had acquired what little insight he had into her
hidden character. It had been from the Baltimore girl who had
accompanied him to Chartres that he had had the story of the Back
Yard Club. The Baltimore girl had at that time been anxious to make
Alice seem attractive to him.</p>

<p>She was in Paris of course because of the necessity for the
German-descended to do War Service, though she appeared contented
enough to be there because she had a passion for looking at
pictures. Her mother had had no great difficulties to meet in
Springfield in spite of her enemy origins. Springfield was
preponderantly German in population. Nevertheless she had thought
it as well to let Alice go to France&mdash;as an auxiliary nurse.</p>

<p>For that Alice had proved herself entirely unsuited: she was too
hopelessly untidy, not so much on her person as with her
belongings. She had at last been pitchforked into a job where the
defect was no particular obstacle&mdash;that of assisting an older woman
in distributing to French hospitals the supplies that benevolent
America sent over in vast quantities.</p>

<p>She had been stationed with this woman at a depot near Blois.
They had French <i>poilus</i> attached to them to help in unpacking
crates; they lived in a small, oldmaidish house in the shadow of
the castle and drove great distances every day in an old car lent
them by the French authorities. This life seemed to have suited
Alice as well as any other. She appeared to have no very decided
tastes. She liked as well as anything to sit still in a
straight-backed chair, saying and doing nothing. But she liked
driving an automobile which she did with great coolness and
preferably at the highest speed to be obtained from the car which
she happened to be driving. At intervals more or less regular, of a
fortnight or two, she would visit museums or art galleries. She
would do so with avidity for about ten days. The next fortnight she
would spend apparently in digesting what she had seen&mdash;sitting
still with her hands in her lap and looking straight in front of
her. She never appeared to make any use of her knowledge.</p>

<p>She was rather small&mdash;which was singular since both her father
and mother were very tall&mdash;she was fair but not very fair; her
mouth was small and very red-lipped; she pouted naturally which
gave her usually a sulky expression except on the rare occasions
when she smiled. Her eyes were grey&mdash;not very large&mdash;with the brows
strongly marked. Several curling strands of rather luminous brown
hair usually came out from under her hat beside her cheeks. Her
equanimity was always absolute. She never lost her temper except
with high winds which she detested or when asked to tidy up a room
with speed. Then she would make a sound like 'Tcht! Tcht!' between
her teeth and make the confusion of what she was tidying seem more
hopeless...</p>

<p>During the drive to Chartres Henry Martin had gathered very
little about her. She was not interested in such few common friends
as they had. She had apparently made the acquaintance of the girl
from Baltimore at a boarding house at which they had both lived
after the armistice. After the Baltimore girl had gone to live with
Kuhn at an hotel she had come almost daily to take Alice to the
Louvre in Kuhn's car. Alice had apparently been going through the
pictures century by century. The Baltimore girl had stayed with her
when she found interesting the pictures through which Alice was
plodding. When she did not like them she drove Mr. Kuhn's
automobile round the Bois and returned to pick up Alice at closing
time.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had gathered that Alice had had a lover at the
boarding house&mdash;a Frenchman who had picked acquaintance with her at
the Salon Carre in the Louvre, and had taken up his quarters at the
<i>pension</i> for the purpose of sleeping with her. He did not
appear to have gone about with her during the day or to have
identified himself with her in any way. Apparently as soon as her
freshness had gone off for him he had broken with her, had told her
that she did not interest him any more, and had left the boarding
house. It had been immediately after that that the Baltimore girl
had suggested to her that she should go on the trip to
Chartres...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had not heard of Alice's former liaison until after
he had been married to her for some time. If he had heard of it
earlier it might have shocked him but, by the time he did, he was
already accustomed to the change in the point of view that had
overcome the world as he was to know it. Drink had no doubt had a
good deal to do with it. After Alice had been to the Louvre, the
Baltimore girl returning at closing time from her driving in the
Bois would take her to the Ritz bar. There they would meet Mr. Kuhn
and, amidst the noise of the polyglot but pre-eminently English and
American crowd, they would drink so many cocktails that it had
never been either the Baltimore girl or Alice who had driven home.
Mr. Kuhn on the other hand practically never exceeded, but the two
girls seemed to pass every evening in this state of definite
intoxication or mental haze.</p>

<p>His union with Alice had presented no aspect at all of romance.
At Chartres they had visited the cathedral, walked rather noisily
about the town in the dusk, dined copiously at a restaurant, played
auction whilst drinking champagne and <i>fine</i> in a private
sitting-room at the hotel. The girls had become very intoxicated
and had sung French songs. He remembered some necking with Alice
and that he had certainly kissed the Baltimore girl.</p>

<p>His necking with Alice had been rather timid on his part. He had
not known exactly what part he was supposed to play with a girl of
rich parents from his own town. By her it had been received rather
sulkily but without repulsion or reproof. He imagined afterwards
that she was resenting the Frenchman's desertion.</p>

<p>Next morning they had found themselves in bed together. Henry
Martin had no idea of how they got there nor, as far as he knew,
had Alice. She had exhibited a sort of exaggerated sulkiness during
the following morning, and at lunch she had expressed her intention
of returning at once to Paris. But after they had visited the
cathedral and attended Benediction she had said no more about it.
They had drunk almost as freely at dinner and during the subsequent
bridge but they had remained sober enough to know that, before they
went to sleep she had become, almost without preliminary
endearments, his mistress.</p>

<p>They had spent the two ensuing days in driving round the flat
country about Chartres. Alice drove at horrifying speed in country
lanes at the bottoms of valleys, then cresting ridges always to see
the distant blue spire of the cathderal, brooding, like a finger
pointing upwards, over the December plains...And Alice brooding
over the sight...</p>

<p>She told him once afterwards in Springfield, driving back more
than a little tight from the Country Club on a New Year's morning,
that the lot of them had never been so near their deaths as on that
period of driving. She said, if it hadn't been that each time she
had wanted once more to see that spire, when the car had been doing
over eighty she would have given a twist to the wheel. He shivered
sometimes still when he thought of it. He shivered at that moment.
But he never knew whether it was for hatred of himself and his
companions&mdash;and she came afterwards to hate Mr. Kuhn very
furiously, at least in her cups&mdash;or whether it was out of despair
for the loss of her Frenchman. She had told him once, too, that if
it had not been for the blue glass in the great rose window of the
cathedral just before Benediction that Christmas day he would never
have possessed her. She said once that if she ever found him
attractive it was when she used to imagine she saw him silhouetted
against that blue haze amongst the dark columns.</p>

<p>That was almost as much as he knew ever about her attitude
towards himself. They had once had almost a gay period together. It
was when, coerced into acting as traveller for Pisto-Brittle by his
father and herself, they had been driving to little places round
Chicago. She had driven almost as fast as she had round Chartres
and had almost uttered exclamations of delight when the pile round
the Spearmint building had from time to time appeared, grey-blue,
against the sky, above the plains. They had imagined at the time
that she had been with child but that had not proved to be the
case. He did not know whether she did or did not want to have
children. At first they had taken precautions against it happening.
But they had given these up, partly out of listlessness and partly
because they interfered with such physical pleasure as they got out
of their intercourse. They had, however, never had a child.</p>

<p>Henry Martin imagined that that might be because she had
procured an abortion whilst she was the mistress of the
Frenchman&mdash;or earlier. But he had no means of knowing. The physical
disability might well be in himself. He had no reason to suspect
that. But he had never had a child as the result of any of his
affairs and both his Sister Carrie and Brother Hal were
childless.</p>

<p>He sometimes thought that Alice was heartbroken over the
sterility of their union-that that might account for her
queernesses. But that too he had no means of knowing...</p>

<p>When they got back to Paris from Chartres Mr. Kuhn had just
simply clumped Alice's grips down in the apartment in the rue des
Saints Peres. That seemed to mark for Henry Martin the degree of
promiscuity that his world had reached. For himself he had till
then been on the side of the angels. Mr. Kuhn talked a great deal
more than Alice; in spite of that, his motives and point of view
were not much less inscrutable. He seemed to mark the passage of
time. Henry Martin learned that the French authorities at first and
then gradually the French in general were becoming extremely
unpopular. He knew that, because whatever Mr. Kuhn said represented
what was felt in the most correct circles. Mr. Kuhn's uniforms grew
daily more decorative and resplendent; his conversation more and
more to lay stress on the fact that his part in the war had been
strictly noncombatant. His task of assuring the welfare and comfort
of perhaps misguided soldiers had been fulfilled. He was careful to
inform hearers gathered together in the Ritz bar or more democratic
drinking places across the water that his present function was
merely to ensure that the United States got her dues out of the
iniquitous grafters who ruled the lately allied republic. He was
merely engaged in attempting to obtain early payment for
typewriters and sewing machines. They had formed the cargo of the
transport that had brought over himself and Henry Martin. But only
Henry Martin knew that.</p>

<p>Thus almost the same moment Henry Martin learned that it was
good form, or going very shortly to be good form, to dislike the
people among whom they lived, and that it was becoming more and
more the fashion for males to regard females as little more than
the casual furniture of a man's apartment. You could acquire women
as you acquired divans, mattresses or central heating and replace
them by other patterns when their attractiveness made them seem a
little shop-soiled...And women, of course, if their means
permitted, could behave exactly the same by men...A well-dressed
woman who had been sitting at his table whilst Alice was dancing
with her husband at the Bal Tabarin had said to him:</p>

<p>'You seem to be a niceish sort of a fellow. I'm a nice woman.
Why don't we divorce our husband and wife and get married?'</p>

<p>She had been of course more than a little lit&mdash;but it would not
have much astonished Henry Martin if the proposal had been agreed
to by Alice or the husband who was a prominent member of the
younger set of Providence, Rhode Island. Henry Martin had never
known their names. They had struck up a friendship, with
practically no introductions, at Harry's bar in a crowd all more or
less acquainted and had gone up to dance at the Ball Tabarin
because it was relatively inexpensive and both the men at the
moment rather broke...He had never seen that couple again.</p>

<p>If her union with Henry Martin had done her any good it was
fortunate for Alice that first Wanda and then his father had
arrived in the apartment just after they had had a very late and
fairly wet night at Montmartre. They had only just got up and the
apartment had been like a new pin. The <i>femme de ménage's</i>
tidying had had no time to be undone by Alice. She had not even
opened her <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> or dropped the wrapper in
the butter dish.</p>

<p>The <i>femme de ménage</i> had been an elderly lady with only
one eye, in a rusty black dress and perpetual carpet slippers. Her
other eye had been put out by a fragment of the bomb that had
destroyed her husband, one of her grandchildren&mdash;and a number of
other worshippers in the Church of St. Gervais on Good Friday,
1918. She had a singular high voice, like a horse's laugh, and she
and Alice played a perpetual game of catch-as-catch-can.</p>

<p>It had amused him at the time. He imagined now that that
amusement had given Alice a certain claim on him. It was perhaps
all the claim she had really ever had.</p>

<p>He had been in his apartment nearly two months. Every day at
least once the old lady had stood with her back to the doorpost of
the kitchen, leaning a little back, holding a fork and telling the
story of how she had lost her husband and grandchild at the same
moment. On a Good Friday. At Mass. God be thanked, they might be
considered as having gone straight to Paradise. They, if anyone
ever, would be in a state of grace. The thing that troubled her was
that it would be many years before she would see them again. She
was a good woman after her lights. <i>Sérieuse</i>! But she could
not expect to escape many years at least in Purgatory. Unless God
took into account her being an old woman who had been hard hit.
Sorely tried! She had put all her savings into the hands of the
Christian Sisters. The Government had seized all the property of
the Christian Sisters. So at seventy she was without a
<i>sou</i>.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had eaten in his apartment at least once every day.
His office had been next door to the Ministry, on the boulevard
round the corner. She had talked to him whilst he ate.</p>

<p>In that way she had acquired a proprietary interest in him, and
showed a great deal of devotion. Naturally Alice had torn that a
good deal. In spite of her untidi ness she was a masterful
housekeeper. A saucepan, a slipper and a hairbrush would stand
among his papers on the bureau but she scrutinized Madame
<i>Eugénie's</i> accounts with the fierce conviction that she would
find the old lady overcharging by at least ten cents a day...And a
dime a day meant a dollar every ten days. Thirty dollars a
year.</p>

<p>The old lady stood that with a good deal of humour. She would
stand respectfully behind Alice whilst Alice compared her books
with her receipts. But suddenly her one eye would fall on the
saucepan amongst the papers. She would wander with it, her felt
slippers dragging, away into the kitchen. When Alice would look up
with a fierce question as to the price of a T bone she would be
gone. When she came back, Alice's torrents of impetuous French
would be incomprehensible to her. In the middle of a long speech
her attention would wander and she would go away with the hairbrush
or the slipper. Sometimes it would be a stocking draped over the
Quimper pottery teapot on the mantelpiece or a bathrobe under the
sofa.</p>

<p>Her untidiness was extravagant considering that she was really
very careful of her personal appearance. It was to be accounted for
by her mental concentration. She would take the saucepan in order
to make coffee&mdash;for she considered that the French could not make
coffee. She would have been reading a letter from a girl friend
when she went to get the saucepan, so she would drop the several
pages of the letter into a bowl of salad in the kitchen sink. With
the saucepan in her hand she would remember that she had meant to
make a note of the date of a painting by the court painter to Louis
XIV&mdash;Rigaud...Rigaudin, some such name. So she would stand the
saucepan in among the papers on the bureau and become engrossed in
a long note on French art of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>He had once or twice asked her why she did not take up painting
herself. It might occupy her leisure moments. She had at first said
that she didn't care to. She wanted to be a good housewife. One
day, in a real temper, she had blazed out at him: Did he mean her
to shame her mother? Her uncle's children&mdash;four of them&mdash;were all
musical. Each of them played an instrument. All good
musicians...But did he want her to shame her mother by comparison
with them? They were good musicians. But once their instruments
were bought that was an end of the cost. Their music they got from
the symphony society to which they belonged...But consider the cost
of this painting...Brushes. Mediums. Palettes. Easel...A whole
paraphernalia every time you moved. She had a girl friend. Ida
Schlemberger! She painted and it was a shame. She was for ever
going to her parents for money for this and that...</p>

<p>When Alice was angry she had little quick movements. They were
attractive. When she was angry with Madame Eugénie she jumped from
side to side in her chair as if she were avoiding thrusts. It
reminded him of a film that he had seen of a mongoose evading the
strokes of a cobra. Not that Madame Eugénie was like a cobra. She
seemed amused by Alice. Or it may have been only that her peculiar
voice gave her the effect of laughing. Anyhow, when they had left
Paris she had sighed. She had said that you got used to people's
way and then, as soon as that happened, they went away.</p>

<p>Alice detested her. She found her invincibly dishonest because
she could not catch her in dishonesty. If she could have caught her
she would have liked her better, for she would have gained a cent
or two. But she could not. She began to detest all the French.
Every morning and afternoon she came back with a story of how one
shopkeeper had robbed her over a pair of stockings. Another had
called her <i>sale américaine</i>. She considered that she ought to
be admitted free to State collections of pictures. As if she had
been a copyist. She said she memorized the pictures&mdash;which was just
as good.</p>

<p>Looking at the matter from that distance Henry Martin considered
that the fact that she went on paying her francs for admission to
the Louvre proved that her ruling passion was not acquisitiveness.
She certainly at that moment possessed all the money that remained
to him. But she had acquired it so wordlessly that it had the air
of having been a natural process. Money flowed to her as water goes
down the hole in a bath. It went invisibly, apparently very slowly.
Then the bath was suddenly empty. His suicide was to be, as you
might say, the rather indecorous noise usually made by the last
waters of an emptying bath.</p>

<p>He didn't resent it&mdash;any more than he resented any other great
natural phenomenon. She was now, as things went, comfortably
situated. She must have six thousand a year or so all invested in
New York Central Bonds. In addition she had inherited from her
mother. No doubt in the end her investments would feel the frost.
At the moment they were almost unaffected. With six thousand a year
she could do well in Paris and no doubt, as soon as he was dead,
father would come to her assistance. He had said as much in answer
to a letter Henry Martin had written him from Paris four months
ago. Henry Martin had said that he was no longer in a position to
support his wife. Father had answered that he, Henry Martin, could
always return and again take up drumming for Pisto-Brittle. As long
as he did not he would have to support his wife. If on the other
hand he died, father would see that Alice was properly provided
for.</p>

<p>It began to worry him that, with all the time he had had for
thinking about it, he had never got his relationships straight in
his mind. Not with his father. Not with Alice...What was at the
bottom of his father? Determination to break him, Henry Martin, to
his will? The desire to continue the dynasty of sugar bakers?...All
he knew was that, all his life, he had felt against him a
tremendous obstinacy. Willing him to do something.</p>

<p>And, for the matter of that, what was at the bottom of Alice?
Avarice? Some unknown passion?...All his life with her he had felt
himself to be up against an obstinacy only equalled by that of his
father. But he could not feel that it willed him to do anything. It
was as if he hardly existed for her...</p>

<p>It burst like a shell in his mind that she might be a
Lesbian.</p>

<p>He knew next to nothing about Lesbianism. Alice had certainly
had a great deal to do with women and practically nothing to say to
men. Their presence always seemed to make her sulky...Sudden
excitement filled him. He felt as if he ought to investigate...As
if he had been wronged. As if he had wrongs that he could declaim
about. He had always wanted to have wrongs...To be in a position to
declaim about them...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Finished writing, old bean. Be ready in a minute....Then we'll
drink!'</p>

<p>The dim blue room and the window with the whirling shapes of
light became important again to Henry Martin. But he was too
excited not to return immediately to his brighter images...Paris
and Springfield. Those were what were really material...He was
haunted by the level-crossing over the railway where there had
always been a traffic jam. His father had walked them, as children,
down there. Passing the store that had the electric fixings.
Grandfather Smith's drug-store had been at the upper, left hand
comer, A little girl called Gretchen with two flaxen pigtails had
cried because he had shooed her away when she wanted to look
through the coloured demi-johns.</p>

<p>He was convinced that he had suffered a great wrong. That was a
queer thing to discover a few hours before...his end. If you
discovered a great wrong it ought to be about the middle of your
life. So that you would have time to track it down...It was true
that he knew nothing about Lesbians&mdash;their practices, beliefs,
private conversations. New York swarmed with them. There were
numbers in Paris. They did not seem to be so thick on the ground
there as in New York. Parisians disapproved more; they were more
old-fashioned. No doubt the Lesbians did not show themselves so
much.</p>

<p>Some man in New York&mdash;at a stag party at Hieronymo's&mdash;had once
said to him:</p>

<p>'How can you wonder at it? Look at the male New Yorker. He's a
crass beast. There must be eleven nice, educated, clean girls in
New York to every decent man...No wonder a nice girl prefers to
take up with another girl...'</p>

<p>It seemed plausible. When he looked at the table full of lit men
with whom he had been in company he could not imagine anyone
wanting to take up with anyone of them. They had been the larger
Pisto-Brittle New York distributors. Giving him a farewell dinner
before one of his returns to Springfield...That look had indeed
decided him&mdash;for the last time&mdash;to have done for good with
Pisto-Brittle and Springfield...He had had that farewell dinner
under false pretences. He hadn't gone back to Springfield&mdash;or only
to pack his grips.</p>

<p>Instead, immediately afterwards he had gone to see Mr. Kuhn who
lived then in an apartment in West Forty-Second Street. Mr. Kuhn
happened to be in. He suffered from hay fever and was of the
opinion that the pollen of the ragged herbs and loose-strife that
grew on the vacant building lots of the city were the cause of his
malady. He therefore stuffed the cracks of his windows with
medicated cotton and sat all day with his radio going.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had decided to take definitely to 'writing.' The
sight of the Pisto-Brittle agents embattled and all more or less
lit, round the speakeasy table, had certainly had something to do
with that determination. But no doubt it had been coming on. Mrs.
Percival must have had something to do with it. She was tall, cool,
with beautiful wrists and she seemed to him to be always shadowy.
In a hat with feathers drooping over the brim. At any rate she did
not seem to belong to the age of Pisto-Brittle agents...<i>Any</i>
other age!</p>

<p>When they weren't adolescent and high-voiced the Pisto-Brittle
agents were pendulous-jawed, greyish-faced and bass-voiced. Their
personal linen was profuse, they sucked huge cigars with fat lips,
slapped the beaming adolescents on the shoulders with enormously
heavy fat white hands and roared in harsh voices the glories of
various fellows who had extended the sales of Pisto-Brittle. The
thin adolescents beamed at having their shoulders struck by those
tallow thunderbolts and said:</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Schmalz! Sure, Mr. Schmalz!' in the blue smoke of the
great cigars and the fumes of straight alcohol disguised as
Burgundy. They made an incredible row considering that they had
nothing but Pisto-Brittle to talk about...Certainly Mrs. Percival
had nothing to do with an age that contained them...</p>

<p>She herself had been born in Stuttgart of quite pure American
parentage. Her parents had been in the diplomatic service. Her
husband treated her badly. He was a novelist of South Dakota
origin, but his people, who had been farmers, had moved to
Springfield where they had engaged in the shoe trade and become
very wealthy. Percival, the novelist, was by then well known. But
outrageous. A bad man. The parents sided with Mrs. Percival against
their son, and she came to make them a protracted visit. The
mother, at fifty, had taken to writing free verse of an extremely
modern type. She was grey-haired and thin and was understood to
have French blood. After she took to writing free verse she built a
studio over the back garden. It was in two tiers with a sort of
gallery like a stage. On this, the musical society to which
belonged the cousins of Alice performed every Thursday night. The
studio was adorned with very modern art from Paris. There was even
a Picasso drawing. The Percivals' house was thus quite an art
centre. Father and Alice's uncle Heinrich and Mr. Percival, Senior,
used to play cut-throat quietly in an alcove in the studio on
Thursday evenings. They all liked music with their cards. Alice's
father was not allowed to play with them on these evenings. He
could not be taught not to shout as German players shout over skat.
So on those evenings he used to go through his accounts with his
antique head-clerk over two immense seidels of what passed for
near-beer...</p>

<p>Quite an art-centre! A little Paris!...Nearly everyone who went
to the Percivals' on a Thursday evening could talk of the Place de
la Concorde. It gave them indeed a background that most of them at
one time or another had lately banked there...</p>

<p>Henry Martin exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p>'That's it...That was exactly it!'</p>

<p>There were people in the room...Hugh Monckton's English
chauffeur and a girl in a kimono like the wings of powdered
butterflies.</p>

<p>He remembered that Hugh Monckton had pushed open the
communicating door of the next room and had said something in
French...But the shock of his discovery or possibly the two shots
of '57 <i>fine</i> that he had swallowed down made it difficult to
keep his mind on Hugh Monckton and his companions...</p>

<p>When they had all three gone off to Paris two years or so ago,
Alice and Mrs. Percival had been going together...It was
outrageous. But he remembered twenty things that showed it...Old
Mrs. Heinz's disproportionate rage at their going...Old Mrs. Heinz
had made a special visit to the Pisto-Brittle works to warn Henry
Martin that if they went to Paris Alice would go to the devil. He
had thought at the time that the fiery-moustachioed grenadier of an
old woman had meant: because of the drink.</p>

<p>Alice had been becoming more eccentric at that time when under
the influence of liquor. Henry Martin had thought himself that
Alice had wanted to go back to Paris so that she might without
censure can herself and display her person in public places...Since
Mrs. Percival had been in Springfield Alice had taken dancing
lessons from her...Mrs. Percival had been a pupil of some
celebrated Russian. She could almost have been a professional. Once
when Percival had gone off to Latvia for three months he had left
Mrs. Percival without a cent. She had supported herself by dancing
Russian dances in one of the Parisian Palace Hotels...</p>

<p>It was outrageous!</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton was standing by the little bureau. The chauffeur
was seated at it. Hugh Monckton had one hand down on the paper
before the man. He said:</p>

<p>'You'll recognize this document, Phelps...You see the underlined
words. Now this codicil witnesseth...You'll recognize
Mademoiselle!'</p>

<p>He was saying to the girl who had her back to Henry Martin:</p>

<p>'Veuillez vous approcher un peu, petite, que Phelps puisse vous
reconnaitre?'</p>

<p>The girl had her handkerchief up to her face. Either she was
crying or ashamed...</p>

<p>The girl probably did not sleep with Hugh Monckton or he would
not have <i>vousvoyé'd</i> her. You probably say 'toi' to French
girls you sleep with. He himself had certainly always
<i>tutoyé'd</i> Félicité...</p>

<p>Mrs. Percival's face came before him...Her earnest face and deep
voice when he had been begging her to divorce Percival and marry
him. She had said...He heard her saying it:</p>

<p>'No. No. It's unthinkable. It would be too hard on Alice.'</p>

<p>He had argued with her incredulously. Other people divorced and
re-married. It was already settled that he and Alice were
divorcing. There was no reason why she should not divorce Percival.
She was not living with him since she was living with them. They
had then a very nicely furnished house in the rue des Quatre
Vents...Provençal armoires in brown wood with bright steel hinges
and ornamentations.</p>

<p>One of Alice's undergarments had been lying on a brown wood
settee. Mrs. Percival had said:</p>

<p>'But this would be different...unthinkable...'</p>

<p>He had taken Alice's garment and thrown it furiously into her
bedroom. She was at a dancing lesson...Outrageous.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said amiably:</p>

<p>'Heigh, old man. Turn on us the light of your countinghouse for
a second...'</p>

<p>He pointed Henry Martin out to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>'That's Mr. Henry Martin Aluin Smith,' he said. 'You'll
recognize him if you meet him again. One of the best.'</p>

<p>The man blinked at Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'Your ccrnsin, sir,' he said. 'No difficulty in recognizing 'im.
The spitting image of you, sir.'</p>

<p>The scrutiny destroyed Henry Martin's subconsciousness. Hitherto
these persons had seemed dim and in miniature. At the end of a
diminishing glass.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said to the girl:</p>

<p>'Regarde-toi bien ce monsieur, veux-tu, petite?'</p>

<p>He was <i>tutoy</i>-ing her now! But it was perhaps because she
was crying. She held her handkerchief over her eyes and shook her
head behind it when asked to look at Henry Martin. Hugh Monckton
said:</p>

<p>'A nice little filly. A decent piece. A bit watery because she's
been deserted by the Governor of French Cochin-Saigon.' He added:
'A pair of us, you see. Both deserted. Two inconsolables!' He said:
'Excuse me,' and began to give directions to Phelps.</p>

<p>Phelps was to take the silver Rolls-Royce and drive like hell to
Biarritz. He was to get to Biarritz station before Madame
Bumblecuppy Bumblecumbske. Madame Bumblecuppy Bumblecumbske's train
would just about be starting.</p>

<p>'There's a drive and a half for you, Phelps,' he said. 'You like
driving like that.'</p>

<p>Phelps was to present Madame Bumblecuppy Bumblecumbske with this
dressing-case full of souvenirs and five hundred francs' worth of
roses that he would buy in the town. After that he was to make his
way as fast or as slowly as he liked to London and put himself
under the orders of Mr. Cyril Monckton. Mr. Cyril would no doubt
find jobs for him.</p>

<p>'You're too good a man to lose,' he said.</p>

<p>Phelps asked if he might drive by Paris and pass a day or two
there. There was a little piece in that city.</p>

<p>'You'll never drive Madame Bumblecuppy Bumblecumbske again,'
Hugh Monckton said. 'Nor me either, very likely. I'm to wear the
jolly old willow.'</p>

<p>Phelps's immobile face became more immobile. He said, 'Oh, come
sir, there was a plenty of nice little pieces on sea and on
land...Madahmahsell there, now. She'd soon stop raining. One day
again they'd be up and away through the Khyber Pass to the Atlas
Mountings.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'No. No, Phelps. It's good of you, Phelps. No more little pieces
for me. Nor large ones. Napoo finny. Mamma say No Bong! I shall get
me to a monastery.'</p>

<p>'Those are my sentiments,' Mr. Phelps said. 'But there's
pleasure to be got out of little pieces if you don't let them wind
around your heart strings.' He said reflectively:</p>

<p>'I shan't be sorry not to be driving Madame Sorenson
again...Nervous she was. Not that she demonstrated! But little
shrieks, going round corners...Distracting...' Suddenly he said
earnestly:</p>

<p>'You ain't comtemplating nothing...Not rash, sir? "The rash
act"...the coroner said...That's how the papers put it.'</p>

<p>'You'll have to drive damn rashly if you don't start,' Hugh
Monckton said. He was pushing the chauffeur out of the room with
friendly pats on the shoulder.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The girl was still sitting beside the bureau...a particoloured
butterfly. Patches of vermilion, blue and emerald green. Her too
Hugh Monckton propelled across the room with friendly pats. She had
still her handkerchief to her face. She had never looked at Henry
Martin.</p>

<p>All these actions were dim to him. The room was dim, lit only by
the battered, shaded green lamp on the bureau that diffused a
little light with its reflections. Hugh Monckton had his right arm
round the girl. With his left hand he was forcing into the fingers
that held together her kimono a closely folded wad of paper.</p>

<p>'Vous me ferez le plaisir...la faveur...Phonneur, he said,
'd'accepter cela...oh, comme souvenir, you know. Vous avez ete
bonne pour moi.'</p>

<p>At the door she turned. Her right sleeve elevated itself. She
was like a butterfly about to take wing. With the awkwardness of a
woman throwing violently her hand came forward. The little packet
flew from it and dissolved into slowly descending sheets of paper.
Pinkish...Large French bills they were. They fell among the packing
cases.</p>

<p>'You speak French like a native,' Henry Martin accused him.</p>

<p>He was labouriously retrieving the notes from among the cases.
He came up slowly.</p>

<p>'Mustn't speak French too well unless it's necessary,' he said.
'It isn't done. He was counting the notes. 'A damn lot of things
aren't <i>done</i>' he grumbled. 'Most of the jolly things.' He
added: 'That little piece can't get over the ex-Governor of French
Cochin-Shanking-Saigun...Whatever it is...Not a very savourylooking
bloke, you'd say. But she can't get over his...oh,
defection...Wonderful things some women are...'</p>

<p>He took up a large envelope and put it down again.</p>

<p>'May as well go with the others and save stationery.'</p>

<p>He had inserted the notes into another large envelope that was
already addressed. He closed it and sealed it with a great red
wafer that shone on the white like a gout of blood.</p>

<p>'The girl's to have the notes,' he said. 'Enough to keep her for
a year. At her own computation.' He added: 'She told me what the
ex-Governor ought to have done if he'd done what she might have
expected he would have done...Name of Becquerel,' he said.
'Mademoiselle Jeanne Becquerel...'</p>

<p>He was standing astride the great, strapped, eccentrically
striped grip from which he had taken the leather case of the
<i>Fine de la Republique</i>. He looked a little wan.</p>

<p>'You'll think me a damn reckless fellow,' he said. 'But I take
plenty of precautions. I have this kit bag looking like a
harlequinade because any luggage-snatcher would think twice before
carrying it through the streets. It's bolted to the floor too and
lined with flexible steel.' He said absently: 'Plenty of
precautions...Plenty of...' Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>'My damned head...It's difficult to think of what I do want to
say...Like neuralgia of the worst...</p>

<p>He picked out of the grip a polished pig-skin case and pitched
it across to Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'Open it,' he said. 'Count them.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had never seen a thousand-pound note. There were
like magpies and rustled. There were twenty of them.</p>

<p>'Part purchase money for <i>Le Secret</i>,' Hugh Monckton
commented. He added: 'Come over here....He put the leather case
into a fold of the grip. I've warned the agent...Lamoricière...I've
seen you talking to him...that the purchase will not go
through.'</p>

<p>He closed the grip.</p>

<p>'Nothing will open it now,' he said. 'But look here. The "M" of
my initial goes over a stud...The nail head...If you pull it
out...See?'</p>

<p>The grip opened with the unctuous sound of good leather. He
said:</p>

<p>'You noticed that...The "M" of my...our initials...'</p>

<p>He repeated again:</p>

<p>'All these precautions...All these precautions...' Then more
briskly:</p>

<p>'But you'll know now...'</p>

<p>He exclaimed suddenly the one word: 'Unless...'</p>

<p>He looked earnestly at Henry Martin. He seemed almost
appealing:</p>

<p>'Unless you'd care...If it would give you pleasure...As a lark
you know...Don't you say "whoopee?"...'</p>

<p>He retreated rather wearily to the sofa, his square shoulders
rolling as he bestrode the luggage.</p>

<p>'It was meant to give pleasure...that money!' he said.
'Incalculable pleasure...And they say that non-active
capital...Frozen reserves...are the curse of to-day...I'd like to
think...'</p>

<p>He was suffering some emotion. It was perhaps only British
inarticulateness. He said:</p>

<p>'We'll drink now...The '57 is good enough, isn't it?...For a
last binge?...</p>

<p>It occurred to Henry Martin that it was not nice that Hugh
Monckton should drink. The glass of a motor might crash and cut
your face. He felt extreme dislike at the idea of having his face
cut by the splintering glass of a wrecked automobile...This fellow
had said he went cuckoo after the smallest drink. He was going to
drive back to Carqueiranne!...</p>

<p>It was, all the same, folly to bother about what happened to
your face if, in a few hours...</p>

<p>It was now well past twelve o'clock. He had meant at 6.30 sharp
to step: like a sentry...</p>

<p>It was odd the kind of delicacy that prevented your really
uttering...oh, the word for...passing over. Even when you're fully
determined...</p>

<p>If he did not get to Carqueiranne till two. Say, halfpast
two...It would hardly be worth while to go to bed. There would be
nothing to occupy him if he did not. All of his papers were
destroyed and all his clothes packed into his two grips. Along with
the souvenirs for Sister Carrie and Brother Hal...And of course
Mrs. Percival.</p>

<p>Sister Carrie was having a bad time with that blackguard
foreigner...he wished he could tell that fellow off...He wished he
could have told Mrs. Percival off...Because that had been a
monstrous discovery for him to have made. At what you might call
the eleventh hour!...It was too late to do anything about it. The
queer thing about...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Death...'</p>

<p>He was pouring the '57 brandy into a smallish tumbler. He was
doing it with the care of a chemist transferring a liquid from one
phial to another. His head was bent down, his eyes frowning
seriously at the liquid as it went over the neck of the bottle into
the glass.</p>

<p>He looked up and smiled ingenuously at Henry Martin:</p>

<p>'We'll drink,' he said. 'I don't suppose you want to get blotto?
It'll make two good goes...The ice pail is in the wash-stand.'</p>

<p>When Henry Martin came back from the end of the room with the
frosted pail Hugh Monckton on the sofa had stretched his long legs
before him. He had the air of resting after a great labour and of
being determined to make a long and luxurious sitting.</p>

<p>'As I was going to say,' he began, 'death is a queer
thing...Your...one's own death...Queer to think about...It will
leave you...<i>one</i>...so impotent...Powerless, you know.'</p>

<p>He made room on the sofa.</p>

<p>'Let's suppose you are in the trenches...You are timed to go
over...In say six hours...It's twelve-thirty now...Say at
six-thirty a.m...You say to yourself...'</p>

<p>He said suddenly:</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon for saying "you"...It's probably
disagreeable. You aren't preparing yourself for death...I ought to
say "one" all the time.'</p>

<p>He took a sip of his iced brandy and soda. He savoured it
luxuriously, rolling it over his tongue.</p>

<p>'The queer thing about contemplating death is the feeling of
absolute impotence it gives you...Supposing I mean, that you're in
complete health...'</p>

<p>He was still smacking his lips a little.</p>

<p>'Damn good <i>fine</i>, this,' he said 'That just illustrates
what I mean. I don't excuse myself for commending my own brandy. I
may tell you I haven't tasted any...Not, you know, to have a binge.
Not in donkeys' years. Tyranny of the doctor fellow, you know...I
always seem to feel my Johnnie standing at my elbow..."Two fluid
ounces of alcoholic liquor diluted to four in eleven," he seems to
say...Sir Pumpleby Pumpleby, you know. Physician-in-ordinary to His
Majesty...That sort of name. Standing at your elbow when your
butler fellow pours you a glass of '14 <i>Château Pavie</i>...'</p>

<p>He tapped a fat cigarette end on his thumbnail.</p>

<p>'Illustrates what I mean,' he repeated. 'This is the last of my
'57...I say to myself: "I must tell Cyril"...Cyril's my cousin. And
factotum...Bit of a tyrant too. Like the doctors...Damn it, you'd
think he'd let me die my own way. He's my heir. But no! it's: "I
wouldn't if I were you," or: "You'd better not, old man...Not
now!...Wait a bit!" All the time...'</p>

<p>He sipped again.</p>

<p>'The <i>fine</i> illustrates what I mean,' he said once more.
'This finishes it. Ordinarily I should say: "Cyril I must have some
more '57 brandy next week."...Or, as it's difficult to get I might
say to myself that I must get it myself...As being more sporting,
you understand. I use Cyril for routine and do difficult things
myself. And it's difficult nowadays to find difficult things to
have to do.'</p>

<p>He put his hand on Henry Martin's forearm.</p>

<p>'What's become of religion?' he asked. 'I suppose that when one
contemplated death in the old days one wondered where one was
going. Now one doesn't...Why?...One is irritated that one won't be
alive. One thinks of injustices one would like to put right...You
know...There are housemaids you think your buder isn't nice to. Or
women whose husbands were killed by grindstones in your
works...There's a Mrs. Taylor now...I had a letter from her at Nice
last week...Her husband worked for the dad and me, man and boy for
over fifteen years. And was killed...like that...She says she's
fifty-two and doesn't get about as well as she used to...'</p>

<p>His hand, as if persuasively, grew heavier on Henry Martin's
forearm...'In the old days,' he said, 'one would be afraid of going
before one's Maker...If one hadn't jolly well seen that injustice
was remedied to widows and orphans...and housemaids...Now...I don't
know. One forgets to think about one's Maker...Why?...Why does one,
as it were, postulate that there's nothing after death? And just
feel amazed that one will be powerless?...It's very disagreeable to
feel that one will be powerless.'</p>

<p>He reflected for a second or two.</p>

<p>'One can make a will,' he said, 'or add a codicil to one. As you
saw me doing. But wills and codicils are tricky things. Suddenly
they go off on a wrong sideroad. One would want to put them back on
the track. One would want to do it from where one is floating
in...what is it?...infinity...But one won't be able to. In the old
days one thought, I understand, before one popped off that if one
were one of the elect one would have the ear of God...So, if one
had left money for a scholarship at Magdalen, say, and the wrong
sort of fellows were getting it you could speak to God and He had
the thing put straight...Am I right? Or isn't that
pukka...eh...theology...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin was only half listening. Not half! He was
distracted, resentful and engrossed. This was a shadowy affair. He
felt as if he were continually being grabbed by the shoulder. By a
small boy. This distracted Englishman with a pain in his head was
of the mental calibre of a small boy. He grabbed one's shoulder and
gabbled irrelevant nonsense whilst one was engrossed. Gazing into
clear sea water at <i>infusoria</i>. He didn't know what
<i>infusoria</i> were...He said:</p>

<p>'In the Roman Catholic days the saints were supposed to have the
ear of God. So if you were one of the elect....'</p>

<p>He didn't know what <i>infusoria</i> were. But during the last
month at Carqueiranne he had several times spent half an hour or so
looking down into rock-pools. There were rocks below and to the
left of the hotel. There was practically no tide in the
Mediterranean but waves came up now and then. They left pools when
they receded. In the stereoscopic depths little beasts ran about
and opened and waved tentacles. He considered himself to be, now,
gazing into a still pool at the bottom of which was Mrs. Percival.
Amongst the wavering weeds of course, Alice was somewhere wavering
about her...As the male spider desultorily wavers around the
female...Until he makes his final dash...He had never before
thought of Alice as detrimental...Nefarious...He did now! That was
probably her secret.</p>

<p>Well: he had six hours...Five and a half! He had wanted to spend
them thinking in solitude about the rock pool. And this lunatic was
perpetually grabbing at his shoulder. He did so now.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose,' Hugh Monckton was burbling, 'that one could
pray to a saint to give one back Gloria Sorenson? The saint would
probably think it immoral.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said testily:</p>

<p>'You don't pray to a saint. You ask him to pray for you. That's
what <i>ora pro nobis</i> means.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Ah, you know everything!' and remained looking broodingly at
his extended feet.</p>

<p>'What a hope!' he exclaimed.</p>

<p>That was probably Alice's secret...Like the 'nice girls' of New
York she preferred a woman to him! He had danced and not given
pleasure...Nefarious! That was what it was. Alice was like a beast
of prey wandering in the jungle around Mrs. Percival...Who was
obviously the soul of innocence!...But was she? What did 'soul of
innocence' mean? An innocent soul, no doubt...As you say'Man of
sorrows.' Meaning sorrowful man.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton was pouring brandy into his glass. And still
talking. He appeared to be talking about his happy childhood. Or
perhaps it had been an unhappy childhood. He seemed to have had an
interfering father...Who had wanted to bring him up like a prince
of the blood-royal...Solitary!...He had had no friends. Had never
had any friends...But always great possessions!...He had never had
anyone to talk to...Till Madame Bumpiesomething...Gloria
Sorenson!...Now she was gone!...Rough luck...But now he had Henry
Martin to talk to...He felt instinctively that Henry Martin was
someone he could talk to,...</p>

<p>Damn the fellow...</p>

<p>Someone he, Hugh Monckton, could trust in...</p>

<p>You couldn't trust in anyone...There was Mrs. Percival!</p>

<p>It came suddenly over Henry Martin...When father had left
Paris...in 1919...June 1919...he had taken Alice with him. He had
developed gastric ulcers. Naturally! He had lived like a rhinoceros
in Paris. No doubt it had been worth it...But he had had to be
accompanied and looked after by his attached daughter-in-law. Henry
Martin had not been allowed to go home. He had been sent to the
army on the Rhine...There had been something queer about that.
Someone had certainly blocked his being sent home. There had been
nothing for him to do on the Rhine...A few accounts for him to
keep. Otherwise nothing...</p>

<p>The dark girl who had lived with Leopold Kuhn had come to the
Rhine. Kuhn had had enough of her. She appeared to resent it. She
and Henry Martin had passed a day or two together. In Coblenz. She
had put it into his head that Kuhn had cast his eyes on Alice and
for a day or two Henry Martin had been furiously angry. He imagined
that Kuhn had sailed with his father and Alice. Of course his
father would not be able to chaperone Alice.</p>

<p>But a few days afterward Henry Martin had had a picture postcard
from Kuhn. From Paris. Kuhn was still in Paris trying to get the
claims of his firm against the French Government settled...Henry
Martin had parted with the dark girl who had gone to Heidelberg to
find a fellow called Luther Cary of Baltimore...They had not found
much in each other...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had been kept over a year on the Rhine: he had come
to the conclusion later that it had been, after all, Kuhn or his
politically powerful firm that had had him kept there. He had seen
the sewing machines and typewriters in the hold and cabins of that
White Star liner. But that had all seemed vague and quiet. He had
arrived at the conclusion when Kuhn had introduced him to his
all-powerful uncle who, in the Algonquin dining-room, had given him
that disastrous financial advice...Yes, he had come to the
conclusion then that Kuhn had taken him to lunch either as a reward
for having kept his mouth shut or as a return for the in
convenience he had suffered for being kept away on the Rhine whilst
easy fortunes were being made in America...That was no doubt the
way grafters worked. They probably didn't, when they handed you out
your share, explain what it represented. He had often wondered how
people could face the fact of talking about graft when they got
together to plan. The one or two really big grafters he had met
socially had been very serious minded, silver haired persons with
markedly white hands and clean linen...So they probably never
talked about it.</p>

<p>That was quite unimportant. What had burst upon him like a bomb
just now&mdash;since he had been in that room!-had been his relationship
with Alice after his return from the Rhine to Springfield. It had
been then 1921...</p>

<p>There had been no relationship between them.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Percival had left Springfield!</p>

<p>She had been on a just-after-the-honeymoon visit with
Percival&mdash;to his father and mother. At that time Henry Martin had
not seen her. She had been in the town for a couple of days and
Alice had certainly seen her. He himself had been settling in. And
going round the Pisto-Brittle works and into Pisto-Brittle affairs.
With father. Mrs. Percival, he had vaguely understood, was already
beginning to get on badly with her husband. He was reported to have
every bad quality...But if Alice and Mrs. Percival...had even then
begun...oh, a love affair...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton, who had been going on tiresomely about something
or other, pressed his hand insistently on Henry Martin's
forearm.</p>

<p>'You'll of course not talk about it,' he said earnestly. He was
staring intently into Henry Martin's eyes. His face was appealing.
'But of course you are not the sort to talk about it...I felt that
the moment I set eyes on you...Even in Orderly Room in the old days
I saw that the most confidential returns went your way...I daresay
it's partly our having so nearly the same names...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'I don't exactly know what you're talking about. I daresay I'm
to be trusted.'</p>

<p>'About our A's,' Hugh Monckton said. 'I've been telling you what
I wouldn't tell anyone else in the world. Or I was just going to
tell you...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I wish you wouldn't...I can't be of any use to you or anyone. I
don't even know what your A's are.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'No, you wouldn't of course understand. You use such different
words...They're our ordinary shares. There's a saying that there's
one man at least that ought to have a statue in England...That's
the Ordinary Shareholder. The mug who first subscribes to a
company...And his statue ought to be set up in the Workhouse
Yard...Put our A's...Next Monday week...<i>Après demain en huit</i>
as the French say...Or it should be really demain en huit since
we've talked into to-morrow, Sunday, the sixteenth...Then they're
going to declare...'</p>

<p>His disjointed phrases were working Henry Martin into a rare
state of nervous distress. He had never liked Englishmen. He could
never see how any American could ever like any Englishman. The
English sometimes like Americans. But the other way round, never!
They did not seem human, those fellows. They made you
uncomfortable. They did not see things as you see them and you
never knew what they would say next. They were worse than negroes
because they were whiter and colder.</p>

<p>But this insistent fellow...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton's hand was heavier and heavier on his forearm:</p>

<p>'A final dividend of a hundred per cent,' he said. He added:
'Making a hundred and twenty per cent for the year...</p>

<p>He remained silent a long time looking intently at Henry
Martin.</p>

<p>Henry Martin remembered&mdash;There was no end to the coincidence in
this affair! But no doubt coincidences always crowded into your
last hours!&mdash;the solitary and final row he had had with Jack
Percival. It had been, precisely, about the taciturnity of the
English.</p>

<p>That would have been unbelievable; but they were shaping for a
row in any event. It had been on an occasion&mdash;at a table outside a
disagreeable café near the Pantheon in Paris. There had been some
idea of effecting a reconciliation between Mrs. Percival and that
fellow. His disagreeable accent was still in Henry Martin's ears.
He spoke&mdash;he looked!-like a bull frog with a brick throat. He had
brought an enormous bouquet with white paper frilling&mdash;like the
petticoats Sister Carrie had used to wear in Springfield. When they
had been children, and father with his gold-headed cane had taken
them for walks on Sundays...A quarter of a century ago...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'Damn it all...Aren't you any kind of a business man?...That's
inside information.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Not much...Not much of a business man, I mean...Information
about what?...'</p>

<p>The bringing of the bouquet...for Alice!...had been a rough sign
of grace. On the part of Jack Percival. He affected the rough
diamond. He had once passed three months as a cowboy. Somewhere.
When his lungs had been touched. So he had offered the bouquet to
Alice with simulated awkwardness...As if to show a bashful,
he-man's sense of his gratitude for her hospitality to a wife he
ought to have looked after himself.</p>

<p>A rough diamond...Henry Martin felt a revulsion...At the thought
of a rough diamond in bed with the soft flesh of Mrs. Percival!
Then...</p>

<p>But perhaps Mrs. Percival...and Alice...were wronging that
fellow too! A tenebrous affair!</p>

<p>He wondered where he had got the word 'tenebrous.' Probably from
a translation of the Russian author Turgenev. He had been reading
Turgenev at that time.</p>

<p>But it had been tenebrous all right. The terrace of the café had
been too narrow and ill-lit. They had sat close together, in gloom.
Their faces had appeared rather pallid when they had been three
minutes there. Jack Percival had already been in a hell of a
temper...Jerking his arms about alongside his frog's
head...Obviously, Mrs. Percival's revulsion from him had been
sufficiently justified. He couldn't see that Alice's had
been...from him, Henry Martin.</p>

<p>Yet obviously she had felt revulsion. From the very minute when
he got back to Springfield. Coming from the Rhine!</p>

<p>From that date they had never lived...<i>Maritalement</i> the
French called it...Except after drinking parties when there had
been lots of straight alcohol...Twentyone to Thirty-one...Say to
1929. When they had already agreed to divorce...Nine or ten
years...</p>

<p>Only after drinking...Perhaps, then, Alice had had
justification...</p>

<p>There had been in those tenebrousnesses outside the café two who
hadn't given pleasure...</p>

<p>And two who presumably had...</p>

<p>He perhaps had been the only blind one in an electric charged
atmosphere. Percival may have seen through it. That was perhaps why
he had treated him, Henry Martin, like a moron.</p>

<p>There had been no talk of reconciliation between Jack Percival
and Mrs. Percival. She had behaved like a perfect English lady. It
had excited his admiration!</p>

<p>Think of that! It had excited his admiration!...He had thought
that that was what it was to have been born into diplomatic circles
in Europe. She had sat, tall and drooping, playing with her glove
buttons. Of the four of them she had been the only one to secure
space enough in which to droop. The others had been all three
jammed together. And, as it were, all listening to her. Though she
only spoke once. But that had been enough.</p>

<p>Percival had been blustering about a film from one of his
stories that Hollywood had released a couple of months before. He
had got, from the Gaumont agency probably, a list of bookings for
it. He had said to Mrs. Percival:</p>

<p>'We could see it at Innsbruck on the fourth. Or in Castellamare
on the twenty-first...'</p>

<p>They had all hung on Mrs. Percival's lips. She had sat looking
down at her hands a long time...It had appeared afterwards that
Percival had proposed to take his wife on a renewed honeymoon
tour&mdash;a third one!&mdash;through the Tyrol to some Italian sea-shore
village where they were to spend some months...</p>

<p>'Hang it all...I knew American business methods were pretty
unsound...But I thought you all just doted on a flutter...You could
make a million by Monday week...'</p>

<p>'Ah! I once had financial advice from a millionaire in the inner
ring. It cost me my eye-teeth and then some.'</p>

<p>He was astonished at his rudeness. The searchlights went on
whirling their arms behind the dark windows. He was dizzy. Hugh
Monckton had recoiled to the end of the sofa. He was dim.</p>

<p>The two women had told him nothing about Jack Percival's
proposal for a third honeymoon. They had told him readily enough
when he had afterwards questioned them about it.</p>

<p>The third honeymoon. Henry Martin didn't know very definite
details of the Percivals' married life. He didn't for instance know
where they had spent the first honeymoon. It had not lasted long
apparently. After it there had come the time when the fellow had
left her to support herself by dancing in hotels! Apparently they
had come together again. Then they spent a second honeymoon. In
Springfield. In 1921. With his parents. Percival père had been born
in Denver. In 1875 or so, during a gold rush. His parents had
trekked there in blizzards in a prairie schooner. Something like
that. It was from that fact that Jack Percival drew his claim to
behave like a rough diamond...To roar and wave his hands over
beer-schooners outside Paris cafes. He claimed that he could not be
expected to support a quiet life in Springfield. He was of pioneer
ancestry. He had spent six months on a ranch. During the war...</p>

<p>After a long pause, Mrs. Percival had looked at Alice and said
slowly:</p>

<p>'We shall be in Chester on the fourth, shan't we?...And
Edinburgh on the twenty-first.'</p>

<p>Jack Percival had hurled the bouquet with its frills amongst the
cigarette butts beneath the table and had ground it under his right
heel. This had seemed to be a gratuitous exhibition of coarse
vindictiveness...At the time it had seemed that. Colorado gold-rush
manners. Mrs. Percival had seemed perfectly justified in giving
such a fellow a peremptory <i>coup de grâce</i>. The fellow had had
the presumption to ask that tall, delicate creature to share once
more his savage caves with him. He had been properly rapped over
the knuckles. Quietly and with dextrousness...He had retorted by
crushing flowers into the concrete of the café terrace...Alice's
flowers!</p>

<p>At the time Henry Martin would hardly have been able to express
all the reprehension of this grossness that he felt. His gorge had
risen. This was a fellow who warred with women...as if he had
struck them.</p>

<p>He had not had any chance to express his reprehension. He had
not yet spoken and within two minutes the fellow had been at his
throat. Calling him a moron!</p>

<p>Percival had said with bitter contempt to his wife and
Alice:</p>

<p>'Ah, you <i>would</i> want to get away among hysterical people
like the English. When you have the chance to get among sheer, hard
personalities.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin, feeling like a Perseus defending two Andromedas,
had plunged into asking Percival if he meant that Italians were
more restrained than the English. The reverse was generally
considered to be the case.</p>

<p>Percival had retorted that no one but a moron believed in
accepted ideas. The English were hysterical. And completely without
manners! They were verbally constipated in mixed company because
they were hysterically shy. But get an Englishman alone in a rail
way carriage on a long journey and inside of ten minutes he would
be rehearsing to you his most intimate, private grievances. And his
entire autobiography and parentage and all about his father's
Oedipus complex. It was only Americans, Italians and the yellow
races that were reticent in face of the disgusting problems that
life offered you.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had countered by asking Percival what he could know
about it. He had never been in England. He had been being an
amateur cowboy whilst Henry Martin had been at Magdalen and in the
British Army. He flattered himself that he had had opportunities of
seeing sides of the English character that were closed to most
people. And he considered the English to be unimaginably reticent.
They never spoke of their private affairs. That was what made them
so misunderstood by the rest of the world. No one knew anything
about them.</p>

<p>Percival had let out a maddened laugh&mdash;a sound such as might be
presumed to be made by an Atheist in Hell.</p>

<p>'Opportunities,' he had yelled. He had waved his hands over his
head. 'Yes, you have opportunities enough, you fellows. I know a
drummer who had peddled stovepipe elbows all over China from the
Great Wall to Tibet and sold them to the Dalai Lama. During the
Boxer Rebellion. And there he was back in Cincinnati. Having seen
as much as you see here...' He drew in his breath so sharply it was
like a sob: 'Opportunities,' he had repeated. 'You have them. And
you don't see what's as near to you as your moron's face to your
moron's nose!' He had stood up, hammering the ham of his hand on
the tin table top. 'You,' he said, 'couldn't talk about the
indecencies of your personal relationships in a railway carriage.
You haven't got the brains to see them.' He had rushed away, waving
his arms, all across the rue Soufflot...</p>

<p>The three of them&mdash;he, Alice and Mrs. Percival&mdash;had
walked home rather silently. As if they had been sobered by a
shock!</p>

<p>It had occurred to Henry Martin that that fellow must have been
jealous...of Henry Martin and his wife! And out of that had grown
his attraction to Mrs. Percival. He had not much noticed her
before.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton had exclaimed mournfully and as if with
reproach:</p>

<p>'It's not too damn decent of you, old bean...You'd think you
regarded me as a confidence-trick man...It's too damn well known
who I am...And, God, I don't want anyone's money.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'I don't know what all this is about...These circumstances are
rather extraordinary...And, let me tell you, I'm not myself.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton said:</p>

<p>'We <i>were</i> in the same regiment...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin exclaimed:</p>

<p>'For the Lord's sake...' He added: 'I've already told you I'm
<i>not</i> myself. All this is extremely odd.' He said finally, 'I
guess it's where I get off.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless he did not move. He found that he wanted to do
something for this fellow. His distress had swum up even through
Henry Martin's humiliation.'...</p>

<p>This Englishman was obviously trying to do what in Springfield,
Ohio, used to be called telling you his middle name. To that extent
Jack Percival was vindicated. He was also vindicated&mdash;for his
apparently unseemly emotion. What his emotion was about had not
come through to Henry Martin then...Now he saw that he had been a
dull fool...A moron!</p>

<p>Now, what this fellow was in a state about did not come through
to him. It might in ten years' time...But there would be no ten
years...He would be an eternalized moron! He said:</p>

<p>'I'm sorry. I'm not in a position to do anything for
anyone.'</p>

<p>'Hugh Monckton had sprung to his feet.</p>

<p>'What the devil do you think you could do for <i>me</i>?' he
said contemptuously. 'I asked you, it's true, a favour....But damn
it!...'</p>

<p>He strode beside the secretaire and out of a waste paper basket
pulled by a long strap a polished leathercase of an irregular leg
of mutton form.</p>

<p>Henry Martin said to himself:</p>

<p>'By God! that's a gun! If he shot me it might be a
solution!'</p>

<p>It swung, jerking at the end of the strap.</p>

<p>'One would have imagined,' Hugh Monckton said, 'that you'd have
seen that exceptional circumstances demand exceptional offers...Let
me tell you the favour I asked you...'</p>

<p>'I don't understand...' Henry Martin was beginning. He certainly
wanted to do the fellow a favour. But how could he? You can't do
favours from the bottom of the Mediterranean. You become a
nullity.</p>

<p>Under glass! Still he seemed to show sympathy...But with
what?</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton was shouting to drown his voice:</p>

<p>'It wasn't for myself. It was for the memory of Gloria. These
dancing people leave no memories when they are dead...Imagine
you'll see clearer when you read my letter...She has sung and
danced...And given a great deal of pleasure. But these things are
so fugitive...So, as you'll see, those other permanent things are
to go to the Museums as the Gloria Sorenson Collection.'...He waved
his free hand toward his packing-cases and grips. They were like a
mournful mound in the dim room. His voice had fallen after the
first sentence. He was swaying a little on his long legs.</p>

<p>'I offered...the...the other stuff to you...For a flutter...It
was meant to go...fugitively as you might say...In giving Gloria
pleasure...So I wanted it to go in giving pleasure...To someone, as
you might say, in the regiment...It struck me as odd that someone
who'd been in the regiment should turn up to-night...The first I've
seen in donkey's years...Gloria, you know, was like a great
butterfly...You've seen her of course...The symbol of the soul, you
know...It should be immortal!...But you want to go to bed...Death
and his brother Sleep...I daresay I go to a better place...Don't
mind me. I'm drunk...'</p>

<p>He swung his wrist, coiling the strap of the revolver around it.
He strode toward the door. Henry Martin was unwilling to move.</p>

<p>'I don't mind sitting up with you,' he heard himself say. He had
had no idea of saying it.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton faced him smiling:</p>

<p>'No, old bean, you don't,' he said. 'This is where you get off
as you put it...Makes you feel queer to be sitting with a
confidence trickster...You'll understand better to-morrow...'</p>

<p>He slapped the hand with the gun in it against his thigh. He
laughed as if he were neighing.</p>

<p>'It's a good joke,' he said. 'I suppose you thought the products
of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street were cuttings from the
Yellow Press. Ten to one you never saw a flimsy of that size
before.'</p>

<p>He went on laughing, swaying backwards on his legs like an
actress playing intoxicated parts on the opera stage. He beckoned
with his gun:</p>

<p>'Come on,' he laughed. 'Let's carry the good news from Aix to
Ghent. That'll knock 'em on the old Carqueiranne highway!'</p>

<p>Even on the dim staircase he stopped to laugh and nudge Henry
Martin:</p>

<p>'Good old confidence game!' he said. 'You hand me your wallet to
walk around a block with. Just to show your trust...And I hand you
my twenty thou, of wrong ones...One can see there ain't no flies on
you...I learnt that in New York when father was there about the
Dekobra affair...Oh, you deep ones...'</p>

<p>On the silent quay he tapped Henry Martin on the shoulder.</p>

<p>'In ten minutes,' he said, 'I'll be a snortin', rarin', ravin'
blade...But in nine you'll be on your hotel doorstep...Then let the
wind blow high...Don't worry, it's only twenty-seven
kilometres...Didn't you know the Monckton sixty did five a
minute?...That's why we're declaring a hundred per cent on our A
Shares on Thursday week!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Henry Martin reeled a little on the bare boards of his
skeletonly clean bedroom. He stood listening. And extremely
displeased with himself. He had taken two steps towards the door.
In the conviction that he ought to go down again and look after
that agonized lunatic. His ears still ached with the roar of the
unthrottled Monckton car. Even when you were inside, it made the
noise of a hundred aeroplane engines tearing sheets of satin. His
knees still ached with wedging himself in, his eyes were strained
with peering into the blazing darkness...The fellow had driven
like...like a lunatic in agony...</p>

<p>Apparently he had not yet gone. He had said that he wanted to
tune the car of torture up for what he had called Dick Turpin's
last ride to York. His language had grown completely
incomprehensible...The thing to do was to ask him in to have a
drink...You couldn't ask a man to your room at one in the morning
and not ask him to have a drink...But the only drink he had was a
very small flask. He had reserved that for the very last. To-morrow
morning...No: <i>this</i> morning. In case he needed heartening
up.</p>

<p>But that fellow was probably going to commit suicide. You can't
let a man commit suicide. That is perhaps the only thing you
actually cannot do. It is a sin to commit suicide. If you connive
at it it is doubly a sin!</p>

<p>He was already outside his door, clumping along the long wooden
corridor...It might perhaps help him with the Recording Angel if he
sacrificed his last drink to keep a man from committing suicide. A
Russian story came into his head. He had heard it years ago. He
didn't know where...A skinny old peasant woman was before the
Recording Angel. Just behind her back was the bottomless pit. It
was filled to the brim and in it swam and struggled the desperately
damned. The Angel asked her if she could remember one good deed in
her long, grasping life. She could remember none. The Angel cried:
'Think! Think! Not one!' And he was pushing her towards the pit. At
the brink she screamed out: 'One! Yes, one!'...She had once given a
rotten onion to a starving woman. The Angel pushed her into the
pit. He held down to her by its stalk a rotten onion. She grasped
it and was being drawn out of the pit. But other desperate souls
grasped at her skirt and were being drawn out. She kicked with her
legs and screamed: 'No; this is my onion. Let go! This is my
onion!' It broke and she descended for ever into the bottomless
pit.</p>

<p>He was descending the pitch-dark stairs. At the bottom he
stumbled and fell on his knees. He was making noise enough to
awaken the whole house. And the dead!</p>

<p>There was very little light in the dining hall and he couldn't
find the switches. A nickel coffee machine behind the bar at one
end of the darkness glimmered in the starlight from a little window
that gradually showed itself high up. He was thus oriented and
found the door fastenings to fumble with. He was in a desperate
hurry. He was convinced that Hugh Monckton intended to do away with
himself. The thing to do was to sit up with him through the night.
He remembered to have heard of two men who had taken it in relays
to sit up with some fellow for a fortnight. After La Belle Otero
had thrown him over for Edward VII...It was a parallel case. Of
course Gloria Sorenson was not La Belle Otero. But neither was Mr.
Bumblepuppy something-or-other, King Edward VII...Nevertheless a
great poet is sometimes regarded as bulking as largely as a
king...If he, Henry Martin, had persevered with his writing he
might have become as important as a king...But kings were no longer
very important. He was barking his knuckles on the invisible
fixings of the back of the door. It was immensely heavy and
cumbersomely fashioned. It swung back at last, noiselessly on its
greased hinges. A square of the dust of starlight existed. That
starlight was like dust. Then the door struck against the wall and
its fixings went on tintillating...</p>

<p>A rumble of a car, speeding, came to him from up behind; beneath
the hills. It ran with the engrossed sound of something that went
on an errand, the noise streaming out behind. It died away,
rose...died away. At last you could not hear it at all though you
strained your ears...It was probably nearly at Hyères by now. It
was at least going in that direction. If it had been going towards
St. Jean du Var there would have been some hope...</p>

<p>It seemed to Henry Martin that, as long&mdash;and only as long&mdash;as he
heard that sound Hugh Monckton would be alive...He was probably
making for cliffs over which he could dash into the sea. Henry
Martin could not remember any cliffs along that coast&mdash;not as far
as the Italian frontier. The road went high on leaving Beaulieu for
Monaco&mdash;and near the sea. But you could hardly crash a light car
through the stone wall of the Corniche...However fast you went at
it you would glance off. There was not breadth enough of road to
let you charge at right angles...The picture of the road was
brought before him&mdash;like nostalgia. The sea intensely blue, with
gentle fleeces of unimaginably white foam. The road of the Corniche
dove-colour, the balustrade pinkish...He was never going to see
that road again.</p>

<p>And perhaps Hugh Monckton was not going to kill himself in that
way. He might object to smashing up that car as Henry Martin
recoiled from the idea of humiliating his boat. He would choose
some other way...Yet Hugh Monckton had talked...raved!...about
setting the Monckton sixty at a bullfinch. He had been boasting
about what the car could do. At the moment, shaken to pieces, Henry
Martin had not known what a bullfinch was. Now he remembered to
have seen a rider in a top hat&mdash;in a sporting print. The horse was
plunging through a thin plantation of something like sumach in an
earth wall. He seemed to remember that the print had been
captioned: 'Tare an' 'ounds at the Bullfinch.'...A fox-hunting
procedure...Perhaps that mad fellow intended to try out his adored
car in some such way. It was as if that had been the last thing
left to him to take a pride in...</p>

<p>As they had passed a little side-road going toward the sea Hugh
Monckton had laughed out that there was a goodish bullfinch down
there. The road, Hugh Monkton knew, ran down to a tiny cove between
high granite cliffs...What they called a <i>calangue</i> about
there. But he could not remember what that particular calangue was
called. It was between the sea and Le Pradet. Or perhaps the place
was not called Le Pradet. At any rate it was not so far as St. Jean
du Var.</p>

<p>The cove contained only a cubical blind brick building in some
way connected with the electric power supply of the districts, but
there was a little strip of sand of extraordinary whiteness. The
people of the town bathed and swarmed there on a Sunday. Pullulated
was the word. But during the week it was quite lonely. A place
where sirens might have disported themselves!</p>

<p>The red rocks forming the calangue rose precipitously from the
strip of sand but a path at not too steep an angle mounted like a
bandolier across their face. On the top there was a coppice of
umbrella and stone pines, the ground soft with the pine needles and
the light between their mournful trunks dim as it is in a
cathedral. Henry Martin remembered to have gone there three times.
Once, about a month ago he had gone there to think out a letter to
his father. His father had replied to it opprobriously a week ago.
Once he had put into the cove in the boat and had tried fishing for
<i>rascasses</i>...That had been on his first visit. He had had so
little success with the <i>rascasses</i> that he had climbed the
hill to look at the view. That was how he had discovered the
thicket.</p>

<p>On the third occasion he had come through the thicket after
calling ingloriously on M. Lamoricière. M. Lamoricière was the real
estate agent who, it now appeared, had been negotiating the sale of
<i>Le Secret</i> to Hugh Monckton. That was another
coincidence...Below the thicket and beyond the road that led to the
main route from Le Pradet&mdash;if it was Le Pradet&mdash;was a stretch of
grassland on top of the cliff. It was unusual to have pasture in
those parts but the local property-owner interested himself in
sheep. He had two hundred and fifty in a long byre in a wood a
little inland.</p>

<p>On top of the pasture stood the villa of M. Lamoricière. M.
Lamoricière was a thin, jet-black bearded sympathetic person who
wore black glasses to protect his weak sight from the sunlight that
poured itself over that upland. His manner was extraordinarily
gentle and he made faded-like gestures with his thin white hands.
He had, like every one in those regions, been at one time a
colonial administrator somewhere in French East Asia.</p>

<p>But even through his gentle kindliness there had penetrated a
tinge of disappointment at Henry Martin's call. He had expected
another Mr. Smith&mdash;it was quite easy now to see whom. The other
Monsieur Smeez was expected to make great purchases. Henry Martin
had come merely to look for a job...He had not taken the blows of
destiny entirely lying down. He could score that to himself.</p>

<p>It had occurred to him that he might not be un-useful in the
real estate business. He had a perfectly good knowledge of
commercial French. Indeed his father had at one time contemplated
opening a Pisto-Brittle agency in Paris and Henry Martin to oblige
him had opened negotiations with several firms in the larger cities
of France. He had even had an office and a clerk of his own for
some months. The experiment had faded out, but Henry Martin
imagined that it had given him insight into French commercial
frames of mind. He also knew Americans.</p>

<p>He had called at M. Lamoricière's office to find that that
amiable gentleman was confined at home with a severe attack of
neuritis in the forehead. He had, however, made a date to receive
Henry Martin at his own house the same afternoon. The interview had
taken place in a dim room whose light filtered through the slats of
jalousies on to innumerable Napoleonic relics...Eagles in gilt,
brass-headed swords; a standard or two and some uniforms in
glass-faced cupboards...M. Lamoricière seemed like a fabulous
monster. His first remark had been to the effect that the road to
his villa would never be supportable until some member of the
Bonaparte family was Dictator of France. He was a Corsican and a
Bonapartist...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had at first been taken for a gentleman whom he
supposed to be called Ash-Hammersmith. He had been received very
cordially. The real estate agent's tense features had slackened
into smiles. Henry Martin realized by now that he was supposed to
be bringing what, for France, must appear to be the tidy sum of two
and a half million francs. For the part-purchase of <i>Le
Secret</i>. M. Lamoricière was imagining himself to be meeting Hugh
Monckton...H. M. A. Smith. If you pronounced those initials in the
French fashion...'Asch...Em...Ah...Smeez' you made a name something
like Ash-Hammersmith...</p>

<p>The interview really proved the death blow for Henry Martin. M.
Lamoricière lost hardly any of his cordiality when he learned that
Henry Martin did not desire to buy a two and a half million franc
yacht. Nevertheless an almost tragic sadness fell upon his high
features...Sadness for the sake of beloved France.</p>

<p>It was delightful and sympathetic, he said, that Henry Martin
should desire to pass the rest of his days in their beautiful land.
And certainly depopulated France had need in her desperate state of
new citizens as loyal as they were energetic. Such a young man as
Henry Martin was just what France needed to supplement her
disappearing birth rate. Nothing could be more advantageous.</p>

<p>But alas!...with the ruin of the approaching Crisis...which M.
Lamoricière could assure Henry Martin was merely at its
beginnings!...with the Bourse falling, the Government venal,
incompetent and rhetorical, how could France support more mouths?
No doubt Henry Martin with his special capacity, his admirable
knowledge of French and his social gifts might increase the
business of the country. But that was a speculation. And who would
take the risk? It was no time for taking risks. The State itself
made it impossible to take such a risk. Henry Martin would have to
provide himself with a <i>carte-de-travail</i>...a permission to
work in France. And that permission would be refused him.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière had seated himself behind his high, knee-well
writing desk. Its black leather indented top was covered with
bronze eagles. Six points of light gleamed in his black spectacles.
Even, he said, if Henry Martin proposed to put capital into his
business he could not advise such a course. He would carefully
consider the offer from his own point of view but he would not
advise Henry Martin to take any such step.</p>

<p>He asked Henry Martin to consider several points. The business
at present just supported him, M. Lamoricière, his wife, his
partner M. Flobel and <i>his</i> wife and the single girl secretary
whom they employed. If Henry Martin put capital into the business
it might be possible to extend it. On the other hand it might not
be possible. The English on that coast where they had formerly
swarmed were selling their properties very rapidly. That made
business active. But it grew in proportion less remunerative.
Prices fell and purchasers were less easy to find. Henry Martin of
course knew more about American affairs than he. But, for his part,
M. Lamoricière did not believe that any rush of American buyers was
to be anticipated for several years to come. He had had
unfortunately reason to follow the American markets. He had
invested a moiety of his savings during his colonial career, in
American undertakings. That had been a disastrous affair. The
French Bourse had been more propitious. But that too, God knew, had
been bad enough. So that after years of industrious, honest and, he
trusted, efficient labours beneath the suns of the tropics he found
himself forced to work at an office desk. He had hoped to have
leant back and rested on his oars. He was tempted to say that he
had almost a right to lean on his oars...But there he was, with
deteriorated health, almost, as you might say, at the beginning of
his career again. It was tragic. It was almost more than
tragic...</p>

<p>His thin features on which the polished skin lay in tight folds
were for a moment convulsed with pain. He had been talking in a
long monologue&mdash;monotonously and with resignation. Now he drew his
breath in between his teeth so that he hissed. He rose rather
precipitately for a man usually deliberate in his movements. He
conducted Henry Martin with little pats on the shoulder to the
door. In the blaze of light on the veranda he covered his brows
with his left hand. He pointed with his right away over the pasture
lot. Where it rose again, waving towards the sky, was the thicket
of pines on a mound.</p>

<p>'Go and observe the view from there,' he said. 'If I had to
advise you I should say: "My young friend. Buy that hillock with
its grove of pine trees. Erect in their shade the most modest
shelter that you consider compatible with your needs. Then realize
whatever your fortune may be. In gold! Put it in a stocking. Bury
it. And take out from it once a year just sufficient for your
needs. In that way you might live to see better times...But you
might not, of course".'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had gone round the pasture. In the grey-blue light
beneath the tree trunks he had first felt death in his heart. He
had just lately written to his father. He had said that, with a
little capital something might be done with real estate in that
part of the world. He had said that he was at the end of his tether
and had asked his father to make him the loan of some thousand
dollars. He had no great hope of his father's acceding. But, till
that moment, he had thought that he could with a little trouble
find a job.</p>

<p>But with the words <i>carte de travail</i> of M. Lamoricière he
had felt a sudden falling of the heart. It was as if the world
situation had come home to him. For the first time he really felt
himself a part of the world situation. He sat amongst the
purplish...greying...reddish, large-scaled trunks of the pines. He
was on a knoll with the Mediterranean below him. But actually the
kingdoms of the earth stretched before him. And particularly the
republics...</p>

<p>That had been a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>He had for the first time known that he was up against it. Till
then he had perhaps believed that one might become one of the
destitute millions of the world. But he had not taken himself to be
such a one. He had really no hope that his father would make him a
loan. His father would say: why couldn't he return and drum for
Pisto-Brittle again? There was some reason in that...for his
father. He had failed at everything else. The grey mountain of a
man, sitting behind the table in the Pisto-Brittle office and
raising and dropping alternately his spatulate, white fingers on
each side of Henry Martin's letter that would lie before him, would
ask himself that question over and over again. Then he would write,
heavily, a contemptuous cable.</p>

<p>Up in the pine-thicket Henry Martin had known that that was what
would happen. And it was what had happened. His father had
cabled:</p>

<p>'Try another star. No possum up this tree.'</p>

<p>He was prepared for it with his determination of suicide.</p>

<p>The solitary session in the pine-clump had prepared him for the
fact that he would find no job in that countryside. Faint
investigations had absolutely confirmed that conviction.</p>

<p>He had imagined that, at the worst he could work in the field
for a peasant or drive a delivery van for one of the department
stores. He was not above earning his living in that way. He had
washed dishes and waited on tables at Dartmouth. He would be only
beginning all over again&mdash;like Mr. Lamoricière.</p>

<p><br>
The great stars at last existed for him. Over the motionless sea!
They wheeled, motionless. The last sound of the motor that he could
hope to hear died away. He went to the edge of the terrace. The sea
did not lap on the pebbles. Nothing existed but black
masses...black masses of the pine trees: of the distant islands.
Even the red light at the end of the little pier was hidden from
him by the limpid blackness of a pillar that supported the story
above the veranda. As it was mid-August the very frogs were silent.
And the nightingales. By August begettings and parturitions of all
birds, batrachians and insects are over for the year so none gave
voice. All such sounds are love-calls...</p>

<p>He imagined that it was like that when you are dead. You were
motionless in black space. There would of course be great stars.
Wherever it was perfectly black the light of the stars pierced the
blackness. From the bottom of a deep, dry well in Indiana he had
once seen the constellation of Cassiopeia though the sun was torrid
above between the well-head and the sky.</p>

<p>If it were no worse than that it would probably be quite as well
to be dead. Perhaps when you were dead you worried. He had figured
that Hell might really consist of endless mental worries...You
would be in blackness with great stars, worrying eternally. Or
perhaps you would only worry in proportion to your wickedness in
the flesh. You would earn oblivion by worrying.</p>

<p>You worried probably about what went on happening to your dear
ones on earth. He hadn't, however, any dear ones on earth. There
were Mrs. Percival and the dark girl in the café. He had given her
his mother's ring...He didn't care what happened to Mrs. Percival
if she did not belong to him. His feelings for her were physical.
Apparently her physical feelings went in another direction. He
didn't know.</p>

<p>It worried him that he did not know. Perhaps afterwards, he
would not be permitted to know...By the Recording Angel! What, if
Alice and Mrs. Percival were Lesbians, was Lesbianism? Possibly a
desire for a higher union...Perhaps his next-world torture would be
worrying because he did not know what Lesbianism was. That would be
grotesque...But why should you not be grotesque?</p>

<p>Who else were his dear ones?...There was positively no one. He
certainly wished no ill to his father but he could not imagine
anything happening to him that should make him, Henry Martin, worry
about him from the interstellar spaces where he drifted...</p>

<p>He was worried at the time about Hugh Monckton. The fellow,
standing beside his car had looked extraordinarily
lonely...Actually he was no lonelier than Henry Martin. But Henry
Martin had the idea that that fellow had wanted to communicate
something. And apparently Henry Martin had failed him.</p>

<p>He had taken it very hard that Henry Martin had not jumped at
what he called his tip about the A's. Almost his last words had
been:</p>

<p>'Of course, old bean, I was exaggerating when I said you could
make a couple of million. But you could make a tidy bit...And, damn
it, don't you understand what I was offering you?...'</p>

<p>He had immediately afterwards said that his old bus needed
tuning if she was to take the bullfinch in style and with a
mournful good-bye had dived under the machine on his back.</p>

<p>Exactly what the fellow's offer had been had not got through to
him. The whole interview came back&mdash;at any rate the later parts of
it&mdash;as if it had passed in dumb show. He had been overwhelmed by
the thought of the intrigue that must have been carried on against
him: that fellow had been mostly incomprehensible. Jack Percival
had been right to the extent of at least one Englishman. Hugh
Monckton had certainly communicated a good deal of his private
affairs...The trouble was, the English talked a language no one
could understand. What with the childish slang, the pronunciation,
and what they left out! You had to know their life story before you
could understand them...</p>

<p>That fellow had been like an agonized dog. Gazing into your eyes
and trying to communicate with every fibre of his
being...Apparently because they had both been in the same
regiment...</p>

<p>A cross between a large-eyed dog and a schoolboy. For it was a
schoolboy's idea that, if you had been in the same collection of
lousy fellows in mud-colour you formed tender associations that
lasted a lifetime or could be taken up again after twenty years. As
if you had been in the same school! Though even that was
schoolboyish enough...</p>

<p>All the same, the fellow had got through to him a sense of
mental agony and loneliness...And physical pain...He had had an
acute pain in his head...Like M. Lamoricière. That real estate
agent had hardly been able to see where he was going because of
brow ague...Perhaps Hugh Monckton hadn't really known what he was
saying.</p>

<p>On the whole Henry Martin no longer wished that he could
exchange identity with that fellow. He himself was calm, in no pain
and drifting through space. The mental bitterness at least of death
was past. He stood there amongst the immense stars that he felt to
encircle the earth. And he felt the earth drifting in the
blackness...</p>

<p>There must be a low mist because the stars did not shine down
the sea. A mist only a foot or so above the water. As you see it
above alligator tanks in zoological gardens. That meant that the
water was very warm. It meant that it would be about flesh-heat
when he stepped into it in an hour or so. That was satisfactory. A
gift of Providence. He remembered to have heard that if you wished
to drown kittens you should do it whilst they were still blind in
tepid water. They would then know no shock.</p>

<p>So Providence was being humane...to a blind kitten. It had
warmed up the bath...</p>

<p>It was odd how little part Providence played in his psychology.
He seemed to have lost his faith by a process of painless
extinction. He could not remember how long it was since he had
prayed, but he was certain that now he never did. Even at that
moment when, if there were supernatural governors, he had
absolutely no impulse to prayer.</p>

<p>'Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat per
eis. In memoriam aeternam erit justus: ab aestimatione non
timebit.'</p>

<p><br>
'Give them eternal rest, oh Lord, and let light perpetual be upon
them. The just man shall remain for ever in the memory: he shall
not fear the reckoning...</p>

<p><br>
He liked to quote the words&mdash;in the Latin&mdash;because of their sound
and the memories they half recalled. But he had no wish to utter
them for himself. Nor had he any that they should be uttered for
him in a day or two.</p>

<p>It was not that he disbelieved in the existence of a Deity. He
felt indeed extremely aware of a First Cause. But he believed that
the Deity was as indifferent to his existence as he himself was
indifferent to that awful Presence. He could not believe that God
cared enough about him even to punish him. Possibly some of the
less important female saints might care about him rather
indifferently but with pleasant manners of a stereotyped kind. As
the Sisters do when you go into hospitals...It astonished him to
find that he felt towards the supernatural economy much as he felt
towards the efficient police of a good republic. They had their
function, but they were nothing to him and he nothing to them.</p>

<p>He could not believe that an august First Cause would take
cognizance of his existence. It had more important tasks...What had
he done to make notice of him worth the while of the Deity? He had
been drunk once or twice. That was defacing God's image. But he had
never been drunk in Europe. That was the real test. At home you had
to drink from time to time. Or appear Pharisaic. Pharisaism was a
worse sin than an occasional jag. Beside it was a political
demonstration. He had never taken pleasure in drink.</p>

<p>He had committed adultery&mdash;or fornication, for he did not know
the difference. Three or four times. But so very dimly! He hardly
remembered the women or girls. They had been dull. Infinitely dull.
And they too had been social demonstrations. You had necked to show
independence. Almost more in order to aid the girls to assert their
freedom. And to shame Pharisaism...Adultery then became little more
than the exercise of a corporeal function. God had given you
corporeal functions to exercise. He had never taken pleasure in
adultery.</p>

<p>As far as he could remember he had broken none of the other
commandments. He had coveted no man's goods. He had wanted to be
someone else: but that was rather in the desire for salvation. He
had done no murder. He had not even fired a rifle in the late war.
On the contrary he had superintended a saw mill and a canning
outfit...in the effort to end war. He couldn't say that he had not
honoured his father and mother. He had at least loved his mother
and admired his father&mdash;even when father had most tried to coerce
him he had admired his spirit. Even now he took a sort of covert
pleasure in his father's cable. It made the joke all the better
that it was his death-blow. He imagined his father chuckling. That
exhibition of stubbornness was something he could admire...</p>

<p>He imagined besides that if Providence really took the trouble
to punish any man it would be Napoleon. Or the politicians and big
business men who had ruined the United States and so the world
might well burn in endless fire. No one had escaped the desolation
they had caused. It had sought out him, Henry Martin, on solitary
shores four thousand miles away. Remorselessly. But Providence had
to swing a million stars each populated by a million million
beings. It probably would view the ruin of three or four hundred
million human beings and their anxieties and distractions as a
giant the size of Mount Everest would view a child of four sticking
a branch into an ant heap, the size of a pudding-basin and
agitating the inhabitants.</p>

<p>It was more likely that Providence let remorseless effect work
out the punishment of individuals. Then he might well worry about
his future. He had danced capably and given only mediocre pleasure.
That was Sin. It was Sin, too, to have to say that, when he floated
between the outer stars, there would be no dear ones here on earth
for him to worry over. That was bad. Bad!</p>

<p>There was Sister Carrie. She had things to worry her. But he did
not know what the things were. She had become more and more the
European great lady, apart, cold, incomprehensible. She worried
perhaps because her husband was not received with sufficient honour
at the Court of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. Or maybe because he
had not received promotion in the Garada Nobile at the Vatican, or
because the Pope had not sent her a golden rose or a medal, or
because her husband had not received the hunt-button of the
Duchesse d'Uzes. Or because he was unfaithful. Or they had no
children. They had plenty of money.</p>

<p>But Carrie had chosen to become European. An American could
hardly sympathize with her troubles. On the last occasion he had
seen her she had been out of her mind with indignation. Some
Cardinal attending some function in her neighbourhood had chosen to
lunch at a neighbouring chateau. Not at hers. She had come to Paris
to avoid the slur's appearing too public. That was how Henry Martin
had seen her. Her husband, the Comte de Pralinghem, had made very
good use of the capital with which Sister Carrie's marriage
settlement had provided him. Her chateau though it dated from 1169
was as modern as most New York hotels. She had there every
imaginable kind of electric fixing, elevators and bathrooms. You
might as well have been in Minneapolis, at a Beer Lord's before
Prohibition. And she had innumerable servants. Her husband was a
very keen business man&mdash;for a feudal landowner. He owned admirable
quarries, sawmills, a ham factory. His estate in those distant
woodlands fairly buzzed. In spite of world depression.</p>

<p>So Henry Martin could not see himself worrying about his sister.
It might be that, having been granted supernatural insight into
psychology&mdash;which would mean infinite capacity for worrying&mdash;he
might appreciate what her tragedy was. And worry. At present her
funeral was too much her own affair...It might of course be
cancer...That was not so easy. Mental distress was more
comprehensible.</p>

<p>It was difficult to sympathize with physical pain. Hugh Monckton
had been suffering. So had Lamoricière. His black-bearded, pale
face had been drawn with it once or twice. No doubt some of Hugh
Monckton's more incomprehensible ejaculations and failures to
finish sentences had been caused by pains in his forehead. You
could not have a whack like that from a cavalry sabre and not feel
after-effects. But it was only now that he realized it. It began to
seem to him atrocious that he had been so indifferent.</p>

<p>All the same he was almost more worried about the dark
girl...That too came over him like a wave. Almost a pain in itself.
She had been in prison. How was it possible to put a girl like that
in prison? It was a sin. As if you kept a brilliant flowering plant
in a cellar. The flowers and leaves would grow pallid. Etiolation
it was called...</p>

<p>He wished he had had a long conversation with that girl&mdash;one of
those conversations that last for days and weeks. He might have
restored her faith in life. And have developed his own personality.
She had a high, flaunting colour on her cheeks. And defiantly
marked eyebrows. Artificial but precise, like black and white
drawing. If he could have lived at her side it might have made a
man of him. He seemed to hear her hard, clear thoughts. Stimulating
him. Like a bitter aperitif!</p>

<p>It was considered to be a sin not to use your talents...How did
he stand under that heading? He presumably had talents. He had done
nothing with them...If he had been able to live with Wanda he might
have made some mark with his art. Or if he had had physical contact
with Mrs. Percival. He <i>had</i> lived beside her and the sexual
irritation had made him do the only work he had ever
accomplished...His unfortunate book!</p>

<p>After all, he had written a book and it had been published. But
it had been so snowed under by the illustrations and the way the
disgusting publisher had put it out that it never occurred to his
mind. Not even when he was summing up his life. That proved that it
had been the product of sexual irritation caused by the proximity
of Mrs. Percival. Whilst that proximity had continued, the book had
seemed alive. The moment he left her it had simply faded. Like
something on the stage when the spotlight goes off it...He had
never thought of that.</p>

<p>His feeling for Mrs. Percival had been purely physical: as far
as he knew his feelings for the dark girl had been quite
intellectual or sympathetic. That was queer, for the one moved as
it were in the grey light of cloisters and the other was like a
black panther in sunlight...</p>

<p>He knew he had begun to think of his book and the physical
seductions of Mrs. Percival at the same moment. That moment had
been whilst Jack Percival had been calling him a moron outside the
café. In quite fiery resentment he had said to himself as if he
were answering that fellow: 'Ah, you think yourself damn fine
because you've written some lousy books in slang. You wait! I'll
yet do something that will prove to your wife that I'm as good as
you!' And immediately he had been aware for the first time, of how
desirable it would be to mingle his limbs with those of the silent
woman on the other side of the tin table top.</p>

<p>His book had been addressed to her. It had consisted of a long
argument with her on the subject of gossip. It had been a book
about gossip.</p>

<p>They lived amongst crowds of Americans in Paris. And all these
people gossiped unceasingly. They seemed to have no other
vocations...And Mrs. Percival shuddered at all that...It was almost
the only thing about her mentality that came back to him. She was
normally exceedingly silent. He knew that she liked green and dark
blues for her clothing and the music of Debussy and the pictures of
Toulouse Lautrec. Advanced but sober works of Art! Otherwise,
except that she was deliberate, he knew nothing about her...But
indeed she had rendered their household rather silent. She so
disliked gossip that she left practically nothing for him and Alice
to talk about at meals. It was no doubt because she thought she had
been a great deal gossiped about and had suffered...Or perhaps she
shuddered at the idea that when her relationship with Alice became
manifest there would be a good deal of spiteful comment. There had
really been very little talk about her either in Springfield or in
Paris.</p>

<p>So he had written his book. It had been astonishing how easily
it had come to him. It had arranged itself: a part on gossip in the
Classics from Theophrastus to Lucian; a part on gossip in the
Middle Ages from Robert of Gloucester to Montaigne; a bewigged part
ending with Madame de Sévigné, Horace Walpole and various
biographers of George Washington: a final modern part which took in
the Yellow Press and the <i>potins</i> of Montparnasse. When he
thought how easily it had gone he was astonished that he had not
continued as a 'writer'. Even the Introduction and the Exordium had
come easily. In them he had really countered the objections of Mrs.
Percival to gossip. He had done it quite consciously, holding one
or two arguments with her. He had put down her objections fairly
and had contented himself with pointing out that without gossip
there would be no knowing anything about the lives people lived. A
good deal of gossip was malicious, but most listeners discounted
automatically what they had heard. So you got something like the
truth.</p>

<p>He had written his closing pages with some feeling. He was
already thinking about a novel and realized that he would find it
very difficult simply because he did not know enough of how people
lived. Then almost simultaneously Mrs. Percival had turned him
down; he had left Alice in preparation for the divorce. And the
storm about his book had burst upon him.</p>

<p>The storm had been mostly the work of the agile and lewd
publisher. Henry Martin had had no idea of writing salaciously. The
publisher and the illustrator together had made him appear a sort
of Casanova. The publisher had found the title <span class=
"smcap">be thou chaste</span>, the motto on the title page being:
'Be thou chaste as snow and cold as ice, thou shalt not escape
calumny,' misquoting Othello. The illustrator had decorated the
pages with vignettes of revolting lewdness. Mostly they represented
nude revels in Montmartre and Montparnasse studios. In addition,
the publisher had provided cheap reproductions of the eighteenth
century prints of bedroom scenes that you buy for a <i>sou</i> or
two at the open-air bookstalls along the Seine quays in Paris. So
Henry Martin had found himself a purveyor of pornography.</p>

<p>It might or might not make it better in the general storm the
volume aroused, that Henry Martin never received a penny for the
book. The publisher had promised him a couple of hundred dollars on
publication. This had never even been paid. A month or so after
publication, Henry Martin had written to the fellow asking him for
the money. He had received no answer. He had not even had a copy of
the book. He wrote again more pressingly. Then he had threatened to
put a lawyer to work. By that time he had seen a copy of the book
in a shop window in the rue de Rivoli. It was surrounded with a
band bearing in scarlet letters the inscription: 'What goes on in
Paris studios.' The full invidiousness of the publisher had burst
upon him...The illustrations! The title! He had all but been sick
under the arcades of the rue de Rivoli in the Paris sunshine.</p>

<p>He had communicated his emotions in the letter to the publisher
that demanded payment of the sum due on publication. The
publisher's jocular answer had expressed grief at the idea of an
author's taking so commercial a view of his art as to demand
payment. He also professed amazement at the idea that Henry Martin
should desire to make money out of the book. On his own confession
it was a pornographic work. The book was by now in the windows of a
great many Paris booksellers. Every time that Henry Martin caught
sight of it it was as if he had been kicked in the stomach. His
café acquaintances had begun to feign not to see him when he came
into those establishments.</p>

<p>A man called Grimaud had attacked him very violently one night.
He was a New Yorker of French extraction, a painter with a studio
in Montmartre. He accused Henry Martin of having revealed the
intimate secrets of his life...And in addition the secrets of the
lives of twenty...thirty...sixty Paris American expatriates. The
illustrator of the book had apparently made recognizable portraits
of actual American artists and their wives. In depictions of nude
debaucheries and recognizably in their own studios...The fellow
with copper hair and a mouth as large as a coal scuttle had been
held by two waiters whilst he gesticulated in front of Henry
Martin's table.</p>

<p>Paris-America had however seemed to calm itself. Henry Martin
had got himself invited to the weekly lunch of the Anglo-American
Journalists' Association&mdash;by a man called Pritel whom he had known
as a friend of Mr. Kuhn, a correspondent of a Detroit paper.
Pritel, who was an amiable fellow, had introduced him to a number
of the correspondents and reporters. Henry Martin had explained
with care and moderation that the letterpress of his book was in no
way either salacious or personal. He did not even know the
illustrator.</p>

<p>One or two men there had confirmed what he said. They had looked
at the book and had found it rather dull.</p>

<p>They had been pretty decent about it. Notes depicting Henry
Martin's distress had appeared in one or two English-Parisian
papers, one or two London ones and in some Paris letters of papers
at home. Three times strangers in cafes had come up to him and
commiserated with him as to the misunderstanding. He had been asked
to an extremely dull party at a woman's club across the water. It
had been distressing to him because the only people he had known
there had been Alice, Mrs. Percival and a man called Josephson from
Cincinnati who appeared to be squiring them. They had acknowledged
each other's existence in the coldest possible way. He had been
tempted to leave. But he had gone on for an hour listening to a
lady with blue-white hair and a bronze-powdered face. She carried
lorgnettes and came from Terre Haute. She was writing a book on
period furniture...Mostly as to its effects on morals. It was
self-evident, she said, that the curves with which you surrounded
yourself and the angle at which you sat or reposed must have an
influence on your character. If you sat in a wheel-back Windsor
kitchen-chair you would incline to a New England conscience. If you
reclined, like Madame Recamier, on a day bed you would lean towards
lasciviousness&mdash;like all the French. Henry Martin had inclined to
believe that there might be something in it.</p>

<p>He had by that time of course separated from Alice and from Mrs.
Percival. And he was leading a sufficiently lonely life in a small
room in the rue Jacob. He went out for most of his meals. Sometimes
he found an acquaintance to talk to him. As often as not he did
not. He imagined that some people still avoided him&mdash;but he might
have been mistaken. A determined maiden lady called Cameron from
Dorchester, Mass., upbraided him with having treated Alice badly.
She was now attending lectures on law at the Sorbonne but, as a
young girl, she had known his mother. Henry Martin had been able to
persuade her that it was Alice rather than he who wanted the
divorce. After that he sat, most evenings, at the table of Miss
Cameron in a cafe! She had a rather nodceable moustache and
occasionally she drank far too many <i>petits verres</i>. Then she
became voluble and hoarse-voiced about the wrongs of women. Her
usual attendants were a New England Presbyterian minister who, at
sixty, had abandoned the ministry and was attending life-classes,
an English Colonel who was doing the same, and two very
bespectacled young girls who were working at the Bibliothèque
Nationale. They sat huddled together for hours in a corner of a
rather noisy café...</p>

<p>Paris apparently had forgiven him for <span class="smcap">be
thou chaste</span>. Springfield had not. By that time Henry Martin
was nearing the end of his tether, financially. He had little more
than a thousand dollars left. The rest of his money had either gone
into housekeeping or into the hands of Alice. For years she had
insisted on his making her a large allowance for housekeeping and
dress. She had not spent nearly as much and had regularly banked
the remainder. She had no doubt timed the divorce to come fairly
exactly when his pockets should be nearly empty. He felt no
resentment. During the divorce proceedings he had had to go through
the formality of an attempt at reconciliation. He had been shut up
alone with Alice in a bare anteroom of the Court. Alice had
reminded him that he still owed a gas bill that had come in after
his departure. The bill had seemed exorbitant but she had brought
it with her and there had been no disputing it. She said that she
was looking for more economical gas fittings in the kitchen. He had
said that, if you could get the electricity people to install a
certain type of fixing and a certain meter, electricity was nearly
as cheap as gas and much cleaner. At any rate he had heard so. From
a pastry cook from whom he brought his <i>croissants</i>...</p>

<p>To the judge who had asked him why he would not return to his
wife he had answered succinctly:</p>

<p>'J'aime une autre femme...'</p>

<p>The judge had burst out:</p>

<p>'Ah mais ça...mais ça...C'est un peu trop fort...' When one has
a charming, amiable and gifted lady for one's spouse one does not
say one loves another!</p>

<p>Henry Martin had maintained an obstinate silence. The thing had
gone through without further words...</p>

<p>But he had begun to be pinched for money very soon afterwards.
He had intended, during the months of separation, to write another
book. A novel. But the annoyance connected with <span class=
"smcap">be thou chaste</span> had too much distracted his thoughts.
And the fact that he was approaching pennilessness paralyzed him.
He presumed that showed he was not an author. Real authors are said
to write away more furiously the poorer they are. But he, with all
the strength gone out of him, had sat watching Anacondas until they
passed their dividend. Then he knew that he was finished.</p>

<p>He had made one effort. He had written to his father asking him
to put his lawyers on the publisher. Sangster, a sanguine Paris
author, had computed that the publisher must owe Henry Martin five
thousand dollars. Louis Trench, also an author living in Paris, but
a pessimist, put the probable sum at seven hundred. The actual
amount was somewhere, no doubt, between the two. On the lowest sum
he would have been able to live for a year. Five thousand would
have kept him going for two or three. Because of course with more
money in hand he would have lived more largely. Probably with a
French mistress.</p>

<p>His father's answer had been curious. Henry Martin had written
that he was reduced nearly to pennilessness.</p>

<p>That, father had answered, was only to be expected. It was
unfortunate too that he could not at this juncture be invited to
take up again his position of drummer for Pisto-Brittle. Henry
Martin could hardly expect to come back to Springfield for a year
or two. Unless his hide was tougher than father believed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">be thou chaste</span> had done that.
According to father the book had been reported as a best seller in
twenty-seven principal cities of the United States. Springfield,
Ohio, considered that that meant that it was being held up to
ridicule in twenty-seven of the fortyeight States of the Union. Its
most intimate, scandalous and painful affairs were being laid bare
to the inhabitants of that vast expanse of territory. The most
prominent citizens of Springfield were the most enraged. Public
action had been threatened against Henry Martin if he dared to show
himself in that city.</p>

<p>It had indeed, the old man said, been taken against himself.
Henry Martin seemed to hear him chuckling as he wrote that the Ku
Klux Klan had waited upon him. They had told him that if he did not
dismiss all his Roman Catholic foremen they would prohibit the sale
of Pisto-Brittle in all the villages within a hundred miles of
Springfield. The old man had insisted on employing always former
inhabitants of Luxemburg as foremen over the boilers in his works.
He considered that job as peculiarly suited to the Luxemburgish,
phlegmatic temperament. He had several times received from the Klan
missives informing him that they objected to this policy of his.
Each time he had replied by dismissing a worker whom he suspected
of belonging to the Klan and replacing him by an Irish Roman
Catholic. So, for a long time, the Klan had left him alone.</p>

<p>Now, he guessed, Henry Martin's outrage on the city had
emboldened them to more open threats. They probably imagined
themselves assured of prominent supporters. Prominent women who
thought that their avarices, evil speaking or adulteries had been
revealed in <span class="smcap">be thou chaste</span> had
half-publicly incited the Klan to direct action.</p>

<p>'I don't suppose,' father had written, 'that Springfield, Ohio,
is any less chaste than any other American city. But they seem here
to have taken the exhortation of your title as being addressed
directly to them...and probably as being needed by them. Mrs.
Prendergast in particular says that your story of the meanness of
her ordering when the Schultz's were coming to stop over for a
week-end can only have been told you by Sylvia Groen. So she has
let out a lot of unsavoury hot air about the behaviour of Sylvia
and the Younger Married Set.'</p>

<p>He added a little later:</p>

<p>'Suppose the K.K.K. to be degenerate descendants of earlier
He-Men. Told them: "Very well gentlemen. Am aged over the
Psalmist's limit and perfectly prepared to shut down Pisto-Brittle
works should city desire it. Might or might not re-open in New York
State. Or Luxemburg. Or England. But imagine such very considerable
addition to already terrible hunger-lines of unemployed in city
might render the corporation disliked. Stated should take that step
if evidence should be forthcoming that sale of one packet of P. B.
had been hindered by their activities".'</p>

<p>He said that he had concluded by telling those fellows that his
will gave instructions for closing down the works, no member of his
family desiring to continue in the industry. His aged body was at
their disposal but he still took leave to imagine that his
clandestine removal would not be applauded.</p>

<p>He concluded that part of the letter:</p>

<p>'Do not have to tell you that sale of P. B. has not been
interfered with. Nevertheless P...the T occasionally crept
in...'should not advise your return here in search of a job. You
remember how intensely you felt your unpopularity when you were
suspected of murdering so-called Huns. And recollect that as you
have chosen to jettison your wife she will not be here to make your
peace with local Hun-ocracy.'</p>

<p>That was true enough. When Henry Martin and one or two others
had returned from the occupation of the Rhine they had found
themselves completely cold shouldered. The local German population
had boldly called them murderers and what few people there had been
of English or allied descent in the town had already had cold feet
about the War. Those ex-heroes had had to avoid even being seen
talking to each other for a long time. He remembered that he and a
young red-headed dough-boy had wanted to tell each other how queer
that all was...Not to exchange reminiscences of sawmills in the
Cevennes and fighting in the Argonne but merely to discuss their
present situation!...They were obliged to make a date in a wood ten
miles from the city. The red-headed boy's name had been Adams or
Quincy or Lowell. Or possibly all three united. In spite of that he
had been forced, to leave the city.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had had the mortifying experience of being
protected by his wile's mother. That blaring, Teutonic housewife
had proclaimed everywhere that Henry Martin had taken care to be an
<i>embusqué</i> as the French called it. He had joined the A.E.F.
as a gesture...As the majority of the German-born of Springfield
had done when they were not over age. Most of the sergeants,
top-sergeants and a good proportion of the officers of the local
units had in early life served in the German army. But they had all
done their damnedest&mdash;and then some!&mdash;not to be sent into the
fighting line. Some of them had even deserted, their absences being
covered by sympathizers in the ranks. Henry Martin, the vigorous
lady had proclaimed, was then precisely on a level with those of
true German origin...</p>

<p>So doors had begun to open amongst the houses of the All-High in
the city. At first only Alice had been asked. But gradually Henry
Martin had begun to receive invitations. And then the non-German
population, seeing that he was received by the principal German
citizens, had begun to invite him too.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had borne the ostracism very badly. He would have
liked to think that he disliked even more the manner in which the
closed doors had been opened to him. That had not been so. He would
have liked to think that he was of the heroic mould. But he had
accepted admission to Society with relief even at the cost of being
proclaimed practically a traitor to his country. He needed, in
fact, human contact if life was to be tolerable to him. He had no
great friends in Springfield; but then he had never had great
friends anywhere.</p>

<p>Now he recognized that his home was closed to him. It was
ridiculous that Springfield should believe that his book was
written against its inhabitants. He had never once given that city
a thought during all the time that he had been writing the thing.
The formidable Mrs. Prendergast had gone shopping with Sylvia Groen
one day when she was expecting the Schultz's and lobsters had been
dear. So a two thousand five hundred year old scarcity of that
crustacean in the market of Athens under Pericles had risen up and
contributed to Henry Martin's end.</p>

<p>Real writers that he had met in Paris told him that they also
had been plagued by members of the general public. Almost anyone
would manage to recognize him or herself in almost any character in
any book that was at all life-like. It was an absurdity one had to
put up with. A novelist called Pink had told him that he had
actually been sued by a lady called Christine Pfeil from near Terre
Haute, Indiana. Pink had called a dissolute Swedish chambermaid in
one of his books 'Christine Pfahl.' And apparently Mrs. Pfeil had
the habit of visiting male guests in their bedrooms after the rest
of the house retired. It had cost Pink a pretty penny.</p>

<p>So he might accept Springfield's dislike of himself as a tribute
to the life-like nature of his book. It was contributing none the
less to his end. His contacts with his father had been always one
long struggle between differingly desperate types of obstinacy. It
was no doubt nothing but pride that made father insist upon his
returning to Pisto-Brittle&mdash;and by now nothing but pride made him
refuse. He was no writer by vocation: that seemed certain. And he
could not even make a living by his brains. Father had put his
lawyer on the publisher of <span class="smcap">be thou
chaste</span>...According to his books the publisher owed Henry
Martin sixteen hundred dollars. But that, the lawyer said, meant
nothing. He could doctor his books how he liked and, since he owed
a great deal to his printers and binders, those people would give
him any kind of vouchers he wanted. It made no difference for the
fellow flatly refused to pay Henry Martin a nickel. He said that he
had had two tremendous successes the year before and those two best
sellers had practically ruined him. He had to pay printers,
binders, and publicity and other overhead charges on the nail; the
booksellers would take anything from nine months to two years
before they paid for the copies he sold them. So there was no
chance of Henry Martin's touching any money for a long time, if
ever.</p>

<p>Father said that Henry Martin could of course bankrupt the
fellow. But if he did so he would make himself very unpopular and
could not expect to get more than two cents on the dollar. And that
in two years' time, considering the congestion in New York
Courts...And that action would be approved by nobody. The whole New
York book trade was, like everything else, in a completely rotten
condition. Everybody&mdash;publishers, bankers, binders&mdash;was bolstering
everybody else up. In the hope of one day realizing something. The
bankrupting of any one of them might bring the whole caboodle to
the ground. In that case none of Henry Martin's fellow-authors
would get anything. By Henry Martin's action. The old man imagined
that Henry Martin had already had a sufficient bellyful of
unpopularity.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-1" id="ch3-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>He could not be certain whether the motor was running quite
smoothly. Usually its sound was an agrfeeable murmur. But perhaps,
just as colours will not have full brightness if you are
financially worried so the sound of engines will not be altogether
soothing if you have been up all night.</p>

<p>Dawn had come very suddenly. It is the misfortune of certain
landscapes of great beauty that human arts have banalized their
most wonderful or unusual effects. On the stage when an actor
lights a candle the whole large stage will be flooded as if with
sunlight. It was so with this dawn of the fifteenth of August,
nineteen hundred and thirty-one.</p>

<p>You cannot spoil dark night and immense, wheeling stars by any
parody. In such a place when the air is just flesh-heat you are
conscious only of being at one with immensity. You are no separate
being and even to you your weightiest preoccupations are without
importance. You say: 'If I had acted then in another way my
situation would now be less unfortunate...' But your regrets have
little poignancy.</p>

<p>But that dawn flickered suddenly into existence. The islands
were illuminated. A white sail showed on the horizon. Sea birds
called. The sea itself, as if awakening, threw a single,
long-resounding wave along the miles of shingle. The stage was
suddenly set. You could no longer commune with infinity. These were
the great boards on which to enact tragedy.</p>

<p>A grotesque&mdash;an almost abhorrent&mdash;message from Destiny opened
the ball. An immense, skeleton-grey bird was flying slumberously
along the edge of the sea. At little more than the height of a man.
With dawn its labours were no doubt ended and it was going to rest
on some solitary crag. With the slow beating of its vast spread of
wings it had all by itself the air of a portent.</p>

<p>It was sleepily almost upon him...six feet away. It screamed
with rage and fear. Its immense wings beat the air in untidy panic:
it towered. Straight up. Towering and screaming it let fall a small
fish. The fish struck smartly on Henry Martin's left shoulder...An
omen!</p>

<p>If a raven in those regions dropped excrement on the left
shoulder of a Roman it was the best omen of all. He did not know
what that bird was...A stork, possibly. A pelican? A flamingo?...A
fish dropped by a stork might be of better omen than excrement from
a raven. The fish was silver...a fortune must be coming to him...It
was a grim and atrocious pleasantry on the part of Destiny. It
struck him as something indecent. Destiny had driven him to death.
His end was tragedy, not mere death. A hundred slowly converging
things were forcing him over the edge of the boat. Not mere despair
because you had lost a woman. Or a million dollars.</p>

<p>He had been doomed in his mother's womb. It had been decreed
that the seed of a wild boar of the Ardennes meeting the lymphatic
stock of over-old New England should beget one who danced without
giving pleasure. That was reasonable...As it were within the rights
of Destiny. Destiny had the prerogative of dooming you within the
womb.</p>

<p>But to conduct you within a foot or two of death and then,
grinningly to throw a fish at you. That was execrable. In execrable
taste...</p>

<p>He ran suddenly into the gloomy cavern of the inndoor. He
clumped up the dark, carpetless stairs...On the staircase at least
he had recovered the night. Shadows.</p>

<p>It had struck him when the dawn had fallen suddenly on him that
he had taken his call too soon.</p>

<p>He ought to have descended two hours later into a brilliantly
illuminated stage. He would have received the plaudits of the
islands, the innumerable smiling wavelets, the pine trees, the
pebbles. Of the sirens too, perhaps! He would then have been the
hero of tragedy, stepping gallantly to his doom. Then he would have
danced. And all that applause would have shown that he had given
pleasure.</p>

<p>As it was, the curtain&mdash;the dawn&mdash;had gone up too soon. He had
been without make-up&mdash;cothurnus, parsley fillet, pine cone sceptre.
And Destiny, in the audience had chucked fish at him!...</p>

<p>He had actually been prepared enough and might then have taken
his call...</p>

<p>In his bare room his papers were all burnt, his grips packed.
His drawers all stood open as witness of the fact that, the night
before, he had taken the proper precautions to leave nothing.</p>

<p>There hung nevertheless on the wall a little card calendar. It
had been given to him last year in return for his <i>étrennes</i>
to the postman...his five-franc tip. It had a pink and grey picture
representing children feeding pigeons beside the Medici fountain.
In the Luxemburg Gardens...</p>

<p>The incredible thing!...It was incredible!...</p>

<p>He had mistaken the date!</p>

<p>It was to-day, Sunday, August 16th...He had taken it to be the
15th...the feast of the Assumption...It stood there on the
Calendar.</p>

<p>15 S. ASSOMP<br>
16 D. St. Roch</p>

<p>The Assumption in good fat capitals. St. Roch in tiny type.</p>

<p>It was disillusionment. He had imagined himself going up to
heaven in a festival of glory. The Assumption was regarded as the
most important feast of the French year. Gipsies from all over the
world came to celebrate it to the Stes. Maries, a few miles
away...Gipsies, cardinals, <i>vaqueros</i>...The tenders of the
wild bulls of the Carmargue. They swam their wild bulls across the
Rhone and back and were blessed by the Cardinals...The bulls for
the bull fights...For the <i>Salta della Muerta</i>...The dance of
death...They placed, those bull fighters, their feet on the horns
of the charging bulls and sprang right over
them...<i>Salta</i>...the spring...<i>Saltaverunt</i>...They sprang
amidst wild applause. If they didn't die they were lucky. If they
did they got more applause...</p>

<p>He had taken pleasure at the thought that, whilst he drifted
over the waving fronds at the bottom of the Mediterranean, those
excitements would be taking place over the blazing pebbles of the
Carmargue. Almost within sight.</p>

<p>But S. Roch...who was Saint Roch!...He was represented as
fainting, with a dog licking his hand, a great loaf and a bamboo
cross. There was a statue of him in the church of his name in the
rue St. Honore at Paris. As far as Henry Martin could remember he
was a local saint...Local to Marseilles and these parts. He must
have been born in Montpellier...Yes, there had been a pestilence
and M. Roch had gone about curing the sufferers and probably
feeding them from the great loaf. He had been himself succumbing to
the plague. But the dog had rescued him.</p>

<p>How could a dog rescue you from the plague?...</p>

<p>Was that the sort of story you wanted to have attending on your
extinction?...It was another grin of Destiny.</p>

<p>On the other hand...perhaps if a local saint had been appointed
for the day of his death his soul might expect to receive more
immediate
attention...<i>Anima</i>...<i>vagula</i>...<i>blandula</i>...Little,
pale, wandering, new wet soul. It might be glad of a dog and a big
loaf...A more homelike reception than to have all the Archangels
and the morning stars singing in glory.</p>

<p>He pulled down the sheets and laid himself fulldressed on his
bed. He didn't know why he wanted to stage his end in that way. But
he certainly desired to leave the impression that he had spent his
last night in bed.</p>

<p><br>
Why should he desire to leave impressions? It was nevertheless a
strong urge and no doubt there is something vital in all strong
urges. Something going to the root of life. An intimation perhaps
of immortality.</p>

<p>If hell consisted of floating between the tides of the winds and
worrying, one might as well worry about what happened to one's
reputation as about anything else. It might be agreeable to hear
them say: 'He was hard boiled. He slept in his bed before the rash
act&mdash;as if nothing had happened.'...Or rather it might be extremely
disagreeable if they said he had been in such a stew that he
<i>hadn't</i> slept.</p>

<p>That was no doubt it. He had examined the bill-fold twice
already and he felt that he was about to do it again. That was
because he extremely disliked the idea of having his body searched
by whoever found him. That wallet contained&mdash;A: his passport and
identity card. B: a letter to Alice. C: a cable to his father. D: a
hundred franc note. E: a letter to whoever found him. He begged
them to send the cable to father&mdash;a night letter costing
thirty-five francs; to mail the letter to Alice; to believe that
there was nothing else in any of his other pockets and to retain
the remaining sixty-five francs for any incidental expenses they
might be put to. He said, too, that his heir and next male
representative was his father and that he had nothing against
anybody. The Crisis alone was responsible for his taking his own
life.</p>

<p>He could think of nothing else to add to that collection of
exhibits. He had done everything he could invent to keep his body
from being handled. He had even tried to invent some way of leaving
his wallet attached to his hand so that they might not even need to
visit his pockets. If he had been going to shoot himself that would
have been simple. If you died by a shot in the brain your hand
closed irrevocably on whatever it held. He imagined himself lying
on the ground&mdash;on the pine needles under an umbrella pine. Then the
first thing that met the eye would be the oiled silk wrapping of
the wallet...Or no, it would be the wallet itself. If he had not
been going to die in the water there would have been no need for
the wrapper.</p>

<p>Some people had all the luck&mdash;the people who shot themselves.
They could lie with their proof of identity in their hand...</p>

<p>He lay with a nearly vacant mind till a ray of sunlight touched
the extended fingers of a branch of the stone pine that grew at the
house-end. He had long since hocked his watch. And it was odd how
litde he needed it. He had, of course, gone native: he had pretty
well acquired the ability to tell the time by the sun. A year ago
he would have laughed at you if you had told him he would one day
live watchless. The watch was the badge of American manhood...Free,
male and twenty-one: complete with timepiece...Incomplete without.
How could you make dates? You could not be American and not make
them.</p>

<p>Four days ago he had verified by the <i>salle à manger</i> clock
that the sun just touched the branch at five-fiftytwo. Giving the
sun two minutes a day of delay, this morning it would touch it at
six.</p>

<p>When the dark needles grew suddenly golden he started. He could
not remember what he had been thinking of. He must have dozed off.
That gave him pleasure. He had actually slept. Then he would not be
obtaining applause by false pretences. He was indeed hard-boiled.
Before the rash act he had really slept in his bed!</p>

<p>He took his call from the end of the little pier at sixfifteen.
It had taken him a quarter of an hour, accompanied by old Marius
Vial, to walk there from the bed in which he had slept. He had a
sense that the mountains and islands 'Ho-ho'd,' the innumerable
wavelets clapped, the umbrella and stone pines waved
commendations.</p>

<p>Somewhere the sirens smiled. Heartlessly! He remembered a
picture he had once seen, of a smiling siren plunging down, beneath
the sea. A classical-featured youth was tight bound in her arms. As
if there had been a hundred ropes twining round his limbs.
Iridescent bubbles shot up through the air. Her smile was gleeful
but aloof. As if she were thinking of something else...If you were
carrying down to your grotto a stalwart youth whose blood you were
going to suck it would be more polite to think of him...</p>

<p>So there he stood amongst all that applause!</p>

<p>On the terrace of the inn the silver fish that the bird had
dropped had still lain on the gravel...Desdny could hardly have
been pelting him off the stage with it. He had acted as became a
hero of tragedy. He had slept with refreshment and come there for
all to see. Spectators, mad with enthusiasm, throw to a great
torero in the arena fans, cigarettes, hats, jewels...whatever they
have to hand. So Destiny had thrown the silver fish. Silver you
observe!</p>

<p>The sheaf of thousand pound notes that Hugh Monckton had thrown
to him the night before had for some reason or another seemed to
represent great quantities of silver. Perhaps because they were
silvery white. So Destiny might have been trying, with silver, to
persuade him not to commit...the rash act. Destiny might very well
think him the hell of a fine fellow.</p>

<p>Well, wasn't he? There he stood on high amongst the applause of
a world. Nothing Destiny might have done had been able to deter
him. He had marched there to his end, Nordic hero. Taking his
call.</p>

<p>He was not wrong in calling it that. An author took his call
when the curtain came down at the end of his play. And the curtain
had come down on the end of his tragedy. Of that he was both hero
and author.</p>

<p>He bowed to the right; to his left; before him. As if he had
been an Oriental saluting the sun. His mind was full of sardonic
gaiety. He remembered to have read somewhere that trapeze
performers felt hatred for a public that applauded their living in
mortal danger. So he hated that heartless, smiling landscape. When
he had finished bowing he ran down the steps to his boat.</p>

<p>His left foot was poised above it, his right was still on the
granite of the quay when he thought: 'This is my last contact with
dry land.'</p>

<p>He imagined that his soul had shrunk within him to the
dimensions of a shrivelled walnut. A walnut in a cavern. That was
his soul. It was already dissociated from his body.</p>

<p>Marius Vial appeared to be speaking. Henry Martin did not hear
what he said. The boat floated free. He went forward and pulled
back the starting lever. Marius Vial had already set the engine
running. Henry Martin turned the wheel on its joy-stick. He
considered that a minute ago he had been mad. You do not bow to
mountains, islands and waves. It is not done.</p>

<p>He had secretly wondered for a long time how fear would take
him.</p>

<p>It had made his throat horribly dry. At this moment, too, he
noticed that the engine was not running smoothly.</p>

<p>It annoyed his head. It was as if a mourner had behaved
indecorously at his funeral. He had been used to take pleasure in
the deep tones of his motor.</p>

<p>It was perhaps no more than the hangover after a sleepless
night...But it had not been sleepless.</p>

<p>He had had five very small drinks of that amazing <i>fine</i>
the night before. Minute drinks because it had been so precious. It
would be treason to that sanctified liquor to think that it had
given him a hangover.</p>

<p>Then this was fear!</p>

<p>The boat had rounded the rocky bluff and opened out the great
bay. The 'port exterior 'as they called it. He thought that in
English they called it 'roads.' 'The English fleet lay in Toulon
Roads.' The level sea spread before him, between the headland and
the mainland. The headland was a peninsula parallel with the
mainland. Those words brought back to him moods of his young
boyhood. 'Mainland.' 'Headland.' 'Roads.' 'Bluff.'</p>

<p>Well, his bluff had been called all right.</p>

<p class="poem">'Oh, little did my mother think the day she cradled
me<br>
Of the lands that I should travel in and the death that I should
dee!'</p>

<p>His mother had been proud of the fact that he had never been
rocked in a cradle. His first crib had stood in the sun-parlour. It
gave on to the garden that was behind the drug-store. It had the
model of a caravel, time of Columbus, that mother had brought from
Fall River after Grandfather Smith's death. But before his&mdash;Henry
Martin's birth. He supposed Grandfather Smith had had some movable
property in Fall River at his death. Mother must have gone over
there to collect it.</p>

<p>She had had the proud idea that rocking babies injured their
brains. He could still hear the inflection of her voice as she told
other mothers that Henry Martin had <i>never</i> been rocked...That
was the baby-raising craze those years...</p>

<p>Perhaps that was why he and the boys born about then were now
the Lost Generation. They probably needed rocking to form their
characters. Well, Providence was about to make up for it. He was
going to be...What was the old song?</p>

<p>'Rocked in the cradle of the deep!'</p>

<p>His throat was deplorably dry, the missing beat of the engine
exasperated his brain. He might go ashore in the little cove called
St. Mejean where there was an <i>estaminet</i>: he might stop the
engine and try sailing. There was a bright little breeze from
behind.</p>

<p>If he went ashore it would look as if he were faltering in his
purpose: if he took to sailing he would appear to be playing for
delay. Besides he had not a penny in the world beside the hundred
franc note in his bill-fold...Hugh Monckton had not in the end
returned the three hundred and ninety-four francs...was it three
hundred and ninety-four? He could not remember. The momentary
recollection of last night gave him pleasure. It reminded him of
the dark girl. He wondered if she was wearing his ring or had
hocked it. He would never know.</p>

<p>There were five bright sails in the bay before him. Pleasure
craft. It was Sunday. There would be hundreds of them before the
day was done. There was a very full-membered sailing boat club at a
little place called Mourillon that had a seventeenth-century castle
and a tiny harbour behind a mole. The little space of water was as
thick with them as if they had been sardines in a tin. Before noon
they would be all out and the bay would be as gay as Miami in a
record season.</p>

<p>He was glad of it. It pleased him to think of going out of the
world in a sort of watery Coney Island. Besides he might be seen to
go overboard...Then they would be fairly certain to look out for
his body. It was his body he was anxious about.</p>

<p>Dreadful fear beset him at the thought of his last minute. He
imagined that you struggled, suffocated. At last you breathed. What
happened then? When the water entered your lungs? Apparently you
died then. You became for the rest of the world no longer 'he' but
'it.' But what exactly happened to you? A desperate running
together of thoughts. Panic? Regret? Your lungs no longer supplied
your heart with air and the want of aeration of your blood
stupefied your brain...So you died poisoned...He had wanted to
avoid dying poisoned. Poison distorted your face and caused pain
like flame. Similarly he disliked the idea of cutting his throat.
It would make you repulsive. So would death by shooting. Besides he
had hocked his gun long ago.</p>

<p>He would not have been averse to putting his head inside a gas
oven and turning on the gas. But he disliked the idea of dying in a
room. He wanted to see a bright sky with his dying eyes...And he
had heard that the drowned had serene faces. He had never actually
seen a dead man. Mother's coffin had been screwed down before he
reached Springfield from Dartmouth. He had imagined that that had
been an act of spite on the part of father. But, of course, it had
not been. He heard afterwards that mother had had a look of
terrible agony and father wanted to spare his children.</p>

<p>He had misjudged father. Father had told the cook to cook
Luxemburg-fashion and had taken his gold-headed cane out of the
drawer immediately after he had come back from the funeral. That
had looked like callousness. It hadn't been. Long after, father had
told Sister Carrie that he had done it as a tribute to mother. He
had been so certain of her saintliness that he knew she had gone
straight to Heaven. If he had had any doubt or considered that she
had earned a period in Purgatory he would have waited till he
thought that period had ended. But, in Heaven, she would see all
things in the right light. She would see that Luxemburg-fashion
cooking was the best for him, and that gold-knobbed canes became
men of his generation. She would be glad when from the battlements
in the sky she saw him eating his first <i>plat de côte</i> and
Kramyk.</p>

<p>A queer old fellow, father&mdash;In some ways his mind worked
singularly like his son's.</p>

<p>Of course Henry Martin had thought that death by drowning would
be the most painless.</p>

<p>He stopped the engine and throwing up one of the deck boards
took out two heavy pigs of iron ballast. He dropped one into either
pocket. That was to show that though he might be delaying his death
he was still determined on it. After all there was no hurry. If he
had set six o'clock for the hour of his rising he had set none for
his death. And he had all eternity before him. And a lovely day. He
had always luxuriated in that sort of brightness. He imagined that
Heaven would be all sunlight and little bright objects.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat had lost way the scarlet, triangular sail
bellied out nicely. Henry Martin had never ascertained what such
sails were called in English. 'Lateen' he imagined. But he had a
vague idea that lateen sails were made of rush. Probably that was
wrong. He was pretty sure that the rig when there were several
masts was called 'felucca.' A brave word, felucca. It made you
think of Salee rovers, corsairs. He was familiar with the look of
the rig from a set of nacred tea-trays that his mother had had.
They showed Mediterranean scenes with the curved felucca yards
bending romantically this way and that.</p>

<p>It was a nice rig. So extraordinarily easy to handle that he had
often wondered why it was not used all the world over. This
particular boat had the disadvantage that, when the sail was
furled, if you had forgotten, or if you had not had time, to secure
the yard it would swing round and round on the mast and might catch
you a tidy crack if you were in the way&mdash;say in the rounded seat
behind the joy-stick. Then it swung round again and caught you on
the other side. Precisely like a vindictive boxer delivering a left
and right.</p>

<p>That had happened to him three days ago, the nose of the yard
catching him such a crack on each shoulder that he had two immense
bruises on his upper arms.</p>

<p>He retreated to the stern where there was a tiller that he used
instead of the motorwheel when the engine was not running. The
stern seat was the more comfortable. You could stretch your legs to
the full with one arm over the bar. It was one of his favourite
positions. From there he could handle the sheet of the main-sail
without getting up.</p>

<p>He lay for a long time with a completely vacant mind. The very
high bow of the boat towered up to a sharp point and hid the
greater part of the roads before him. It was complete luxury. This
was how he had imagined it.</p>

<p>After a time the wind fell completely. The sail flapped now and
then against the mast. Why not be delayed when you could suffer it
in complete luxury? The sails of the approaching flotilla of
pleasure seekers grew brighter and brighter. He could see them
beyond the side of the port bow if he leaned his head over to one
side. It pleased him to see them. They were like a gay fleet coming
to lead him to a feast of garlands.</p>

<p>The sunlight grew whiter and more white. The day hung
breathless. The sea was like a looking-glass: infinitely blue and
getting bluer and ever more blue against the bright green of the
promontory. He was by now well into the roads.</p>

<p>But, by Jove, the water was not blue between him and the
mainland. It was a reddish chocolate. And opaque! There must have
been an immense rainstorm somewhere in the mountains during the
night. Old Marius Vial's <i>trombio</i>. Henry Martin had seen the
water looking like that once already after an immense storm, taking
up exactly half the inlet so that, from above, it had seemed to be
two streaks...of red-brown and blue. The storm had gone pounding
along the foothills of the Alps and then out to sea beyond Hyères.
Cyclonic! These storms with a circular itinerary were not unusual
in that neighbourhood during early August. The amount of water that
fell during one of them was incredible. You could tell that because
though the actual number of days on which rain fell in that
neighbourhood was the lowest in all Western Europe the rainfall
itself was the highest in all France. It was of course practically
the tropics.</p>

<p>A feeling of unease was coming over him. He felt as if someone
was watching him from behind his back. That was absurd. But the
feeling grew until it was as if the something was an immense feline
creature. That was more absurd. You should not yield to these
feelings. There was no knowing how your character might not
deteriorate if you did!...</p>

<p>With his face looking backwards, his right hand, mechanically,
but with frantic speed, released the sheet of the sail from its
cleat. He had seen three boats against a grey curtain&mdash;slate grey
triangles of supernatural leaden-whiteness! They had stood out
against the leaden curtain. One: two: three! They had gone over,
flat. One: two: three! It was incredible that they could have
capsized. But the air was moaning for them.</p>

<p>The immense grey-black curtain towered up to the peak of the
heavens. It advanced with unbelievable rapidity. Before it the
white villas half hidden in the tropical trees, the fort of the top
on Cap Brun, the white semaphore over the highest part of St.
Mandrier&mdash;all these things sparkled and were distinct in the
sunlight. When it reached them they disappeared. There was nothing
but the leaden grey pall with the fringe of sea beaten into an
agony of whiteness.</p>

<p>It threatened unimaginable horrors. It advanced with the speed
of a racehorse. God knew what went on within it. Lightning tore it
and glowed from within. The screams of the drowning were thin but
incessant. Those three sails had gone over, flat, with the
precision of flaps on the edge of a machine...It was Hell that was
advancing&mdash;the hell of primitive imagination.</p>

<p>If he could get the boat round! He had sprung to the engine.
There was no time to let down the yard. The sail, let free, might
not exercise much leverage. Not enough to turn that large boat
over. The noise was now so great that he could not hear if the
engine responded...It had sounded out of order!...</p>

<p>It had sounded out of order. But, if he could not get her head
round they were lost. Her stern was so low that those white seas
would poop her, without a chance of escape. He jammed and jammed at
the starting lever. He cursed but could not hear his oaths. The
sounds advancing were like the screams of demoniac birds...Like the
scream of that bird. He did not dare to look behind him. He had
been Contemplating a sin&mdash;Hell was advancing on him.</p>

<p>She could never run before it. She had a trick of speed: she was
a good filly. They must not be lost: they must not be lost. Time
moved so slowly that when, in the now steaming heat he moved his
hand from the wheel to wipe his wet forehead with the back it
seemed to take whole minutes to get it up to his head...One day is
as a thousand years in hell. Then perhaps the engine was not
refusing. It was time that had broken down.</p>

<p>There was a faint vibration on the wheel in his hands....He felt
his body sway back in his seat. If he could get her round. She must
know she could never stand those seas on her broadside. She had way
on. She was starting engrossedly over the still placid sea in the
sunlight that was already livid.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Now for it, old girl.'</p>

<p>He pressed on the wheel a little but steadily. A big boat like
that could not be turned very sharply. It was at any rate not one
of her virtues. Besides, if that sea caught her heeling for the
turn it would swamp her in a minute.</p>

<p>To his breathlessness her high bow moved slowly to the right.
Along the flank of the mountain that is over Les Sablettes. Behind
the inner harbour. A heavy, squarish mass of cloud was attached to
the peak, going away to the right like a shock of hair. The bow
moved round, obscuring in its deliberate motion, grey-white ravines
and little trees each of which had its separate shadow. He was then
in the shadow and chill of what was advancing. But out there the
sunlight still fell. Objects were amazingly distinct: seven miles
away. But the shadows were ink-black.</p>

<p>On the beach at Les Sablettes there would already be a thick,
gay, unsuspecting crowd of Sunday holiday seekers. As they said
there: You would not be able to smell the sea for the babies...And
unsuspecting!</p>

<p>She had come half round. The bows were obscuring the flowered
gardens and the palms and pines of the mainland. He had made the
inland turn. He would have preferred to make for the open,
left-handed. But there might be some shelter near the land. He was
about a mile out. People in white clothes were running in crowds
along the smugglers' path. Along the face of the rock.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked at the approaching <i>trombio</i>. She was
now broadside on to it and turning slowly. As if unconcernedly.
Like a woman occupied with her cooking during a bombardment. He
still lay back. Luxuriously! Leaning slackly on the tiller. He
considered for a moment and then sprang for the wheel. The tiller
might be jerked out of his hand in the approaching torrent.</p>

<p>That Thing of God appeared to go perfectly straight across the
inlet. Like a great wall with a whitewashed foot. It towered
completely up into invisibility. But, as she moved slowly round, he
saw that the face of the wall was in vaporous motion. It was as if
cloudy beings rushed violently to right or left or upwards. Or as
if...</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'By God!'</p>

<p>It was now that he was taking his call before the mocking beings
of the Universe. It was now...now...now that he was going behind
the curtain.</p>

<p>As soon as she was round he had unthrottled the engine. The sea
was now agitated. She had come alive. Under the new force she
seemed to spring toward her doom. He discovered that he was
panting.</p>

<p>Darkness descended on him. It came like a whip. With a roaring
rush. The air was full of missiles. It was as if a hundred pails of
wheat had been hurled at him. Just before the darkness he had
looked at the compass. Whilst he could still see the land. By
steering due east with a little south to allow for drift if the
wind beat inshore he ought just to shave the headland behind which
lay Carqueiranne. But he was blinded. Heavy veils of water were in
his eyelashes as he shivered. They seemed glutinous, one succeeding
another as he brushed them away with the back of his hand. The rain
drove straight through his shirt. It was icy and impelled him to
rage. He would best this damned imbecility of the elements. And
save the boat. It was as if she trusted him to save her. He
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'By God, she is the only friend I have.'</p>

<p>Damn all women! A woman by now would have been shrieking or
fainting. Not Alice perhaps. But she had gone Lesbian.</p>

<p>The noise was as if a thousand lunatics were rubbing sheets of
corundum paper one on the other. The rain was solid on his skin. It
was as if he were at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>He remembered the little flask in his pocket: the one he had not
offered to Hugh Monckton the night before. <i>That</i> was fiery,
cheap stuff. Having drunk half of it he seemed to be on fire within
and frozen outside. What pastry-cooks call a <i>chaud-froid</i>. It
seemed to fill him with savage gaiety.</p>

<p>She was labouring slowly into the teeth of the wind. She took
the short seas as if she were a hunter at a horseshow taking in and
out fences. It was impossible to see what progress she made if she
made any. He steered to the left, towards the land. Very gradually.
She shipped a little water. He imagined himself to be about level
with Cap Brun.</p>

<p>He knew all the beaches along there. But he was not enough of a
sailor to know how she would take landing on the shingle in this
sea. He was, however, certain that she would be all right if she
struck a patch of sand. Or, if he got under the lea of Carqueiranne
mole he might risk landing on the hard stones.</p>

<p>Suddenly land loomed up before him. Reddish perpendicular rocks
with the spindrift shooting before it. She was going at it, nose
on. And travelling rather fast.</p>

<p>That would not do. Even in smooth water she would stave her bows
in if she charged red granite rocks. He wanted her to come off
without a scratch, and he felt full of confidence that he could do
it. He headed her seawards. It was no doubt the brandy that had
given him confidence. But that did not matter. He caught, near his
left hand in large white letters the word RESERVE. He must be
within ten yards of the land but the water was deep there. He knew
the place but not its name. He was more than half way back to
Carqueiranne and he knew approximately the pace at which they were
travelling.</p>

<p>Out of the shelter of the land the storm blew again more
furiously. She began once more her gait of the jumping hunter. It
made his teeth chatter. He reckoned it would cut her travelling
down to about half. They would have to stand it for a full hour
more.</p>

<p>The wind howled: the rain beat upon him: the engine ran well
now. He could feel its pulsations on the wheel. The monotony grew
insupportable. Once there was a moment of calm in the air. He put
her at it, cramming in the gasoline. He imagined himself to have
made three hundred yards at racing speed. Then she washed into it
again. As if she had gone at...What was it called? A bullfinch. The
sort of hedge Hugh Monckton had said he was going to put his car
at.</p>

<p>There must be a pocket of calm travelling in the middle of the
storm. He thought they called it the cyclonic centre. That must
mean they were in the middle of the disastrous affair. They would
have to go through as much again as they had already gone through.
He doubted if he could do it. He was insufferably weary and cold.
His hands on the wheel ached with cramp. His eyes were painful with
gazing into the wind. He would have given anything to lie down on
dry land. On pine-needles...What a hope! as Hugh Monckton had
said.</p>

<p>The fumes of the brandy were surging up within him...You had to
remember that his stomach must be quite empty. He had eaten nothing
since dinner-time last night. He remembered to have read that,
taken on an empty stomach brandy reached its maximum effect in a
quarter of an hour. After that it acted as a soporific. Weakening
you.</p>

<p>It was perhaps half an hour since he had taken that gulp. Then
he must be feeling the weakening effect. That was damnable.</p>

<p>Suddenly he put her about. It was perhaps the recklessness of
brandy. He must have underestimated her seaworthiness. The la Seyne
boatbuilders probably knew their job and those waters. She was like
a cork. Even when she was broadside on to the direction of the wind
she shipped next to no water. Before the wind she fairly raced the
wave crests.</p>

<p>He felt wild elation. Like a drunken motorist racing through
traffic. Or like Hugh Monckton charging his bullfinch. Well, he was
probably the better man of the two. It was unlikely that he had
done what he said. Whereas he, Henry Martin, was actually charging
an unknown obstacle at breathless speed...</p>

<p>He would have to borrow some money of Hugh Monckton. So as to be
able to sleep for two days on end. He would have to have two days'
sleep before he would have the nerve to commit suicide again.</p>

<p>Well, why not borrow of Hugh Monckton? They had been in the same
regiment! Besides, Hugh Monckton had offered to lend him twenty
thousand pounds to have a gamble with. Surely he would let him have
five hundred francs for a sleep...One five-thousandth of the
sum!</p>

<p>He exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p>'Good God!'</p>

<p>They had leapt into perfectly still water. They were doing very
likely thirty! With a furious kick at the pedal and pushing the
lever completely over he reversed the engine. He did not dare to go
about in the effort to reduce speed. They must have struck the
mouth of the little cove beneath the stone pines. He was thrown
against the wheel as the reversing engine began to take effect. All
the breath left his body. The cove was perhaps two hundred yards
across and a quarter of a mile deep. The sides were lined with red
granite but at the bottom was the stretch of silver sand. The very
thing to land on if they were not going at express speed.</p>

<p>But there was no knowing how far they were down the cove. The
cove it must be because there was no other. But the rain falling
direct into the windless space hid everything. He might well be
going to crash her on to that sand with a force that might stave
her bottom. What a thing to do to your only friend!</p>

<p>But perhaps Hugh Monckton was also a friend. He seemed to hear
his voice say: 'Old Bean!'...Male and female created He them...The
boat was a female...</p>

<p>There appeared dim and wet through the glassy rods of the rain a
red brick blockhouse, a hillside and a white path that divided it
at a slant. It was indeed the cove.</p>

<p>These things came toward him rapidly. But the reversed screw had
taken hold. Every half second the speed decreased. He stood up to
see exactly at what moment to stop the engine. Some men were
running out of the red blockhouse. If the engines ran after she was
stopped they might strain their bearings. He thought so.</p>

<p>She checked glutinously as she were on the bottom ooze. He half
fell forward. She proceeded: then checked more determinedly. He
felt a violent, an incredible blow on his cheek. Incredible
pain.</p>

<p>The yard that had been completely divested of its canvas had
swung round on the mast at the checking of the keel. The end of the
yard was bound in iron.</p>

<p>The blow knocked him sideways. Immediately a fearful sear of
pain existed in his right temple. That flail had swung completely
round on the mast. He screamed. He fell desperately forward on to
the hood that covered the engines...</p>

<p>The only thing that existed was pain. Men stopped him on the
sand and told him he was bleeding.</p>

<p>'Vous saignez!'...'Mais vous saignez!'...'Saignez.'</p>

<p>He struck at them and ran. He thought that if he ran fast enough
he could escape from the pain. And they were barring his way...What
sort of life was this?</p>

<p>They shuffled back stupidly. He ran for the foot of the path. He
must obtain insensibility. He desired to bite at the tufts of
rosemary that on the pathside brushed his cheek. He was past them
before he could bite.</p>

<p>He came to the top and sat down on a ledge. The rain had
stopped. The sunshine fell on the island of Porquerolles&mdash;the high
blue island over the ruffled sea. He could do no more.</p>

<p>He held his hand to his right temple. It came down glutinous and
scarlet. He held his other hand to his other cheek. He desired to
vomit. To have escaped war, tempest and self-given death and to
come to this! The impulse to vomit made him remember his brandy
flask. It was still half full.</p>

<p>The men on the sand below had given up looking at him and had
gone back to the blockhouse. With the impulse of the brandy within
him he stood up. The day was growing brighter and brighter. He must
be going on!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-2" id="ch3-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Hugh Monckton was lying on his face. On pine-needles.</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'"Men fall on their faces when shot through the medulla: on
their backs when..."' 'Medulla' was no doubt not the word in the
quotation.</p>

<p>Some people had all the luck! Hugh Monckton was lying on his
face in the place where Henry Martin had meant to lie. When he had
thought, in the boat, of lying on the ground on pine-needles, that
was where he had meant to lie. Undoubtedly!</p>

<p>The umbrella pines towered up. A light breeze shook their tops.
As they moved pools of sunlight moved over the still, wet
needles.</p>

<p>His passport was in some sort of celluloid casing. Stamped with
a large plaque of gold. The Smith arms perhaps. Or the British
Royal ones. It was in his left hand. His gun had the barrel and the
carrier curiously damascened. It was in his right hand.</p>

<p>The Mediterranean shone through the trunks. From that height he
could see that around the semaphore on the promontory across the
water there was a brown open space. In the early spring no doubt it
had been a green lawn.</p>

<p>It was troublesome to attend to immediate details. The alcohol
he had lately swallowed probably confused him. He had never seen a
dead body. Mother's coffin had been screwed up when he got back
from Dartmouth. He did not know what you had to do for the comfort
of the dead. He had an idea that you put pennies on their eyes. He
had read that somewhere. In this case you could hardly do that.</p>

<p>What was he to do then? It was troublesome to think. He ought
presumably to call assistance. That would mean that his friend's
rest would be the earlier broken. Rough and careless men would
eventually disturb him. Let him lie as long as he could.</p>

<p>It was evident that he had desired his body to be as little as
possible rifled. He had had the same idea as Henry Martin, his
passport being in his hand.</p>

<p>That fellow had succeeded in killing himself when he, Henry
Martin, had ignominiously failed.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had been considering that matter when he had come
into the grove. He had said to himself with bitterness:</p>

<p>'Here's the sort of fellow' I am. I set out to drown
myself&mdash;then run away from a storm that would have drowned me. What
sort of a spectacle shall I present?'</p>

<p>He had said to himself that that was all one with his
grotesquely futile life.</p>

<p>Then he said fiercely:</p>

<p>'Damn it all: I didn't run away from the storm. I fought it as
few men not six feet in their stockings could have fought it. And
precious few who were!'</p>

<p>There was no one but himself to whom he would present any
spectacle. No one else knew that he had set out to commit suicide.
It was merely with himself that he had to argue for it was only
before himself that he could be ashamed. He was not going to be!
His fighting the storm had been a courageous action. He was saving
the boat. You had to save boats. There were two of them. He and the
boat.</p>

<p>It was all very well to say that he had set out to commit
suicide. But his pact with Providence had been to do it in a warm
still sea. With the sun on the island.</p>

<p>He took the passport from the leaden fingers. He had touched a
dead friend! How quickly Hugh Monckton had become his friend. In
the boat he had said that she and Hugh Monckton were his only
friends. It had then seemed a little fantastic. Now it seemed the
exact truth. At any rate as regarded Hugh Monckton.</p>

<p>They had had exactly the same idea. The celluloid casing! Those
were certainly not the British Royal Arms stamped upon it. The
crest was recognizably a pelican of the wilderness. There were two
quarterings of things like hammers. Punning heraldry. The motto was
<i>Sine Fabro Ars Nulla</i>...There is no art without a
Smith...There was an old saying: 'By hammer and hand all Art doth
stand.'...Father had said that in Luxemburg his crest had been a
mailed hand holding a hammer...Henry Martin felt towards the arms
stamped there a sort of intimacy. As if they ought to have been his
own arms. Perhaps he and Hugh Monckton had been related! That might
account for their sudden friendship.</p>

<p>The celluloid casing, then, contained a blue British Passport
inscribed in a little slot: H.M.A. Smith, a thousand franc note and
a letter addressed: 'A celui qui trouvera mon corps!'...'To whoever
finds my body.'</p>

<p>The letter said:</p>

<p>'Je préférerais...' 'I should prefer.'...That no one should
search his body! His pockets were completely empty. He died by his
own act. He had no ill feeling towards any human being. If French
law insisted on an autopsy it must be so. But he would prefer to be
buried in his clothes as it were. He died because the after effects
of the late war had become too intolerable to him. He was
completely useless to man or beast and suffered terribly. He begged
whoever found his body to communicate with his
relatives&mdash;<i>communiquer les nouvelles à ses parents</i>...and war
comrade&mdash;<i>comarade de guerre</i>...Henry Martin Aluin Smith of
Springfield, Ohio, at present staying...<i>qui demeure actuellement
Hotel du Port, Carqueiranne, Var.</i></p>

<p><i>Monsieur Henry Martin Aluin Smith trouverait sur la cheminee
de la chambre seize, Hotel des Negociants</i>...Henry Martin would
find on the mantelshelf of Hugh Monckton's room a letter containing
a codicil to his will. It begged him as knowing all the
circumstances better than another to take care of the disposition
of such of his property as should find itself in that city...It
came with a sort of tranquillity to Henry Martin to turn the page
and to see a rough design...</p>

<p class="cp">+ Cl GIT<br>
UN ETRANGER<br>

XVI. VIII.MCMXXXI<br>
MISERERE MEI DOMINE<br>
QUIA MULTUM AMAVI</p>

<p>He desired to be buried in the graveyard of Le Revest des Eaux,
looking over the Mediterranean and to be covered by a single slab
of granite bearing the inscription: 'Here lies a stranger who died
on the sixteenth of August, nineteen hundred and thirty-one. Have
mercy on me O Lord in that I have loved much.' Hugh Monckton made
that request in that letter that might be made public because he
did not wish the inhabitants of that countryside to think his heirs
niggardly in giving him such simple sepulture.</p>

<p>For a moment Henry Martin felt that that was himself writing!
And then that it was himself lying face downwards there. A sharp
spat of noise came from the paper. It was a gout of blood that had
fallen on the signature. It seemed to cement whatever was the odd
relationship since it related Henry Martin's blood with the other's
name. The signature was extraordinarily like his own.</p>

<p>The pain which had ceased at the discovery of that body now
began again. The sight of the blood had recalled him to himself. He
must go somewhere and get something done to himself. His chest was
covered with blood that had streamed from his cheek and his temple.
He imagined Hugh Monckton was shot through the right temple but not
through the left jawbone.</p>

<p>Now was the time to commit suicide. But he admitted that he had
not the nerve. He must have a couple of nights' sleep. He could not
face it as he was.</p>

<p>He was wretchedly worried by the spot of blood on Hugh
Monckton's signature. How would the people who found him account
for that? He had the strongest possible revulsion from the idea
that it should be he who denounced Hugh Monckton to the police. It
would be denouncing! Those ravens would fall upon him; they would
drag him about and shout in his silent presence. They would perhaps
accuse him of cowardice...But there was one incontrovertible excuse
for suicide. To be abandoned by a woman. That was the one absolute
finality: your whole being was halved. The very reason for your
existence ceased.</p>

<p>No: he would not be the one to do the denouncing!</p>

<p>Then the blood on the letter? How would they account for that?
Blood on a letter inside a celluloid casing! And he, Henry Martin,
bleeding and having passed that way...Hugh Monckton must have a
clean letter...</p>

<p>He thought of substituting his own letter from his own
passport...It was just such another letter...The throbbing in his
head became intolerable. He heard voices. He ran to the edge of the
clump of trees and looked down on the path. He had his own
celluloid wrapped passport in his right hand because he had just
taken it out. Hugh Monckton's was in his left.</p>

<p>Four fat men in black were beginning the ascent of the path.
They pointed to Henry Martin's blood on the track and interrogated
each other. Henry Martin panted. He felt himself a hunted animal.
He ran. He staggered a minute ago. Now he ran.</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton's fingers were cold. He pressed them. That was the
last time they would be pressed on this earth.</p>

<p>He ran across the pine-needles, and, in the blazing light of the
sun, down the slope that gave on to the meadow beneath the real
estate agent's villa. Hugh Monckton's car was standing in the
field. Henry Martin's passport was in Hugh Monckton's fingers! He
had a clean letter.</p>

<p>The slope was slippery, the sun blinding. His miserable feet
slipped: slipped again. They would not sustain him. They slipped
away beneath him. For a moment it was ease to fall. He rolled over
and over, he did not know how far. The jabs of pain at each turn
made eleven!</p>

<p>He rolled over the hard roadway with the impulsion and into the
meadow. He was escaping from the fat men in black! He climbed to
his knees: then to his feet. He was screaming with rage and waving
his arms with madness of fury. He ought to have been spared this.
It was indecent. To make a sport of him when he had just lost his
only friend. Destiny was indecent...He was running towards the car.
You do not take liberties with people who owned cars. He was
running on a serpentine track. The car was as good as his. Hugh
Monckton would lend it to him. Hugh Monckton had left all his
property at his disposal. He was as good as Hugh Monckton
himself.</p>

<p>He staggered two yards to the right: he was erect again but the
earth was trying to strike him. He fell in mounting the step of the
car. He gripped the metal but his hand had no holding power. He was
on the ground...</p>

<p><br>
A gentle voice was saying:</p>

<p>'My wife with her opera glasses which explored the
harbour...'...'Ma femme avec ses lorgnettes qui explorait le
port...' But it must be the plural: 'exploraient.' It was
extraordinarily luxurious to lie on the ground in the sunlight...Or
it might have been the wife not the glasses which explored the
port.</p>

<p>This black-bearded undertaker was trying to make him get up. He
had a large, shining car.</p>

<p>After a time they were in the car. The undertaker, in black
alpaca, was driving it with one arm round Henry Martin's shoulders.
They were going very slowly.</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'You will spoil your alpaca!'</p>

<p>The funereal fellow said:</p>

<p>'That will make nothing.'...Meaning that it did not matter. He
went on: 'Make yourself comfortable my dear Monsieur Smeez. Lean
heavily upon me.'</p>

<p>He had a gentle voice. It was M. Something or other, the
real-estate man. Henry Martin hoped that his migraine was not
troubling him. He said:</p>

<p>'You recognize me? You are very kind...tres gentil. We are going
to Carqueiranne?'</p>

<p>M. Something said:</p>

<p>'No: Carqueiranne is near. But they have little accommodation
there. I thought it better to go to your own hotel in the town.' He
added: 'I should not, my faith, have recognized you...But I saw
your name on the silver plate in your car. And I am naturally
familiar with your figure...You, of course, mistook your road in
the storm. You must have charged right through the hedge at the
turn of the road...Famous cars that your House builds! Your
specimen appears very little injured.'</p>

<p>The pain of someone cleaning his face with gentle dabs was very
sharp. The pungent odour of an anaesthetic burned his nostrils. A
man in white was hanging over him. A voice said:</p>

<p>'This is Monsieur Monckton Smeez...'</p>

<p>Another:</p>

<p>'Vous ne le dites pas!...You don't say! I wish I had his money.
But not at the moment his face.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Non...non...'</p>

<p>He was no doubt repenting of his rash act!</p>

<p>If he wasn't at the bottom of the Mediterranean he was at the
side of a road under some plane trees and he had changed his
identity. The firm husky voice said:</p>

<p>'It is necessary, Monsieur, that I get the gravel out of the
wound. Otherwise you will have a very great scar.'</p>

<p>The voice of the man in alpaca said:</p>

<p>'Monsieur has already a very great and most honourable scar.
From a Boche sabre.' He was one of the first hundred thousand of
his compatriots to land in this country in 1914.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin writhed. This was one of the conse quences of his
act that he had not expected. He tried to say:</p>

<p>'You must not say that.' But they were binding his jaw over his
head with a lint bandage...After all he had wished to be Hugh
Monckton. Now he was.</p>

<p>A mournful face with brown eyes immensely magnified by the
lenses of spectacles was gazing at him from very near...A square
brown beard. A black skull cap. All in white. He said&mdash;in
English:</p>

<p>'Be assured, sair, I weel hairt you as leetle as is not
necessaire...C'est vous qui avez sauvé la France...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin remembered the canning factory in the Cevennes. And
the Syphilis Inspector! They might between them have saved
France...With preventive instruction and canned salmon from the
Rhône! But he tried to remember himself standing up to a mounted
figure in a blue uniform with silver buttons. Galloping upon him
with a waving sabre. It was a less satisfactory way of saving
France. But more likely to be applauded by a wayside druggist.</p>

<p>The man then said he would give Henry Martin a composing draft.
He was still in the automobile. There was a little crowd round it.
Monsieur Lamoricière, the real-estate agent...that was his
name...was explaining with grave unction...This was Mongtong Smeez.
The famous proprietor of the Mongtong car and a hero of the first
water&mdash;during the Great War. During the storm he had mistaken his
road and the car had charged a wall and hedge. At right angles.
Monsieur Mongtong Smeez had been thrown out of his vehicle. But the
car and the hero had each been very little damaged...Monsieur Smeez
appeared to have no broken bones...A tribute to the build of both
car and hero! Madame Lamoricière surveying with her opera glass the
<i>port extérieur</i> for relics of the great storm had turned it
negligendy on the field. She had exclaimed to Monsieur:</p>

<p>'Tiens, mon ami...There is a car in the meadow...And, yes...the
form of one recumbent half hidden by it. Go quickly. Be sure there
has been a terrible accident!'</p>

<p>He had hurried down in his car and had found the hero, recumbent
indeed, beside it...Insensible!</p>

<p>The soft clear voice going on in its precise monotone was
punctuated by gentle, applauding interruptions from the crowd. The
thick shadow of the plane-boughs was black on the road. Monsieur
Lamoricière went on to make a few remarks on the negligence of the
local authorities who had set up no indication post at a most
dangerous angle. Thus they had risked depriving the world of one of
its great industrialists and France of one of her saviours. At a
time of crisis when the world needed more than anything great
leaders of industry. And France all the heroes that could be
found!</p>

<p>To Henry Martin with the sweet taste of an opiate in his mouth
this seemed agreeable and even touching nonsense. The chemist had
introduced the syrup between his teeth by means of a syringe. He
could hardly move his jaw. He wondered why they did not start.
After a time they did, going very gently along a very smooth road.
M. Lamoricière's arm was again about his shoulders. It was
agreeable.</p>

<p><br>
It was dim in Hugh Monckton's room. It had the air at once of a
cathedral and a home. A closed in portion of a cathedral. He seemed
to have passed at some time a large part of his life there. It was
familiar...The treasury of some cathedral. Because of the
fantastically unique objects in the packing cases and because the
spirit of Hugh Monckton was looking over them.</p>

<p>A great many people seemed to have followed him into the room.
But he had had the first glimpse of it in its solitude and
dimness.</p>

<p>It was odd that it was dim. The heavy curtains of course did
that. But who had closed them? He could not remember Hugh Monckton
doing it. And the night before he had watched the searchlights from
the couch. And sure enough the hotel people were saying that they
had not known Monsieur had not slept in his bed. No one had entered
the room. They congratulated Monsieur on his escape. Volubly! They
volubly lamented the storm. Thirty-two poor holiday makers had been
drowned in the exterior port. In the roads...Well, he knew
something about that. But they were not to be aware that he
did...</p>

<p>Above the curtains a little light filtered. Through the rings. A
single gilt streak ran diagonally across the the dusty roses
frescoed on the ceiling and vertically down the puce-coloured,
faded wall beside the mirror. Like gilt. In the dim mirror he saw
white things reflected. Bandages on a man's face. You saw only the
eyes, the nose, the moustache. And a very little of the chin. It
was like the head of a crusader in a helmet of lint. He could not
remember if any of the crusaders had set sail from that port. They
might have. The Pilgrimage of Children might have passed close by
there!...</p>

<p>The question pressed upon him suddenly: Was he going to continue
this...What was it? A farce? A crime possibly? It seemed to be his
only chance of rest. That he needed desperately...A couple of days
stretched on a bed. He did not suppose Hugh Monckton would object
to his sleeping in his vacant bed...Well, he was sure he would not.
The alternative would be a French hospital. No: damn it! Hugh
Monckton would not stand for that. Then...</p>

<p>The people round him were full of solicitude and repeated over
and over again the same exclamations as to the magnificence of his
car. A magnificent car! It had jumped a hedge! It had jumped a
hedge. A magnificent car! <i>Une auto magnifique...cela sautait
comme un cheval</i>...</p>

<p>It was their laudation of him as Hugh Monckton that most worried
him...But if they did not applaud him they would be pitying him. Or
censoring. He was at least keeping alive that part of Hugh Monckton
that was his name and excited applause. Without that there would be
for him, so shortly, nothing but oblivion...Vice-regent here on
Earth...That was what he was...Hugh Monckton's earthly
representative. Receiving in his name their homage for having saved
La France! Literally in his name.</p>

<p>The <i>patronne</i>, an aged dumpling in black, discovered on
the mantelpiece a letter addressed to Monsieur. She began to cackle
over it like a hen over an egg. 'Une lettre à l'adresse de
Monsieur...' A letter addressed to Monsieur...A fat letter
addressed to Monsieur Henri Mungtong Smeez...A letter that
crackled...With <i>billets de banque</i>...What a thing it was to
be rich!...In times of crisis...People left for you letters that
were fat and crackled...</p>

<p>'Fat and crackling, 5 the waiter repeated; the fat chambermaid,
the thin one: and the little <i>chasseur</i>; and the husband of
the <i>patronne</i> and the friend of the husband of the
<i>patronne</i> who had been having a glass of syrup and
water...They all, in different tones, repeated the word...</p>

<p>Monsieur Lamoricière and a silver-haired, tired man were driving
them out of the room. Monsieur Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'This is my friend, Monsieur Smeez...Monsieur le
docteur'...Something!</p>

<p>He was holding the large letter. They were inviting him to
recline himself on the bed...The doctor had acknowledged the
introduction with the air of a judge condemning you to death. The
French doctor's bedside manner! He was a tired doctor. And easily
annoyed!</p>

<p>Henry Martin glanced at the superscription of the letter. It was
addressed:</p>

<p>'Henry Martin Aluin Smith, Esq.' 'To be called for.'</p>

<p>Yet the patronne had read 'Martin' as 'Mongtong.'...Nothing
would ever make French concierges or <i>patronnes</i> recognize the
superscription of letters. Either they gave you all the letters for
all the inhabitants of your apartment building or they refused to
believe that by any possibility 'Smith' could read 'Smeez.' Madame
<i>La Patronne</i> was of the generous type. It was perhaps just as
well!</p>

<p>These then were Hugh Monckton's testamentary directions...</p>

<p>The doctor snatched the letter from his hand.</p>

<p>'It is me you have to attend to. Not your correspondence.' He
said irritably to Monsieur Lamoricière:</p>

<p>'Make more light. How can you expect me to see a patient in
these tenebrousnesses?'</p>

<p>The curtains, admitting a golden blaze, ran back, jingling on
their rings. The light fell strongly from the left. The room faced
due south. It could not be more than ten o'clock. The gilt dial of
the clock with gilt mermaids on the mantelpiece said however a
quarter to four. That was frivolous.</p>

<p>Was it possible to imagine that all that had happened had taken
at most four hours?...The setting out for suicide: the endlessly
lasting storm; the actual suicide. And his complete change of
identity. If he tried to prove to these gentlemen that he was Henry
Martin and not Hugh Monckton they would certify him as a
madman!</p>

<p>A supreme test must however be coming.</p>

<p>The doctor began his investigations&mdash;searching for internal
injuries. Henry Martin did not see how he could have internal
injuries. He had been clouted on each side of the head and had
rolled down a little bank. Then he remembered that he had been
thrown out of an automobile. After jumping a hedge in it!</p>

<p>The supreme test was however coming!</p>

<p>The doctor tried him for leg injuries apparently. He pushed up
Henry Martin's feet till his knees hit his aching jaw. Then he
tried the arms. His bending them was supportable. But when he
tapped the outside of the upper arm Henry Martin groaned.</p>

<p>The doctor became as excited as a terrier by a stackside when
you are ratting. He cut Henry Martin's shirt open right down the
arm.</p>

<p>'It is better for you not to move,' he said, 'and you can
apparently afford a shirt.'</p>

<p>He grew angry at the sight of the bruises on the upper arm.</p>

<p>'This fellow must be injured somewhere,' he said. 'It is
unreasonable. Even his contusions have the air of clearing
up...'</p>

<p><i>That</i> was not unreasonable because they were three days
old.</p>

<p>Monsieur Lamoricière began with his sober, oratorical
manner:</p>

<p>'If you consider that Monsieur Smeez was one of the...'</p>

<p>That was the supreme test. If that grave voice had once more got
out the statement that Henry Martin was one of the Old
Contemptibles Henry Martin knew that he would have sprung from the
bed and shouted that he was nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>The doctor cut the other short.</p>

<p>'That has no bearing on a man who has been thrown from an
automobile.'</p>

<p>'You <i>were</i> thrown from an automobile,' he said angrily to
Henry Martin and held his ear close to the patient's mouth.</p>

<p>Henry Martin found that he could not speak. His voice made
sounds like the rasping of sticks.</p>

<p>The doctor said triumphantly:</p>

<p>'He says he doesn't know what happened. That's at least evidence
of shock...You can't be thrown out of an automobile in a hurricane
and have nothing happen to you. That would be unreasonable.'</p>

<p>He was removing the face bandages with extraordinary rapidity
and gentleness.</p>

<p>'Now for those face scratches,' he said. 'The pharmacien says
they are serious. Pharmaciens always exaggerate. They seek to
magnify the importance of the cases that their luck lets them be
first at...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin's jaw hurt him execrably when it was no longer
supported. His temple hurt him relatively little. The doctor,
peering and fingering, was for the moment silent. M. Lamoricière
was looking intently at Henry Martin. Then down at a small, thin,
dark-blue book...</p>

<p>Henry Martin's heart stopped beating. By that he knew that he
was passionately intent on assuming that other identity&mdash;that he
had been intent on it the moment when he had placed his own
passport in Hugh Monckton's fingers.</p>

<p>The moment before he could not have told you that. Now he knew
because the dark man with alabaster features was looking at the
portrait of Hugh Monckton in Hugh Monckton's passport. And then at
his&mdash;Henry Martin's face. And Henry Martin's face was lit up by the
merciless reflections in the room of the full morning sun.</p>

<p>'You have a great deal of luck,' he said. 'It is lucky that I
found this at your side for it is disagreeable to lose a
passport.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin caught at the outside of his pocket where the
trouser was...It would have been intolerable if that man had come
upon Hugh Monckton's farewell letter. The passport he had had in
his hand. But he remembered stuffing the letter and the note that
were in the celluloid case into his trouser pocket...</p>

<p>'Now I am not hurting you...You cannot say I am hurting you,'
the doctor said. 'You think I will and you shrink. But I am not
hurting you...'</p>

<p>The crackle of the celluloid made itself felt under Henry
Martin's fingers.</p>

<p>'And,' M. Lamoricière said: 'if one were humorous one might say
that you have almost as great luck in your portraits as in your
life. The passport photographs of most of us resemble as a rule
dejected pickpockets or atrocious brigands. Yours at least,
monsieur, resembles an honest man and not a disagreeable one. The
resemblance is also striking.'</p>

<p>At that Henry Martin must have fainted.</p>

<p>He heard the doctor say sardonically:</p>

<p>'It will not resemble him for long. If I am not mistaken this
gentleman will have to join your confrater nity of the bearded.
Some good bromides now and a beard in the hereafter...I will send a
woman to cup him. After that for two days he had better sleep. His
nerves are...'</p>

<p>But after that he remembered only that they seemed to be moving
him and the voice of Lamoricière:</p>

<p>'J'ai entendu dire qu'il a une petite amie. Mademoiselle...' 'I
have heard that he has a little female friend. Mademoiselle...' And
a name Henry Martin did not catch.</p>

<p>And after that the voice of the doctor booming unnaturally. He
must have been fixing something quite close to Henry Martin's ear.
He thought the words were:</p>

<p>'Ah! Elle se console!' And: 'Tonkin-Saigon. He might have done
worse.'</p>

<p>After that it was, rather blissfully one o'clock in the dim
room. One at night. A tiny light above a hung watch showed him
that. Hugh Monckton would have that sort of contraption on his
bedside table.</p>

<p>His jaw ached a good deal...But he had decided to adopt the
personality of Hugh Monckton. That was proved to him by his
fainting. He had fainted with relief at the thought that the
real-estate agent had identified him by Hugh Monckton's passport
photograph. Then he had acted of set purpose&mdash;of set purpose in his
subconscious mind&mdash;when he had fixed his own passport in those cold
fingers...</p>

<p>It opened up a whole vista of problems in criminology. His
conscious mind had had no idea of his motive&mdash;the mind with which
he framed words, caught trains, and decided what to eat in a
restaurant. But the motive must have been there. Otherwise he would
not have so revolted at the thought that the subconscious plan
might not succeed.</p>

<p>A problem in criminology!...But he denied energetically that he
was a criminal. So far he had asked no man for anything. And no
woman either. They had handled him as if he had been a brown paper
parcel. Without his yes or no.</p>

<p>His subconscious mind must have been mad for a bed. For sleep!
For silence! It had realized what would be the quickest way to get
its desires. He had been conscious only of running from the fat men
in black on the path below. He had substituted the passport, as far
as his conscious mind had been concerned, as one performs other odd
actions when one is in a hurry or panic...As people escaping from
fires select eccentric objects to save. Or as he had crammed those
documents into a trouser pocket. Instead of the natural breast
pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>That chance action had preserved his reason. He was assured of
that. If his fingers had not found the feel of those things when
his hand had gone to his side...There was no knowing what would
have happened to him. He would have been convinced that
Lamoricière, having read the letter, was awaiting the dramatic
moment at which to denounce him...Then he would have gone mad. At
the thought that he was not to sleep in Hugh Monckton's bed...At
the thought that he would not, for a day or two, have the chance to
rummage amongst Hugh Monckton's gadgets. That fellow had had the
inventive mind. The bag, stapled to the floor and painted like a
harlequin was proof of that. And now this watch, hung to the tiny
electric globe...And there were probably hundreds more in the half
visible pile of Hugh Monckton's travelling effects...</p>

<p>So that his conscious mind had now to take charge of a situation
created for him by its partner. Its partner was no doubt the part
of your brain that took charge when you were drunk and did odd
things that, next morning, you could not remember to have done. But
he repudiated angrily the idea that he had been drunk. He
remembered his actions perfectly well. And he was aware of his
motives.</p>

<p>He had now to take charge.</p>

<p>What was to become of Henry Martin? Of the Henry Martin who had
been left lying on his face under the pines on that knoll? He had
to think of who would be hurt at the news of his death. He imagined
no one. No one seriously. Sister Carrie not much beyond the
inconvenience of having to go into Continental mourning for a year.
That might be disagreeable.</p>

<p>Alice would care nothing at all. Brother Hal might give him an
hour or two of thought. He might be hurt that Henry Martin had not
applied to him for assistance. Father...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had long ago made up his mind that father would
take the news with grim humour. He would lean back in his chair
with his two hands on the edge of the table before him. He would
say:</p>

<p>'My! The boy sure hitched his wagon to some star after all.' And
he would be proud of his son's spunk. He was an old man. To him
separation came gently enough. Besides they had been separated.
They could hardly have been more apart...Then...</p>

<p>Someone was sobbing. And then moaning. Five sobs and a
moan...Six sobs and a moan. It was impossible to locate the
direction from which the noise came. It seemed to pervade the
night. He wished it would stop. It was like what he would like Mrs.
Percival to do on hearing of his death. There was no soul in the
world whom it would affect. Hardly anyone would say so much as:
'Poor fellow.' That rather let him out. He did not have to worry
much over the grief that his death would cause.</p>

<p>For the matter of that, in a day or two he could cable to his
father and the rest to say that the news of his suicide was...say,
premature. He was by no means out of the wood.</p>

<p>The fat letter was still in his hand. In fainting he must have
gripped it as Hugh Monckton had gripped his passport. It was
another trait that united them. And French people would never take
a letter from anyone's hand. They regarded letters with the
superstition that savage tribes attach to objects under a tabu. A
concierge who gave to a husband a letter addressed to his wife
might be sent to prison.</p>

<p>In lifting the letter to within the range of his sight he was
aware that his chest and upper arms smarted considerably. On his
arm near the shoulder where the doctor had slit his shirt were half
a dozen brown rings. Within them the skin was as dark brown-purple
as if he had been a negro. His chest would be in the same
condition.</p>

<p>They had been cupping him. That is another amiable mania of the
French. They will cup you on every occasion for which the English
will prescribe a nice, hot cup of tea. Queer people, Europeans!</p>

<p>From the heavy relief and dark colour of the rings Henry Martin
knew that they had called in a professional...probably a
domineering old woman in black who had pulled him about as if he
had been a mattress she was turning on a bed...It was queer to
think that what he had dreaded happening to his dead body should
have happened to him alive...It was perhaps now happening to Hugh
Monckton.</p>

<p>That thought was so disagreeable to him that he switched on the
light above the bed and tore open the envelope of the fat letter.
To escape from the thought of Hugh Monckton's body which had become
his own!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-3" id="ch3-3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>The first thing to come out of the envelope were eight pinkish
mauve notes. They were pinned together to a slip of paper that bore
a scrawl: 'For Mademoiselle Virginie, next door. Beg her to accept
as souvenir&mdash;at one thousand francs per day&mdash;of our being
neighbours. Tell her can take from the dead what would be
inacceptable from living.'</p>

<p>The sentiment seemed sympathetic to Henry Martin. He himself had
thought of nothing as sympathetic with which to mark his departure.
He had left twenty francs on the mantelpiece at Carqueiranne for
Mademoiselle Simone the tuberculous chambermaid. Twenty francs to
him had been more than eight thousand to Hugh Monckton. But he had
not devoted an ingenious and kindly thought to that lady. It was
good to be able to devote ingenious and kindly thoughts to others
at the moment of your own supreme trial...Still, he could say for
himself that he had thought of leaving his room very tidy. To save
trouble for Mademoiselle Simone.</p>

<p>It was queer. Everything attaching to Hugh Monckton resembled
all his own attributes...but on a grander scale. Eight thousand
francs to twenty. The battle of the Marne and a sabre cut to a
canning factory in the Cevennes and some water colours!</p>

<p>Well, now that he was Hugh Monckton for a day or two perhaps he
would do things on an equally grand scale...</p>

<p>The sobbing had begun again. He wished it would not. What was
the good of being Hugh Monckton if you could not have silence in
the night?...It went on; became stifled: burst out again.</p>

<p>It interfered very much with his comprehension of Hugh
Monckton's codicil. That he read first because it was the shorter
document. The letter attached to it appeared immensely long. Seven
pages of solid handwriting.</p>

<p>The codicil was fairly succinct. It gave and bequeathed to Henry
Martin Aluin Smith all his property personal or otherwise that, at
the moment of his decease found itself in room sixteen of the Hôtel
des Négociants. In trust for the following institutions...</p>

<p>The institutions were the British Museum, the National Gallery
and South Kensington Museums. The distribution of such property was
to be at the sole discretion of Henry Martin, but the testator
desired that everything that South Kensington would accept should
go to them and should be exhibited in one collection as the Gloria
Sorenson bequest...</p>

<p>That seemed rather complicated. Henry Martin's head was swimming
a great deal. The sobbing had ceased for the moment. The suspense
of waiting for it to commence was almost as distracting.</p>

<p>Henry Martin was fairly acquainted with the purposes of the
British Museum and the National Gallery. But South Kensington
seemed to him to be more amorphous. As far as he could remember it
exhibited everything imaginable from rudimentary locomotives to
pictures by Titian and stuffed owls...There would no doubt be some
way round...</p>

<p>The joke of it was that he was actually a pauper and would be
dealing in millions...The manuscript from Mount Athos alone must be
worth a King's ransom. And he dimly remembered that Hugh Monckton
had spoken of some crown jewels...Something of the sort.</p>

<p>And then...By Jove, he wasn't a pauper. Hugh Monckton appointed
him his sole executor and residuary legatee. With absolute power to
dispose as he chose or to retain possession absolutely of such
works of art, <i>incunabulae</i>...What did that mean?...as those
institutions should refuse to accept...And also with regard to the
sum of francs fifty thousand (50,000 francs) in French notes of one
thousand francs...Nos...So and so to So and so...There was no
following the figures and letters...The notes were in the flap of
the grip...</p>

<p>Besides, the sobbing had begun again...</p>

<p>He was then assured...Fifty thousand francs was two thousand
dollars...He could live...luxuriously...As if leaning back on the
cushions of an automobile...He put the codicil down on the bed
beside him.</p>

<p>He could accept the fifty thousand francs. Any man of honour
could. He was to undertake an office of considerable trust. One
that for him at least would be laborious...Then...</p>

<p>It was a reprieve...But the queer thing was...</p>

<p>Destiny, sure, was one up on Henry Martin...To the tune of
sobs...That was perhaps what you called a <i>memento mori</i>...The
Egyptians used to have a mummy case at their feasts. To remind them
that one day they would die! The Romans called that a <i>memento
mori</i>...So the sobbing might have been invented by Destiny to
remind him that he would come to the end of the two thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>It was perhaps not real sobbing...a noise in his bandaged
ears.</p>

<p>One two three four five sobs. And a long, high moan...One two
three four five six seven eight nine...Why in hell didn't she moan?
It was a woman sobbing.</p>

<p><i>Memento mori...Memento homo quia</i>...What?
<i>Mortalises</i>...Thou art mortal and money flows through your
fingers like quicksilver.</p>

<p>There was perhaps even an Egyptian Book of the Dead amongst
those packing cases. There might be anything. He could not
remember. He had not attended. Hugh Monckton seemed to have gotten
together all the rare things of the world. To attend on his voyage
to the Isles of the Blest. With Wanda Sorenson on the yacht called
<i>Le Secret</i>...he imagined them reclining on cushions in the
soft brightness of the tropics...Beneath the Winged Victory. And
Wanda Sorenson playing with unset jewels in her lap. Picking up a
handful and letting them trickle through her fingers...</p>

<p>However, she would probably not want to do that. She would be
reading a second folio Shakespeare. Besides, the gods would not let
you know Paradise.</p>

<p>What a lot of people meddled with you. Destiny, the gods, St.
Roch...</p>

<p>He had an extraordinary sense of Hugh Monckton. He was standing
astride his leather case. Smiling: a high-featured melancholy
smile. Like an actor playing Hamlet astride Ophelia's grave. He was
holding a skull. No, it was a leather case containing a hundred
grand. He was just about to say:</p>

<p>'Here, old bean...</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<p>'I did love thee once, Ophelia.'</p>

<p>But it was Ophelia who had got him. Hugh Monckton ought to be
floating down a brook holding poppies or whatever it was...But he
was otherwise engaged!</p>

<p>The room had been lighter last night. Or the light had been
redder and had fallen on Hugh Monckton from above so that his face
had been more illuminated...But it was a tangle. Hugh Monckton
could not play Ophelia. It was Wanda...No, Gloria who was Ophelia.
She was Danish. Or something Scandinavian? So had Wanda been...</p>

<p>What was Wanda now? It was twelve...no, thirteen years since he
had seen her. He had not seen her the last time he might have
because that woman had had the grippe...He had not thought of her
for a long time...</p>

<p>Gallia Gonsidine...A pretty name. A born New
Yorker...Welsh-Irish-French. He had known her before he had known
Alice. Sitting about in the Ritz bar when Paris had been full of
American troops and their women. He knew very little about her.
Tall and dark and silent...He had apparently always been attracted
to silent women. Or to very talkative ones!</p>

<p>When Alice had as it were gotten into his bed he had regretted
Gallia Considine. He had had a sudden urge toward her the first
moment he had seen her. She had been leaning back in a lounge chair
talking to a waiter who had been standing behind her shoulder with
a tray of cocktails.</p>

<p>She had wanted to know how to get to Fontainebleau. Henry Martin
had taken her there and they had spent an enjoyable quiet day. Both
liking the same things. Pictures of royalty and period furniture.
She had seemed to like him. But they hadn't seen much of each other
alone. They met at the bar most afternoons. And then Alice...</p>

<p>They had met afterwards when Alice had gone to Springfield to
see about her inheritance from her mother. And they had each
revealed that they regretted the other...They had seemed to have
very similar minds...Queer! Queer!</p>

<p>Queer, these sudden attractions...He had had one or two in his
life...And two last night, by Jove...He was getting to say 'By
Jove.' Like Hugh Monckton.</p>

<p>Then, by Jove again, he had two thousand dollars. He would be
damned if he let anything come between him and the dark girl as
long as they lasted...</p>

<p>The silver fish had been a valid omen. A fish, according to
psychiatrists, had a sexual significance...Well, the dark girl was
obviously not unsexed...No: no one should come between him and her.
On his side of the bed at least. He was through with this damn
Hamlet mood!</p>

<p>The silver fish...He had taken it to mean the leather case with
the twenty white banknotes that Hugh Monckton had been chucking
about just now...No, that had been last night. But he could not get
out of his head that Hugh Monckton was in the room. It seemed to
smell of his peculiar language.</p>

<p>But the silver fish...There was nothing about the twenty
thousand pounds in the codicil. He was aware that he had skimmed it
through to see that. No doubt technically that might come to him as
residuary legatee. But you could not take money like that. Not such
a large sum. Even if Hugh Monckton had had as strong an urge
towards him as he towards Hugh Monckton...Still, the twenty
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>He picked up the long letter from the bedspread beside him. It
might give some information...</p>

<p>The sobbing was beginning again.</p>

<p>'You may think this damn extraordinary.'...'Uncommon spunky
three-quarter back...Remarked you in O.R...' O.R. meant Orderly
Room. He was running through the large, sprawling writing. It in no
way resembled his own though their signatures were singularly
alike. But men who dash at the body of their writing are often
careful about their signatures.</p>

<p>He gathered Hugh Monckton began by explaining why he had placed
such singular trust in him...Apparently he had been more observed
in the British regiment than he had known...And particularly as
being trustworthy with returns. That had given Hugh Monckton the
idea of entrusting the dispersal of his relics to Henry Martin. He
had been thinking of looking for a man. He had even had the idea of
giving the job to M. Lamoricière. But it would have taken two or
three days to have explained the matter fully to him. And Hugh
Monckton was in a hurry. He said that Henry Martin could not know
what his sufferings were. His mere physical sufferings.</p>

<p>So Henry Martin had appeared to him as a godsend&mdash;a man he knew
to be trustworthy. Exceedingly cultivated! With an immense
knowledge of the world. And wealthy...Then it was not the mad thing
it looked. The only doubtful feature was whether he would take the
job. He might find it a bore. If he did he trusted that he would
place the whole thing in the hands of M. Lamoricière. And pay him
handsomely out of the twenty thousand pounds. Hugh Monckton only
hoped that the French Government would not get too much out of it
in the way of Death Duties...</p>

<p>It was difficult for Henry Martin to keep all these details in
mind. The sobbing had continued; he had pulled one of his bandages
back from over his ear. The sound came from the next room. The one
from which the girl had last night emerged.</p>

<p>The phraseology of Hugh Monckton's letter was not as insular as
his language last night. It was, nevertheless, extraordinarily
redolent of his personality. It seemed to fill the whole, dim room.
And Henry Martin was continually looking up from the letter. As if
to see whether Hugh Monckton was not standing over his grip with
the full light on his face...And suffering.</p>

<p>And wanting what with regard to that girl?...</p>

<p>She was supposed to have slept with him. He gathered that from
what the doctor and Lamoricière had let drop. But he didn't suppose
that she had. As much from her passionate gesture when last night
she had thrown the money back into the room as because Hugh
Monckton had been passionately in love with Gloria Sorenson. If the
girl had slept with him she would no doubt have accepted the money
as her due. The passion in her gesture probably came from the fact
that she considered herself disdained. And after all Hugh Monckton
must have had so many little <i>poules</i> at his disposal that he
could have done very well without her.</p>

<p>Then if the lady were sobbing with financial embarrassment he
supposed that Hugh Monckton would have wanted him to knock at least
on her door and tell her that the money was still at her disposal.
She could now very well accept it...You can take from the dead what
you cannot from the living...</p>

<p>But he wanted to discover if there was any mention of the twenty
thousand pounds in the letter. The night before Hugh Monckton had
talked of letting him have that money to speculate with. At the
time the idea had seemed absurd. Or as if there were some trap in
it. There had been something about the A shares of the Monckton
Company. They were to declare a dividend of a hundred per cent.</p>

<p>It was queer. It was the dear things that were affected by the
crisis. You noticed in Paris that the expensive shops in the rue de
Rivoli had their windows full of placards announcing tremendous
reductions in the price of expensive luxuries. But people clung to
some luxuries. So whilst necessaries and costly things fell in
price and still more in consumption, things like the Monckton Car
and Pisto-Brittle even increased their sales.</p>

<p>He came, in one paragraph, on something about a widow, a Mrs.
Taylor, about whom Hugh Monckton said he was going to talk in a
moment or two. He wanted her provided for...Henry Martin remembered
vaguely that he had actually talked about some widow of a workman
in the Monckton Car Factory...</p>

<p>Henry Martin's heart gave a leap...There was 'twenty thousand
pounds' looking up at him from the sheet of paper...But the passage
only said that if Henry Martin would not accept the distribution of
the trust the expenses of forwarding and M. Lamoricière's costs
were to be paid out of that sum...</p>

<p>The idea of lending Henry Martin the money to speculate with had
then only been an afterthought...That perhaps let him out.</p>

<p>It was nevertheless an enigma...He was in possession of a bit of
secret information. By it he ought easily to make a small fortune.
But unless he took the loan of that money he would not be able to
make anything out of it. And there was not a great deal of time to
be lost. He thought he had till Thursday. It was now Sunday.</p>

<p>That Hugh Monckton wanted him to take it he knew. One of his
most vivid discomfitures was the thought of that fellow standing
beside his car and saying:</p>

<p>'You hadn't ought to have done it, Old Bean.'</p>

<p>He had said that he was going to tune up his car and, from
somewhere under the footboard he had dragged out some spanners and
a pair of enormous gloves. And then he had stood, wavering a
little, silhouetted against the glare of his headlights. They
illuminated half the little port with the boats sleeping and the
front of the Douane, the great white house, sleeping too. He looked
extraordinarily gauntletted. And solitary.</p>

<p>That had been the last time Henry Martin had seen him. Outside
the inn at Carqueiranne, before he had gone up to his room. Last
night...Was it last night or the night before last? It was now a
quarter to two by Hugh Monckton's watch. Was 'last night' the time
up to last midnight&mdash;two hours ago? Or was it the night before the
day before?...It didn't matter. It must have been exactly
twenty-four hours since he had taken leave for good of that poor
fellow. His newest friend...One of his oldest, too. There could not
be many men he had known for sixteen years and who had kept him
himself in mind for as long...As being trustworthy enough to handle
million's worth of knick-knacks!</p>

<p>Gauntletted! So as not to soil his hands!</p>

<p>It was queer to think that a man who was just going to commit
suicide by disfiguring, in the most awful fashion, his features
should care about whether his hands were dirty. But people who were
about to commit suicide did the oddest things. And that poor, dear
fellow...He must have been nearly demented...Intense physical
pain&mdash;and passionate longing that was no good!</p>

<p>He felt himself luxuriate in the strength of his own life. He
was almost without pain as long as he kept still. The bed was
extraordinarily comfortable. It was probably Hugh Monckton's own
property. That is, his, Henry Martin's...</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Damn it, what a swine I am!'</p>

<p>But, in the end, a living dog is worth a dead lion...And he,
Henry Martin was wearing the lion's hide...</p>

<p>What had happened to the other fellow? Was he still lying face
downwards with the light of the great stars filtering through the
pine tops. At least he would not be cold. The night was still and
warm...The great stars of last night and of for ever! Please God,
Hugh Monckton was sailing amongst their tides. And not worrying too
much. At any rate, he, Henry Martin, would see that his Gloria had
her name handed down by that bequest. Of her at least it could be
said:</p>

<p><i>Saltavit et placuit</i>.</p>

<p>And maybe Hugh Monckton's lavishness would secure for her a
measure of immortality. So they need not say: <i>Mortua
est</i>...Alms for oblivion they called it.</p>

<p>The phrase came to him:</p>

<p>'Nothing is here for tears...'</p>

<p>Perhaps there wasn't.</p>

<p>The sobbing had begun again. He was going to do his best to
alleviate that girl's sorrow. He seemed to have adopted Hugh
Monckton's individuality with some thoroughness. Then he must do
what Hugh Monckton would have done. Hugh Monckton must have made
her acquaintance in that selfsame way. He had heard her sobbing
through the night...For the governor of French Cochin something or
other. A Hell of an attractive fellow that governor must have been
to exact such steadfast lachrymosity! But now he could go to her
and tell her that she could quite appropriately accept that sum of
money because it was the bequest of a dead man.</p>

<p>He had one leg out of the bed. The movement, oddly, hurt his jaw
more than a little. He nevertheless persisted, moving the other
under the sheets. He became motionless.</p>

<p>He could not tell the girl the money was from a dead man. He,
the dead man would be alive before her. Here was a dilemma.</p>

<p>His impulse to do something for that girl was, all the same,
very strong. He got as far as the middle of the room, level with
Hugh Monckton's harlequinade grip.</p>

<p>Damn it, he must give up thinking of it as Hugh Monckton's grip.
It was his own grip! These things were all his! Except the
antiquities!</p>

<p>'<i>My</i> grip! <i>My</i> watch! <i>My</i> bed!' Hugh Monckton
would have said: 'Mai kit-bag!'</p>

<p>Damn it, too, if the girl on the other side of the door had
slept with Hugh Monckton she might well be a danger. She would
presumably know him better than even Monsieur Lamoricière or the
hotel people. He circumnavigated the baggage. His legs were
unsteady and his head and the muscles of his neck ached. He held
his bandaged face close to the glass. He was strikingly like that
poor fellow! He tried frowning. The bandages over his brows
remained unmoved and his expression was not changed. He thought if
he displaced his 'h's' he might seem more English. He said:</p>

<p>'Some people as hall the luck, ol' bean!'</p>

<p>But practically no voice came. The crack on the jaw might
account for that. And the bandages. They had the bluish tinge
attributed to the dress of ghosts...Decidedly it would be better
not to come personally in contact with that girl. He could send her
the money by Lamoricière who could no doubt be persuasive enough.
And he would allege himself to be too ill to see her.</p>

<p>Of course Hugh Monckton did not misplace his 'h's.' And the 'ah'
sound in his 'i's' had been hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>Destiny must have watched over that affair with singular
minuteness. Henry Martin imagined that he had no particular accent.
One cannot tell. But no one had ever mimicked him as they would
have if his speech had been at all outrageous. On the other hand in
French he had no doubt a strong American accent just as Hugh
Monckton had a strong English one. The difference was very marked.
Apparently to the French the English accent was what they called
'<i>zézayant</i>'...a little childish and appealing. The American
on the other hand they considered harsh and overbearing. The boat
had been then a good friend to him. He had at first imagined that
those two strokes of her yard had been a sign of enmity. Now he saw
that the one in the temple supplied him with a necessary scar. That
on the jaw gave him an excuse for speaking for quite a time with a
voice that was no voice at all. When his natural voice returned his
French friends would accept the change as being a product of the
accident. As for his English friends Henry Martin would have to
avoid them. Destiny had begun its job very thoroughly: it was
unlikely that that august Force would now spoil the ship for want
of a ha'porth of tar! But it would be better to avoid the girl next
door. Her ululations had an ominous sound: like a dog baying the
moon.</p>

<p class="poem">A dog that howls at his master's gate<br>
Foretells the ruin of the state</p>

<p>Something like that! But he was tired for the moment of Destiny.
He desired to try a little freewill. As if he proposed to take the
bit between his teeth.</p>

<p>There came from the next room a crash: a thud: half a dozen more
crashes and the tinkling of broken glass sliding down. Then moans.
Gradually becoming stifled. Lasting a long time. Then
silence...</p>

<p>You can of course produce a devil of a row in the middle of the
night. With comparatively few effects...But when you have knocked
things over and smashed, say a wash-basin and a tooth glass you
generally start picking them up. Then they clink...</p>

<p>He found that he was hammering on the communicating door...She
couldn't have cut her throat because of the Governor of
Cochin-Saigon. She ought to have gotten over that by now...</p>

<p>He was pressing the button of the bell by the door...The door
giving on to the passage. He was in the passage, ringing at the
same time the bell and shouting. The bell resounded from dark
distances: his shouting was inaudible...There was a horrible
smell...He was not too steady on his legs. But they would
serve.</p>

<p>The smell in the girl's room was atrocious. He dragged her by
the hand along the floor into his own room. Hugh Monckton's. It
<i>had</i> been a basin that had smashed. No doubt as she
staggered. She was lying among parti-coloured fragments. A basin
and a ewer! She must have grabbed them as she fell...Particoloured
herself too. In a Cochin-Chinese bathrobe...Batik they called the
colouring. She was flattened into his floor in a way only the dead
have. And not all of them. Hugh Monckton had not looked flattened.
Rather in what you call high relief.</p>

<p>She wasn't breathing. She was like a little mound of stuffs.</p>

<p>He drew deep breaths. He thanked God for his large lungs and the
cool air that came into them, yet the night was hot. He had held
his nose with his left hand, dragging her with his right. He could
not have lifted her. She had poisoned herself by turning on a gas
jet...She must have held her head over it. And then fallen against
the wash things.</p>

<p>He had closed the door between the two rooms. That ought to have
settled it. Of course it hadn't. The slightest spark and half the
house would be blown to pieces. His head ached and all his limbs.
It hadn't been without damage that he had rolled down that slope.
He wetted a towel in his ewer and covered his nose and mouth. It
was a weary business.</p>

<p>He was back in his room, the gas-tap was turned off. He had not
drawn a single breath. But his head swam. He sat down on the
horsehair sofa. He wondered if, having changed identity with Hugh
Monckton, he had inherited his physical disadvantages. Supposing it
was to be all pain and neither wine nor women! That would be...oh,
poetic vengeance.</p>

<p>He had been sitting with his elbows on his knees and his hands
over his eyes and bandages. He might have been sitting there a long
time. He might have been asleep. As he had been that morning when
the sun had touched the fingers of the stone-pine branch.</p>

<p>The girl's arm which had been over her breast was stretched out.
She lay in the form of a cross.</p>

<p>An impulsion of intense weariness went over him. He would have
to set about reviving her. Of course she was not dead. It was wrong
to imagine that every one in that countryside had the knack of
successful suicide. But apparently those who did it for the sake of
love were more persistent than those who were beggared.</p>

<p>You revive, don't you, those who are suffering from gas
poisoning by the same thing you do for the nearly drowned? To expel
the gas from the lungs! He didn't believe he could do it...</p>

<p>The bell rang in distant darknesses. In the corridor he hammered
on several doors. From behind one came a somnolent man's answer,
but no result...</p>

<p>He was on his knees at the girl's head. He worked her arms up
and down. The small wrists were quite warm. The batik gown, with
the up and down motion divided itself gradually. Her form became
plain. And rather agreeable. The Indo-Something Governor must have
been a connoisseur in night-gowns...No thinner fabric could have
been imagined...</p>

<p>He worked unceasingly. It seemed unceasing! All the sinews of
the back of his neck ached, going down into his shoulders...</p>

<p>Seen from above her unconscious features were very regular. Of
course you cannot tell what a woman is like till you've seen her
eyes...Her figure was extremely symmetrical. The small feet stood
up; bare. Their nails were reddened. Her hair exhaled an agreeable,
oriental odour...She was no doubt a completely uninteresting
<i>poule</i> but the Governor would have seen that she had a good
figure...Governors can be trusted to see to that. And agreeable,
preferably regular, features!</p>

<p>It was no doubt because of his lech for the dark girl that he
found no physical attraction towards this one. Or because of his
physical exhaustion. Or because he was annoyed with her for causing
him the extra fatigue. Or because she was upside down to his
eyes.</p>

<p>But there were white limbs just sheathed and shining...One ought
to feel attraction. Or at least curiosity. Physical attraction was
mostly curiosity of an exploring kind...There must then be
something wrong with him. Perhaps it was poetic vengeance&mdash;no,
Justice! once more. Perhaps like Hugh Monckton he was never again
to know what is called love of woman...What a hope! As Hugh
Monckton said. He himself wasn't mad about women. But that would be
a dumb outlook...Yet he had been hit over the head just as Hugh
Monckton had been. He didn't know how the yard of a boat compared
with a German sabre.</p>

<p class="poem">'...Not as deep as a well or as wide as a church
door. But 'twill serve.'</p>

<p>Why did he have to think of gloomy quotations?</p>

<p>A single large drop of moisture was on the girl's forehead. It
must be his own sweat. He was panting by now. That was perhaps a
direction. Try water. When he rose he reeled right over to one of
the packing cases. The harlequin grip was at his feet...It was
perhaps a sign that brandy was indicated.</p>

<p>He opened it. Just like that!...Without having to pause to think
he had pressed a stud. The jaws of that monstrosity went apart with
a faint sumph like a sigh. It had acknowledged its master's
hand...</p>

<p>He was drinking a minute sip of the <i>fine de la
République</i>....Hugh Monckton had recommended him to finish it
with his girl...</p>

<p>Damnation. Was it possible that he was never to drink again? And
that he was to be impotent?...Or afraid to risk it for the fear of
death? Because of the crack on his skull.</p>

<p>He knelt on one knee beside the girl. He placed the mouth of the
square case bottle to her lips...Any other alcohol would have done
as well. He elevated grudgingly the end of the bottle. She
certainly swallowed.</p>

<p>He lifted up her head with his arm underneath her dark hair. He
pressed his lips on hers...A man must want to explore.</p>

<p>Her arms of course were round his neck. They would be. Her eyes
remained closed but she said distinctly:</p>

<p>'C'est toil' and, 'Ah que je suis contente!'</p>

<p>She must be taking him for the Indo-Something Governor.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Do you think you could stand?' The floor must be very hard.</p>

<p>She was of course going to sleep in his bed. There was no end to
this nuisance. But perhaps, then, he might feel at least some
physical attraction.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>Je croyais que tu t'étais suicidé...à cause de l'autre.'</p>

<p>She thought he had suicided. Because of the other...Then she
must be taking him for Hugh Monckton. Her eyes remained closed: her
head hung back over his arm. They must have made a romantic
picture. He kneeling. Her voice seemed to come from remote
distances of her inner consciousness. It said:</p>

<p>'Pourquoi as tu fermé ta porte à clé?...Alors je me suis décidée
à me tuer...Je te croyais mort derrière le cloi...'</p>

<p>You would have said that she was suffering from the effects of a
narcotic. She could not finish the word which was no doubt
'cloison'...She thought Hugh Monckton had locked the door against
her. Then she had decided to kill herself...</p>

<p>It began at least well. She had taken him for that
fellow...There was no knowing what their relationship had been. But
so far he, Henry Martin, had made a satisfactory substitute. After
all, why shouldn't he?</p>

<p>The clothing had fallen right off her shoulder. Her skin was
brown. Over the armpit it was quite dark. In creases. It was at
least a change from the skin of Alice which was mat white. And
wearisomely unattractive. Some blood showed at least under this
skin...Why did he have to think of Alice?</p>

<p>If he had opened the window in her room he could have taken her
back. She was trying to help him to help her to rise. But
listlessly...But he had not opened the window...</p>

<p>Her eyes opened for a moment. She was on her feet holding her
hand to her hair as if to be sure that it was tidy. Her eyes were
blue-grey. They closed ineffably. She said:</p>

<p>'Pardon que je t'ai tutoyé...Je vous aime tant.'</p>

<p>She was asking for forgiveness for having said 'thou' to him. As
you do to children or your lover. Then she had said: 'I love
<i>you</i> so much.' It proved she had a tidy mind to think of that
at that moment...Then Hugh Monckton had only been kind to her. As
he would have been to any stray.</p>

<p>He was getting his breath to make the formidable journey to the
bed. He supposed it did not matter to these girls where they slept.
She exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Vous...si fort...si courageux...si généreux...'</p>

<p>He was going to have some job to live up to that fellow. Well,
he would tackle it. He would be strong: courageous: generous! Why
not? He owed it to Hugh Monckton.</p>

<p>She sat crumpled together on the side of the bed and took off
her batik covering. There was nothing to her. She was smaller than
Alice. She had an oval face and the slightest moustache. Like any
other girl of that country where they descend from the Phoenicians
or God knew what race. She said drowsily:</p>

<p>'Vous savez je vous ai jeté l'argent dans le visage parce que
vous m'aviez ignorée...mais main...' and collapsed sideways on the
pillow...</p>

<p><i>That</i> difficulty had solved itself. Those eight thousand
francs were disposed of. She had thrown them at Hugh Monckton the
other evening because till then he had ignored her...Her charms
presumably. But now apparently she could take it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-4" id="ch3-4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>The dark girl was sitting in a round-backed arm-chair just on
the other side of the night table. She was reading the <i>New York
Herald</i>. On his shoulder Henry Martin felt the breath of the
ex-lady of the governor of Cochin-Something. It was exceedingly
still in the room. The eight thousand francs lay on the night
table. The dark girl was wearing his ring on her wedding
finger.</p>

<p>She had broad shoulders, high breasts. A green jewel showed on
the lace insertion of her black dress. It went up and down as she
breathed. The clock ticked.</p>

<p>Her dark eyebrows and her high colour expressed a capability of
anger. Of passion. When she touched the hair just above her ear
with her ring hand he felt extraordinary pleasure.</p>

<p>She looked at him and said:</p>

<p>'Is there no end to human madness? Surely the gods intend the
destruction of humanity...' She added. 'But why should they destroy
us who are sane?' She tapped the newspaper as if some paragraph in
it had aroused her animosity. She looked extraordinarily sane. He
almost regretted that she had spoken.</p>

<p>He said: 'You read English?'</p>

<p>She exclaimed:</p>

<p>'You need not whisper. The opiate I gave <i>la petite</i> should
keep her doped for an hour or two yet.'</p>

<p>He had indeed whispered: he did not know whether it was because
his jaw had been fractured or because the injury had affected the
muscles of his throat. She lowered her newspaper and crossed her
legs.</p>

<p>'La petite tried to suicide?' she asked. 'She said that she
would. So I gave her that heavy opiate. Under the pretext that it
would drown any pain.'</p>

<p>That was evidently what had happened. He might have gathered
from the girl's voluptuous drooping, that she had been doped, not
poisoned by gas which was probably disagreeable. She had looked
like an enraptured flower.</p>

<p>'It is amusing,' the dark girl said, 'all these failures to
suicide...And indeed suicides! For that other <i>pauvre</i> has
succeeded. And a man at la Cressonade has killed himself and his
mistress and three children.'</p>

<p>She added, in English:</p>

<p>'It was good dope that. My boy friend gave it to me. In case I
should be sleepless in the cells.' And then in French: 'But I
supported all that with equanimity.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin whispered:</p>

<p>'Another has suicided?'</p>

<p>'Encore un Smeez,' she answered. 'Another Smith. A New Yorker. I
saw you with him, night before last. I too am a New Yorker. I shall
attend his obsequies. He was down and out.'</p>

<p>She counted on her fingers:</p>

<p>'Two Smiths. Mademoiselle Becquerel. The man at la Cressonade.
He was called Amontillado or something like that. From Genoa. And
four he killed.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Becquerel?'</p>

<p>She answered:</p>

<p>'The participatrix of Monsieur's couch is Mademoiselle Jeanne
Becquerel.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin managed to get out: 'Virginie!' rather louder. In
alarm! Hugh Monckton's note had said: 'Virginie.' The eight
thousand francs were to be given to Miss Virginie. If he had given
them to a Miss Jeanne he would have to make it up himself.</p>

<p>The girl said indifferently:</p>

<p>'Jeanne&mdash;Virginie. Virginie-Jeanne. It is all one. That nasty
fellow called her Virginie so I call her Jeanne ever since though I
called her Virginie before...' She added in English. 'He was the
sort of quarter-tipper that would call her Virginie. I bet he never
tipped a cloakroom girl more than a quarter in a speakeasy.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin whispered:</p>

<p>'He at least was not a New Yorker!' He imagined she was talking
of the ex-Governor.</p>

<p>'No, sir! II est un sale Moco...et un sale monsieur...' A Moco
was a local inhabitant. 'But if Jeanne's mother had not sufficient
sense to see that she had a reasonable settlement when she became
his <i>maîtresse en tître</i> I don't see why he should make up the
deficiency...</p>

<p>He asked:</p>

<p>'She was very hard up?'</p>

<p>'She was in the cart,' the girl answered. 'Dans la misere meme.
And she had not the spirit to go out and do the requisite. She
could no doubt have got a speculative lawyer to make that sorry
fellow cough up. It was I who handed her all her food through the
door. Except her <i>petit déjeuner</i> which is provided by the
hotel. And that comes to an end to-morrow.'</p>

<p>She added.</p>

<p>'There were days when she would not open to me, myself...The
truth was, I imagine that she loved that monsieur! She would not
hock the jewels he had given her.' She added again...'We are like
that, we others...A ring, a necklace, becomes sacred. More fools
we.'</p>

<p>A waiter in his shirt sleeves with a yellow-striped waistcoat
and a face like that of a stupid racoon came in with two round
trays on his left arm.</p>

<p>The girl said:</p>

<p>'You can put Mademoiselle's coffee on the divan. She will not
wake yet. I will heat it over the gas when she does.'</p>

<p>The waiter put the tray on the night table, having first taken
up the notes. He laid them on the <i>croissants</i>. He said they
had made Monsieur some gruel in case his jaws would not work. If he
did not eat the <i>croissants</i> they would be allowed for in the
account.</p>

<p>He took up his station behind the curving mahogany foot of the
bed and looked without interest at the face of the girl on Henry
Martin's shoulder. He had a short lock of darkish hair that fell
over in front of his eyes. He said nonchalantly that an emissary of
the <i>commissaire de police</i> was waiting to know when it would
be convenient for monsieur to receive him.</p>

<p>The personality of the dark girl had so overwhelmed Henry Martin
that he had not begun to put two and two together. He had not got
over the improbability of the dark girl's being a New Yorker. His
brain was probably not working very fast because of the opiate he
had had the night before...But he feared the French police.</p>

<p>The waiter said:</p>

<p>'It is because you were the last man, probably, to see that poor
mad man alive. He sprang out of a boat in the storm and tried to
murder Marius Guiol and Marius of the Reserve. He threatened them
with a revolver. Then he shot himself under their eyes. There was a
third man too.'</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'They say he demanded their money. But no one believes it. They
are a couple of fat Mariuses.'</p>

<p>She said in English:</p>

<p>'You best see the Commissaire at once. Then they will close the
<i>enquête</i> very quickly. There are seventeen <i>enquêtes</i>
to-day. On seventeen poor drowned ones of the cyclone...If you put
it off...Well, the police like to make <i>ennuis</i> for
millionaires. It pleases the democracy. And they will have more
leisure later on. See him at once.'</p>

<p>The waiter said:</p>

<p>'It appears that monsieur was the last man to see him alive. He
was the monsieur that monsieur brought in with him the night before
last. I have recognized the body. There is no mistaking it, though
the face is much iniured.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin felt as if at every minute he was being handed
banknotes. This was a product of crowd madness....He imagined that
the two Mariuses even believed their story. They might even have
<i>seen</i> a revolver when he had sprung out of the boat. One of
them would have invented that fire-arm. The other would have
contagiously believed it. Then he would have communicated the
contagion to the first and the two of them would have infected the
third...They would say they had run up the path after him. He had
seen them creep. They were the fat Mariuses of the Marseilles
district. Incredible boasters and liars. To the extent that they
were capable of believing themselves. With truthful
asseverations...So much the better...</p>

<p>What worried him was the dark girl. She became more desirable
with every flash of her teeth. They flashed when she smiled and her
lips, drawing up, showed them when she spoke viciously. She had
only smiled once. She was more given to denunciations...He wanted
to live with a woman who denounced people. It would be like a
tonic. A woman like a tonic was what he needed...</p>

<p>He had two thousand dollars. Certain. Would that keep them
for...Six months? Two? One? It would depend on what her scale of
extravagance was...One month might not be enough to exhaust
his...his curiosity as to her. Perhaps not two. Perhaps not
six...Even eighteen months might not be sufficient. Usually a skill
at denunciations grew tiring after eighteen months or less...</p>

<p>But how was he to provide for eighteen months...There were the
twentv thousand pound notes. He had been thinking about whether he
could make use of them. He imagined he had thought that matter out
but he could not remember what he had decided.</p>

<p>Half a policeman was in the room. He wore a great cloak in spite
of the stifling weather. He had a pink and white face like those of
the waxen dummies in the cheaper tailors on Main Street. He said
nothing. He held a slip of paper.</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Monsieur will see Coco at once.'</p>

<p>She said to Henry Martin:</p>

<p>'They call that guy Coco...No not this guy...The
Commissaire.'</p>

<p>The policeman removed his cap and with stiff swaying came to
lean over the foot of the bed alongside the waiter. He stared down
with expressionless and glassy eyes at the face of the girl on
Henry Martin's shoulder. It irritated Henry Martin that he could
not see her face. He would have disturbed her if he moved.</p>

<p>The policeman cleared his throat. He must have been very husky
indeed before. It occurred to Henry Martin that the ex-mistress of
the ex-Governor&mdash;particularly if he was a local man!-must be more
of an object of curiosity to these people than himself...Than Hugh
Monckton that was to say. He felt a pang of jealousy. If you have
exchanged identities with one of the great rich in the world you
ought to excite curiosity!</p>

<p>The policeman said to the waiter:</p>

<p>'Apparently she is not for the Red Light quarter this
journey.'</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Sale flic,' and put out the end of her tongue at the
policeman.</p>

<p>Henry Martin thought that if you said 'Sale flic,' to a French
policeman he immediately clubbed you. This policeman merely
laughed, leaning back and catching his thumbs in his belt.</p>

<p>The girl beside Henry Martin suddenly sat up. She wiped the
sleep from both eyes and, in the same gesture, leaning across his
chest, she took the sheaf of notes from the bedside tray and waved
them towards the dark girl.</p>

<p>'These are mine,' she said, 'Eudoxie, do you see? I have earned
these!' She lay down again and went to sleep.</p>

<p>It appeared that the dark girl's name was Eudoxie...Eudoxia! It
seemed to be a name for rather majestic women...</p>

<p>The policeman was leaning back on his heels and, with his face
towards the ceiling was roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>'I will tell you,' he exclaimed, 'where for fifteen...'</p>

<p>The dark girl might have moments when she was majestic. At the
moment she was not being so. She had caught a pair of scissors from
the table beside her and held them as if they had been a
dagger.</p>

<p>'Dare to say it!' she exclaimed, 'and you shall see your eyes
lying on this table top.' She threw the scissors down. 'Besides,'
she said, 'I shall report you to Coco. You are a disgrace to my
family.'</p>

<p>She could certainly appear disdainful.</p>

<p>The policeman and the waiter were again regarding the girl
beside Henry Martin with a serious attention that might never have
been interrupted.</p>

<p>'After all,' the waiter said, 'one does not see every day one
who in a single night can earn francs by the thousand!'</p>

<p>The policeman said:</p>

<p>'In a single night!' with an awestruck expression. 'I thought it
was in eight.'</p>

<p>'I tell you, in one,' the waiter said. 'Should I not know? I,
Marius Paline!'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was tranquilly in the room. He seemed to be more
in black than ever. He had brought the aged <i>patronne</i> with
him. Or perhaps the <i>patronne</i> had introduced him.</p>

<p>He removed his black glasses, looked at Mademoiselle Jeanne
Becquerel as if with satisfaction and said:</p>

<p>'I hope you had a good night...I took the liberty of locking the
communication door as there were so many valuable objects lying
about.'</p>

<p>'That was thoughtful,' Henry Martin said. As soon as they saw
his lips move everyone in the room became as still as a mouse. 'But
it was quite unnecessary.'</p>

<p>He intended that to give pleasure to the dark girl.</p>

<p>The <i>patronne</i> whose small black person was hidden from
Henry Martin by the waiter and the policeman brought out
shrilly:</p>

<p>'Indeed it is quite unnecessary to lock doors in this hotel. I
accept none but impeccable clients. You, at least, Marius, will say
that there has never been a robbery in this hotel.'</p>

<p>She was addressing the policeman, not the waiter, for the
policeman turned to face her.</p>

<p>'Not,' he said jovially, 'not since the German poet was robbed
by the two women.'</p>

<p>The <i>patronne</i> protested more and more shrilly. That
gentleman had been a German. And a poet. And he had introduced the
two women into the hotel. You cannot refuse a poet. And if he
brings women with him...</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was introducing a very sleek, very tall dark
gentleman who had a scarlet button in his nosegay buttonhole and
who introduced himself sideways, thrusting his left shoulder
forward as if he had the habit of penetrating crowds.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'My good friend, M. Eugene Gaudin of the police.'</p>

<p>The dark girl raised her eyebrows and said:</p>

<p>'Bon jour, Coco.' Mademoiselle Jeanne Becquerel sat up in bed
beside Henry Martin. She occupied herself with arranging her
hair.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière waved a formal white hand:</p>

<p>'My distinguished friend Monsieur Ash Emma Smeez!'</p>

<p>The sleek gentleman spoke with such rapidity that Henry Martin
had difficulty in following him. M. Lamoricière was also saying
that Henry Martin was one of the heroes who saved our dear France.
Henry Martin nevertheless gathered that the tall, sleek man desired
to see Henry Martin's papers and to know what he knew of the
deceased. His heart beat heavily. But he was unconscious of fear.
M. Lamoricière picked up the passport that remained on the table
where he had dropped it the night before. The police official
snatched the passport, read out 'Asch Em Ah Smeez. Correct,' coldly
and with immense speed. 'Tiens! The initials are the same as those
of the deceased!' He glanced at the inside of the passport: at
Henry Martin imperiously. He said: 'Likeness sufficient,' and threw
the passport back on the table. 'Passport No. 374,875. Last renewed
in London, June 30th, 1930...You last saw the deceased?'</p>

<p>He fixed Henry Martin with his imperious dark eyes. He had been
dictating to a little dark fellow who had a note book and was half
hidden by the other.</p>

<p>Henry Martin whispered as well as he could for the beating of
his heart.</p>

<p>'Last night...No the night before last.'</p>

<p>It was ridiculous of his heart to beat perceptibly. There was no
danger. His heart made noises in his dry throat.</p>

<p>He was made to say the deceased had been in the same regiment
with himself. Was distinguished for trustworthiness. And valour.
Had many decorations. More than himself. Certainly more than
himself...</p>

<p>The statements were coming out of him like contrary happenings
in a delirium...But they were all true.</p>

<p>The Commissaire said:</p>

<p>'Yet he was American...Well there were some good Americans.'</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Be careful what you say, Coco. Je suis New Yorkaise!'</p>

<p>The Commissaire said:</p>

<p>'Well we know it!' With his eyes firmly on Henry Martin. 'Did he
beg money of you?' Did he seem outrageous? Were you aware that he
was ruined? Did he appear poor?...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'On the contrary.' Far from demanding money he had paid Hugh
Monckton's bill...</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'That is true. I saw it. Monsieur, here, went across the
<i>dancing</i> to ask him.'</p>

<p>The Commissaire said:</p>

<p>'Trust you to see things, Yu-Yu!...Did the deceased appear
disturbed?...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said: 'He appeared perfectly calm. He was perfectly
well dressed. I understood that he was a very rich man...'</p>

<p>It was confusing. He could not collect whether he was speaking
well of Hugh Monckton or of himself...It would be inappropriate to
speak well of himself. But that poor fellow. He said urgently:</p>

<p>'Could you not give him a military funeral? He deserved it. He
was immensely brave. And suffered terribly. For France.'</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'He was a splendid fellow. I would rather have had him penniless
for a lover than any man here. He appeared calmer than any man
here. He came across and spoke to me. About the Antibes youth who
danced and gave pleasure. He gave me this ring! To be sure that
gave pleasure. And in an hour he was dead.'</p>

<p>'You are always romancing, Yu-Yu,' the Commissaire said.</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Yes, yes...he gave her the ring...I saw it.'</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, pleased glance. He forgot what he had to
say.</p>

<p>The Commissaire said:</p>

<p>'That closes the <i>enquéte</i>...That is characteristically
American. He gives his ring to a chance woman, lends his last
<i>sou</i> to a friend. And suicides. It is convincing. The two fat
Mariuses were lying. It is a banal affair. A ruined man suicides. A
product of the crisis&mdash;<i>Voilà tout!</i>'</p>

<p>The little black man snapped his notebook to. The
Commissaire-adjoint was edging away.</p>

<p>'A military funeral...Military music, at least.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin's voice was apparently audible to all the room. The
Commissaire shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'For that,' he said, 'you should apply to the municipality. And
it is not militarist here!' He added: 'Besides funeral processions
are not popular with the police. There are too many of them. Every
dead grocer has a procession a mile long. Walking. It causes great
anxiety to the traffic policemen. They also have to be considered.
Their tasks are already sufficiently onerous.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin found himself to be desperately anxious that Hugh
Monckton's body should not be treated as if it were his own. He
would have been thrown into any kind of ditch. But this was a
splendid, fortunate youth. He must not be treated as if he were a
down and outer...</p>

<p>'Something must be done about it. Can you not feel that?'</p>

<p>He had a sense of extreme loneliness. Everyone of these faces
was blank. As if they could not see why a pauper who had shot
himself should need an expensive funeral. At home&mdash;whatever could
be said against them!&mdash;they would understand that a hero had earned
a funeral march. Only the dark girl looked at him sympathetically.
She had said she was a New Yorker.</p>

<p>He exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I will provide all the expenses. I will conduct the obsequies
myself...</p>

<p>The thought of Hugh Monckton&mdash;his image, his dark and outraged
soul seemed to brood above that appalled and stupid multitude. More
people were coming in.</p>

<p>An energetic voice said:</p>

<p>'You will do nothing of the sort while you are my patient.'</p>

<p>It added:</p>

<p>'What is this?...The <i>lever</i> of the King and Queen?...Just
because monsieur is a King of finance...Is this the eighteenth
century?'</p>

<p>At each of his barking questions an individual left the room.
The French may be hail fellow well met with a policeman. Or they
sink into the ground before him. According to his mood or the
occasion. But before the doctor they all tremble. Always! And he
addressed them as if they were mean church robbers of deficient
intellect. They were alone with Lamoricière and the two girls. The
doctor towered over him as a chef above the joint on which he is
about to operate. Beside him sat Mademoiselle Jeanne. She was still
doing her hair. She had procured a comb and a hand-mirror.
Presumably the dark girl had passed them to her.</p>

<p>The doctor said to the dark girl that he wanted towels. Two
towels. And clean!</p>

<p>It was the first time she had stood up. So it was the first time
he had seen her on her feet. She was tall. And erect!</p>

<p>The doctor had several nickel instruments. He said:</p>

<p>'It would be better if Madame got up. The hour is presumably
sufficiently advanced!' The girl laid her comb and mirror on Henry
Martin's chest. The decolletage of her nightgown was almost
excessive. It was perhaps as well that it was long. She threw back
the bedclothes and stepped over Henry Martin's legs, sliding to the
ground. He did not understand why he should feel a proprietary
interest in her. The dark girl drew the nightgown down as she slid
to the ground.</p>

<p>'La petite is used to the tropics,' she said to M.
Lamoricière.</p>

<p>'We are all used to the tropics,' M. Lamoricière said. He was
like a perpetual undertaker at a feast but his manner was
approving.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his large, white finger at Mademoiselle
Becquerel. She was draping her butterfly-robe about her. She made a
little grimace at him. She tenderly embraced the dark girl. They
whispered. Beside the dark girl the other was mouse-coloured.</p>

<p>Henry Martin supposed that these amenities attended on the lives
of European millionaires. But he had anxieties at the back of his
skull. Perhaps because he was not to the manner born.</p>

<p>The dark girl said, after a whisper of the other.</p>

<p>'He saved your life then. That was chic. He is a chic
personage.'</p>

<p>The other whispered.</p>

<p>'And courageous! And generous! And handsome!' the dark girl
repeated aloud for her.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'Surely monsieur is all these?'</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'If these ladies would assume the functions of modern nurses
instead of that of the chorus of the ancient Greek Theatre! I
should have thought M. Lamoricière would have had more sense!'</p>

<p>The dark girl answered:</p>

<p>'It is true we are like a Greek Chorus. Strophe and
anti-Strophe. But it should not be disagreeable to you, Monsieur le
docteur Grouault!'</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'I did not say it was disagreeable to me. But duty combines ill
with pleasure. Put a towel on the pillow to receive the face of
Monsieur. Madame will relieve him of the jacket of his pyjamas. He
will lay himself on his face. I must examine his back.'</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton's pyjamas were of a vivid dark green silk. On
either breast was a Japanese embroidered stork. The silk was very
heavy. The dark girl approved of them. But his skin? It was eroded
and bruised and no doubt covered with dark cup-marks...</p>

<p>He said to the other:</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle is not very acquainted...intimate!'</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'It will do her no harm to see an admirable torso.'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'It is true. Monsieur has the figure of a Greek athlete.'</p>

<p>He was stripped to the waist and made to lie with his face in
the towel that was on the pillow. He wondered why the doctor wanted
the towel on the pillow. But it was restful. On his back the doctor
hammered. He pressed to it his ear and his heavy head. He addressed
himself obviously to Mademoiselle Becquerel.</p>

<p>'Madame,' he said, 'Monsieur has admirable lungs. His liver is
completely sound...What I don't understand...'</p>

<p>He clasped something round Henry Martin's upper arm. There was a
noise as of pumping a bicycle and the pressure increased.</p>

<p>It was agreeable lying there and having your physical fitness
recounted item by item to the dark girl. The doctor spoke to the
other but the dark girl heard. Both girls tittered now and then.
Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'What did I tell you? A Greek athlete. Of the type that saved
the world at Marathon. And two thousand years later, our dear
France.' He lowered his voice to say:</p>

<p>'Mes félicitations!' He was no doubt addressing the girl who
slept in Henry Martin's bed...He imagined that sympathetic
Lamoricière, like half that city, had been concerned over the fate
of the ex-mistress of the ex-governor. They all undoubtedly knew
that she was shut up in the room, grief-stricken, refusing to
emerge, having her meals handed through the crack of the door by
the dark girl. No doubt they informed themselves from day to day as
to her progress. Some would be of the opinion that she would commit
suicide; others that she would die of grief. The less kindly would
call it all comedy...Now, because she had passed the night beside
Henry Martin, the kindly Lamoricière offered her his felicitations.
He imagined her again, <i>casée</i>. And with the perfect male
animal...Well, she had eight thousand francs. A girl alone can live
a long time on eight thousand francs. For long enough to recover
herself. And to form new connections...</p>

<p>He wondered vaguely as to the class of such a girl. She was
delicate-limbed, dainty in person. She spoke French beautifully.
Her voice was precise. He had discovered no trace of coarseness
about her. Yet she sat with complete unconcern in a strange man's
bed. Under the eyes of quite a crowd and exposed her limbs with as
much unconcern as if she had been alone in her own room. That was
the product, obviously, of some brand of purity. Or at any rate of
innocent fearlessness. And all the others accepted her. Apparently
at her own price. He had been towards her in a proprietary position
of sorts. He accepted as much responsibility for her as he would
have done if, say, he had invited her to dinner at a good
restaurant. He had felt very little embarrassment and no anger at
all. Yet if Alice exposed herself in the slightest he had always
felt deep&mdash;as it were fundamental!&mdash;anger. And she had had a sort
of passion for adopting lascivious attitudes and exposing her legs
in company. Whenever she was at all lit. And your real nature came
out when you were lit!...</p>

<p>The girl at any rate came of a better race, with a better
tradition and training. Alice no doubt took after her German
forbears. She had a natural coarseness and desire to display that
the appropriate male would have suppressed with a club. But she had
been born into a society where clubs were no longer used. That must
be it.</p>

<p>Yes, this girl was a step upwards...</p>

<p>It annoyed him that again he should be comparing her to Alice.
It was hardly fair to her. She also was no doubt careful of money.
She had grabbed those eight notes. As Alice would have done if they
had been lying about. But she had put them down again. She was a
sufficient judge of men to know that they were safely hers. Alice
would have thrust them into her bosom...Displaying her bosom to do
it!</p>

<p>Indeed this girl had apparently only held them for a moment to
display them to the dark girl. In sign of a victory...Over Hugh
Monckton's resistance to her charms. No doubt they had discussed
the matter for a long time. Perhaps after she had thrown the notes
back at Hugh Monckton. She would have told the dark girl about it
and Eudoxie would have told her she was a fool not to keep the
money. Then she must have boasted that she would earn it. Or
die!...That was good enough.</p>

<p>She had neither earned it nor died&mdash;if the earning it meant that
she was to arouse sentiments of desire in Hugh Monckton! Or in
himself who was in possession of the other's identity. But she had
at least come into all the apparent right to be regarded as
the...oh, they call it <i>maîtresse en tître</i>&mdash;of the man who
was in possession of Hugh Monckton's identity. She had attempted a
gallant gesture and, to all appearances, had succeeded. She had
every right to triumph. Good for her!</p>

<p>As compared with Alice's acquisition of himself it was a dashing
affair. Very similar but more ingratiating. Alice had got him by
lumpishly exhibiting herself to the eyes of father&mdash;who, compared
to these others, was only an obstinate Luxemburg-Ohio peasant. But
this girl had done the same thing with prayer and fasting and at
the cannon's mouth...Over a gas ring which, being of shorter range,
is more deadly!</p>

<p>He was smiling. He had not expected to smile into his pillow. He
had expected all this to be an affair of anxieties. It hadn't been.
Destiny had indeed done the thing in style. Or he had selected the
occasion well!</p>

<p>If you wanted to attempt suicide with subsequent change of
identity where else could you select better to do it than that
landscape of stone pines and illusions? It was there inevitable
that fat men should see a revolver in your hand. It was a country
to keep pace with which you had to boast of your unflinching
courage. Those fat Mariuses had to have faced revolver muzzles
without paling. So they had to invent the revolver. Old Marius
Vial's special line of boating was <i>trombios</i>, water-spouts,
and incredible catches of fish due to his wisdom. He would never
have invented a revolver. Yet, in those parts you were safe to find
someone who would.</p>

<p>And indeed in those parts you were safe to find classically
featured dark girls beautiful enough to make you cross a room and
present them with rings...That was the entrance into siren-land,
that region. You were safe to find a siren there. As well as a
<i>poule</i> with a cold.</p>

<p>The dark girl's bit of evidence had come in very handy. Her
assertion that he&mdash;Henry Martin&mdash;had that night been perfectly calm
had undoubtedly saved him&mdash;Hugh Monckton!&mdash;at least a good deal of
cross examination by the commissaire. It had settled it that the
<i>enquête</i> would be closed then and there.</p>

<p>The exact spot: the exact climate! Without that white sunlight
wouldn't Lamoricière have been able to do without black spectacles
and so to have recognized that there were certain differences
between the down-and-out American who had asked him for a job and
the corpse of the Englishman in the mortuary? And the hotel
waiter...In that land of dreams and islands he must have dreamed
the identity of that corpse with the monsieur who had visited Hugh
Monckton the night before last. For he had pulled the cordon in his
sleep when he had admitted them. And he had been fast asleep with
his face to the back of the sofa in the hall when they had passed
him on their way upstairs! Yet he had sworn that he recognized the
corpse as Hugh Monckton's friend! Illusions! Dreams! The desire to
be of assistance or to be in at the death to the wonder of the
crowd!</p>

<p>He might well smile. There he was, face down on a bed instead of
face upwards drifting over the Mediterranean ooze with its
<i>oursins</i> and sea-flowers and foliage...And wasn't it a
refutation of the Catholic's denial of perfectibility? Or even of
progress?</p>

<p>There he was, rather ludicrously, in something of the same
situation as had been his a year or so ago...In apparent possession
of a woman who in no way interested him whilst another woman&mdash;who
might, he had thought, have been the making of him was not his! But
he had progressed.</p>

<p>If his available money were merely fifty thousand francs&mdash;with
whatever additions the residuary legateeship of Hugh Monckton's
possessions might bring in&mdash;it was more than he had possessed very
lately. And if Mademoiselle Jeanne Becquerel did not interest him
very much she was at least an <i>article de vertu</i>&mdash;a Dresden
shepherdess!&mdash;as compared with Alice Heinz.</p>

<p>And the dark girl was certainly an improvement on Mrs. Percival.
On the Considine girl. Even on Wanda. She at least was alive. They
were shadows. And he himself, now that he was awakened&mdash;was as you
might say enlightened&mdash;he did not mean to let himself get into any
false position again. It was all very well for Lamoricière and the
rest to imagine that he was in the possession of Mademoiselle
Jeanne Becquerel. He wasn't and did not intend to be.</p>

<p>With age a man did make a certain progress. In his worldly
circumstances and wisdom. He must gain in powers of selection and
determination to get what he wanted. He himself was no longer a
chicken. And he had now a second start.</p>

<p><br>
Eudoxie was the centre of that group of three. Mademoiselle
Becquerel was seated on the arm of her chair and had her right arm
over the back behind Eudoxie's head. Her left hand fondled the
other's right. Mr. Lamoricière stood behind the two at a little
distance. They were talking of the late storm with its seventeen
drowned in the <i>port extérieur</i>.</p>

<p>The doctor had turned him over and was continuing his meticulous
and impatient investigation. It was as if his indignation increased
with each progress he made over an organ. He said, as if
contemptuously:</p>

<p>'Well, and now the bandages...Your blood pressure is
disgustingly normal considering the life you lead.'</p>

<p>The others were talking in low, audible voices. Henry Martin
wondered if he ought not to protect Hugh Monckton from the
imputation of having led an outrageous life...</p>

<p>But the dark girl held the floor. M. Lamoricière had been in
church. The other girl had of course been shut up in that room. M.
Lamoricière had only been soaked to the skin. Between the corner of
the rue Émile Zola and the cathedral door. The sheet&mdash;of
rain&mdash;had fallen on to him at the corner of the rue Émile
Zola. Without a premonitory drop. In the next room there it had
grown as dark as night. Jeanne Becquerel had been going through her
papers. She could not distinguish them. Then she had observed that
the surface of the <i>rade</i> was like a gigantic nutmeg grater,
the flat steel-grey water thrashed into agony by the rain.</p>

<p>But Eudoxie had seen the storm. She had been out in it. To her
they had to listen.</p>

<p>She had been walking on the Ghemin des Contrebandiers&mdash;the path
that leads half way up the cliff when there is a cliff or on the
shore when there is none, all the way along the indentations of
that land. From the Spanish border to Italy! Whenever she was on
that path she wondered what it would be like to travel it all over.
Some called it the Chemin des Douaniers. It was a matter of taste.
Those who were in favour of law and order called it the customs
officers' path. The others named it after smugglers. For herself,
she was among the others. No doubt both the <i>douaniers</i> and
the <i>contrebandiers</i> used it when they needed it.</p>

<p>Well, she had been going along that path. As she did every
Sunday. To go to Mass with Aunt Veronique. At Ste. Agathe. They
knew her custom. The other two said: 'Yes! Yes!...But yes!'</p>

<p>She had, naturally, witnessed Henry Martin's struggle with the
waves. In common with several hundred others. The half of the
city's population that did not go out on the waters, went, on a
Sunday morning, along the Chemin des Douaniers. Henry Martin had
seen the Crowds, dressed in white, running for shelter. As he had
gone round.</p>

<p>She had been round a corner. Under Les Jarres. So she had not
for the moment seen the storm in the sky. But she had seen the
leadenness of the atmosphere. And three white triangles going
suddenly flat down. And a large launch with a red sail, going
about. With the red sail streaming out.</p>

<p>That had been when Henry Martin had let the sheet go...</p>

<p>The doctor said irritably:</p>

<p>'Why are you panting?...What are your sensations?'</p>

<p>The dark girl went on:</p>

<p>'It may possibly have been the embarkation of the poor deceased.
But that would be too romantic. Considering how, as I have told
you, the night before I would willingly have become his
mistress...And I do not become the mistress, as they say in the
United States, of the first guy to hit the sidewalk...le premier
venu.'</p>

<p>The other two said simultaneously:</p>

<p>'But assuredly not, Eudoxie!' And Mademoiselle Becquerel:</p>

<p>'It takes for you the beginning of a true passion.'</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Voilà!' As if she were accepting a deserved tribute.</p>

<p>She had got to the top of the crag under Les Jarres. Then she
had understood.</p>

<p>'It was not, my children, my first trombe. Nor my tenth!' She
had been out with her cousin, the police sergeant that had lately
been in the room. In the great storm of 1924. So she knew...'I
called to that man in the launch with the red sail: "Come in here.
You can land in the lee of the rock here. Before it strikes
you."...And, if it had been he, there would have been the romantic
situation for you! Me with his ring on my finger and his picture in
my heart. Calling: "Vous serez à l'abri, ici," "Vous serez à
l'abri, ici"...You will be in shelter here! You will be in shelter
here! "As if on my breast." 5 She added: 'But it was probably not
to be. The boat of Marius Vial at Carqueiranne has, it is true, a
red sail...But they all have red sails...A hundred...' She had
taken off her <i>fichu</i>. And waved...like Isolde!</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'Like one of the sirens...No one can say we have no sirens in
our cerulean waters whilst we have our Eudoxie.'</p>

<p>She exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Like Circe, then. Not just any old siren...La première venue
des syrènes.'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière laid his hand over his heart and bowed.</p>

<p>'You at least, Madame,' he said, 'never turned man into a
beast.'</p>

<p>She reflected a moment and said:</p>

<p>'No, I believe I never did...Still it was probably not he.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin found that he was writhing on his pillow. White
lint was flashing before his eyes. The doctor was undoing his
bandages. He was trying to push the lint away. And he was
exclaiming: 'C'était...C'était...' 'It was...It was...' He was
trying to tell the dark girl that it had been Henry Martin in the
boat.</p>

<p>He didn't care. It was perhaps dangerous. They might ask him how
he knew. They had heard everything that had been told him about the
suicide...And he did not care. He had harmed no one. He wanted to
establish that relationship with her. To show her that Destiny had
intervened!</p>

<p>This was all getting into a tangle...If the dark girl really
felt a tenderness for the dead man...Then...</p>

<p>The doctor said harshly:</p>

<p>'I do not believe you are a Mons hero...You writhe like a baby
at the undoing of a bandage...You said just now: "It was...It
was..." What was it? A little stab of pain...I swear I have caused
you no pain...All you pampered people...'</p>

<p>He must be a fierce democrat.</p>

<p>Henry Martin's features felt naked. And stiff. All the bandages
were off and he had to shade his eyes from the light.</p>

<p>The doctor called to the others:</p>

<p>'Come here and look at a hero.'</p>

<p>The doctor had put on gold-rimmed pince-nez to examine the
wounds. His yellow-foam coloured hair was rumpled as he passed his
fingers through it with invitation. His little, white naval beard
bristled.</p>

<p>'This is an incomprehensible and vexing case,' he said. 'I, as
you know, was on Admiral Sénè's flagship and escaped only by the
intervention of God!...So I have seen the seriously wounded...I
have also...'</p>

<p>The dark girl's brows had come down into a straight line. All
their eyes gazed at him. It was perhaps the crucial test.</p>

<p>The doctor continued:</p>

<p>'I have also, God knows, attended on drunkards and idle
wastrels...This gentleman was till four yesterday morning...it was
yesterday morning, was it not?...till four yesterday morning drunk.
At Hyères. Writing letters furiously. In spite of the remonstrances
of the waiter...'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Becquerel said:</p>

<p>'It was because of that then that your room was empty.'</p>

<p>She was across his chest, her arms around his head. She kissed
the wound on his temple. She said:</p>

<p>'Why did you absent yourself?...I thought...'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière laid his hand over his heart.</p>

<p>'It is thus, fittingly,' he said, 'that beauty heals the scars
of valour!' He added: 'The one scar has singularly displaced the
other.'</p>

<p>The doctor snorted:</p>

<p>'Valour!' with unexpected violence. 'You call it valour,
Lamoricière. I took you for a serious man.'</p>

<p>'This gentleman,' he addressed them, 'mad
drunk...Writing...Writing...Is it the hour?...And the unfortunate
waiters...They I suppose are clay? Furniture? Spittoons?...Those
poor fellows in this time of crisis...Whose earnings are
derisive!...' He addressed Henry Martin: 'Let me tell you,
monsieur, on one of those men I had enjoined rest...Now he is a
case of nervous breakdown...Are you aware those poor fellows must
be at their duty at six? And you keep them till four. Attendant on
your frenetic writings...'</p>

<p>That was why, in the darkness, he had heard the long,
intermittent roar of the car, making towards Hyères.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Becquerel was looking at him with reproachful
eyes:</p>

<p>'Mongtong!' she said, 'why could you not have written in your
room? I would have sat and held the inkstand to you...'</p>

<p><br>
That miserable fellow!...He saw him being hovered over by the
miserable waiter, in a lugubrious, ill-lit café...In atrocious
pain. Brushing the waiter aside and saying:</p>

<p>'Laissez-moi seul, vieille fève.' 'Let me alone, old bean.'</p>

<p>The dark girl's eyes were still upon him, the brows still a
straight line.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Becquerel had stood up. The doctor wagged his
pallid forefinger against her face.</p>

<p>'And you, Madame!...Have you no more sense! After that grave
accident and his outrageous folly...Let me tell you, if you desire
to retain the affections of monsieur...What do I say? If you desire
to retain monsieur on this earth and in his full reason...'</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Becquerel said:</p>

<p>'He is infinitely courageous! And beautiful as Apollo! And
generous! She whimpered and took refuge in the arms of the dark
girl who continued to look at him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'What is puzzling...the real puzzle is that the symptoms of this
fellow indicate neither wounds, nor inebriations. Nor even
lechery...They are those of shock after a long period of financial
misfortunes...<i>revers de fortune</i>. Heaven knows that with
those symptoms in these days I am familiar enough.'</p>

<p>Eudoxie had retreated to her arm-chair with her arms still about
the other girl. Her face as she looked at Henry Martin was
curiously softened.</p>

<p>'<i>Chagrins! Preoccupations journalières</i>...Grief! Eternal
preoccupations! Heaven knows the doctor in these days is familiar
enough with the symptoms they cause...But this gentleman is famous
throughout Europe for his resources...Consider: before committing
his madness...his rash act, he throws a <i>billet de cinquante
livres sterling</i>&mdash;to the waiter...And then charges a hedge,
being too drunk to tell the twenty metre broad highway of <i>le
Pradet</i> from a tiny <i>chemin vicinal</i>...'</p>

<p>The dark girl said vindictively:</p>

<p>'What do you know of the anxieties of wealth, Monsieur le
docteur Grouault?...May this unfortunate gentleman still not have
known your <i>revers de fortune?</i> And <i>chagrins!</i> And
<i>préoccupations journalières!</i> Are you such a communist that
you have lost all sense of relativity? I thought you were more
soft-hearted.'</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'That is true, Yu-Yu...I am perhaps carried away with
indignation at the thought of the way in which those who call
themselves great financiers&mdash;our Kings of to-day!&mdash;have with their
incapabilities ruined the world...'</p>

<p>Eudoxie said firmly:</p>

<p>'That is true. If you left it to me not one of those men should
escape hanging. But that is not to say that monsieur, here, may not
have known <i>revers de fortune!</i>'</p>

<p>The doctor said:</p>

<p>'I heard the other day of a King of Copper...Vainkell-hosare:
some such Boche name. He was brokenhearted because his fortune of
two hundred and fifty million francs&mdash;six thousand two hundred and
fifty million dollars&mdash;was reduced by this crisis to fifty
million...twelve hundred and fifty million francs...But do you
suppose that Vainkell-hosare gave any tears to his millions of
victims?...Millions?...the sacrifice of his Vanity and
incompetence.'</p>

<p>'That does not say,' she maintained, 'that monsieur here may not
have had <i>préoccupations journalières</i>. How do you know he may
not have had worries due to that very Boche?...These things all
interlace.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Yes, mademoiselle...Yes, mademoiselle...'</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken to her in a long time. But
he imagined that he recognized in the doctor's singular phonetics
the name of Mr. Kuhn's uncle. There was no other copper king with a
German-sounding name and two hundred and fifty millions to lose. He
had the momentary impression of the heavy jowl and contemptuous
voice of that financier. He had threatened Henry Martin into
ruin.</p>

<p>He suddenly thought that he would give not a little to be
drinking near-beer in the hotel where he had lunched with the
millionaire. It came over him like a wave at the thought of the
stiff napery, the substantial silver that clattered fatly as it was
thrown on the table, the wallowing in fat steaks, the roar of the
conversation, the clatter of the waiters at the serving tables, the
high ululations of the bell-boys...He seemed to have heard nothing
like it for years.</p>

<p>The millionaire he remembered had been infuriated at the
service. He had slammed a heavy hand on the table and asked his
nephew if he considered <i>that</i> to be civilization. The nephew
had even obsequiously run to the waiter's service table and had
fetched the great man the ketchup. The delay in bringing it had
excited his heavy rage...If then the waiter had brought that fluid
more speedily Henry Martin might not have been so completely
ruined. The financier would have been less violent in his commands
and Henry Martin would have dared not to put all his eggs in one
basket. As it was he had been too frightened to do anything else.
These immense men of business excited an awe. Defying that man was
more mysteriously frightening than it would have been to defy a
Roman tyrant...So all Henry Martin's capital had gone into those
copper shares...As all everyone's capital had gone into things into
which they had been ballyhooed or tyrannized into putting
them...</p>

<p>The occasion had not been propitious. It had not even been
agreeable. The great man had treated Henry Martin as if he had been
a maggot on a lettuce leaf...But at the moment he would have given
not a little to be just rising from some such table over there.
Rising and going out into the rattle and banging and overtension of
the nerves and hell that flowed all round the noise in which he had
been existing...But that torrent of fluid noise was not for him. He
had to remember that he was now an English millionaire. Those
fellows' lots were cast probably in quieter places...</p>

<p>The doctor was preparing some new bandages for his head.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was saying:</p>

<p>'And indeed we have to consider that even the Monckton car
shares have not been immune. The natural instinct excited in one by
contact with a distinguished figure has made me take notice that
they have been dropping a point here and a point there...So that&mdash;I
saw it stated in passing in a financial paper&mdash;they now stand lower
than they have done at any time since a month after the
reconstruction of the company on its present lines...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin was conscious of an extraordinary ringing in his
ears. If they now stood so low&mdash;an almost fantastic dividend was
just about to be declared...Why, that was fortune to anyone who
possessed a certain capital...</p>

<p>'It is all the more unusual...' M. Lamoricière was going on, 'in
that shares of an apparently prosperous company usually rise
towards the time of a declaration of dividends...</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Is it you that are going now to give us financial advice?'</p>

<p>'You mean to say,' M. Lamoricière said, 'that I have brought my
own eggs to a miserable enough market. That is true. I little
thought that after years of service in a treacherous
climate...'</p>

<p>The doctor made an impatient 'Br-r-r!' of sound.</p>

<p>'We are all in the same boat, my friend,' he said. 'And monsieur
here too seems to be of the same company...Mankind has always been
the prey of scoundrels. And survived. Now the scoundrels are not
even sufficiently competent to feather their own nests. So mankind
perishes. We used to live on the crumbs that fell from the rich
men's tables. Now there are neither crumbs nor tables. There are
not even rich men.'</p>

<p>Eudoxie said:</p>

<p>'When I listen to you men...to a crowd of men...it is as
if...'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' the doctor interrupted, 'I admit that if the Ship of
State were conducted by women as beautiful and as intelligent as
you.'</p>

<p>'It would at least be a barque of Cytherea,' she interrupted in
her turn. 'As it is it is a cargo of maimed...And having brought
the world to such a pass you chastise me for supplying the only
sane solace.'</p>

<p>'It was not I that chastised you,' the doctor said. 'There are
many things that should be suppressed before you and your
snow...For all I would do to stop it they may to-morrow put up a
statue to you as the <i>Bona Dea</i> of Sirenland.'</p>

<p>He beckoned the Becquerel girl towards the secretaire on which
Hugh Monckton had written his will. But he remained looking at the
dark girl.</p>

<p>'All the same,' he said impressively, 'I should be guilty of
ingratitude if I did not traverse your attack on our friend
Lamoricière in his capacity of financial adviser. As it is hard on
him at his age to have to set again his hand to the plough so it is
hard on me at mine to have to give up my collecting of
pictures...'</p>

<p>Eudoxie said affectionately:</p>

<p>'You and your crusts!'</p>

<p>'My collecting of pictures and my leisure with dignity,' the
doctor continued solemnly. 'To have to give up at once all my
repose and the purpose of my life and to have to betake myself
again to the scalpel and the bistouri!...But I owe it to the advice
of our friend that I am not cast upon the streets and my beloved if
incomplete collection dispersed.' Their friend possessed an
instinct for the Bourse that could only be set down as a natural
gift since he had passed so much time in their colonies. And in the
most desperate positions he had shown the coolest of heads. When, a
month ago, the incompetent criminals who managed French affairs had
reduced the Bourse to a state of raging lunacy M. Lamoricière had
managed the affairs of Doctor Grouault himself and his friends
Escartefigue, Boyer, Decanis&mdash;and much humbler people too!&mdash;so
consummately that, although they had all been seriously hit, not
one of them but retained a good proportion at least of their
holdings...</p>

<p>He went on for a long time...</p>

<p>Henry Martin was feeling extremely lonely. What sort of people
was he amongst in this musty and mouldering room? He had no sort of
clue. They appeared eccentric but extraordinarily real. And
unrelated and unaccountable.</p>

<p>Here were girls&mdash;presumably of a certain class&mdash;yet they talked
of Cytherea and Circe and Isolde. As familiarly as they would talk
of their pet dogs. And with the evident expectation of being
understood by their menfolk. It seemed incredible at this day and
year...And they were the cousins of police sergeants and mistresses
of governors of provinces. And went to prison with good humour and
without loss of self-respect...</p>

<p>And the men talked as if they were addressing political meetings
and handed each other testimonials...Lamoricière had handed even
Henry Martin a testimonial...in his character of Hugh
Monckton...</p>

<p>They seemed without rancour and tolerant of the hardships that
life thrust them against...It was nevertheless lonely...</p>

<p>As far as he could see they would have to form his society. For
as long as his funds lasted. They seemed to be on terms of easy
intimacy with the dark girl. Presumably they would stroll in and
out of the rooms&mdash;wherever they might be&mdash;that he and she would
occupy...It was perhaps a desperate venture. But it appeared to be
what he was in for. A life without recognizable landmarks. Without,
as it were, a Chrysler Building, a Brooklyn Bridge, a level
crossing with petrol signs and a traffic jam...Without even a Tour
Eiffel!</p>

<p>How did you orient yourself?</p>

<p>It appeared to be obvious that he would have to live in a closed
circle...<i>Sicut hortus inclosus est soror est conjux</i>...He did
not know what Hugh Monckton's social or vital contacts had been.
Except for the Bumblepuppy Bumblesumpske's and Jeanne Becquerel he
could not think of anyone who had known that poor fellow. He might
have numbers of gay friends in the near neighbourhoods. And if he,
Henry Martin, ran up against any of them he would be at a serious
loss. He would not be able to recognize them...He could of course
feign loss of memory as the result of his accident. And there were
no doubt other expedients. But he disliked the idea of active,
false pretences. It was one thing to lie in a bed nearly voiceless,
and have other people call you Asch Emma Smith. It would be quite
another to sit, say, in a terrace of one of the Riviera palaces
and, amidst crowds, boldly to declare:</p>

<p>'I am Hugh Monckton Allard Smith!'</p>

<p>Everything then forced him to a sort of disappearance. And a
disappearance where he was. He had once seen some sort of crab sink
straight into sand, apparently without effort or motion. He would
have to perform some such operation. And there!...There at any rate
he had an identity. Almost anywhere else in the world he might
suddenly have to struggle to retain any at all. For, if he was not
Hugh Monckton what was he? Henry Martin would be buried.</p>

<p>The doctor had by now installed himself at the
<i>secretaire</i>. He assumed a pair of pince-nez, took a sheet of
paper and placed the fingers of both hands, palm downwards,
determinedly on the edge of the writing flap. So installed he
regarded Mademoiselle Becquerel who stood humbly before him as an
implacable confessor might regard a weeping penitent. That attitude
is the delight of French doctors.</p>

<p>He said with a military voice:</p>

<p>'Madame; the case of Monsieur Smeez is serious but not
desperate.'</p>

<p>Henry Martin felt a certain shock. After all he did not know how
much injury might have been done him. He had certainly suffered
from long strain and the accident had come right on top of it. It
would be at least singular if, whilst inheriting the outward
personality, he had incurred also the physical handicaps of Hugh
Monckton.</p>

<p>The doctor went on harshly:</p>

<p>'It need not become desperate if you will observe exactly what I
am about to enjoin on you...But remember; it is the last drop that
makes the barrel overflow...You go on following certain detrimental
habits day after day with little
detriment...Then...<i>Vlan!</i>...the superfluous drop! There is
your barrel overflowing...Perhaps irrevocably...'</p>

<p>He regarded Mademoiselle Becquerel with re-awakened fierceness.
She drooped before him like a flower in a waterless vase.</p>

<p>'Abstinence!' the doctor barked suddenly. 'You understand! If
you value Monsieur's future happiness, abstinence must be the note
of his and your existence for a long time to come. There must be no
physical indulgences. <i>None!</i> Not a drop of alcohol! Not a
drop! A most limited regime. Most limited.'</p>

<p>He readjusted his pince-nez to gaze fixedly, first at the girl,
then at Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'There must be no toying with actresses in the draughts and
small hours of the <i>coulisses</i>. There must be no stimulants
either to the spirits or the corporal frame. Anxiety must be
avoided...If in fact you desire the return of Monsieur Smeez to a
state in which the normal and usually legitimate pleasures of
humanity may be again his...The lawgiver seeks nominally to restore
the moral health of the individual by confining him between iron
bars. The physician says to his subject: "Here is a prison. It is
only by your voluntary entry here that your normal health can be
assured."...</p>

<p>He fixed the girl even more intently:</p>

<p>It appeared to be the general impression, he said&mdash;and that
impression his own eyes had confirmed&mdash;that she was sufficiently
intimate with the patient to have considerable influence over him.
Probably she considered that their lives were, at any rate
provisionally, a joint affair. Then let her try to persuade
Monsieur to seek some rural retreat. This life of hotels was no
thing for a patient suffering with nervous disorders. A rural
retreat. A small establishment with none of the disorders attendant
on profuse wealth. They must live simply with a very few true
friends for all society. Monsieur must be content to exist <i>en
bon père de famille</i>&mdash;as lives a good father of a family...But
even as a <i>bon père de famille</i> he must acquiesce in shackling
himself...That is difficult when one has just taken to oneself a
young wife of charm and grace in a district where the wine with its
juices grows in profusion. But the results of neglect of these
injunctions might be terrible.</p>

<p>There were already indications that the brain of monsieur had
been too much tried. All his other organs were impeccable. He had
in truth the physique of an athlete...a physique in which any woman
happy enough to engage his affections for however limited a time
might well revel...But the master of all these organs...of the
heart, the lungs, the sense&mdash;that master tottered on his throne.
The brain!</p>

<p>This singular voicelessness for example. There was nothing
physical to account for it. It was a symptom of the failure of the
brain to control the action of certain chords. Its nature was no
doubt suggested by the sufficiently serious surface injury to the
jaw.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had been observing the dark girl. She had begun,
when Mademoiselle Becquerel had left the arm of her chair, by
affectionately stroking the sleeve of M. Lamoricière. She was
apparently trying to lessen the hurt feelings that her jeering at
his financial abilities seemed to have left in him. Henry Martin
had heard her say:</p>

<p>'Mais non...mais non! Everyone knows how your advice saved
Freddi Champnouveau and Diane de Montsouris and the others Doctor
Grouault was talking of...Is it not freely said that because of you
the <i>crise</i> has not come to certain quarters of the
city?...'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière had made some remark that Henry Martin had not
been able to catch because of the doctor's peroration. In a pause
she had said earnestly:</p>

<p>'It was said of someone else: He saved others. Himself he could
not save!'</p>

<p>Apparently M. Lamoricière remained adamant in his hurtness for
she continued to retain her hand on his sleeve and to look up into
his face running through a whole gamut of little grimaces of
affection, apology and deprecation. But at last the doctor's
barking voice had had to master the attentions of the other two.
She had remained silent. But again over her mobile features there
had run a whole scale of expressions.</p>

<p>When the doctor had declaimed as to the seriousness of Henry
Martin's condition she had looked at him with concern and pity. And
then with a little <i>moue</i> as if to indicate that the doctor
was a pessimist who must not be too seriously attended to. Her
glance resting directly in his eyes was indescribably moving to
Henry Martin...Like a welling up of a beam of velvet-black
light!</p>

<p>When the doctor with gesture and voice had harshly enjoined on
Mademoiselle Becquerel the necessity for 'abstinence' she had made
a comical little grimace at that lovelorn girl's back...But when he
had prescribed for Henry Martin the life of a <i>bon père de
famille</i> under a regime in rural surroundings she had clapped
together her pink-nailed hands, exhibited pleased hilarity with her
mouth and eyes...Henry Martin imagined for a moment that the idea
of rural retirement appealed to her for herself. As if she had had
enough of precarious life and desired nothing better than the
society of a restrained father of a family in vineyards whose
fruits were not used for the manufacture of intoxicating
beverages.</p>

<p>But she pointed first to Henry Martin and then to the back of
the Becquerel girl. She made a gesture of benediction...as if they
were kneeling down before her and she imposing her hands on their
heads. Then by joining her hands in supplication and looking up to
Heaven she made him quite plainly understand that that was what her
little friend had all her life prayed for.</p>

<p>The doctor had now arrived at the really luxurious part of his
seance. He had for some time been writing fast in a minute hand. He
held up the sheet of paper and from it read vindictively to
Mademoiselle Becquerel. He tapped the paper sharply as he read.</p>

<p>'At six-thirty two water glasses full of tepid Vichy Chosal
water...At seven-thirty no coffee but infusion of lime-flowers.
Some dry rusks without butter. Diet almost entirely
vegetable...Vegetable soup: the juices of fruits. Between each
principal meal a coffeespoonful of Passiflorine...Extract of
passion-flower in an infusion of lime-flower and orange flower
water...Before each meal a coffee-spoonful of...something Henry
Martin did not catch. In half a wine-glassful of red wine of not
more than nine degrees of alcoholic content. Or preferably in a
half a glass of pasteurized milk...</p>

<p>The regime took a long time to read out. Finally the doctor
said:</p>

<p>'If <i>that</i> regime does not cure him of the habit of keeping
waiters up till four in the morning and then charging hedges like a
Spanish bull there is nothing that will.'</p>

<p>He gathered his paraphernalia hastily and, in going, stood a
minute before Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'You have probably a bad three days to go through. The third,
fourth and fifth days after a shock such as you have had are
probably the worst. You feel no doubt well enough now. But
to-morrow will be bad.'</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>'Let me beg you to observe very carefully the regime that Madame
will explain to you. The slightest departure from it in any of the
major particulars will, I may tell you, cause inevitably the most
distressing mental symptoms. They would be heralded by excruciating
pains in the head. But it would then be too late to ward them
off...'</p>

<p>The dark girl and M. Lamoricière had apparently continued their
discussion. Her voice became audible saying:</p>

<p>'My dear friend: If I were the King I would give you my fleets
and my armies and my lands to lead and administer for me. If I were
God I'd give you my waves and my clouds and my rivers and my hills
and my olive fields and vineyards so that you might better
administer a sad world...If I had ten <i>sous</i> to invest I would
give them to you. Or if I had two million, eight hundred thousand
francs...But since you are so ill-natured and grouchy I will not
stay in the same room with you.' She added in English: 'Oh hell,
take the chip off your shoulder.' And told her little friend that
it was time she got some clothes on her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4-0" id="ch4-0"></a>PART FOUR</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4-1" id="ch4-1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Henry Martin lay looking at the grey Mediterranean. Across the
satin water above the balustrade of the terrace were the wooded
slopes and white villas of the peninsula of Saint Mandrier. Below
his eyes was the exact spot at which he had gone about in the boat.
To the left was the open sea, stretching out towards Africa. The
woods were dark: the waters of the exterior port light grey: the
sky cloudless and without colour. Suddenly the semaphore above the
dark woods lit up. It became a candle of white flame. The first
rays of the sun had just impinged on it...</p>

<p>Well: that was that! They had moved into the villa the night
before, the long and tiresome process finishing after dark. All the
doors and windows being open, in the coolness, the slight warmth of
Jeanne Becquerel, beside him, motionless in the bed, was not
disagreeable.</p>

<p>But you cannot dismiss the Mediterranean with: 'That is that!'
It remains with mercy, without heart. It smiles without malice as
without kindness. But with more of malice!...</p>

<p>They were in the villa next to the farmhouse of Eudoxie's aunt.
She was a bad old woman who had always been bad...<i>Malin</i> as
her admirers said. Now she was a farmeress. They said she was a
miser about everything but food. She insisted on having twenty-two
different kinds of fish for her <i>soupe de poissons</i>...And she
ate enormously. But the villa, which belonged to her, was in a
state of dilapidation. She was broad. Broad-faced, broad mouthed
and appeared implacable. She was also loose and jovial. Apparently
you never knew whether she would denounce you or shake her sides
with mirth at the spectacle you presented. She was said to have
been responsible for Eudoxie's having gone wrong...if Eudoxie could
be said to have gone wrong. Eudoxie's father&mdash;the aunt's
brother&mdash;was some sort of <i>fonctionnaire</i>. A functionary.
Apparently he kept the accounts&mdash;or it might have been only the
door!&mdash;in the French Consulate-General in New York. He was said to
be terribly serious!...<i>terriblement sérieux</i>...That was how
Eudoxie came to be a born New Yorker. It appeared that there was a
colony of terribly serious French people: a French
quarter...somewhere between Hell's Kitchen and the bottom of
Riverside Drive, according to Eudoxie. Henry Martin did not know
New York well enough to be able to place it. He did not know even
exactly where Hell's Kitchen had been though someone once driving
driving him in an automobile had said to him amongst rather squalid
streets on the West Side: 'This is what used to be Hell's Kitchen.'
No doubt in the 'eighties it had been the resort of thugs with
bangs and light women with bustles. Or with knives and guns and
marked cards. On beer barrels in dancing saloons...Something like
that. It must have been Dennis&mdash;one of the chief Pisto-Brittle New
York agents who had been driving him. He said he had been born in
Hell's Kitchen...And yes: one evening when he had been sitting on
his mother's doorstep he had seen a lighted kerosene lamp descend
through the air and crash in the roadway...Thrown by some pimp at a
kept woman on the third floor! But he had only understood that
when, the other day, he had seen a similar episode in a play whose
name Henry Martin could not remember. At the time the fellow&mdash;it
must have been Dennis!&mdash;had been only a child of eleven. Now he was
the head of quite a big firm of chain drug stores...If he wasn't
ruined! Everyone there appeared to be ruined. Or it might be more
correct to say that anyone might be...</p>

<p>But you could not underestimate the Mediterranean...It lay there
grey and unwinking...A russet tinge was showing on the plateau at
the foot of the semaphore on St. Mandrier...He had forgotten that
there was a plateau there. But, being now so high on the mainland
and the dawn air so clear, he could see a flat space around the
base of the white building that had become golden. A little tinge
of blue was coming into the sky.</p>

<p>It had perhaps sirens&mdash;that grey, unwinking sea. You would
imagine that high on the mainland you might be beyond its
influence...But no! its influence spread&mdash;to the land, the skies,
the vegetation, the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>You could not call Eudoxie...the dark girl!...a siren! She asked
nothing of you. She desired neither to suck your blood nor to rifle
your purse. Nevertheless she was without remorse and without
passion. Or so nearly...</p>

<p>Her father had ten years longer to serve in New York for his
pension from the French State. Keeping accounts. Or doors!
Apparently he had not approved of New York. At any rate between
Hell's Kitchen and Riverside Drive. He had thought it might be bad
for his daughter's morals. Or perhaps not her morals...her
<i>tenue</i>...manners, deportment, management of her voice. So
when she had been twelve he had sent her back to have the benefit
of a true French education. In care of her aunt who was avaricious
except for food. And she had gone wrong. Like her aunt who also had
<i>mal tourné</i> in her youth. But she was now enormously rich,
ferocious, jocular. And respected. She was permitted to provide the
<i>pain bénit</i> in the village church...</p>

<p>He could not make out whether, if it were still to do, he would
do it over again!</p>

<p>The sunlight was creeping down the flanks of the peninsula. It
was on the great, white villa half way down. The sea was becoming
blue. And the sky...</p>

<p>In Chicago when he had been drummer still for Pisto-Brittle, he
had met a man called Smith. Casually. In the underground lunchroom
at the Blackstone. Smith had warned him against copper...A man with
a red nose; but he seemed to know something about copper. He had
said the Germans were coming into the market for the first time
since the war. With immense quantities of the metal. The Cape
Copper Mines also were about to treble or quadruple their output.
Under American management. They had been bought by some big
company. Kennecotts Henry Martin thought. There would be floods of
copper on the market. And with shares at the immense price to which
they had been forced...why with the slightest touch of Bad
Trade&mdash;which was sure to come&mdash;the bottom would fall clear out of
the market.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had taken red-nosed Smith to be one of those
Americans who are always raising hell about America. There are such
Americans. Nothing American is good to them...The food: the
interstate railway commissions: the House of Representatives. Even
the merits of the plumbing, they say, are exaggerated...That fellow
had been the merest casual acquaintance. He had sat down next to
Henry Martin in that grill room. And then had burst out into an
attack on Copper. He had seemed a madman at the time. One of the
bores you have to suffer when you travel...But if he had taken
Smith's advice...</p>

<p>Well: what had he to grumble at? He had a villa on the shores of
the Mediterranean. Tiberius had nothing better than that. And a
great garden containing every kind of sub-tropical vegetation from
spinach to pomegranates. And money to burn. And Hugh Monckton's bed
to lie in...</p>

<p>They had taken it from the hotel. You might trust a man like
Hugh Monckton not to sleep in the beds of a one-horse hotel. He
travelled with his own bed...But Hugh Monckton was sleeping at the
end of a deep valley. On a hillside under a place called le Revest.
With his tombstone ordered. And might the Almighty have mercy on
him because he had loved much.</p>

<p>He, Henry Martin, on the other hand had the luxurious bed, and a
nearer view of the Mediterranean; and money...</p>

<p>Hugh Monckton had probably lugged that bed about with him
because he was an invalid. It was an incredible bed: it supported
you as lightly as swansdown&mdash;you being the swansdown...And he,
Henry Martin, was now lugging it around...</p>

<p>Because he was an invalid.</p>

<p>He could not tell whether he was an invalid or not. He had two
charming girls...one of them really lovely and meek like a dove and
the other the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. He had
their society day and night and they looked after him with a tender
solicitude...Eudoxie had stayed chatting with them last night till
long after twelve...but the other lovely creature left him
completely indifferent...</p>

<p>He looked down at her sleeping face beside his upper arm.
Relief: absolute and warranted trustfulness&mdash;and no doubt
happiness!...A mere fortnight of them!...had delicately rounded her
cheeks and given them a tea-rose blush. Her eyes were lightly
closed...She was actually like a rose. And she clung to him like a
clinging rose about a tree trunk.</p>

<p>She was fairer than he had thought. Or perhaps the constant
presence of the dark girl made her seem to grow fairer.</p>

<p>On the other hand the mere contemplation of the dark girl in his
more emotional moments made his heart beat and his brain swim. His
heart would beat so fast as to be troublesome. Occasionally he
would have tears in his eyes...But so, he would swear, had
she...</p>

<p>They were perhaps witnesses of pity. She knew he must have
suffered for a protracted period, to get very little...</p>

<p>But he had the makings of a harem: a luxurious bed in which to
lie like a Sultan; no material worries. No moral ones even...And to
be rid of material worries was something in which no one who had
not been through them could believe...</p>

<p>Nevertheless if he had taken the advice of red-nosed Smith he
probably would not have been there. Though if it had not been
copper it might very well have been something else. No one had
escaped. The dark girl had said she had had a letter from her
father. He said that no one over here had any idea of how bad it
was over there. Their connections&mdash;Eudoxie's and his&mdash;had had to
close their flower-shop on Forty-second Street. No one bought
flowers. Their sons had lost their jobs in the bank. Old Gourit had
been on the bread-line for a month. He had been seen there by
accident by his niece. His bed-ridden wife had been without
blankets for a long period. At the Consulate work had fallen to
nothing. A spider had made its web over one of the ink-wells in the
chief-waiting room...A week ago! They had let it remain to see how
long it would be unbroken. It was still intact. It was fortunately
still August and warm. The bread-line stretched from the Sister's
hospital at West Eleventh right up Sixth Avenue to West Fourteenth
Street. God knew what would happen when winter came...</p>

<p>Reading the letter Eudoxie had looked up at him and said:</p>

<p>'Think of that...from West Eleventh to Fourteenth...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin had said that he did not know lower Sixth Avenue
very well. He had only been in New York for visits. That was true.
He tried to say only true things to her.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'You don't say...I have the feeling you are New Yorkais. Like
myself...But one has the feeling that everyone who does not speak
French as a native language is New Yorkais.'</p>

<p>She exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Listen to this. As you are not a citizen of New York this may
impress you. My father writes: "Your sister Eugénie was last night
coming home with her fiancé, young Larbre, from a party in Columbia
Heights. They had in their taxi a young fellow...a millionaire
<i>quelconque</i>. When they got to Columbus Circle they were delayed
because the bread-line was all round the Circle. 'Isn't that a
splendid sight,' said that young fellow; 'doesn't that make you
proud of America?' They said!!!!!?? And he answered: 'They're all
down and outs. Starving. They have to wait four hours for a can of
coffee and two inches of bread...Yet they are perfectly orderly. No
exclamations! No complaints!...What country but America could show
such discipline?'&mdash;And he added: 'But something will have to be
done to stop them from going from bread-line to bread-line. Some of
these fellows after they have been fed here will go on straight to
another place. That must be put a stop to!'"</p>

<p>The dark girl's eyes rested contemplatively on Henry Martin.</p>

<p>'Do you know what I would do if you were such a millionaire?'
she asked.</p>

<p>She answered seriously:</p>

<p>'I would come up to you and I would spit in your face!'</p>

<p>Her glance had, however, changed to one of soft compassion.</p>

<p>'But you are not a millionaire...' And she added very slowly:
'Like that one!'</p>

<p>He had had a swift feeling of dread...It seemed to him certain
that she must know that he was not Hugh Monckton...He had had the
conviction before: that seemed to confirm it!...</p>

<p><br>St. Mandrier was by now all in sunlight. It would last only for
a short time for that was the north slope. They were now in
September. The first or second. Anacondas had passed their
dividends. That did not matter to him. Moncktons hadn't.</p>

<p>He tried to gather his thoughts together...He had been thinking
of red-nosed Smith: and of his emotions when he looked consciously
at the dark girl: and of Jeanne Becquerel here, a little...And of
course of his general situation! But all the others bracketed into
that.</p>

<p>It wasn't red-nosed Smith so much. He had done with the memory
of that lunatic. But perhaps he was not so much of a lunatic. When
you heard of breadlines from West Eleventh to West Fourteenth it
made you think he ought to have been taken more seriously...But
when Americans have a down on America they speak so wildly they
cannot expect to command much attention...</p>

<p>But there had been another Smith...If he had taken his advice he
would not be here now...That was Henry Martin Aluin Smith I. His
surface-conscious self...</p>

<p>His emotions when he had stood over that body were now clearer
to him. They were perhaps clearer than they had been just after the
event&mdash;the rash act!</p>

<p>There had been H.M.A.S. I with burly common sense. He had said
that it would be an act of childishness to take passports from a
dead man.</p>

<p>But in the eyes of H.M.A.S. II that British passport had looked
extremely hypnotizing. Like a trinket. Dark blue: with the gilt
plastering of royal arms. And the idea of celebrating his escape
from death had been alluring. After having passed out of such a
long period of shadow it was only fitting to make whoopee...</p>

<p>And heaven knows how complex a man is! Henry Martin was aware
that, but for another intercession, his conscious self would have
won out. He was not, in his normal senses or even when a good deal
agitated, the man to let himself be carried away by a childish
recklessness. A gilt bauble was nothing to him. Either in itself or
as a symbol of the sort of lawlessness that sometimes becomes a
man!...</p>

<p>But under these two there had been a third Henry Martin. It was
a stern being: the remains within himself of the cave man: the
latent possibility within him of the criminal. It was the part of
him that was motivated by hunger, thirst, panic, the dictates of
sex. And sleeplessness. It was as if that third presence at the
conference had said: 'Aw hell: I want sleep and a Hamburg steak.
And bandaging. And a woman...Get to hell out of here. Give me two
days of that and to hell with the consequences.'</p>

<p>He must have reckoned on a pretty certain two or three days of
as much whoopee as his banged up frame could support...No doubt not
any of his subconsciousnesses had counted on more than two days of
it. He&mdash;they!&mdash;had intended explaining the mistake and laughing the
matter away. He ought to have known that that would not turn out so
easy...None of it had actually been easy...To keep himself from
making slips he had had to act to himself the part of Hugh
Monckton. And it had proved easy. It had been like when you
valorously set out on a course of lying. You come to believe
yourself in the end.</p>

<p>And he had lied very little. Those people had displayed
astonishingly little interest in his past...None at all! He could
not recollect that they had asked him a single question until once,
in a sort of jealousy, he had described his father as an old,
obsdnate man...The French are like that. For them there exist only
France and the present. They are incapable of showing interest in
your past in another land...No, he had only lied once. When he had
been pleading with Eudoxie. He had said:</p>

<p>'But you are wearing my ring!' It had slipped out.</p>

<p>She had turned it round on her finger and said:</p>

<p>'But it was given me by the other poor fellow!'</p>

<p>He had caught himself up with a readiness of which he might have
been proud at any other time.</p>

<p>'None the less,' he heard himself say: 'It was I who sent it
you. You will see my initials on the inside of the setting.'</p>

<p>She had been sitting by his bed in the hotel.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'Yes: I know your initials are there.' She had looked at him
with the first amusement she had shown at that interview. A queer,
as it were sideways, amusement. At any rate her mouth had gone down
only on one side. As when they say you smile on the wrong side of
your face.</p>

<p>'Ah yes,' she said, 'Of course yes! You could not be seen
talking to a...To one like me...Yes, yes: of course. Much less
giving me a ring...So you sent it...He would never have thought of
that the poor fellow...But you, you had your distinguished
position. And of course...Yes: Gloria Sorenson would not have liked
it. She would have made the fur fly...'</p>

<p>He had said:</p>

<p>'I loved you from the first moment I saw you!' He was by then a
great deal worked up. But it had been true enough.</p>

<p>She sighed.</p>

<p>'It is a hard, cruel thing...life!' she said. 'If you had seen
Jeanne the first time I saw her. In the playground of the
Lycee...She came running up with a button and a needle...My tablier
was too small for me. My aunt who was a scatterbrain had forgotten
to attend to my school trousseau until the last moment. So there
was no tablier. And an overall like that is prescribed by the rules
of the Lycee. So that no girl should look finer than any other. So
at the last moment my aunt found me an old tablier of my cousin
Georgette. And there stood I, scowling like a fiend and a lot of
girls jeering at me. Because I had burst one of the buttons of that
gar ment. Girls will jeer for any reason at all if you are new and
shy and speak French awkwardly. With a New Yorkais accent...And
Jeanne sewed on that button. And you would not believe it, seeing
Jeanne now, but she bit one of the girls that went on jeering at
me.'</p>

<p>She stopped to think for a moment.</p>

<p>'I would have you believe,' she said, 'that it was not long
before every one of those girls would eat out of my hand whilst I
called them names...But Jeanne continued to worship me and carried
my knapsack and spent her lunch money on buying me scent and did my
devoirs for me, crying, whilst I was flirting with my cousin who is
the police sergeant you saw...So decidedly you are not the first
one to fall for me on sight.'</p>

<p>Her features dropped.</p>

<p>'No,' she said. 'When I saw that red sail flash away before the
gloom I knew that poor man was not for me. But it is true that that
night I would gladly have slept with...' She did not utter the last
word.</p>

<p>The flying away of the scarlet sail seemed to have made a deep
impression on her. She had referred to it several times...As Henry
Martin's boat had charged into the tempest the triangle of scarlet
had flown away behind him...Like an omen, she had said...A
mysterious stranger the night before had given her a ring. Now she
saw a gout of flame or of blood whirl away behind him. How could
you read that? And she standing on top of a rock, waving, like
Isolde!...</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards she had had to run into the chicken house
of les Jarres where she had crouched amongst the outraged hens.</p>

<p>It had been at that point in that particular interview that he
had first known pain...</p>

<p>He was getting confused...At what point in what particular
interview?...His brain was turning. It was as if he had to hold
himself down in bed.</p>

<p><br>He was lying looking at the sea above the balustrade of the
terrace. The supporters of the balustrade were of stone. Pinkish.
They were like a row of ewers of which you could not see the
handles. Between them was the sea. The sea was like grey
satin&mdash;with enormous scrolls of glutinously still water. The sun
was gradually filling the world...He almost prayed that the heat
wave might be over. They had had now ten days of heat wave. Down in
the town. But they had promised him that, up here it would be
cooler. The sky was nevertheless without a fleck.</p>

<p>He was looking at the exact spot...The spot where the scarlet
triangle had whirled away behind the white launch. He ought perhaps
not to have that spot under his eyes. It might bring on pain.</p>

<p>Pain...He had never imagined such pain. He had never known pain
before. Before he had always been healthy. A healthy
animal...Almost an Olympian athlete...But that pain had been like
flame going to the very sources of sensation...In the brain. Not
the pain of the wound in his temple. Behind that!...It drove him
mad merely to think of it!</p>

<p>That accursed doctor!</p>

<p>It had come of course at the end of his first interview with
her. After the long and tiring interview with that argumentative
fellow Lamoricière. Tiring...Two tiring interviews. At the end of
the doctor's examination. And after the shock of the
'accident.'...Well: it had been an accident: the blows from the
yard. Swinging round on the mast...Right: Left!...</p>

<p>And then you can have any number of private thoughts during
interviews. Your other personalities are thinking for you. About
suggested illnesses. All sorts of panics...All his personalities
had gone into his pleading with the dark girl...But all through his
interview with Lamoricière he had been thinking other
thoughts...About cabling to his father...About, precisely, his
health...That had been by the doctor's suggestion, evidently.</p>

<p>That accursed doctor...</p>

<p>They had said he was somebody tremendous! A great Paris mental
specialist who had retired to live among painters and collect their
pictures as they painted them. But the <i>crise</i> had hit him. He had
had to begin to practice again...Serves him right!...</p>

<p>Perhaps their declarations of that fellow's distinction had been
all a product of the southern sun. They were all Mariuses down
there. If they had nothing else to boast of they would boast about
the miraculous gifts of the last stranger they had met in a
café...As Lamoricière had boasted to everyone on the road about
his, Henry Martin's, valorous exploits on the Marne...But of course
they were Hugh Monckton's...He had by now so identified himself
with that poor dear fellow that the fellow in the blue uniform
charging down on him on a roan charger was something that he might
seem to see at almost any moment of the day. In a sort of
substituted memory...And he had called the hotel waiter: 'Old
Bean,' half a dozen times whenever he brought in a meal...</p>

<p>But of course they would exaggerate the distinctions of that
doctor!</p>

<p>Nevertheless he had on his prescription headings a formidable
list of distinctions. He was adviser to the Republic on half a
dozen hygienic directions. And, after his name on the same headings
was printed a whole row of things like bugs! Decorations...From a
great number of countries...Sweden: Canada: Rumania. England
even...So he was an international big bug!</p>

<p>It was enough to frighten anyone into a nervous attack...</p>

<p>Perhaps that pain was no more than a suggestion of the doctor
himself!</p>

<p>These accursed fellows! In France they called them the New
Inquisition. In earlier days it had been the priest allying himself
with the woman on your hearth who held you down with bands of
steel. Now it was the doctor. He curried favour with your woman. By
forcing abstinence and economy on the <i>bon père de famille</i>. The
woman on your hearth wanted that. It let her build up the dots of
her daughters, the capital for starting up her sons in
business...So the doctor established himself as firmly in your
house as the sucker fish fixes itself in the keels of ships.</p>

<p>New Inquisitors...For, damn it all! The old Inquisitors were
merely external. Their spies were outside the house; their
executioners and torturers outside the body. But this new order was
always within your doors and the woman of your hearth was their
spy. The pains with which they threatened you were within you: they
could create them by suggestion and the woman kept them always
alive by reminders of the dread threats of their ally. They were
inescapable...</p>

<p>On the other hand that damned fellow may have been right. The
pain may have come in the course of nature: consequent on the
emotions aroused in him by that fatal and predestined scene with
the dark girl.</p>

<p>And on the other hand it might well be that, in this case the
woman of this particular hearth might object to the fiat of the
doctor. She had already begun to say that it was hard on her little
friend...Of course it was hard. It was even indecent. Still she
would have been in the same case if she had had a husband who had
had an accident after a long period of...He could not remember the
French phrase...financial worries...A bridegroom though! That
perhaps made it indecent!...<i>Revers de fortune</i>: that was the French
phrase. Well, she was suffering from the world crisis. She was not
the first, nor would she be the last!...</p>

<p>And it was all fatal and predestined...Eudoxie had so strong a
feeling of the wrong millionaires had done by mismanaging the
finances of the world that she would not take up even with so
innocuous a millionaire as Hugh Monckton. She preferred to remain
for her 'boy friend,' the dope merchant whose only attraction
seemed to be that he was in gaol in England after having clumsily
got her into gaol. He was English.</p>

<p>And he, Henry Martin, had had to change identities with a
millionaire. 'A pound millionaire!' she had said. With an
inflection as if by association with her boy friend she had learned
to be contemptuous of the dollar.</p>

<p>A net, its bamboo frame shining in the sun, was moving along
outside the balustrade, visible between the pink ewers. He felt
sudden peace. He had always the dread that one day it would occur
to her that the present situation was too equivocal. Then she would
never come again. Apparently not even an idea that the situation
was even unusual had so much as brushed her lucid mind. 'Equivocal'
was probably a word that she did not know. As the dictionary of
Napoleon had not the word of fear in it. Or perhaps that was
Nelson...She was coming carrying a fisherman's landing-net. Of
course she was going fishing with Jeanne Becquerel. To catch the
twenty-two different sorts of fish that her aunt needed for her
fish soup. She was said to make the most admirable fish soup in all
the Var. The 'young couple' were invited to dine with her that
evening.</p>

<p>The landing-net pitched over the balustrade. The terrace was
very long. She preferred to run like a cat up the protuberances of
the rocks that supported it. One black trouser came over the
balustrade: then the other. She was wearing a great round straw
hat. Bistre coloured. The sunlight touched the top of the
balustrade along with her. Her hands were in sunlight...</p>

<p>He said to himself:</p>

<p>'How is this? I am like the Indian who prayed: "O Shastriyama
what is this creature that Thou hast given me. Seeing that I can
neither live with her nor without her!"'</p>

<p>Shastriyama had not given that creature to him. Yet, since
sunrise he had been thinking incoherent thoughts. Because of his
fear that she might not come. Now he could not get his breath
because she had!</p>

<p>She picked up the fishing-net and walked in with it over her
shoulder. In trousers she had broader hips than he had thought. She
balanced as she walked with one hand on her hip. With the great hat
the hoop of the landing-net made intersecting haloes behind her
head. Above the immense bell-shaped trousers the top of her
bathing-dress was light flame-coloured. It was not very low in
front but a broad opening came right down to her belt behind. The
belt was emerald green. He could not see the opening at her back.
But he knew it was like that. He had no doubt seen it as she had
climbed over the balustrade. He had thought he had shut his eyes.
Obviously he hadn't.</p>

<p>She was leaning against the doorpost. Even then she was
defiantly rouged. At six in the morning! It was bad taste. She was
got up to resemble southern beauty. A Carmen or, with the wide
trousers, a Corsair's bride. With the provocative hips and the hand
on one of them. Her lips were no doubt exaggerated in colour, but
he could not see them. They were hidden by a purple aster! She was
chewing the stem. It gave the effect of an enormous mouth. She was
smiling.</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel groaned:</p>

<p>'Je me lève! Je me lève...Mais je suis si bien!'</p>

<p>...'I'll get up! I'll get up...But I am so happy here!'</p>

<p>The dark girl leaned her face over his face. The aster fell upon
it, chastely sprinkling his cheek with dew.</p>

<p>'That is better than a kiss!' she said laughing at him
ironically. He groaned. She bent again and kissed him on the lips.
Her warm breath smelled sweet of coriander seed. Coriander seed is
one of the chief ingredients, with saffron, of <i>soupe de poissons</i>.
No doubt she had picked a grain or two out of the mortar in her
aunt's great kitchen.</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel threw a possessive arm right across his
chest.</p>

<p>'Mamour!' she protested sleepily. 'Mamour! No one shall have
Asch Emma Smeez but me.'</p>

<p>The dark girl leaned back. Smiling at her as one of infinitely
superior physical vigour may smile. Each time she had bent over
Henry Martin she had done it without moving her hips from the
doorpost. That was a piece of suppleness that Henry Martin much
liked. Hugh Monckton had done it when he had bent down over his
grip to take out the twenty thousand pound notes&mdash;which were by now
more than doubled...And that gesture had undoubtedly endeared him
to Henry Martin...That was not so unreasonable. A person who could
do it must have lived cleanly, with moderation and sobriety...And
of course she was a beauty specialist. She said she could do away
with his scar if he persisted in not wearing a beard. But they
liked his beard, those two. It made him look more like a man who
could beat them. French women apparently liked to think that their
men could beat them up if they wanted to. With skill and attention,
not breaking bones or disfiguring visible parts of the
flesh...Women of their class...But of what class were they? Perhaps
of a class like that of actresses who were never, on any account,
'received' in France...He had forgotten about his beastly beard.
Now it started tickling. He could not scratch under their eyes! Of
course many Frenchmen wore beards...And some English!</p>

<p>A nearly three weeks' beard! Past the absolutely revolting
stage...</p>

<p>He had not shaved since the fifteenth of August. It was now the
fifth of September. He remembered that he had not shaved on the
morning when those things had happened. That was scarcely polite to
Destiny. It was perhaps why that august but humorous force
condemned him to wear that unhygienic offence. It cut him off from
his countrymen. He had gone native. Englishmen could wear beards.
They had a king who was a beaver!...It was Eudoxie who was set
against his shaving. She refused permission clamorously. She said
that if he shaved at all he must go clean-shaven. He disliked the
idea of sacrificing his moustache. He thought he had a weak upper
lip. He must have. Anyway he was cut off from his countrymen.
Expatriate! Eudoxie no doubt knew that!...It also made him less
easily recognizable. That fellow Jimmy Stout had showed no sign of
recognition at all.</p>

<p>'Get up and catch the rascasse. The rascasse! The rascasse!'
Eudoxie laughed. Jeanne Becquerel hid her face almost under his
armpit.</p>

<p>'You need never be without rascasse,' Eudoxie said. 'While you
have my little friend...She can always catch them. She is so
lethargic...As for me I can catch everything else but not
rascasse.' <i>Soupe de poissons</i> needs rascasse before everything
else.</p>

<p>'If you bait her hook,' Eudoxie said, 'and throw it in she will
sit motionless for an hour...That is why my little friend catches
them...All the other twentyone kinds will only take moving bait.
That is why I catch them up so fast...I shall call you Monsieur
Rascasse.'</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel sat straight up in bed.</p>

<p>'No one shall call my Asch Emma Smeez anything but Asch Emma
Smeez!' she said. 'And they shall not even shorten it. He is Asch
Emma Smeez.'</p>

<p>'You do not even know his name!' Eudoxie laughed.</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel made a face as if she were contemplating a
bitter draught.</p>

<p>'You Mongtong...' she began hesitatingly.</p>

<p>'No it is not at all that,' Eudoxie said.</p>

<p>'Then it is Asch Emma Smeez,' the girl panted. 'My Asch Emma and
my Smeez, too.' She curled one of her feet under her.</p>

<p>Eudoxie said:</p>

<p>'Rascasse...Rascasse...Rascasse I tell you...If you do not come
soon the rascasse will be too late for my aunt's soup. Then she
will never give me another holiday. And I shall have to stop in
Manhattan Beauty all my life. Never go out of the shop. Pass all my
life giving fat Americans from Montparnasse physical lessons...You
without pity!...You know my implacable aunt.'</p>

<p>She stopped and then exclaimed very slowly:</p>

<p>'If you do not come soon the sun will be blazing into our
cove...Then it will spoil the nacreous skin that you think our
Seigneur likes...'</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel moved up suddenly on her foot. Her left leg was
stretched straight before her, two inches above the soft bed. The
nacreous skin was dead white under the shining, transparent
covering.</p>

<p>'It will go rusty,' Eudoxie said...'And Monseigneur will take on
another favourite!'</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel from her single foot sprang right over him. She
was on tiptoe on the red tiles of the floor...Like a Greek statue
of a poised diver...She poked her chin triumphantly at the dark
girl...</p>

<p>Eudoxie held her head back.</p>

<p>'It was I that taught you that!' she said with pride in her
pupil.</p>

<p>There were yards of cream-coloured silk on a chair beside Jeanne
Becquerel. She was out of her nightdress and the silk was whirling
round her silver white person. As if she had been a scarf dancer.
The heavy silk rustled about her thighs. She was draped, with a
square end of silk hanging before her. She poked her chin again at
Eudoxie.</p>

<p>'No, I could not do that,' the dark girl said: 'Little Malay
girl...We know you have been in the tropics...'</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel looked like a Greek boy in old alabaster and
fig leaves. She bathed in a <i>sarong</i>.</p>

<p>They embraced rapturously. The dark girl's arms were like
mahogany crossed over the other's skin...Mahoerany whose
transparent surface contained luminous blood!</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel stood in the doorway, leaning back against the
doorpost beside the dark girl. Since the light from the upper sky
was intense she was not in silhouette and her skin was indeed
nacreous as the dark girl said. Like mother of pearl. She stretched
out one arm to hold the other doorpost so that it cut the doorspace
in half, like a straight bar, obscuring St. Mandrier. Her head was
turned to gaze into the south. The shadows beneath her arms,
armpits, breasts and knees reflected the blue of the sky; there was
a little pink on the base of the neck, the ribs and the lower
limbs. But most of the flesh was rice-white...A Hellenic figure
done in nacre! The dark girl was like a drop of luminous
blood!...She would no doubt one day fly away...Like a scarlet sail
before disaster.</p>

<p>They had perhaps arranged that contrast so as to be alluring to
men. They had perhaps arranged to shade or expose their flesh so as
to be the one in red bronze, the other, rice...Why shouldn't they?
The allurement of men is the business of these seas and
skies...They had to leap and give pleasure. Then to die. Or maybe
sufficiently to economize to unite their wealth to that of a rich,
tamed farmer and to capitalize a Manhattan Beauty Shop where you
could employ your niece as adviser in reducing calisthenics. That
was what Eudoxie's aunt had done. It was no doubt relatively death.
But in her youth she was said to have danced and given
pleasure.</p>

<p>The dark girl pointed her thumb backwards towards the face of
her mate.</p>

<p>'What wouldn't you give to know what she is thinking?..She will
stay like that till there is an earthquake.'</p>

<p>She slipped under the rigid arm. Out on the terrace she juggled
with oranges. With one hand she kept six in the air at once. As one
fell out of range she caught it with her net and took another from
the table beside her. So there were always six in the air at once.
Those high up caught the sunlight and were illuminated and golden.
Behind her pyjama trousers, from below the terrace the orange trees
pushed up their formal and emotional foliage. He could not be
certain that Greek women wore pyjama trousers. Perhaps the Cretans
did. At Cnossos. Or he seemed to remember an outline on a red
platter. In the Louvre.</p>

<p>At any rate the boy of Antibes who danced and gave pleasure had
probably juggled six oranges in that way. Perhaps on that very
terrace. It was an unchanging landscape...</p>

<p>When the last of the oranges had gone beyond reach of her hand
and had been caught in her net she disappeared from the field of
his vision in that doorway. He saw her for a moment through the
other. In full sunlight there. But a momentary cloud went over the
sun.</p>

<p>He was left alone with Jeanne Becquerel. Her face was
averted.</p>

<p>No he had no curiosity as to what she was thinking. He had
practically never felt curiosity as to what Alice had thought when
she went into one of her trances. Actually she must have thought of
miles of pictures in the Louvre...Very likely Jeanne Becquerel
thought about the salaams of Cochin-Saigonese or whatever they
were...Apparently, out there of an evening, she had mixed cocktails
of unusual fruit juices for the Governor's male friends. In a Batik
wrapper of unbelievable iatricacy of colour and a Japanese sash
wound round and round her. Like the sarong now. Only the Japanese
sash would be in great bows behind whereas the <i>sarong</i> was knotted
or draped or something, in front. She would stand in a dim, shining
room and as each man took his drink he would kiss her hand. Or the
Saigonese would raise it to their foreheads...</p>

<p>Maybe she was thinking of that...Perhaps there had been
incense-joss sticks&mdash;and gongs and paper lanterns and things...But
Eudoxie had said that she dreamed of a future in a farmhouse in
that countryside. Beside a <i>bon père de famille</i>...</p>

<p>He wished he did not have to think of Alice every time he
thought of this girl. This girl was in no way like her...She had
long, well moulded, slow moving limbs. Alice had been by comparison
squat. And about this girl there was no avarice at all. She had not
yet asked him for a penny. Not even for the cable she had sent to
father for him...The eight thousand francs had trailed about the
hotel room for days. At last Eudoxie had taken them to open an
account for her. In some bank that was said to be sound.</p>

<p>Apparently, like so many French people, the ex-Governor had been
close. In every direction but one. He had given the girl no money
and she had taken none though she might apparently have had the
resources of a province to play with. In the way of bribes and
exactions. On the other hand the governor had fairly buried her
under silks, large conglomerations of jewellerylike cat's-eyes and
moonstones and objects in brass. Perhaps she liked that. At one
moment she would be in a garment, black in base, with emerald
green, orange, scarlet and purple scrolls. When you next looked
round she would be in a scarlet jacket with black, blue and
goldwine embroidery. With her hair as if glued back under jewelled
combs...</p>

<p>In that, if in no other way, she was an improvement on Alice who
would wear the same stuff gown without change for a couple of
months. She had had one Indian printed muslin that had driven him
fairly batty because she would wear nothing else. Yet she had
bought frocks fairly often...Perhaps for the charming of Mrs.
Percival!</p>

<p>When they moved up to the villa Jeanne Becquerel's kimonos and
bales of silk and large jewel cases had hardly left them room in
the car to sit in and it had jingled like an old iron cart with her
hammered brass pots and ash trays and vases. And he must already
have seen her in fifty different, clinging dresses. It was rather
agreeable.</p>

<p>It was agreeable too to see her flesh under the clean sky...As
if you were beginning to collect statues...</p>

<p>The dark girl came back with a tray. A ewer full of ice cubes
and another of red-orange liquid.</p>

<p>'A l'Americaine,' she said...'Though of course you are not a New
Yorker. Still here's the juice of ten oranges...'</p>

<p>She slipped the net over Jeanne Becquerel's head and went along
the terrace dragging the shrieking girl after her.</p>

<p>In a minute she was back in the doorway. Her face was grave
enough.</p>

<p>'That old letter,' she said in English. 'The one I gave you last
night...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'No, it was a very good old letter...'</p>

<p>She exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I was afraid it told you where you got off...'</p>

<p>He answered slowly:</p>

<p>'No: it solved the last of my moral doubts...'</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'You'll admit it looked like blue ruin...' And then: 'But a
moral...oh, la, la...Isn't my little friend moral enough for you?
Is your urge for New England schoolmarms?...'</p>

<p>She added:</p>

<p>'It is true. You are a good boy...And he did not wish the news
of his death...? That is of course why...She was rather
breathless.</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel was dragging her by the bare arm.</p>

<p>'This is not <i>convenable</i>,' she said...'You shall not send me to
catch rascasse and creep to my man...'</p>

<p>They went from that doorway and then appeared at the other,
further down the room. They had their arms about each other and
stretched their free hands towards him in a Roman salute.</p>

<p><br>He lay for a long time looking at the amethystine blue sea. The
slopes of the peninsula opposite were dusky. The sunlight had gone
round to the other side. The cleared space round the base of the
semaphore showed as a green lawn. He sipped his orange juice from a
thin, frosted glass in which ice tinkled...They had looked like
sisters of the Roman decadence moving in long steps...Or of course
like mannequins on the terrace of a Riviera resort.</p>

<p>That was all one.</p>

<p>'The point is,' he said, 'that that really is Alice!'</p>

<p>The taste of the orange juice had reminded him of the
dining-room in Albany station. You eat rather well there. He used
to think so.</p>

<p>One morning towards five, coming from Buffalo when he had been
drumming for Pisto-Brittle, he had got out of the train and drank
three glasses of orange juice on end. Afterwards he had had a real
American breakfast...Perhaps he would never eat a real American
breakfast again! It looked like that...</p>

<p>He lay for a long time, regarding the white triangles of sails
over against St. Mandrier. Even the cataclysm of three weeks ago
had not cured them of their passion for catching minute
sea-creatures. Perhaps because that was something for nothing. If
they went to New York the first thing they would ask as the boat
approached the Twenty-third Street Quay was whether there you could
catch small fish for a <i>friture</i>...</p>

<p>Alice at least had never paid him the compliment of even
simulating jealousy when Mrs. Percival had deigned to give him a
moment or two of private interview. This girl called him '<i>mamour</i>'
with a pretence of possessiveness!...One progressed! The species
remained the same, the genus underwent modification.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4-2" id="ch4-2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>The night before she had handed him a letter just as they got
into the car to leave the hotel. It was addressed to 'Henry Martin
Aluin Smith'. The waiter indignantly protested that he had not been
able to read the name. And the <i>patronne</i> had lost her
spectacles three weeks ago on the day the letter had arrived. Henry
Martin had expected so little trouble from letters that he felt no
shock at receiving this. But when he saw that the postmark was
'Hyeres' of the sixteenth of August he had a shock. It was as if
the dead had risen. He had held it in his hand on the wheel when he
had been driving to the villa. All the while she had been looking
at him with anxiety and sympathy. And all the while they had been
sitting in the little saloon, by the light of a single candle she
had looked at him...Perhaps with panic. He was awarq now that it
had been at least with sympathy and anxiety. He was warranted in
believing that was because she had just said that she had been
afraid it was where he got off...Then she was with him!</p>

<p>It was difficult to know what she thought. She knew he was not
Hugh Monckton. Of that he had been aware from the very first. At
the very first whilst the doctor had displayed his damaged
face.</p>

<p>He had felt a moment's alarm. That secret might be worth money.
She too might want something for nothing. But he had long known
that she didn't want money at all. She wanted only that Jeanne
Becquerel should be provided with a <i>dot</i>. So that she might be
married to a wealthy farmer when he, Henry Martin, was ready to
dispense with her society...</p>

<p>She would gain nothing by hurting him. She would only hurt
Jeanne Becquerel.</p>

<p>All the same their conversations had had a certain piquancy...As
if she knew that she could make him jump at any moment. For fear
she should laugh at him because she had so easily penetrated his
disguise...And within a very short time he was sure that she cared
for him a great deal. So that those <i>tanquineries</i>&mdash;the teasings&mdash;were
mere by-play of intimacy. They showed they had a secret known to no
one else in the world.</p>

<p>And her zealous retrieving of the letter showed that she watched
out for his good.</p>

<p>No letter had come for Hugh Monckton...No communications at all.
He had perhaps a private box at the post office. Or perhaps on
first setting out with Gloria for the Islands of the Blest he had
cut himself adrift from his kind. That was most likely true because
no one had called to see him. He had left no address. Probably he
was in that obscure hotel in order really to cover his tracks. And
wasn't it likely that in confiding to Henry Martin so considerable
a trust he was showing that he had lost touch with his social kind?
That neighbourhood even now swarmed with English. Rich English.
Hugh Monckton must, if he had wanted to in the ordinary course,
have been able to find half a dozen men he knew better than Henry
Martin.</p>

<p>That he should have so confided was not as extraordinary as it
appeared. It is not at all unusual to meet men whom one would trust
on sight with one's most vital affairs. It would be too much to say
that it happened every day and one doesn't very often trust
strangers with one's intimate secrets. But it is not at all
unusual...In a very short space of time he himself had met Hugh
Monckton, Eudoxie and Lamoricière...</p>

<p>And Hugh Monckton had been as ready to trust Lamoricière as
Henry Martin had been&mdash;and almost as much on sight. That man was
made to be trusted...You even trusted him in spite of yourself. As
it were unconsciously. He, Henry Martin, had made up his mind not
to indulge in that speculation. Then, next moment, he had heard
himself putting all that money into the hands of that black-bearded
fellow. Unconditionally. For the purpose of conducting a
speculation.</p>

<p>That dreadful day that had ended in pain!...The seventeenth of
August.</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel had gone into her room just after the doctor
had finished re-bandaging his face. M. Lamoricière had apparently
not made up his quarrel with the dark girl. He stood with
Napoleonic folded arms over by the window. His sunk head made his
black beard stick forward like a brush from his chest. His forehead
was rather&mdash;not very&mdash;bald.</p>

<p>He had advanced immediately upon Henry Martin. He was between
Eudoxie in her chair and Henry Martin's face. He began at once an
apology. The introduction was very long and stately. It disclaimed
on the part of M. Lamoricière any claim to interfere into the
affairs of Henry Martin...It took Henry Martin some time to realize
that he was begging forgiveness for having locked the door between
Henry Martin and Jeanne Becquerel the night before.</p>

<p>He said he had been in a quandary. He did not of course know
what he knew now. The hour had been late. There had been
large&mdash;very large!-sums of money lying about. And valuables worth
even more than the sums of money...He knew of course that the
English were more careless in these things than his own countrymen.
Still it had seemed a little exaggerated...There was an unlocked
drawer in the secretary...Hugh Monckton went everywhere with a
Napoleonic officer's travelling bureau. It was an ingenious piece
of walnut-wood furniture...Ingenious in the heavy way of the
eighteen-tens.</p>

<p>As M. Lamoricière did not finish his sentence as to the contents
of the unlocked drawer Henry Martin took it that they had been of
great value. He made a sign that he wanted to speak. He said he
could not remember what had been left in the drawer. Shock had
driven it out of his mind.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière had made a note of the contents. He had a large
notebook and sat stiffly. There had been two books of notes of
French currency: one for fifty thousand, the other for sixty
thousand francs. He had taken the liberty of introducing into
it:...He began to read a list of jewellery: a gold watch: a
valuable pair of cuff-links: a lapis-lazuli signet ring. A number
of...</p>

<p>Henry Martin had waved his hand. He might be taken to know what
his personal effects consisted of. In his creaking whisper he asked
that M. Lamoricière should put his ear next his own mouth.</p>

<p>The doctor had suggested that his voice-failure was
self-induced. But it grew more and more difficult to speak. He said
he wanted to see Mademoiselle Yu-Yu's face. M. Lamoricière placed a
hairy ear next Henry Martin's dry lips.</p>

<p>These things had been difficult of arrangement. His head had
been again swimming. But he had kept on. He had a desperate desire
to know what the dark girl thought of him. M. Lamoricière signalled
to the dark girl to move into another bergere that stood near the
foot of the bed. His composure was unbreakable. He seemed to think
it the most natural thing in the world that Henry Martin should
desire to see the dark girl's face...But he seemed to think that
everything was the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>Henry Martin directed his words towards the dark girl. M.
Lamoricière kept his ear close to Henry Martin's lips. Whilst Henry
Martin spoke M. Lamoricière directed his eyes pensively towards the
carpet. Before he himself spoke he erected himself, rigid and
black, in his cane chair.</p>

<p>Henry Martin addressed them both. He said: they had heard the
doctor's directions as to his immediate future. He intended to
follow them.</p>

<p>The dark girl leaned suddenly towards him, her lips parted.</p>

<p>He whispered on:</p>

<p>He desired to find a villa...But modest...Fit for a very small
establishment with an income at the most of fifty thousand francs a
year...</p>

<p>That should settle it. It should show the dark girl what she had
to accept. She could take it or leave it. On the spot...Her lips
were more widely parted; she sat further forward; her glance seemed
to penetrate his eyes.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière sat up, rigid against the back of his chair.</p>

<p>'That seems very proper,' he said. 'That seems appropriate.' He
made notes in his large black book. He said: 'You would like it
high up. For the sake of a view of the Mediterranean. And to avoid
heat which would be pernicious to you in your condition.'</p>

<p>He asked if, for the sake of his eyes, he might close the
curtains. The sunlight had been streaming in. He came back in a
soothing dimness. He said he hoped that did not prevent Monsieur's
seeing the face of Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>He produced his notebook again...</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'I presume you desire that the lease should be in the name of
Mademoiselle Becquerel...of Madame...That would be the usual
course.'</p>

<p>A convulsion moved Henry Martin's throat. The dark girl was
nodding. She wanted the lease to be in the other's name!</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière went on: he had few such villas on his books. The
estates he dealt in were usually much larger. But with good-will.
And with the aid of Mademoiselle Yu-Yu...</p>

<p>The dark girl said:</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm a good scout!'</p>

<p>'You will perhaps desire,' M. Lamoricière said, 'to pay one or
two years' rent in advance...To secure it. That is not unusual...Or
to take it à volonté...With the option of purchase. In case the
arrangement proves permanent...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Whatever is usual...Generous...'</p>

<p>He lay back on his pillow...He felt faint...It was perhaps
misleading the dark girl...As to his resources...He had fifty
thousand francs. No other certainty...He heard her say that that
was swell. He was a swell guy. Her voice for the moment was a deep
contralto with emotion...He understood that she was indeed a New
Yorker. At that time he had not known her history. It was the first
time he had noticed her English. If she spoke English in a moment
of emotion&mdash;spontaneously&mdash;she must be a New Yorker. That soothed
the part of him that was homesick. As if he would be less
expatriate!...A swell guy too...That was what he was!...</p>

<p>The others began talking villas...One at Dardennes...Too inland.
No view of the Mediterranean. The Villa Pavia...Mon Répos at La
Vallette...Not the one at Bon Rencontre of course.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'My aunt has the Villa Nike at disposal...'</p>

<p><i>Niké</i> meant Victory! He wanted the Villa Niké! He kept his eyes
closed. To rest his voice...He must have more money. She was a New
Yorker. At that time he thought she must have contracted a New York
demimondaine's habits of expenditure...She would make do with less.
He had had a Scotch porridge mug as a child. It was yellow. But
with brown, as if burnt in lettering it said, 'Contented wi'
little but canny wi' mair!'...He must get her a good time. Damn it,
she deserved it. Father and mother had brought the mug home from a
honeymoon voyage. They had been in Luxemburg and the Rhineland and
had returned over Scotland...She deserved...she deserved <i>Le
Secret</i>...</p>

<p>It was odd. How often hadn't he seen <i>Le Secret</i> off St. Mandrier.
With her high spars and tall black hull?...Her screw was so
powerful that when you saw her from a height beating into the <i>port
extérieur</i> against a strong mistral&mdash;with only the mizen set&mdash;you
saw behind her a great trail of blue-green whitish water. A hundred
and fifty yards long. But it had never occurred to him that one day
he might come to think of that marvel as a wedding present for a
New Yorker!</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'It is too ramshackle. It is almost a ruin...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin found that the thought of the twenty silver-white
notes was burning into his being. From behind his right shoulder!
He must have left the painted grip open last night.</p>

<p>Eudoxie said:</p>

<p>'We will make the old she-devil diminish the rent by half. With
the other half we can arrange it tastefully. Besides, that will
much lessen the taxes...</p>

<p>Henry Martin found he was trembling. He clenched his teeth. They
had been knocking together and had hurt his jaw. It was perhaps in
that way that thieves felt at the thought of easy hauls of great
booty. He had once been on a jury in Springfield. A burglar who was
being tried for burgling Mrs. Von Augsburg's had explained. He had
successfully made off with half the diamonds of Mrs. Carl Busch
next door and had been having a good time at Miami. But in coming
away from Mrs. Carl Busch's he had noticed that Mrs. Von Augsburg's
would be extraordinarily easy to break into. The thought had so
distracted him that he had lost all taste for Miami and eventually
he had come back. So the cops had got him.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'If you have sufficient influence with Madame your Aunt the
Villa Nike would be admirable.'</p>

<p>'I can always blackmail my aunt when I really want to,' Eudoxie
answered coolly: 'I have only to threaten to leave Manhattan Beauty
Shop. Or if the case is really serious I can say I intend to open
an opposition business. I am all the Manhattan there is in the
establishment. And eighty per cent of the beauty. And I have enough
capital. And the wholesalers will trust me...Besides the title of
the firm is registered in my name...'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière had wondered that the old lady had fallen into
that trap. For himself he would have thought that the 'New York
Beauty Shop' would have been a better title.</p>

<p>Eudoxie said:</p>

<p>'No, <i>sir</i>?' in English. All French people knew that
Manhattan was a cocktail and all Americans that there must be a
real live New Yorker behind that gilt name...Little old Manhattan
was good enough for her...</p>

<p>And so the cops had got that burglar. Henry Martin kept his eyes
closed. It was perhaps that he was contemplating. But it
wasn't!...It was a puzzling affair. He had hurt Hugh Monckton's
feelings by refusing to take those silver white things. Then, now
that he was a ghost it was his duty to appease that ghost...By
doing what he had asked...But Henry Martin being dead...No, Hugh
Monckton! Being dead his property became no longer his. He had no
right to dispose of it. Not even his ghost had...</p>

<p>Eudoxie was saying remarkable things...Her aunt hadn't fallen
into a trap. They had arranged that Eudoxie should register the
name of the firm under her own name. So as to avoid death duties.
Her aunt would probably die before she did. Then the name of the
firm being Eudoxie's all its essential value would be hers. There
would be no death duties. The extraordinary mania of the French for
evading death duties...They took precautions against those payments
even before they had earned any money. They would rather earn no
money than make the payments.</p>

<p>They were talking in low tones. They thought he was going to
sleep...</p>

<p>It occurred to him that, if he was committing any offence
against the law it was that of evading these death duties...He
ought to pay on the fifty thousand francs. And to see that it was
paid on the rest...But then he was acting in the spirit of the
country. Every Frenchman would applaud that...He could chance
it.</p>

<p>Eudoxie was apparently talking about her traffic in snow. She
was going to abandon that. It would be dastardly.</p>

<p>Apparently in a back parlour of the beauty shop she slipped tiny
papers of snow into face powder packets...She had clients who
trusted her. She would not let them down. Was there so much
happiness in the world? She was carrying on a crusade against the
imbecile wickedness of Authority that hated happiness! The police
had put her in prison for six weeks. Because her boy friend was a
foreigner. And to placate the English police who had discovered the
international supplies...It was understood they would not touch her
now. As long as she was discreet and the traffic did not assume
unreasonable proportions. She was in partnership with her aunt. Her
aunt's political pull was fairly considerable. The police preferred
to let her alone. Besides Eudoxie would rather spend the rest of
her life in prison than let down her favourite clients. The whole
countryside, too, was with her. They all doped. Every other man in
the Arsenal and half the personnel of the Navy. Every day she had
been in prison she had received half a dozen bunches of
flowers.</p>

<p>If what she said was true Eudoxie was a very bad, dark girl. An
enemy of Society with the applause of the Nation. If you evade
death duties you are also an enemy of Society&mdash;with the applause of
the Nation. Fifty million Frenchmen can't be wrong. All the same
there seemed to be something&mdash;what the French called louche about
the situation. His head could not exactly distinguish nice
differences. As regards the French tax-collectors he could say,
couldn't he, that the fifty thousand was pay for work done. And, if
he handed over the Bank of England notes to the principal executor
that fellow could settle about death duties...The chief executor
was, he supposed, the man called Cyril Monckton. That was the
simple course...But...there was an obstacle. He could not think
what the obstacle was...</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was gravely applauding Eudoxie...Could you
entrust twenty thousand pounds in banknotes to a man who applauded
a trafficker in cocaine? With nothing but what they call a note of
hand as security...</p>

<p>Of course the obstacle was that, if he returned the silverwhite
banknotes to Cyril Monckton that fellow would have to be told that
Hugh Monckton was dead...But it was Henry Martin Aluin Smith who
had blown his brains out. That was on the passport. What do you
know about <i>that?</i>...Of course he could return the notes through a
bank which would say that the payment was made by the order of Mr.
Asch Emma Smith! Certainly he was never going to sign Hugh Monckton
Allard...Changing your identity was more difficult than had at
first appeared! Eh, old Bean!</p>

<p>Yes, return the notes by way of a bank. Speculation was too
risky. The 'Monckton A's' would have to be bought before next
Monday. The shares apparently were dropping in fear of a bad
dividend. But the dividend to be declared on Monday was to be one
hundred per cent...It would be an unparalleled opportunity! No one
had ever had such a chance. If you bought the stock with dividend
you netted one hundred per cent at once. With naturally the <i>pro
rata</i> diminution for the price above par of the stock. By spreading
out the money carefully, on cover, you could make...You could make
more than double. Not more than double. With stamp duties if there
were any in England. And Lamoricière's fees...</p>

<p>But before next Monday...How did you operate from that place?
God only knew. It was obvious that he could not go to London. Not
even to Paris...</p>

<p>He opened his tired eyes. The dark girl was holding the door
open. For Lamoricière to go. Henry Martin said: 'Hi!' Desperately.
His voice had completely broken. The dark girl did not hear him.
She seemed to be ages coming towards him. It was God's mercy that
she had not followed that fellow.</p>

<p>He whispered desperately in her ear:</p>

<p>'Get that guy back...<i>Prompto Subito!</i> For God's sake get him
back...Tell him Big Business...Big.</p>

<p>Why in God's name had he sent for him? The girl had gone. She
had said they had thought he had been asleep...</p>

<p>How could he trust that fellow? What did he know about him? He
looked like a Chief of Department in a French Ministry. No chief of
department in a French Ministry could be trusted out with twenty
thousand pounds in cash. Two and a half million francs! It was
unthinkable...</p>

<p>The fellow was a long time coming back.</p>

<p>And there was something <i>louche</i> about the whole thing. It was too
much like getting something for nothing. That was said to be the
American sin. Americans were jeered at all the world over for
that...He would be damned if he would add to the National
discredit. The straight and proper thing was to return the money to
the Cyril Monckton man...Obviously! And work out the morals
later!</p>

<p>He could tell Lamoricière that he had brought him back to give
him a tip about Monckton A's. Out of gratitude. That ought to
please Lamoricière. He might put ten out of his legitimate fifty
thousand francs. Or twenty thousand...Twenty-five! That was the
proper thing. The right thing! That would give him another six
months with Eudoxie. She seemed to be willing to accept a fifty
thousand a year scale of living...In eighteen months he could turn
round too...Write a book about French morality. Sympathetically, of
course!...It was wonderful how calm it made you to have found the
right way...</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was indeed like the French Chief of a Ministerial
Department. He ought to say:</p>

<p>'En quoi puis-je vous etre utile?'...'How can I be of service to
you?' That was exactly what he did say. Whilst he was still holding
the doorknob.</p>

<p>He must have got some way down the stairs. Eudoxie was still
slightly out of breath. She went first to the communication door
and then to the window after she had peeped in. She remained
looking out on the <i>rade</i> intently, through a little division she had
made in the curtains.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière bent his ear to Henry Martin's lips.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that to give up all idea of using those
banknotes was the right thing. Everything pointed to that. Every
circumstance clamoured that. It was only in that way that he could
find the peace of mind that was now necessary to him. He said:</p>

<p>'Next Monday Monckton A's will declare a dividend of a hundred
per cent.'</p>

<p>He had not intended to say just that. But with so little voice
it was difficult to beat about the bush. If he wanted to do a
service to Lamoricière that was the quickest way. He said:</p>

<p>'Of course, in confidence!' He managed to add. 'I have no
objection to your personally...using...the information.'</p>

<p>His heart was beating <i>too</i> fast. He got out:</p>

<p>'Discreetly!'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was sitting like a ramrod. Looking at him! He
made with his head a motion to indicate that Lamoricière should put
his ear down again. He whispered&mdash;with extraordinary speed:</p>

<p>'The big grip is open?...Yes...You did not close it last
night...I wish to benefit...' His head swam...'A young friend...'
Well he wasn't old!</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière whispered:</p>

<p>'Yes...Yes...' Excitement was perhaps gaining him too.</p>

<p>'You will find in the grip...In the left hand...side flap.'
Between each group of words his heart beat violently...'A
small...square...pigskin portefeuille. To hold English
banknotes...' He could tell the man to mail them to the executor!
They were not safe there anyhow...</p>

<p>He had read constantly in French novels that in moments of
excitement men's brows drip with sweat. His brows were dry.
Prickly!</p>

<p>Lamoricière was a long time gone. Behind his head.</p>

<p>The notes were gone!...They must be gone...His heart stopped
beating this time! His brow was dripping...There would be only the
little wads of French notes. It was too little...He had lost
Eudoxie...It was no doubt the waiter...Or the old woman who had
cupped him...He had lost Eudoxie!</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière was standing beside him, looking passionlessly
down at the pigskin note-case.</p>

<p>He whispered:</p>

<p>'They must be put in a place of safety.' That was all that was
in his mind. They must be put in a place of safety...They were the
future of himself and Eudoxie. He whispered: 'Open it...Count the
notes...there should be twenty...'</p>

<p>The case was too high above his sight for him to see the notes.
He heard them rustle. Lamoricière was fingering them deliberately.
He said at last:</p>

<p>'Yes: there are twenty...I have a safe at the Credit
Lyonnais...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'You understand...For the benefit of my little...no, my
young...friend...Any profit you may make in Monckton A's...'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière bent his head forward and erected it again. A
sign that he understood. He said:</p>

<p>'A little speculation...a safe one!...For a...a dependant...That
seems very proper...'</p>

<p>Henry Martin said:</p>

<p>'Not in my name...I do not wish to sign papers....The capital to
be returned...Intact...your commission...'</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière said:</p>

<p>'I do not take commissions when operating for a friend. That is
not my metier. I am a real-estate agent.'</p>

<p>Then there was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>M. Lamoricière began an oration: He appreciated Monsieur's trust
in him. It was a pleasure to be connected with interests so vast.
He would avail himself of Monsieur's information. It would be of
the greatest service. And Monsieur could be sure of his discretion.
Were their interests not the same? It was obvious that any
divulgence of information to third or fourth parties would defeat
their joint aims...</p>

<p>It all seemed very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The dark girl had turned him down. He might have expected it.
But not for the reason she gave. It was just his luck. He presumed
he had not given pleasure...Not at all...If it had been the night
before last! If it had been before the sail blew away! If it had
not been to that room he had contrived to be brought...If he had
been brought to her all bruised and bleeding...</p>

<p>He expressed blind passion for her. She whispered:</p>

<p>'I had thought it...Jeanne Becquerel was asleep just now.' Her
face was extraordinarily fixed. As still as a Japanese painting. He
said that at the first time he had heard her voice...She said:</p>

<p>'They say that...But I believe you...For as long as it
lasts...But I believe you for as long as it usually lasts...If you
had chosen to be anyone else...Or any other room...</p>

<p>He did not understand her. She said:</p>

<p>'If you had not been a millionaire...If you had not chosen
that...</p>

<p>He swore he was a beggar...With enough for a year's
happiness...</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'Yes, I know...But one does not get a year's happiness. It is
not what one is here for...Not people like you. Or me...'</p>

<p>His voice had come back. He was half out of bed trying to catch
her hands! He exclaimed loudly:</p>

<p>'That is nonsense...I have just come out of Hell...'</p>

<p>She gave him her hand to soothe him and stood looking down at
him. She was cool and good-humoured. She said:</p>

<p>'Moses saw into the promised land...We are like Moses...'</p>

<p>He exclaimed, again loudly:</p>

<p>'I shall be rich...I promise...In a day or two I will buy the
yacht <i>Le Secret</i>...'</p>

<p>She said, as if she were afraid:</p>

<p>'You must not do that...You must not be mad...I do not like rich
people...There are too many poor to think about...I should be
unable to think. Out of fear for you and because of the bread-lines
too...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'I swear I am not a thief!' so loudly that she looked back over
her shoulder, drawing at her hands...At Jeanne Becquerel's door.
She said:</p>

<p>'I have, of course, known some thieves. One was afraid for
them...But we are made for renunciation.'</p>

<p>Her looking backwards had stung him. He said contemptuously:</p>

<p>'You talk like a Protestant. One would say you had read that
fellow's book..."Strait is the path and narrow the gate..."'</p>

<p>'Does it astonish you?' she said. 'I am a Lutheran...We are in
great strength here. It is our country.'</p>

<p>That stunned him. He said:</p>

<p>'But...Then he found no words.</p>

<p>She was a light woman. Up for sale to the highest bidder. Or he
had thought so. Yet she talked of renunciation. It did not hang
together...He tried to check all she had said...If this had been
the night before last, she had said...If it had been before the
sail blew away...If it had not been to that room that he had
contrived to come...Perhaps it hung together...There might be
reason in her madness. But she was mad.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'You are mad...You love me...'</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'I think so...As these things go...If it is a consolation, I
feel for you as I never felt for another...But that is perhaps more
torturing to you.'</p>

<p>He said no, she must tell him. He tried to draw her down towards
him...She looked again towards the door behind her, the strong
sinew of her throat rigid beneath the skin. She nearly laughed.</p>

<p>'Of course we can speak English,' she said. 'I had forgotten.
Lie down. You may kiss me before Jeanne Becquerel...Lie
down...'</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'Listen, honey...These things happen...I guess I felt as strong
a lech for you the night before last...And it has gotten stronger.
That's O.K...'</p>

<p>She was speaking calmly and dispassionately. Her American hurt
him.</p>

<p>'These things do happen,' she said. 'I guess you may call it
love. I guess that's what love is. Having no experience...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'Speak French...'</p>

<p>She answered:</p>

<p>'No, no...If Jeanne Becquerel heard...'</p>

<p>He cursed that girl. She said:</p>

<p>'You cannot save a life...if it is a suicide...and then torture
worse than the Third Degree. Even a cop wouldn't. And you're too
swell a guy...'</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>'The hell I am...'</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'I'd have slept with you...Jesus, I would...Till what happened
last night.'</p>

<p>He exclaimed: Christ, she didn't think that he...</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'A gentleman doesn't kiss and tell...An honest to God gent
doesn't <i>not</i> kiss and tell. It's even less genteel...'</p>

<p>He said he swore that...She leant down and took his head in her
arms. She whispered:</p>

<p>'Listen, honey,' again. It was torturing. She spoke French like
Prosper Merimée, English like a Caféteria waitress...Was that what
New York did for loveliness?</p>

<p>'I guess,' she went on, 'with us French girls in sex it's all
the same as with liquor. We get wine as kids so keeping on the
water wagon's no effort...It's an effort to keep off you,
honey...You're too swell a water wagon for it not to be...' She was
stroking his sound cheek...She said: 'You can see for yourself,
lovebird...' She had left New York when she was twelve...She said:
'Mamour, mamour. C'est la tragédie inscrutable de la vie
humaine...Qu'il faut...'</p>

<p>She held her head back so as to look at him down the lane of her
black lashes. They were heavy with...</p>

<p>He had forgotten the name of the stuff. He had known it well
once...His head was not on her breast...He had once helped Mrs.
Percival put it on...For a costume ball. She was going alone with
Al...</p>

<p>The world stopped...It was as if it went to the centre of the
world...That doctor had said...Pain...</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>'It would be too damn hard for the kid...She's a swell kid...Oh,
hell, she's been through hell too...'</p>

<p>Her voice was like thunder. He was sobbing on her breast. You
could not believe such pain was...</p>

<p>She called out:</p>

<p>'Jeanne Becquerel...Jeanne Becquerel...Viens vite...Ton homme
est...' 'Come quickly...Your man is...'</p>

<p>There was nothing but the knife going through the temples from
side to side.</p>

<p><br>That had been exactly three weeks before the day on which he had
watched the dawn from his bed. No...exactly twenty days. It was
three weeks to the sixteenth. He did not remember those twenty days
too well. The fifteenth and sixteenth were clear enough in his
memory. It was like what they say of old men, they remember the
events of their youth better than the day before yesterday...He was
certainly not an old man...Free, male...But was he either?...At any
rate he was rising thirty-six. What you called the prime of life:
though until you had been through it yourself he did not see how
you could tell!</p>

<p>And no doubt those two days had aged him...What could you
expect?</p>

<p>It is the desperate thing about human life that sorrow never
comes and goes alone. You suffer; then you have to suffer more
because you have suffered...They call it 'sorrow leaving its
traces!' It had certainly left its traces on him...</p>

<p>Though you wouldn't say so, to see him lie in a gorgeous bed,
with a scented beard, in green pyjamas of heavy silk and a Japanese
crocheted white stork on each breast pocket. Looking out over the
Mediterranean&mdash;with houris kissing their hands to him every time
they left him for ten minutes...Those girls made him scent his
beard!</p>

<p>But Destiny is probably virtuous and reads the gospels...It
hands you bouquets with its right hand; but its left, not knowing
that you are a favoured individual, socks you one that damn near
leaves you down for the count. And certainly inappreciative of the
plaudits! It had done that for Hugh Monckton&mdash;'Some people as <i>hall</i>
the luck.'...Now it was presumably doing it for him, Henry
Martin...It wasn't true to say: 'Never the time, the place and the
loved one all together...' They were all there...But...What a
hope?</p>

<p>He drew Hugh Monckton's letter from under his pillow. It was the
final gift of the right hand of Destiny...The propitious one. God
knew where the left was going to sock him next...Long Melford, they
used to call it. The Straight Left!...But he had his charter...To
himself. The stuff to ease the New England Conscience!...He had
awakened extraordinarily cheerful that morning. As if overnight he
had been proclaimed Emperor of China...Well it had been something
like that...He was secure in bed and board. And he hadn't had
something for nothing. Hugh Monckton had begun his immense,
sprawled letter by saying right away that Henry Martin had killed
him and you have to accept favours from the people you have killed.
Just as you have to split yourself to serve those whose life you
save...</p>

<p>Nothing less than that!</p>

<p>The letter began:</p>

<p>'Look here you Yankee! You put the kibosh on this Johnnie.
You've got, in honour bound, to do what you can to appease his
wrathful ghost...'</p>

<p>Twenty days...For three of them that doctor had kept him under
with a strong opiate. Then for twelve more he had bromided him into
a moron. He knew that because when Lamoricière had come in with an
authorization to bearer from the head office of the Crèdit Lyonnais
to draw for six million odd francs he had felt as if it had been
Hugh Monckton's valet coming in to say that his bath was ready and
his eggs had been on four minutes and ten seconds...He had spent
two days trying to reckon what six million odd francs made in
dollars, pounds sterling and other fancy currencies. On the next
day the doctor had taken him off bromides and he had spent it
weeping on the breasts alternately of Jeanne Becquerel and the dark
girl. That was the thirteenth day. On the fourteenth day they had
taught him to play <i>belotte</i> on an invalid table attached to his bed.
On the fifteenth he had taught them rummy at a table near the
window. The waters of the <i>rade</i> had been like viscous glass:
dove-coloured. He had seen <i>Le Secret</i> come in and be moored under
the window. On the fourteenth, against the doctor's orders, but
accompanied by that Inquisitor, M. Lamoricière and the two girls he
had been driven to the local branch of the Crèdit Lyonnais. His
beard was like a hedgehog's spines but his temples were still in
bandages. At the head of his cortege he had been received like the
chief mourner at a swell funeral. He had hardly been able to keep
his mind on the conversation of the bank-manager but he hoped he
had succeeded in paying two and a half million francs to the
account of Hugh Monckton Allard Smith at the Bank of England...By
direction of H.M.A.S.</p>

<p>That had been such a load off his mind that he had seemed well
enough to let Jeanne Becquerel and Eudoxie by turns drive him to
see the Villa Nike. In his Monckton!...He had not been strong
enough to climb up the hill to the villa. It was pink: standing a
hundred yards up off a side road. Eudoxie had driven timidly; but
Jeanne Becquerel had taken the car like the very devil over
atrocious roads behind a mountain. He had seen on the roadside
under le Revest the grave...It was a bare square, all alone in a
dry field they had lately added to the cemetery. Eudoxie had cried.
Their white wreaths had gone brown under the torrid sun. But from
where he lay he could see the Mediterranean, miles down the valley.
If he was any more interested in the Mediterranean...</p>

<p>When they had got back to the hotel Jeanne Becquerel had taken
cables to his father, and sister Carrie and Alice. To each he said,
'Newspaper reports erroneous. Feel no anxiety.' He had signed
'H.M.A.S...' Jeanne Becquerel had asked to be allowed to send the
wires. The post office was just round the corner. She wanted to try
the streets. She had not been in them for six weeks!</p>

<p>Whilst she was gone he pleaded once more with the dark girl. She
told him to remember his head and begged him to vouchsafe a few
endearments to Jeanne Becquerel. She made him understand that if he
pressed her again he should never see her alone. She said certainly
she loved him.</p>

<p>When Jeanne Becquerel came in again he offered her an account of
her own for fifty thousand francs; a platinum wrist watch; a
Monckton eight or a Packard. She refused them all. She said that on
the night he was well she would take a diamond ring.</p>

<p>Eudoxie said she would take the fifty thousand francs and bank
it for Jeanne Becquerel. On a former occasion Jeanne Becquerel's
mother had been too dumb to ask for proper settlements. But she,
Eudoxie, was a New Yorker with no flies on her. Men would now find
Jeanne Becquerel a different proposition. Jeanne Becquerel said
there would be no other man. Eudoxie said that that was all the
more reason to take the fifty thousand...</p>

<p>It was queer, when they went into the great café on the Rade
under the hotel Americans ignored Henry Martin. He might not have
existed...He was a bearded Frenchman with two French girls. The
place was full of Americans, nights, because of the heat-wave. When
they stepped on Jeanne Becquerel's toes or knocked his hat off the
table they never apologized...A fellow he had known rather well
because he had been one of the literary squad at Dartmouth&mdash;called
Harold Cripps&mdash;told him he had once dressed up as a plumber. He had
been aiming at Journalism. He said it had been like being dead.
Because no women looked at him. When dressed as a sophomore or a
dry goods drummer he could catch glances&mdash;ranging from glad eyes to
dulled casualness. But, as a mechanic, he was one with the refuse
boxes at street corners.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had thought at the time that had been because,
anyhow, Harold Cripps, was rather an unpresentable little rat. Now
he knew! It was not so much that women avoided his glances. All did
not. There are American women who will take up with niggers or any
native. But with the men it was universal. He was a Dago He had
gone native. The Declaration of Independence no longer applied to
him. All men are <i>not</i> born free and equal...In the brilliant
illumination outside the buzzing shades of the café the polyglot,
polychromatic crowd of the port drifted by against the moonlight.
It was full moon on the twenty-eighth...Innumerable niggers in
khaki with scarlet fezzes, Algerian carpetsellers, little
Indo-Chinese women: Hawaiians, unimaginable Germans; little
sailors...He was one with them. He wondered any French were allowed
in that café...</p>

<p>There was a Montparnassian called Jimmy Stout. Henry Martin had
known him once and then had ceased to know him. Alice had been
behaving rather freely one night at the Dôme. Mr. Stout had
misunderstood her intentions. As she had not been very canned on
that occasion Alice had complained to Henry Martin...At any rate
Mr. Stout had every opportunity of knowing Henry Martin by
sight!</p>

<p>On the night of the third of September Jimmy Stout, a squat,
heavy jowled ignominy in a very tight beret, had been sitting two
or three tables away from Henry Martin and Jeanne Becquerel.
Eudoxie had been up at her aunt's to arrange about the moving into
the Villa Niké. They had obtained a lease of the place for an
almost infinitesimal rent. The old lady had considered that she
would get it back in the repairs they would effectuate and the
perfumes Jeanne Becquerel would buy.</p>

<p>Henry Martin had been in the inside of the café. When he came
back Jeanne Becquerel complained that the fat man had insulted her
outrageously. Henry Martin had sat down and stared straight at
Jimmy. Fixedly. For nearly a minute. The fat man had fidgeted,
rubbing his right hand over his cheek and trying to return the
stare. There had been no sign of recognition about his furtive
glances. When Henry Martin had half risen rather precipitately the
fat man had bolted into a knot of his countrymen who were occupying
half a dozen tables at the other end of the long terrace...</p>

<p>On the other hand several American women&mdash;usually stout&mdash;bowed
and smiled ostentatiously at Eudoxie. One, very stout indeed, came
up to their table and addressing Eudoxie as if she had been the
Queen of England, said that she had reduced three hectos. She said
Madame Eudoxie's method was marvellous. She wore as many diamonds
as the wife of a French wholesale greengrocer. Her be-paunched
husband in white ducks sucked at an immense cigar behind her. The
ash was two inches long. He managed at last to get in that he had
met Mr. Hugh Monckton Allard Smith, <span class=
"smcap">V.C.</span>, in New York with his father Sir Charles...His
wife bustled him away, shockedly, into the middle of the American
group. Faces from there turned towards them frequently...</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel distinguished herself that evening. Eudoxie
always blazed. She had returned from her aunt's wearing a black
satin, skin-tight vest above her immense pyjama trousers. Her lips
and cheeks were scarlet: her lashes so heavy that you would have
said she could not raise them. She had brought in a tiny white
paper a minute portion of snow for Henry Martin to try. It had had
no effect on him.</p>

<p>But Jeanne Becquerel had been in white. No doubt white <i>crêpe de
chine</i>. But on Eudoxie's mentioning a dress of some Eastern Queen
she had jumped up and run into the hotel.</p>

<p>While she had been gone Eudoxie had revealed that Henry Martin
had been in luck to meet her at that <i>dancing</i>. He had been trying to
find out whether she had been there again. She said that, on
Saturday evenings when the farmer, her aunt's husband, came into
town she looked in at most of the respectable places of
entertainment after half-past eleven. If she saw her uncle she got
one of the waiters to telephone up to the farm and held her uncle
in conversation until one of her cousins came and took him
home...Henry Martin remembered that he had first seen her in
conversation with an earthy man and a dull girl. Her uncle might go
to the Red Light quarter or even to Marseilles once a month to
<i>faire la bombe</i>. But, for the rest, he was as avaricious as his wife
and next day was grateful to his niece for having caused him to
save money. Besides the old peasant was not insensible to the
prestige it gave him to be seen sitting in a semi-public place with
any one so striking and well-known as his niece Eudoxie...</p>

<p>Jeanne Becquerel came hobbling, with short steps, between the
impressed tables full. She was in Cardinal's scarlet with azure
blue dragons in embroidery that climbed amorously all round her
figure. She had narrowed her eyes with Kohl, and her hair,
mucilaged straight back, was transfixed with foot-long pins that
had carved, jade tops...The Americans she ignored but she scattered
smiles on the French tables and got a sufficiency back. Henry
Martin realized that she was not above reaping the fruits of an
innocent triumph. She was showing the inhabitants of the city that
she had more than kept her end up...She put her arms about his neck
for an instant. To show that the English Milor was hers.</p>

<p>He had gone native indeed. And he was beginning to penetrate the
habits of his fellow savages...He ought, of course, to have known
that a girl who was one of the principal commercial ornaments of
that place and whose salary and share of the profits of an
expensive establishment amounted probably to more than those of the
admiral commanding the station would not sit for hire in a <i>dancing</i>.
But he hadn't known it.</p>

<p>What he could never have penetrated on his own was why she
should sit there at all. It was democracy. He had once asked a
Southern girl with a deep and earnest contralto voice why when she
got among other Southerners she&mdash;and they all!&mdash;elevated their
voices into shrieks that were hardly believable. As if they had
been calling to distances, along cliffs, against the wind. The girl
had said: 'Well, they're not all First Families of Virginia here.
But most of us have been to Kids' school together. So we mustn't
high hat the others.'</p>

<p>It had been like that with Eudoxie. She made opportunities to go
into the <i>dancings</i>. On weeks when her uncle went to Marseilles she
would get the <i>commis</i> of big perfumery firms to take her there to
dance and would nod at the girls who sat there for hire or make up
their faces from her own vanity accoutrements, in the cloakroom. It
was she said: 'le coq qu'elle devait à Esculape'...the cock she
owed to Aesculapius...</p>

<p>So that he had next to all that he wanted, for he took all the
rest of her to be a compound of virtues and spices!</p>

<p>As they drifted past the American quarter a voice said:</p>

<p>'That's the Madame of the Beauty shop.' It seemed to be produced
by a throat of parched brick. 'The other's the chief mannequin of
Call-lo's.' Voices said: 'No, Chanel's...No, Poiret's...I seen her
there...'</p>

<p>A voice like Stentor's roared:</p>

<p>'He's hiring the Queen of Sheba for a third...We can't all be
Rockefellers...' Another: 'But we can keep from being
beavers...'</p>

<p>They strolled past those people as if they had been third class
passengers.</p>

<p>And, next day the last of the difficulties solved itself. With
the letter that Eudoxie gave him and that he held under his fingers
on the driving wheel...</p>

<p>A year or so ago he had been at a reception. A French royalist
deputy had been there, a high-nosed, red-faced Norman. He had
spoken English better than Henry Martin. The moment he had heard
that Henry Martin was American he had begun to pick at him.
Gradually he had worked himself up to an oration. Shouting. He had
said that America had ruined the world. Because she wanted
something for nothing. Others gave genius, labour, civilization,
lives in millions. America had given nothing and hoarded up
everything. He had gone on for a long time, citing innumerable
instances...</p>

<p>How that might be Henry Martin did not know. He was unacquainted
with the ground. If other nations were such fools as to let one
nation get something for nothing he didn't see why it
shouldn't.</p>

<p>But for his own person there had suddenly spoken within him&mdash;the
New England Conscience! It would be too much to say that that
problem of life had become with him a morbid obsession. But it had
worried him. He might, for instance, have taken proceedings against
his publisher; but the thought that the sales of <span class=
"smcap">be thou chaste</span> had been really due to the
illustrator had stopped him. No doubt if he had actually begun
proceedings the fellow would have paid him at least something. Then
he would not have been driven to commit suicide at the same moment
as the other fellow. His whole life would have been changed. He
would have been still at Garqueiranne, holding the knitting work
for the old ladies and pottering about the shores in the boat with
the scarlet sail! He had mildly pleased that little group, just as
now he had another little group that liked him. He picked up little
groups so easily.</p>

<p>It was without doubt due to his hybrid origin&mdash;He was a product
of a wild boar of the Ardennes and a First Family of Fall River.
The New England Conscience could be acquisitive enough. Boston,
according to Southerners, had grown rich out of the Slave Trade and
as soon as the Slave Trade had become obnoxious to world policy it
had howled for the walloping of the South to whom it had sold the
slaves&mdash;slave-manufactured products competing with those of its own
cotton mills.</p>

<p>No: he had no illusions as to want of acquisitiveness going
along with a delicate moral sense. The trouble was that the New
England Conscience was critical. New England would reconcile with
its conscience the sale of slaves as long as the sale of slaves was
practicable. But, while it could do that, it considered, say,
buccaneering as most reprehensible. It would have no truck with
that Central American practice. It was Nordic and don't you forget
it. It excelled at drawing lines! Before all things else.</p>

<p>The devil was if you inherited half your blood from Buccaneers
and half from Fall River First Families. Father and mother had been
able to run their ship all right because when occasions called for
buccaneering father could attend to it and when you had to remember
that you were a First Family of Springfield mother took you in hand
and made you put away your gold-headed cane. But when you had the
two strains inside yourself...You could not buccaneer efficiently
because your left hand considered it indelicate to go beyond
selling slaves. It was as if <i>Le Secret</i> went yawing all over the
bay. Instead of sailing near the wind!</p>

<p>He would be damned if he was irresolute. He would face anything.
The times were out of joint but the cursed spite was that he was
not the fellow that was called to set them right.</p>

<p>It was perhaps that that was the matter with America...With the
world. There was too much hybridization. Affairs were no longer in
the hands of people who ran true to type. Eighty per cent of the
population of New England was of confused Dago origin. Yet the
critical power of the region remained in the hands of the
Hill...And was paralysing!</p>

<p>Over the body of Hugh Monckton, Henry Martin III had eventually
triumphed over H.M.A.S. I and II. I, was no doubt the normal Henry
Martin of Fall River Psychology: II, which had wanted to take the
passport for a lark, was father's product: the child of the wild
boar of the Ardennes. (The aristocrat of poor mother's family had
naturally to be a refined bandit who refused to take something for
nothing. Taking from the rich what he gave to the poor and so
getting to heaven in true New England fashion!)...But Henry Martin
III who had eventually won the day had been the acquisitive
instinct that was at the bottom of both Luxemburg and
Massachusetts&mdash;of the cave man that was at the bottom of all
types.</p>

<p>So there Henry Martin had walked&mdash;a milor, a Rockefeller&mdash;before
a parterre of ragtag and bobtail, with, on each arm, a whore of
surprising costume and grace...And expected to acquire an even more
dissolute and alluring third!</p>

<p>But underneath that magnificent, international figure there had
still been the lean, troubled Henry Martin of Fall River
Conscience. He had money and was afraid to use it. He had actually
said to Jeanne Becquerel that they must keep within a margin of
fifty thousand francs a year. Not out of a spirit of economy, but
because he shrank from the fiercer pleasures that might be earned
from the millions&mdash;in francs&mdash;that he had gotten, for nothing! He
could not see how he had earned even the use of the twenty thousand
pounds with which he had speculated...</p>

<p>Those two girls had accepted his orders with delight. They
seemed to make him almost French. That was what they wanted to
complete their idyll...He could see, however, that Eudoxie was
puzzled. It appeared to her not to fit in with the spirit of a
gentleman who gave away gold rings on sight and presented his last
three hundred and ninety-four francs to a mere acquaintance!...She
had taken him for a bold and ingenious thief. That had troubled her
because she had thought she might have to worry over his
arrest...But thieves squandered. One who, having millions at his
disposal, proposed to live with a lovely mistress on a sum fitted
only for a comfortable but careful middle class family&mdash;that
puzzled her. It ravished Jeanne Becquerel, who asked for nothing
better than comfort based on economy.</p>

<p>But Eudoxie had arrived very near the truth. By the morning on
which they went fishing! It was obvious to her that he was not a
thief. That he had been given a moderate sum that he might conceal
from the world the fact that Hugh Monckton had committed
suicide...For the sake of the shareholders of the Monckton
concerns!...And she had felt immense relief when he had told her
that that ominous letter had made things all right once and for
all.</p>

<p>It was whilst re-reading Hugh Monckton's letter that he had the
full sense of her perspicacity! With an immense amount of beating
about the bush, army slang and endearing epithets Hugh Monckton
asked that Henry Martin should do his best to conceal his suicide.
That request was the occasion of the letter. Whilst speeding
between St. Jean du Var and Hyeres the idea had come into his
aching head. If the startling news of his death by his own hand
were broadcasted across the world there was no knowing what effect
it might not have on the Monckton concerns...His shareholders were
mostly old-fashioned, quiet investors who would be so troubled by
sudden fluctuations that he almost thought he had not the right to
kill himself. But, relying on Henry Martin, he was going to take
the chance. If he didn't kill himself by putting his Monckton at
the bullfinch he would do it with his revolver.</p>

<p>But he begged Henry Martin to do his best to suppress the news.
Temporarily at least. For good if possible. It would do his
father's memory no good; it would militate against all that he
stood for. It might even hurt Gloria. And, Henry Martin knew that
he would give away everything that he possessed rather than that
for one second Gloria's white brow should be wrinkled by pain.</p>

<p>What Hugh Monckton wanted was to drop out. Unnoticed. If all
trace of him could be lost so much the better. He had already done
what he could to cover his tracks. That was why he had been staying
in that unspeakable hotel. He had told his boring cousin Cyril
Monckton that he was going away for years&mdash;with a woman unnamed...At
the end of years, the English courts would give leave to 'presume
his decease.'...It was doing Cyril Monckton no great injustice. He
was rich enough already and in due course would come into his,
Hugh's, shekels.</p>

<p>There was money in lashings to effectuate this. Henry Martin
could buy up the reporters; he could bribe officials wholesale. As
residuary legatee all the money lying about was at his
disposal...There was no end to the considerations that Hugh
Monckton produced...It was tragic to hear his lamentable voice
pleading!</p>

<p>Henry Martin read the sixteen scrawled pages of the letter by
the light of a single candle in the dim saloon of the Villa Nike.
As happens in France the electric light had not yet been put on.
And it was as if, from standing astride of the grips in the hotel
room, Hugh Monckton had come to stand in the shadows of that place.
Henry Martin could see his very hand, with the strap of the gun
about the wrist, move in that passionate pleading.</p>

<p>And there was the final plea...It was Henry Martin who had
killed him. Until they had been walking across the painted Place du
Theatre in the deathly sirocco there had seemed still one
possibility of escape for that tormented mortal. But the contempt
in Henry Martin's voice when he had uttered the words: 'The Foreign
Legion!'&mdash;that had made Hugh Monckton see that there was only one
means of escape! How indeed was he with his destroyed physique to
stand the businesslike gruelling of that life under a torrid
African sun?...What a hope indeed!</p>

<p>'Then,' Hugh Monckton adjured, 'do me this favour, old bean. It
is all one whether I die to-night or after two months of hell in
Oran. I shall go certainly to a far better place than that
stink-hole. I have no remorse. But do this in expiation. Old bean,
I have never been so grieved. Surely my awful shade shall be
unappeased in Phlegethon...Good old Achilles, you know...Then to
appease me&mdash;For indeed old bean, you're the first man I felt I
could talk to&mdash;unburden myself&mdash;in donkeys' ages&mdash;donkeys' and
donkeys' ages...Except Gloria and she took insufficient pleasure in
my unburdenments...'</p>

<p>He begged Henry Martin to hire <i>Le Secret</i>&mdash;or any equivalent
abode of bliss on the earth, the waters of the earth or the waters
under the earth. And to take any little piece...And the remains of
the <i>Fine de la République</i>. And any oddments and spondulicks as he
believed they called it beneath the folds of the starspangled
one...And so to prolong for Hugh Monckton, here on earth, the jolly
old beanfeast that, by all odds his own mortal career should have
witnessed...</p>
