<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><i>Nine years ago the writer had occasion to make a hasty will.
Since one of the provisions of this document appointed Conrad the
writers literary executor, we fell to discussing the question of
literary biographies in general and our own in particular. We hit,
as we generally did, very quickly upon a formula, both having a
very great aversion to the usual official biography for men of
letters whose lives are generally uneventful. But we agreed that
should a writer's life have interests beyond the mere writing upon
which he had employed himself, this life might well be the subject
of a monograph. It should then be written by an artist and be a
work of art. To write:</i> "Joseph Conrad Korzeniowski was born on
such a day of such a year in the town of 'So and So' in the
Government of Kieff", <i>and so to continue would not conduce to
such a rendering as this great man desired. So, here, in the
measure of the ability vouchsafed, you have a projection of Joseph
Conrad as, little by little, he revealed himself to a human being
during many years of close intimacy. It is so that, by degrees,
Lord Jim appeared to Marlowe, or that every human soul by degrees
appears to every other human soul. For, according to our view of
the thing, a novel should be the biography of a man or of an
affair, and a biography, whether of a man or an affair, should be a
novel, both being, if they are efficiently performed, renderings of
such affairs as are our human lives.</i></p>

<p><i>This then is a novel, not a monograph; a portrait, not a
narration: for what it shall prove to be worth, a work of art, not
a compilation. It is conducted exactly along the lines laid down by
us, both for the novel which is biography and for the biography
which is a novel. It is the rendering of an affair intended first
of all to make you see the subject in his scenery. It contains no
documentation at all; for it no dates have been looked up; even all
the quotations but two have been left unverified, coming from the
writer's memory. It is the writer's impression of a writer who
avowed himself impressionist. JVhere the writer's memory has proved
to be at fault over a detail afterwards out of curiosity looked up,
the writer has allowed the fault to remain on the page; but as to
the truth of the impression as a whole, the writer believes that no
man would care&mdash;or dare&mdash;to impugn it. It was that that
Joseph Conrad asked for: the task has been accomplished with the
most pious scrupulosity.</i> For something human was to him dearer
than the wealth of the Indies.</p>

<p>He was small rather than large in height; very broad in the
shoulder and long in the arm; dark in complexion with black hair
and a clipped black beard. He had the gestures of a Frenchman who
shrugs his shoulders frequently. When you had really secured his
attention he would insert a monocle into his right eye and
scrutinise your face from very near as a watchmaker looks into the
works of a watch. Fie entered a room with his head held high,
rather stiffly and with a haughty manner, moving his head once
semicircularly. In this one movement he had expressed to himself
the room and its contents; his haughtiness was due to his
determination to master that room, not to dominate its occupants,
his chief passion being the realisation of aspects to himself.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In the Pent Farm, beneath the South Downs, there was a great
kitchen with a wavy brick floor. On this floor sat a great many
cats; they were needed to keep down rats and they got some milk of
a morning. Every morning a wild robin with a red breast and
greenish-khaki body would hop, not fly, across the floor of the
kitchen between the waiting cats. The cats would avert their
glances, pulsing their sheathed claws in and out. The robin would
hop through the inner doorway of the kitchen, across an angle of
the low dining-room and so up the bedroom stairs. When the maid
with the morning letters and the tea tray opened the bedroom door
the robin would fly through the low, dark room and perch on a comb,
stuck into a brush on the dressing table, against the long, low,
leaded windows. It awaited crumbs of bread and tiny morsels of lump
sugar from the tea tray. It had never been taught to go on these
adventures. This robin attended at the opening of the first letter
that, more than a quarter of a century ago, the writer received
from Joseph Conrad. The robin watched with its beady eyes the sheet
of blue-grey paper with the large rather ornamental
handwriting...It was afterwards drowned in a cream jug which took
away from its aspect of a supernatural visitant.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Above the large kitchen was the large Men's Room where the hinds
of the farm had been used to sleep. It was entered by a ladder
which was removed at night so that the hinds should not murder the
farmer or do worse to the farmer's wife. The low windows of this
low room were leaded in diamond shapes, the glass frosted with the
green of great age. One of these windows had inscribed upon it, no
doubt by a diamond, the name <i>John Kemp</i> and the date 1822.
Conrad always objected to <i>John Kemp</i> as a name not
sufficiently aristocratic for the hero of "Romance", who was the
grandson of an earl, but the writer liked it and it remained so in
the book.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Years before that, looking through the pages of Dickens's "All
the Year Round" for woodcuts contributed by Ford Madox Brown, upon
whose biography he had been engaged, the writer had come upon a
short rendering of the official account of the trial of Aaron
Smith. This had been the last trial for piracy that had ever been
held at the Old Bailey and the prisoner was acquitted. The story
told by him in the dock was sufficiently that of "Romance", as it
now stands. It struck the writer at once after the reading of the
first few paragraphs&mdash;that here indeed was what we used to
call a <i>subject</i>, with a tone of voice as if the word had been
italicised. For certain subjects will grip you with a force almost
supernatural, as if something came from behind the printed, the
written or the spoken word, or from within the aura of the observed
incident in actual life, and caught you by the throat, really
saying: "Treat me." So in the dusky air of the British Museum
Reading Room, whilst that first perusal was being made, it was
almost as if the genie of the place exclaimed, "Treat this
subject." If you do it will mean fortune; if not, lifelong
ill-luck. It brought fortune.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The first treatment of that story by the writer was of an
incredible thinness. It was like the whisper of a nonagenarian and
the writer had tried to make it like the whisper of a nonagenarian.
It was finished just before, in 1898 or so, Conrad first came to
see the writer at Limpsfield...Why the writer should ever have
thought of writing of pirates, heaven knows, or why, having
determined to write of pirates it should have been his ambition to
treat them as if in terms of a very faded manuscript of a Greek
play! But that was certainly his ambition and, as it proved, his
ambition was certainly granted to him to achieve. Every sentence
had a dying fall and every paragraph faded out. The last sentences
of that original draft ran: <i>Above our heads a nightingale (did
something; poured out its soul, as like as not, or poured out its
melody on the summer air, the cadence calling there for eleven
syllables). As it was June it sang a trifle hoarsely</i>...The
reader will observe that the writer had then already read his
"Trois Contes", just as the first words of Conrad's first book were
pencilled on the flyleaves and margins of "Madame Bovary." The last
cadences, then, of Herodias run: <i>"Et tons trois, ay ant pris la
tete de Jokanaan den allaient vers Galile. Comme elle etait tres
lourde, ils la portaient alternativement."</i>...As cadence the
later sentences are an exact pastiche of the former. In each the
first contains nineteen syllables; the concluding one commences
with "As it was", and is distinguished by the <i>u</i> sounds of
<i>"June"</i> and <i>"lourd"</i> and the <i>or</i> sounds of
<i>"hoarse"</i> and <i>"portaient."</i> It was in that way that,
before the writer and Conrad met, they had studied their
Flaubert...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad came round the corner of the house carrying a small
child; that did not impede his slightly stiff gait and the
semicircular motion of his head as he took in the odd residence,
the lettuces protected by wire netting from the rabbits, or the
immense view that lay before the cottage. He was conducted by Mr.
Edward Garnett. In those days the writer had been overcome by one
of those fits of agricultural enthusiasm that have overwhelmed him
every few years, so that such descriptive writers as have attended
to him have given you his picture in a startling alternation as a
Piccadilly dude in top hat, morning coat and spats, and as an
extremely dirty agricultural labourer. Mr. Garnett lived an acre or
so up the hill; Mr. Conrad and his family were staying on
Limpsfield Chart. It was in those days Mr. Garnett's ambition to
appear what the French call <i>lézarde:</i> he might have been a
very, a very long lizard, indistinguishable, save for his
spectacles, from the monstrous stones of his cavernous and
troglodytic residence. From his mansion the writer's two-roomed
cottage might have been a volcanic fragment, thrown off. Mr.
Garnett frequently reproved the writer for wearing dark grey
frieze. It caused, he said, a blot on the Limpsfield hillside into
whose tones one should sink. The writer was engrossed in carrying
out experiments, suggested by Professor Gressent of the Sorbonne in
Paris. He was trying to make ten lettuces grow where before had
been ten thousand nettles and was writing articles for the
<i>Outlook</i> on the usage of the potato as an extirpator of
thistles, in sand. That is accepted as good farming now.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Upon the writer Conrad made no impression at all. Mr. Conrad was
the author of "Almayer's Folly", a great book of a romantic
fashion, but written too much in the style of Alphonse Daudet, whom
the writer had outgrown at school, knowing the "Lettres de Mon
Moulin" at eighteen by heart. A great, new writer then. But as to
great writers or artists this writer even then <i>en avait
soupé</i>, cradled in the proof sheets of Rossetti, with Swinburne,
Watts-Dunton, Hall Caine (Sir Something Hall Caine) and all the
Pre-Raphaelites for the commonest objects of his landscape. And Mr.
Garnett used to lead the Great New, one by one, to poke up the
writer as if he had been a mangey lion. The writer no doubt roared.
In that way Mr. Garnett led up Stephen Crane, Conrad, Lord
Ollivier, now H.B.M. Minister for India, the wife of the Secretary
of the Fabian Society, the Secretary of the Fabian Society...A
whole procession; precisely as if one had been a mangey lion in a
travelling menagerie. Or perhaps a man at the zoo! And Mr. Garnett
would do the poking up, telling the distinguished that the writer
was possessed of too much individuality ever to find readers...It
was the most depressing period of a life not lacking in depressing
periods.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer perhaps roared. Obviously the writer roared on that
occasion, but he certainly rather disliked Conrad as you dislike
those who pass before your cage and get you poked up. We went
afterwards with several children up to the sloping lawn of Mr.
Garnett's residence. It is at that point that a real remembrance of
this beautiful genius comes to the writer...One of the children
crawled over the sloping grass as weak new-born kittens crawl;
another, on the other hand, with an engrossed face, a little older,
whilst Conrad stuck his eyeglass into his eye, progressed for all
the world like a <i>cul de jatte</i> of our Paris streets. Two
fists stuck into the ground, one short leg projected, the other
curled underneath, blonde and determined, it levered itself over
the grass with its hands and between its arms. And Conrad threw
back his head and laughed; his eyeglass fell out; he stuck it in
his eye again and gazed at the child; threw back his head and
roared, and uttered odd words in Marseilles French...Immediately
afterwards Mr. Garnett assured Mr. Conrad for the third time that
the writer was too individual ever to have a public for his
writings. It was of course high praise...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So the writer left Limpsfield and returned to the Pent Farm. A
complete veil dropped between himself and Conrad. And then suddenly
came the letter at whose reading the robin attended. The writer had
indeed roared at Limpsfield. Obviously he had told Conrad the story
of John-Kemp-Aaron-Smith, for Conrad asked him to consider the idea
of a collaboration over that story&mdash;which Mr. Garnett had told
him was too individual ever to find even a publisher. It would
otherwise have been an impertinence on the part of Conrad. And
Conrad was never impertinent. His politeness even to his grocer was
always Oriental.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer's answer was the obvious one that Conrad had better
come and see for himself what he had let himself in for. And Conrad
came. But that time <i>Conrad</i> came...He was like the Sultan of
the True Believers walking into a slave market. And for the writer
that he remained until his lamentable death. He was a
gentleman-adventurer who had sailed with Drake. Elizabethan: it was
that that he was. He has been called Slav; he has been called
Oriental; he has been called a Romantic. He was none of these
except on the surface, to his grocer; a man has to have a surface
to present to his grocer or to afternoon callers. He himself was
just Man: <i>homo europeaus sapiens</i>, attuned to the late
sixteenth century. In all the world he would have loved nothing
better than to singe the King of Spain's beard if it had not been
to write a good book. Well, he outwitted the Dutch navy in Malaysia
and wrote the greatest books in the world.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He had an extraordinary old mare with such long ears that you
took her for a mule. She was called Nancy. And a black wickerwork
chaise. And he cared for these things with the lively passion of a
man; what he had must be shipshape: reins, bit, headstall, feed...I
remember once in an inn yard at Winchelsea an enormous, fat,
six-feet-two, lousy, greyish scoundrel of a stableman; leaning back
against a wall he was, his face quivering, the colour of
billsticker's paste. He panted, "I've heard tell of the British
liaon; but protect me from the Rooshian bear..." Russian being as
near as he could get to Polish. Conrad had been talking to him; he
had been stealing the mare's feed of oats...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>With a hyper-sensitiveness to impressions the writer, too,
remembers Conrad throwing teacups into the fireplace during a
discussion over the divine right of kings&mdash;a discussion with a
lady who alleged light-heartedly that Marie Antoinette had been
guilty of treason to France. The whole of the discussion the writer
did not hear because he was discoursing to a very deaf gentleman on
the genealogical tree of the Dering family. Nor indeed can Conrad
have thrown the teacups into the fire since on going away the lady
said, "What a <i>charming</i> man Mr. Conrad is! I must see him
often."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was in short the passion of Conrad that you noticed first and
that passion he applied to his writing: his darkness, his wide
gestures, his eyes in which the light was like the glow of a
volcano. This is not over-writing; his personality deserved these
tributes. It was chivalry too. After his discussion with the lady
over the divine right of kings he was pale, exhausted, panting
almost. That was because he remembered Marie Antoinette in the
Conciergerie, so ill-clad, so deprived of her children, so pallid
and unkempt that to him she was real and he remembered her. And she
was dead and a cheerfully heartless fine lady should not make
fun&mdash;which was what it amounted to&mdash;of dead queens. Dog
should not eat dog; fine ladies in silks should not gnaw the
reputations of ladies fine that once wore finer silks and were now
dead. It was the want of imagination in all humanity, thus in
little summed up and presented to him, that aroused in him such
passion and called for such self-control. For it is to be hoped
that it is apparent that it was only to the writer that the
impression remained of teacups thrown into the fireplace. The
writer has seen Conrad just so enraged when the Bishop of London,
returning from St. Petersburg after Bloody Monday, remarked that
Russians would always have troubles until they were inculcated with
the hearty British love of field games! He detested Russians; his
passion was rather for Bonapartists than for the Bourbons, but that
imbecilities should be uttered as to the lot of the suffering
maddened him.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Conrad&mdash;it is most characteristic
of Conrad&mdash;that when, after five years, he and the writer got
to the last paragraphs of "Romance" and when the writer had
written, <i>"For suffering is the lot of man", Conrad should have
added, "but not inevitable failure or worthless despair which is
without end: suffering the mark of manhood which bears within its
pain the hope of felicity, like a jewel set in iron."</i> He had
the mark of manhood!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He came then to the Pent to see what he was in for. He came in
for passion&mdash;and suffering. The writer has seldom seen such
suffering as was gone through by Conrad during the reading of that
first draft of "Romance." Conrad had expected a drama of Cuban
pirates, immense and gloomy, like "Salammbo", with a reddish
illumination, passing as it were upon a distant stage...For the
first chapter or two&mdash;those passing at the Pent Farm&mdash;he
was silent. Then he became&mdash;silent. For he seemed to have
about him a capacity for as it were degrees of intensity of his
silence. No doubt he listened to the first pages with a movement or
so to light a cigarette, with a relaxing of the limbs or a change
in the position in the chair. These must gradually have ceased.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The parlour at the Pent was a deep room with a beam across the
middle of the low ceiling; small, pink monthly roses always showed
insignificant blooms that looked over the window sills. An immense
tythe barn with a great, thatched, black mossy roof filled in the
whole view if you sat by the fireplace; occasionally you would see
a rat progressing musingly over this surface. If you approached the
window you saw a narrow lawn running to a low brick wall after
which the level dropped to a great stockyard floored usually with
straw and not unusually with a bullock or two in it. Conrad and the
writer planted an orange tree, grown from a pip, under the low
north wall of this narrow garden. It was still alive in
nineteen-seventeen, growing just up to the coping of the low wall
where its progress was cut off by the north wind. It was a very
quiet, simple room.</p>

<p>The writer sat in the grandfather's chair, his back to the
window, beside the fireplace, reading, his manuscript held up to
the light; Conrad sat forward on a rush-bottomed armchair,
listening intently. (For how many years did the writer and Conrad
not sit there like that!)</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We began that reading after lunch of a shortish day; the lamps
were brought in along with the tea. During that interval Conrad
showed nervous and depressed; sunk in on himself and hardly
answering questions. Conrad being then almost a stranger, this was
the writer's first experience of to what Conrad's depression over
an artistic problem could amount: it was like a strong current that
operated on a whole roomful...With his back, then, to the lamp, and
Conrad completely in the shadow, the writer read on, just having
the impression that his hearer's limbs were all bunched together in
his chair and that they contracted gradually. There were many
strong shadows in the low room where most of the light was on the
ceiling.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad began to groan...It was by then fairly apparent to the
writer that Conrad disapproved of the treatment of the adventures
of John Kemp; at any rate in Cuba; and the writer had a sufficient
sense already of Conrad's temperament to be disinclined to ask
whether his guest were ill. He feels now the sense of as it were
dumb obstinacy with which he read on into those now vocal shadows
in the fireside warmth...The interruptions grew in length of
ejaculation. They became, "O! O!...O God, my dear Hueffer..."
...And towards the end, "O God, my dear <i>faller</i>, how is it
possible..." The writer finished with the statement that, as it was
June, the nightingale sang a trifle hoarsely. This zoölogical
observation, in spite of the cadence, gave the final touch to
Conrad's dejection. The writer's voice having stopped he exclaimed,
"What? What? What's that?" When he heard that that was the end he
groaned and said, "Good <i>God!</i>"&mdash;for the last time. There
are writers&mdash;French writers&mdash;who can keep the final
revelation of a whole long novel back until the last three words.
For this he had hoped. The writer would rather have died than have
so machined a book.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad was the most unrivalled hatcher of schemes for sudden and
unlimited wealth or for swift and undying glory. To see him go upon
one of these adventures was heartening in itself. His face lit up,
his muscles tautened, he first expatiated on his idea and then set
out. Obviously his training as a master mariner inveigling
unwilling Eastern traders into shipping cargoes that they did not
want to consign, at prices that they did not want to pay, to
bottoms commanded by Conrad, for one reason or another unsuited to
their merchandise&mdash;this training helped him with direct human
negotiations. To see him, leaning over a counter, persuading the
stolid Mr. Dan West, grocer of Hythe, to grant him credit unheard
of in that market town, was a singular study in fascination. The
bearded, blinking and very excellent grocer&mdash;I wish I knew his
equal elsewhere&mdash;understood possibly the transaction which
contained in its essence bills at three months, mortgages I daresay
on life insurances&mdash;heaven knows what!&mdash;and then a
triumphant progress to the White Hart where the benign, dark,
statuesque and really beautiful Miss Cobay presided in the dimmer
recess of that very old tavern...And there sat the grocer,
benevolent, pleased, blinking a little, a solid, wealthy, fiftyish
man, several times mayor of his ancient town, with great knowledge
of men, quietly indulgent to the romantic visitor who had descended
upon him...For all the world he might have been the Stein of "Lord
Jim" contemplating the hero of that wonderful work and saying
within himself, "Romantic!...That's what he
is&mdash;romantic!"...And the beautiful, statuesque, slow-moving
Miss Cobay, invariably silent. The writer at least never heard her
utter one word, except that, years after, motoring through that
ancient Cinque Port, the writer, for old sake's sake, took a drink
at the bar of the White Elart, and Miss Cobay with her enigmatic
gaze asked after Mr. Conrad, then many years gone from the Pent,
for all the world like one of the silent women of Conrad's early
books: the heroine of "Falk" who never utters <i>one</i> word...The
writer, alas, alas, seems to become Marlowe.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad was Conrad because he was his books. It was not that he
made literature: he was literature, the literature of the
Elizabethan Gentleman Adventurer...Think of setting out in an old
wickerwork chaise drawn by what appeared to be a mule to persuade a
Hythe grocer to give you three years' credit...Think of setting out
from Stamford-le-Hope, a safe harbour where at least there was
contact with ships, estuaries, tideways, islands, into an unknown
hinterland of savage and unknown populations, of bare downs, out of
sight of the refuge of the sea, to persuade an unknown wielder of
the pen, the finest stylist in England, to surrender his liberty to
a sailing partnership&mdash;to surrender too his glamourous
"subject", for all the world as if you had adventured into the
hinterlands behind Palembang to ask some one only just known to
give up to you for joint working the secret of one of those
mysterious creeks where gold is found. An adventure like that of
"Victory" itself...And then to insult the owner of the creek with
groans, sighs, O God's, contortions...Well, all we who supported
Conrad to his final, so great victory, were the subordinate
characters of his books, putting up with his extortionate demands
for credit, for patience or for subjects...The Steins, the
Whalleys, the captain MacWhirrs...and now the Marlowes!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For, for some hours of that distant day of our "Romance", the
reader may be assured that the question of the very existence of
that work hung in the balance. It was truly as if Rumpelstiltkin
had come to carry off the Queen's child. (<i>The dwarf</i>, Conrad
quotes Grimm in his epigraph, <i>answered, "No, something human is
dearer to me than all the wealth of the Indies!"</i>) The writer,
please let the reader be assured, has always been supremely
indifferent to the fate of his books; to the estimation in which
they were held&mdash;by any soul but Joseph Conrad; to such things
as career; personal reputation and the rest. Conrad could hardly
have selected a better discoverer of creeks to whom to go. But the
writer was not then ignorant of the vicissitudes of human life and
of literary partnerships. The terrible wrangles between Henley and
the relicts and executors of Stevenson were at that moment filling
the press. Or one might remember the effects on Johnson's fame, of
Boswell. To do what Conrad then imperiously desired, to surrender
the creek to a joint partnership was...asking for it!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It hung then in the balance. But there gradually appeared after
dinner, through a long farmhouse night until two in the morning,
the magic. It was magic! There had been disclosures. Conrad had
artlessly expounded his desires. Hearing, at Limpsfield, the writer
develop his miraculous "subject"&mdash;of Aaron Smith, last pirate
ever to be tried at the Old Bailey, of the Creek with Rio Media at
the bottom of it and the pirate schooners with Nikola el Escoces in
command sailing out to the sack of brig <i>Victoria</i> with her
cargo of logwood, rum, raw sugar and dyes&mdash;Conrad had imagined
a robust book, with every drop of the subject squeezed out of it.
Whereas it was characteristic of the writer that though in the
trial Aaron Smith had deposed to a lady bearing the glamourous name
of Seraphina Riego, daughter of a <i>juez</i> de la premiera
instancia, known as the Star of Cuban Law, and inhabiting the
pirate city of Rio Media in Cuba, the writer had very carefully
left out this lady in the first draft of his book, the lady with
whom John Kemp sat under the hoarse nightingale having been a
carefully dimmed figure with bare shoulders and a handkerchief,
called Veronica...Conrad had expected to hear a reading by the
finest stylist in England of a work, far-flung in popularity as
"Treasure Island" but as "written" as "Salammbo", by the addition
to which of a few touches of description, sea atmosphere, mists,
riggings and the like, in a fortnight, fortune should lie at the
feet of the adventurers...It was another of those magic
enterprises...Alas, after five years' work there was "Romance" with
its <i>succès d'estime</i>. Not much of that, even, for the critics
of our favoured land do not believe in collaboration.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad's marvellous play and change of features came now into
the story. Ruffled, the writer, even before dinner had explained
the nature of the <i>tour de force</i> he had attempted. This was
the narrative of a very old man, looking back upon that day of his
romance&mdash;as to-day this narrator looks back. You are getting
the real first draft of "Romance" now. This is how in truth it
comes out according to the technical scheme then laid down by us
two.</p>

<p>Before dinner, then, Conrad listened to the writer's apologia
with a certain frigid deference. Of course if that was the way of
it, no doubt...But why choose such a subject?...A man of
sixty-two...Yes, yes, of course...He remained however shut up in
the depth of his disappointment and still more in his reprobation
of the criminal who could take hold of such a theme and not,
gripping it by the throat, extract from it every drop of blood and
glamour...He disliked the writer as a criminal, fortune thrown
away, a Book turned into the dry bone of a technical feat. He
exclaimed, "Let me look at it. Let me look at the manuscript";
shuffled the leaves distastefully as if they had been the evidence
of a crime...To throw away fortune&mdash;that was not shipshape: to
murder a subject&mdash;that was murder, foul, unnatural...The
dinner bell rang...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At dinner there were ladies; gradually the depressed Conrad
became Conrad. Pepper came under discussion. He declaimed as to how
the greatest wars in the world had been fought for pepper. The
Spice Islands, the East, came into the room for a little while,
with Wapping Old Stairs, the tents of the army over Constantinople
at the end of the Russo-Turkish War with Conrad as a sailor before
the mast on the deck of a Messageries Maritimes transport. There
ensued a desperate wrangle as to whether saffron had any
flavour&mdash;in the course of the consumption of curry. Conrad
declared that saffron had no flavour; the writer, that saffron was
one of the most strongly flavoured of all possible herbs. Conrad
swore that he had carried whole cargoes of saffron; he had spent
his life in carrying cargoes of saffron; he had known no other
pursuits. The writer on the other hand had given more saffron to
diseased poultry than ever Conrad had carried and had in addition
reproved cooks enough to make ships' crews for not putting
sufficient saffron into <i>poule au riz</i>...Conrad declared that
that was merely to give the rice an agreeable colour. The writer
called it a most disagreeable, an offensive colour...Conrad's eyes
flashed dangerously; his teeth white under his drawn-back
moustache. We both contemplated Calais Sands...Some one changed the
conversation to pearls...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In all our ten thousand conversations down the years we had only
these two themes over which we quarrelled: as to the taste of
saffron and as to whether one sheep is distinguishable from
another.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>After that first dinner Conrad talked, there being people
present whom he found sympathetic...When he talked on such
occasions he was like his "The Mirror of the Sea." Indeed, a great
part of his "The Mirror of the Sea" was just his talk which the
writer took down in a shorthand of his own extemporising, recalling
to Conrad, who was then in a state of great depression, various
passages of his own relating...Alas, three weeks ago, the writer
drove in a black, shaken, hooded contrivance, over a country of
commonplace downlands, the continuation of the Kentish downs,
beyond the Channel. He went, jolted behind an extravagant female
quadruped, between fields of wheat that small winds ruffled into
cat's-paws. And the parallel was so intimately exact that the
writer found himself saying to himself, "Well, Ford, <i>mon
vieux</i>, how would you render that field of wheat?"...The reader
must take this record of a coincidence as a sincerity...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For the days have been innumerable upon which, behind the
amiable mare of Conrad's or a far less amiable Exmoor pony of the
writer's, we drove&mdash;say between 1898 and 1905&mdash;over a
country of commonplace downlands and asked ourselves how we should
render a field of ripe corn, a ten-acre patch of blue-purple
cabbage. We would try the words in French: <i>sillonne, bleufoncé,
bleu-du-roi</i>; we would try back into English; cast around in the
back of our minds for other French words to which to assimilate our
English and thus continue for quiet hours.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So, three weeks ago to-day&mdash;thus does one return to one's
old loves!&mdash;the writer drove from just such a ramshackle,
commonplace farm building in an undistinguished country over slight
hills on a flinty bye-road and heard Conrad saying to him, "Well,
Ford, <i>mon vieux</i>, how would you render that field of
wheat?"...Unless you have these details you cannot know how
immensely strong an impression this beautiful genius made on a mind
not vastly impressionable or prone to forming affections...So the
writer continued turning the matter over.</p>

<p>He went on thinking first of French and then of English:
"<i>Champs de blés que les vents faibles
sillonnaient</i>...Cornfields...No, not cornfields, because that,
to Americans, signifies maize...Wheat fields...Fields of wheat that
the weak...feeble...light...what sort of winds, breezes, airs..."
There is no occupation more agreeable on a still day: it is more
restful, really, than fishing in a pond..."Fields of wheat that
small winds ruffled into cat's-paws...That is, of course, too
literary..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>These considerations remained in the front of his mind as he was
jolted over the abominable granite setts of a small market town, to
the dilapidated station. He continued to think of wheat, dusty,
bronzed, golden, as if running away over a small
hillside&mdash;whilst he purchased tickets of a disagreeable woman
behind a grille, whilst he purchased an English paper of a very
agreeable woman in a blue pinafore. On the railway platform he
said, "<i>Dont les vents faibles sillonnaient les sur faces
roussâtres</i>,..." whilst looking at black capital letters in the
paper that his companion held folded. It struck him at once, "This
is a bad joke...That paper is of the sort that makes bad jokes...He
was speaking to me. Not five, not three...minutes...Not three
seconds; just now on this platform ...the duskyish voice with the
brown accent, rather caressing..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer exclaimed, "Look! <i>Look!</i>"...His companion
unfolded the paper. The announcement went across two columns in
black, leaded caps...SUDDEN DEATH OF JOSEPH CONRAD. They were
demolishing an antiquated waiting room on the opposite platform,
three white-dusty men with pickaxes; a wall was all in broken
zigzags. The writer said to himself, <i>"C'est le mur d'un silence
éternel qui descend devant vous!"</i> There descended across the
dusty wall a curtain of moonlight, thrown across by the black
shadows of oak trees. We were on a verandah that had a glass roof.
Under the glass roof climbed passion flowers, and vine tendrils
strangled them. We were sitting in deck chairs. It was one o'clock
in the morning. Conrad was standing in front of us, talking.
Talking on and on, in the patches of moonlight and patches of
shadow from the passion flowers and vines! The little town in which
we were dominated the English channel from a low hilltop. He was
wearing a dark reefer coat and white trousers.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He was talking of Malaysia, palm trees, the little wives of
rajahs in coloured sarongs&mdash;or perhaps not
sarongs?&mdash;crouched round him on the ground; he himself
cross-legged on the ground teaching the little wives of rajahs to
use sewing machines! Moored to a rotting quay&mdash;as it might
have been Palembang, but of course it was not Palembang&mdash;was
his schooner. His schooner had in its hold half a cargo of rifles
under half a cargo of sewing machines. The rajahs, husbands of the
little wives, did not like their Dutch suzerains and in that
country the War has lasted not five but three hundred and
fifty-five years...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That then was Conrad on the occasions when he talked as he did
on that first evening after dinner. His voice was then usually low,
rather intimate and caressing. He began by speaking slowly, but
later on he spoke very fast. His accent was precise, rather dusky,
the accent of dark rather than fair races. He impressed the writer
at first as a pure Marseilles Frenchman; he spoke English with
great fluency and distinction, with correctitude in his syntax, his
words absolutely exact as to meaning but his accentuation so faulty
that he was at times difficult to understand and his use of adverbs
as often as not eccentric. He used "shall" and "will" very
arbitrarily. He gesticulated with his hands and shoulders when he
wished to be emphatic, but when he forgot himself in the excitement
of talking he gesticulated with his whole body, throwing himself
about in his chair, moving his chair nearer to yours. Finally he
would spring up, go to a distance, and walk back and forth across
the end of the room. When the writer talked he was a very good
listener, sitting rather curled up whilst the writer walked
unceasingly back and forth along the patterned border of the
carpet.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We talked like that from about ten, when the ladies had gone to
bed, until half-past two in the morning. We talked about Flaubert
and Maupassant&mdash;sounding each other, really. Conrad was still
then inclined to have a feeling for Daudet&mdash;for such books as
"Jack." This the writer contemned with the sort of air of the
superior person who tells you that Hermitage is no longer a wine
for a gentleman. We talked of Turgenev&mdash;the greatest of all
poets; "Byelshin Prairie" from the "Letters of a Sportsman", the
greatest of all pieces of writing; Turgenev wrapped in a cloak
lying on the prairie at night, at a little distance from a great
fire, beside which the boy horsetenders talked desultorily about
the Roosalki of the forests with the green hair and water nymphs
that drag you down to drown in the river.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We agreed that a poem was not that which was written in verse
but that, either prose or verse, that had constructive beauty. We
agreed that the writing of novels was the one thing of importance
that remained to the world and that what the novel needed was the
New Form. We confessed that each of us desired one day to write
Absolute Prose.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But that which really brought us together was a devotion to
Flaubert and Maupassant. We discovered that we both had "Felicite",
"St.-Julien l'Hospitalier", immense passages of "Madame Bovary ",
"La Nuit", "Ce Cochon de Morin" and immense passages of "Une Vie"
by heart. Or so nearly by heart that what the one faltered over the
other could take up. And indeed, on the last occasion when we met,
in May of this year, agreeing that we had altered very little,
surprisingly little&mdash;oh, not the least in the world!&mdash;the
writer began, "<i>La nuit, balancé par l'ouragan</i>..." and Conrad
went on, "<i>tandis que le feu grégeois ruisselait</i>," right down
to, "<i>Et comme il était très fort, hardi, courageux et
avisé</i>..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Before we went on that earlier night to bed Conrad confessed to
the writer that previous to suggesting a collaboration he had
consulted a number of men of letters as to its advisability. He
said that he had put before them his difficulties with the
language, the slowness with which he wrote and the increased
fluency that he might acquire in the process of going minutely into
words with an acknowledged master of English. The writer imagines
that he had actually consulted Mr. Edward Garnett, W. E. Henley and
Mr. Marriott Watson. Of these the only one that Conrad mentioned
was W. E. Henley. He stated succinctly and carefully that he had
said to Henley&mdash;Henley had published "The Nigger of the
Narcissus" in his <i>Review</i>&mdash;"Look here. I write with such
difficulty: my intimate, automatic, less expressed thoughts are in
Polish; when I express myself with care I do it in French. When I
write I think in French and then translate the words of my thoughts
into English. This is an impossible process for one desiring to
make a living by writing in the English language..." And Henley,
according to Conrad on that evening, had said, "Why don't you ask
H. to collaborate with you. He is the finest stylist in the English
language of to-day..." The writer, it should be remembered, though
by ten or fifteen years the junior of Conrad was by some years his
senior, at any rate as a published author, and was rather the more
successful of the two as far as sales went.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Henley obviously had said nothing of the sort. Indeed, as the
writer has elsewhere related, on the occasion of a verbal duel that
he had later with Henley, that violent-mouthed personality remarked
to him, "Who the hell are you? I never even heard your name!" or
words to that effect. It probably does not very much matter. What
had no doubt happened was that Conrad had mentioned the writer's
name to Henley and Henley had answered, "I daresay he'll do as well
as any one else." No, it probably does not matter, except as a
light on the character and methods of Conrad, and as to his ability
to get his own way...</p>

<p>For it was obviously <i>une émotion forte</i> that the writer
received in those small hours in a sufficiently dim farmhouse room.
In such affairs Conrad's caressing, rather dragging voice would
take on a more Polish intonation and would drop. His face would
light up; it was as if he whispered; as if we both whispered in a
conspiracy against a sleeping world. And no doubt that was what it
was. The world certainly did not want us, not at that date; and to
be reputed the finest English stylist was enough, nearly, to get
you sent to gaol. Something foreign, that was what it was...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At any rate when, with a flat candlestick, the writer at last
showed his guest into a shadowy, palely papered, coldish bedroom
and closed the door on him, he felt as if a king were enclosed
within those walls. A king-conspirator: a sovereign-Pretender; Don
Carlos of a world whose subjects are shadows.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-2" id="ch1-2"></a>II.</h2>

<p>As for what happened immediately to the history of "Romance",
the book, the writer's mind preserves a complete blank! It might be
easy to construct images out of probabilities or by consultation
with one person or another. But that would not be within the spirit
of the bond; this is the record of the impression made by Conrad
the Impressionist upon another writer, impressionist also. It is an
offering In Memoriam constructed solely out of memory.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Some years ago Mr. H. G. Wells took occasion to write to the
papers. He stated that the writer had visited him and informed him
that he had persuaded Conrad to collaborate with himself. Mr.
Wells' memory must almost certainly have betrayed him, though the
matter is of no great importance. What does remain in the writer's
mind very clearly is this...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer and Conrad made several choppings and changings in
their occupation of the Pent: the writer occupied it for several
years; Conrad then lived in it with the writer's spare furniture
which was mostly of Pre-Raphaelite origin. It pleased Conrad to
write at a Chippendale bureau on which Christina Rossetti had once
written or at another which had once belonged to Thomas Carlyle:
one got in those days those small, cheerful pleasures out of life.
Then Conrad occupied the Pent altogether, the mournful house under
the bare downs exercising a great fascination over him. When you
went out of the front door&mdash;Mr. Walter Crane, who during one
of our movings about Kent and Sussex took the house furnished, had
painted a Japanese crane and some verses on that door&mdash;when
you went out, then, the narrow garden giving on to the stockyard
had a short brick path running under the windows and it was very
soothing to see the flattish lines of the country running away for
a great distance, one convolution going into another. The brick
path dried up very quickly in the wettest of weathers; up and down
it, as if on a quarterdeck, Conrad would pace for hours and hours,
the lines of the country soothing him. In that part of England the
words of Charles II are most true; what with the shelter of the
downs and the position near the sea, there is there scarcely any
day upon which a man may not go abroad&mdash;at any rate to the
extent of a brick path under his windows. The great barn closed in
the scene immediately to the front, but you saw the fields to the
right, so it was a very quiet and private place...And indeed,
during the last of our conversations, this year, Conrad alluded to
the fact that, for the first time in his life, he had, in his
vastly more arranged residence of that day, a study to himself. And
he added, "Ah, but it isn't the <i>Pent!</i>" He said too that the
great tythe barn had been burned down during threshing.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We used in our day to take great entertainment out of shooting
rats with a Flobert rifle from the brick path. There were channels
made by these animals in the black-green thatch of the barn and you
would see them proceeding leisurely from end to end of the great
expanse in broad daylight. Then...Whiff would go the Flobert and
the small bullet pinging into the thatch would send a rat bounding
away over the corrugations in the old straw into some hole, for all
the world with the action of a tiger bounding over watercourses. As
far as memory serves we never hit a rat: but one notable success
was scored to the writer. Fired at from an incredible
distance&mdash;ninety yards or so, something gigantic!&mdash;a
great old grey rat crossing a road collapsed feebly. We ran forward
and dispatched it with the butt. That was ever afterwards scored to
the writer as an immense feat of marksmanship, often referred to.
If any one talked of shooting Conrad would say, "Ah, but you should
have seen Ford's shot at the rat!..." Actually the writer, with a
little more farm knowledge, was sure that the rat was dying of old
age before it was fired at, the bullet never reaching it. But he
has kept his own counsel to this day of confession...No, we were
not high-brow there at the Pent. We played dominoes, Conrad with
passion and the skill of a master. Indeed, in how many city Meccas
and Belgian cafés must we not have rattled the black and white
bones over round, white marble table tops! We played <i>écarté</i>
or, when very serious, chess, but usually dominoes, at which the
writer never remembers to have won a game. Sometimes the writer
knocked a golf ball about the fields, Conrad, standing on the brick
path, regarding the occupation with the contempt, say, that his
collaborator bestowed on Daudet. Once the writer seriously sat down
to describe in words the satisfaction you feel when you have
brought off a good drive and see the white ball lyrically against
the blue sky. It was a careful piece of writing, <i>mots justes</i>
and all. Conrad looked at it with attention and then slowly,
blankly raised his shoulders and eyebrows, we returning to
dominoes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-3" id="ch1-3"></a>III.</h2>

<p>On one of those days, then, we drove in state from the Pent to
pay a call on Mr. Wells at Sandgate. There was a curious incident.
As we stood on the doorstep of Mr. Wells' villa, in the hesitant
mind of those paying a state call, behold, the electric bell-push,
all of itself, went in and the bell sounded...Conrad exclaimed,
"<i>Tiens!</i>...The Invisible Man!" and burst into incredible and
incredulous laughter. In the midst of it the door opened before
grave faces.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We paid our call. Whether we were taken to be drunk or no only
the owners of those grave faces can say. I suppose that we were.
But the incident of the bell-pull was of a nature that had a
peculiar appeal to Conrad's humour. For years after, a translation
of Mr. Wells' book having appeared in Italian, you could never
mention that author's name without Conrad saying,
"<i>Tiens!...L'Uomo Invisible!</i>"...Indeed, during a visit in an
interval of our long separation caused by European vicissitudes and
their sequelae Conrad asked the writer, "Do you ever see Wells
now?" and added, "<i>L'Uomo Invisible</i>...Do you remember?"</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But Mr. Wells' "The Invisible Man" made an extremely marked
impression on Conrad, as indeed it did on the writer. So it
deserved to. Indeed, as far as memory serves, "The Invisible Man",
the end of the "Sea Lady" and some phrases that that book
contained, and two short stories called "The Man Who Could Work
Miracles" and "Fear", made up at that date all the English writing
that, acting as it were as a junta, we absolutely admired. Later
there came the stories of Mr. Cunninghame Graham, the writing of W.
H. Hudson and&mdash;with reservations on the part of Conrad for the
later novels&mdash;the work of Henry James.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was as if, when we considered any other English writer's
work, we always in the end said, "Ah, but do you remember 'Ce
Cochon de Morin'?" or the casquette of Charles Bovary, according to
the type of work undergoing commendation. After reading the
passage, say, of the pavior striking with the spade at the
invisibility flying past him from "The Invisible Man", or the
episode of the turning over of the lamp and the burning downwards,
from "The Man Who Could Work Miracles", we recalled no French
masterpiece...These pieces were authentic, in construction, in
language and in the architectural position occupied by them in the
book or story&mdash;in the progression of the effect!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Mr. Wells has recorded that he was aware that at this date there
was a conspiracy going on at the Pent against himself and against
British literature. Against British literature there was, if you
choose to call it so; against Mr. Wells the extent of our
machinations is as recorded above.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad had odd, formal notions of how one should proceed in the
life literary. As far as he was concerned the purpose of our call
on Mr. Wells was to announce to the world of letters that we were
engaged in collaboration. To the writer this was just exactly a
matter of indifference except for a not materially pronounced
disinclination to pay calls anywhere or at any time. But Conrad
liked proceedings of a State nature. He would have liked the
driving in a barouche to pay calls on Academicians such as is
practised by candidates for membership of the French Academy. And
exceedingly vivid in the writer's mind is the feeling he had, as we
drove down the sloping railway bridge above Sandling Junction. He
was like a brown paper parcel on a seat beside a functionary in a
green uniform, decorated with golden palm leaves and a feathered
cocked hat...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We were then going over the third draft of the second part of
"Romance" and had at last finally and psychologically decided that
the book would eventually go on. Of this the writer is certain. He
is certain because the exact image and air of that time came back
to him suddenly whilst making a very minute recension of the text
of the French translation of "Romance." The writer was in mid-ocean
on the deck of a liner, reading very meticulously the translation
of an episode which related how, on a blue night in Kingston Vale,
John Kemp knocked down, in the presence of the Admiral of the Fleet
in the Jamaica waters, a Mr. Topnambo, member of the Governor's
'Council, who wore white trousers that glimmered in the
half-light...There were on that upper deck in the sunlight a number
of New York Jews playing pinocle and a number of Washington
flappers reading novels. But the writer heard his own voice as, in
the low parlour of the Pent, he read aloud the passage that
concerned Mr. Topnambo, the blue night, the white trousers, the
barouches standing in the moonlight waiting for Admiral Rowley and
his intoxicated following to take the road. And then Conrad,
interrupting..."By Jove," he said, "it's a third person who is
writing!"</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The psychology of that moment is perfectly plain to the writer.
Conrad interrupted with a note of relief in his voice. He had found
a formula to justify collaboration in general and our
collaboration. Until then we had struggled tacitly each for our own
note in writing. With the coming of blue nights, the moon, palms
and the brilliant lights of the inn reflected down the river,
Conrad saw the possibilities that there were for his own exotic
note in the story. Above all, with the coming of politics; for John
Kemp, in coming to blows with Mr. Topnambo, member of the
Governor's Council, then and there identified himself with the
party in the island of Jamaica that at that date desired annexation
by the United States.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>This at once made our leading character handleable by Conrad.
John Kemp merely kidnapped by pirates and misjudged by the judicial
bench of our country was not so vastly attractive, but a John Kemp
who was in addition a political refugee, suspect of High Treason
and victim of West India merchants...That was squeezing the last
drop of blood out of the subject...</p>

<p>The differences in our temperaments were sufficiently well
marked. Conrad was brave: he was for inclusion and hang the
consequences. The writer, more circumspect, was for ever on the
watch to suppress the melodramatic incident and the sounding
phrase. So, till that psychological moment, the writer doing most
of the first drafting, Conrad had been perpetually crying, "Give!
Give!" The writer was to give one more, and one more, and again one
more turn to the screw that sent the rather listless John Kemp
towards an inevitable gallows. The actual provision of intrigue in
1820 between England and Jamaica was the writer's business. Conrad
contented himself with saying, "You must invent. You have got to
make that fellow live perpetually under the shadow of the gallows."
In the original draft of the book John Kemp had been the mere
second mate of a merchant ship going out to Jamaica in the ordinary
course of his business of following the sea. But in the second
draft he was mixed up with smugglers and fled from Hythe beach in
the moonlight with the Bow Street runners hot on his
trail&mdash;already a candidate for the professional attentions of
the hangman. In that second draft, however, he was in Jamaica,
still merely a planter's apprentice&mdash;insufficiently hangable.
There had to be more inevitability in the shape of invention. The
writer therefore set to work to read a vast number of Jamaica
newspapers of the twenties and, finding that that island was then
an ant-heap of intrigue by what were called Secessionists, it was
an easy task to identify Kemp hangably with those traitors to the
British crown. Conrad, however, was a Loyalist: a Loyalist to every
regime that ever existed but passionately a Loyalist to Great
Britain. It was therefore necessary to give the screw one turn
more: Kemp had to be made a misjudged man, betrayed by the stupid
cruelty of merchants and the administration. He thus became exactly
a figure for Conrad to handle. For, if Conrad were the eternal
Loyalist, nevertheless the unimaginative and cruel stupidity of
Crown and Government officials was an essential part of his creed.
He was a politician&mdash;but a politician of the <i>impasse</i>.
The British Empire was for him the perfection of human perfections,
but <i>all</i> its politicians, all its public officials, police,
military officers of the Crown, gaolers, pilots, port admirals and
policies were of an imbecility that put them in intelligence below
the first lieutenant of the French navy that you could come
across...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So, by that moment, we had worked John Kemp into a position that
can have been occupied by very few unjustly accused heroes of
romance. When he stood in the Old Bailey Dock he had the whole
legal, the whole political, the whole naval forces of the Crown,
the whole influence at once of the City of London and of the
Kingdom of Spain determined to hang him. And the writer is bound to
confess that on reading "Romance", after an interval of twenty
years&mdash;and in a French translation!&mdash;the hairs really did
rise on his scalp over the predicament of John Kemp on his trial.
And he wondered at the melodramatic genius that had been possessed
by that third writer that was neither himself nor Conrad...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For having got hold of that comforting theory Conrad never
abandoned it. At intervals during our readings aloud that lasted
for years he would say, always as if it were a <i>trouvaille</i>,
that that was certainly the writing of a third party. It had not
been long before he had given up all hope of swift fortune coming
with the speedy finishing of that book. For the writer the pleasure
of eternal technical discussion with Conrad was a sufficient motive
for continuing our labours. But for Conrad, with his stern sense of
the necessity for making a career, that was not enough. He had to
find at least an artistic justification for going on. We were both
extremely unaccepted writers, but we could both write. What was the
sense of not writing apart if there were no commercial gain? He
found it in the aesthetically comforting thought that the world of
letters was enriched by yet a third artist. The third artist had
neither his courage nor his gorgeousness; he himself had none of
his collaborator's literary circumspection or verbal puritanism. So
the combination was at least...different.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Thus came about our drive to the Lower Sandgate Road. Conrad
considered it appropriate that we should make an official
announcement. The collaboration was determined upon. For the
receiving of this official communication no one could have been
more appropriate than the author of "The Invisible Man." Conrad had
in those days a very strong sense that those who had taken part in
his launching as a writer had the right to have communicated to
them any crucial determination at which he arrived. It was a fine
trait in his character. He had originally consulted Mr. Henley, Mr.
Marriott Watson and, the writer presumes, Mr. Edward Garnett, these
having been, as it were, his chief backers behind the scenes. Mr.
Wells had been his chief backer before the public&mdash;as
Reviewer. All the reviews that "Almayer's Folly" had received had
amounted to a mountain of praise; the most tremendous and moving
commendation had been that contributed by Mr. Wells to the
<i>Saturday Review</i>, an organ that was then almost miraculously
regarded, under the editorship of Mr. Frank Harris. Mr. Wells then,
living in our neighbourhood, to whom better could this junta have
proceeded? So at least Conrad thought and the writer offered no
active objection.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Mr. Wells apparently thought the same. Of what happened at that
villa in the Lower Sandgate Road, except that the back garden had,
descending to the sea-beach, a stepladder up and down which several
charming creatures were disporting themselves with the Channel as
background, the writer carries in his memory now only the
conversation of Bob Stevenson and the remembrance of Conrad,
talking to Mrs. Wells with enormous animation about the great storm
in which for the first time he came up the Channel, passing that
point. The writer was engaged in remembering that great storm. He
had been at school at Folkestone on the cliff almost
perpendicularly above where we then sat. In the morning after the
gale had blown itself out we looked down in sunlight from the edge
of the Leas. The whole sickle of Dungeness Bay had a fleet ashore
on its beaches&mdash;innumerable smacks and coasting vessels, large
international sailing ships and two East Indiamen, the
<i>Plassy</i> and the <i>Clive</i>, with their towering black and
white sides, all heeling over, rigging and canvas hanging down like
curtains right round the bay, unforgettable and helpless...Bob
Stevenson was engaged in telling the writer with animation almost
equal to that of Conrad that Ford Madox Brown could not paint. The
writer was wishing himself with the group round Conrad and Mrs.
Wells. The crossing of the voices of those two brilliant
conversationalists remains still in these ears, and the odd mixture
of feelings...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>On the next day Mr. Wells bicycled up to Aldington Knoll, where
at about seven miles distant from the Pent the writer was once
again leading an agricultural life of the severer type&mdash;in a
cottage of the most minute, the Conrads occupying the Pent. The
writer was, indeed, engaging himself on the invention of a new
species of potato in the intervals of contriving the gallows for
John Kemp. Mr. Wells came to persuade the writer not to collaborate
with Conrad. With an extreme earnestness he pleaded with the writer
not to spoil Conrad's style. "The wonderful Oriental style...It's
as delicate as clockwork and you'll only ruin it by sticking your
fingers in it." The writer answered that Conrad wanted a
collaboration and as far as the writer was concerned Conrad was
going to get what he wanted. He can still see the dispirited action
of Mr. Wells as he mounted his bicycle by the rear step and rode
away along that ridge of little hills...No more than those two
speeches had been exchanged.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-4" id="ch1-4"></a>IV.</h2>

<p>Into the still, depressed note of the Pent there had introduced
itself the tremendous panorama of sea and sky that showed from
Aldington with its Knoll. We passed our time driving the amiable
mare or the infamous Exmoor pony between one and the other. We went
out of a sunshiny morning with bits of manuscript; we returned
through bitter rain-storms, the mud splashing up visibly before the
dim lanthorns, the manuscript read aloud, commented on, docketed
for alteration...It comes back as a time of great tranquillity,
though the high skies of Aldington, with the sickle-shaped, painted
marsh and the flat Channel ending with the pink cliffs of Boulogne,
seem cracked as the surface of an old, bright painting will be
cracked&mdash;with the agonies of Conrad's poverty, unsuccess,
negotiations and misgivings.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Still, a time of great tranquillities, and, at intervals, there
were triumphs. Pinker, a blinking Bramah in the shape of Destiny,
would grant an unimaginable advance; William Heinemann&mdash;the
most generous and wise of publishers, a Jew at that&mdash;would
hand out an unexpected cheque on the top floor of Number 31 Bedford
Street whilst the writer kept Pawling&mdash;a blond Christian but
much more like a publisher than his Semitic
partner&mdash;interested as well as he might with a description of
the plot of "The Inheritors", a thin collaboration with no plot in
particular that Heinemanns eventually published. Then Conrad would
come in, buttoning his overcoat over the cheque; Mr. Pawling would
throw up his hands and exclaim to the writer, "You've let him get
at that ass William again. By God, that is not cricket!"...And the
two conspirators against the peace of mind of Number 31 Bedford
Street would proceed to the famous Bodega just out of the Strand.
There, with Sir Henry Irving and Nellie Farren at adjoining tables,
over smoked salmon and champagne in small tumblers, they would play
dominoes until the last train for Sandling Junction, with its quiet
lines of scenery, its fresh breath of air, and the mare in charge
of the stable boy who would be just lighting the lamps of the
trap&mdash;that last train leaving Charing Cross at 4.50 and
getting down just at dusk...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>There is something conducive to writing in low rooms, in a
commonplace downland country, with nearly level fields that run
into quiet convolutions, away to a distance. Let the direct
lighting be modified by a barn, the illumination coming from the
peak of the sky: let there be a quarterdeck walk up and down which
Conrad may turn in his pyjamas and dressing gown occasionally,
getting relief from his thoughts in a glance at the quiet fields
amongst which the writer will be practising golf strokes...Well, in
just such a room with a barn to block the direct light, with a
miniature stockyard, in a commonplace downland country the
writer&mdash;sits writing! And you dare to tell him that he cannot
go out and, in the rain, catch his dangerous pony that swings round
and kicks the inviting sieve of corn out of your hand, just missing
your chest...He cannot drive the seven miles to the Pent to ask
Conrad what he thinks of Colonel Marchand and Fashoda!...You must
surely be lying...Or you mean to tell him that in half an hour
Conrad, in the dilapidated motor hired from the White Hart at
Stamford, won't be coming in to ask what we are to think of Fashoda
and Colonel Marchand and what we shall do if there is really war
with France...We get the London papers only by the second post at
4.30, and do not as a rule look at them until to-morrow at
breakfast time. But in these exciting times, with Colonel Marchand
crossing the Sahara and hoisting the French flag in a position
which Kitchener of Khartoum has stated to be the key-point of the
British Empire in Africa and consequently on the road to
India...And the French with their extraordinary .75 quick-firer
field gun...It all turns on what the Germans will do, the Russians
having their hands full in the Far East...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was like that, when we were not discussing the desirability
of the word <i>bleu-foncé</i> as an adjective to apply to cabbages
in a field, or when we were not moved to queer enthusiasms over the
use of words by Christina Rossetti...But if you tell me that I
cannot put in Tommy and drive through the rain to the candle-lit
Pent&mdash;no <i>Eau, Gaz, Electricité</i> in <i>that</i>
gentleman's residence&mdash;well, if you tell me that, I suppose
you are right...<i>"C'est le mur d'un silence eternel qui descend
devant vous, mon vieux!"</i>...For the feeling, through a large
part of a century, was for the writer very strong that Conrad was
there, who <i>might</i> be consulted about a difficulty&mdash;in
politics, in the architecture of a story, over an English word, or
about the French for Romance&mdash;for which there is no
French!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The irresistible feeling that one had about him was that he was
practical, that the last thing that he was was Slav. For the Slav,
to be true Slav, must be as helpless before the vicissitudes of
this world&mdash;as helpless as is a new-born kitten, 2 greyish,
sprawling object, mostly jelly. A sort of Dostoievsky! If you asked
Conrad how to circumvent a banker he would have an expedient. If
you asked him whether women ought to have a vote he would say, No!
with decision. And then, remembering the part played by women in
keeping alive the national feeling of his country, Poland, where
all the men took to drunkenness or lechery or listnessness after
the abortive revolution of 1862, he would say that the only
creature that ought to be paid the compliment of having a vote, a
thing always useless, was such a woman as his mother, Mme.
Korzeniowski, or his aunt, Mme. Paradowski. Or any other woman!
But, as his private expedient, he said to women in the words of the
Mohammedan ranee of Palembang, "Why should you strive for
domination during the day?...Your power is of the night, during
which, with a whisper, you shall destroy empires!"</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The dominant attraction of Conrad's mind was the firmness with
which he held ideas after he had contemplated a sufficient number
of facts or documents. He had had great experience of the life of
normal men; his reading had been amazingly wide and his memory was
amazingly retentive. Amazingly, even to the writer, whose memory is
sufficiently retentive and whose reading wide if desultory. Yet
Conrad never presented any appearance of being a bookish, or even a
reading man. He might have been anything else; you could have taken
fifty guesses at his occupation, from, precisely, ship's captain
to, say, financier, but poet or even student would never have been
among them and he would have passed without observation in any
crowd. He was frequently taken for a horse fancier. He liked
that.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>His ambition was to be taken for&mdash;to be!&mdash;an English
country gentleman of the time of Lord Palmerston. There might have
been worse ambitions. To understand how a Pole, born in the
Government of Kiev, infinitely far from even the sea, should have
desired to be that&mdash;and should have desired it with
passion&mdash;the reader must keep in mind two things if not three,
one of them a vivid picture in the mind of the writer. During the
last century, if you went down to Tilbury Dock, you would see
families of Jewish-Poland emigrants landing. As soon as they landed
they fell on their hands and knees and kissed the soil of the land
of freedom. For Conrad there was another side. As a child he lived
in a great house in Poland: a great house with wide avenues and
many lights at night. One night all the lights went out, the
avenues were deserted; a sledge without bells came before the
portico. A figure, cloaked and muffled to the hat rim, came up the
steps and was closeted for long with the master of the house. Then
drove away over the snow. Conrad said he could imagine that he
heard the voice of <i>l'or de la perfide Albion</i> jingling in
great bags as the sledge went away.</p>

<p>For this was the emissary of Lord Palmerston, sowing gold all
over Poland so that the Polish revolutionary spirit might be kept
alive and Russia embarrassed in her encroachments on Pera or
Afghanistan.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For that was England of Conrad's early vision: an immense power
standing for liberty and hospitality for refugees; vigilant over a
pax Britannica that embraced the world. With an all-powerful navy
she had an all-powerful purse. She was stable, reasonable,
disciplined, her hierarchies standing in their orders, her classes
settled, her services capable and instinct with an adequate
tradition. And ready to face Russia with fleet or purse when or
wherever they should meet. The first English music-hall song that
Conrad heard was:</p>

<p class="newspaper">We don't want to fight but, by Jingo, if we
do,<br>
We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the money
too.<br>
We 've fought the bear before and so we will again,<br>
The Russians shall not have Constantinople...</p>

<p>A Pole of last century&mdash;and above all things Conrad was a
Pole of last century&mdash;could ask nothing better.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>And, above all things else, as the writer has somewhere pointed
out, Conrad was a politician. He loved the contemplation of
humanity pulling away at the tangled skeins of parties or of
alliances. Until, suddenly, a strand gave, a position cleared up, a
ministry was solidly formed, a dynasty emerged. He was, that is to
say, a student of politics, without prescription, without dogma,
and, as a Papist, with a profound disbelief in the perfectibility
of human institutions. The writer never saw Conrad read any book of
memoirs except those of Maxime Ducamp and the Correspondence of
Flaubert; those we read daily together over a space of years. But
somewhere in the past Conrad had read every imaginable and
unimaginable volume of politician's memoirs, Mme. de Campan, the
Due d'Audiffret Pasquier, Benjamin Constant, Karoline Bauer, Sir
Horace Rumbold, Napoleon the Great, Napoleon III, Benjamin
Franklin, Assheton Smith, Pitt, Chatham, Palmerston, Parnell, the
late Queen Victoria, Dilke, Morley...There was no memoir of all
these that he had missed or forgotten&mdash;down to "Il Principe"
or the letters of Thomas Cromwell. He could suddenly produce an
incident from the life of Lord Shaftesbury and work it into
"Nostromo", which was the political history of an imagined South
American Republic. That was one of the secrets of his
greatness.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But certainly he had no prescription. Revolutions were to him
always anathema since, he was accustomed to declare, <i>all</i>
revolutions always have been, always must be, nothing more in the
end than palace intrigues&mdash;intrigues either for power within,
or for the occupancy of, a palace. The journalist's bar in the
palace of the Luxemburg, where sits the present Senate of the Third
Republic, was once the bedchamber of Marie de Medicis.</p>

<p>That is not to say that Conrad actively desired the restoration
of the Bourbons; he would have preferred the journalists to remain
where they were rather than have any revolution at all. All
revolutions are an interruption of the processes of thought and of
the discovery of a New Form...for the novel.</p>

<p>Indeed, almost the only revolution that he contemplated with
enthusiasm was one by which a successful adventurer seized the
reins of power. Anywhere! Some King Tom! It was not that his
visions were Napoleonic. His favourite modern ruler was Louis
Napoleon, Napoleon I being too big, too rhetorical, too portentous
for any intimacy. We planned for many years, and even wrote one
scene of, a historical novel dealing with First Empire figures. But
the First Empire was gone; the subject was the attempts made to
save Ney from execution; the chapter showed Louis XVIII a
bewildered figure, forced to sleep and receive petitioners in a
corridor between two doors, the Protocol providing lavish rooms for
innumerable peers of France, lackeys and parasites, but none at all
for God's anointed whose handkerchief was always dangling halfway
out of his hip pocket. That was how we&mdash;or rather how Conrad,
for the writer never had any political views of any strength at
all&mdash;regarded restored Legitimacy. Yet he was fit to throw the
teacups into the fire if you derided the doctrine of the divine
right of kings.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>No, on the whole, his favourite political character was Louis
Napoleon as Adventurer, and even Napoleon III, Emperor of the
French, roused some of his admiration. He liked gilt Third Empire
furniture, all other gilding, reviews, uniforms, la Montijo,
mirrors, fraudulent financiers, the Due de Morny, the Mexican
adventurer. He liked the mournful, cynical sovereign surrounded by
the crowd of adventurers, <i>escrocs, rastacouères</i> and
prostitutes in high places that brought down the Empire. He admired
Napoleon III for his dream of a Latin Union, which Conrad found
practicable and to be desired. That was probably his idea of
humanity, a realm in which the solitary, cynical, not impracticable
dreamer is brought down by his womankind, his relations, his
servants, his hangers-on, his household. He saw the same microcosm
in the bankruptcy and ruin of a Court perfumer&mdash;or of the
captain of a coastwise trading ship. He prized fidelity, especially
to adventurers, above all human virtues and saw very little of it
in this world.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>His favourite political anecdote, that which he repeated the
most often, was of the Maire of the XIHth Arrondissement who sent
to Morny, then his half-brother's Minister and taking the waters at
Spa, a telegram to the effect that the whole 'Rue de la Glacierè
was in a state of insurrection. It ended, "Que faire?" And Morny
replied...But we are writing for Anglo-Saxons. This not very
edifying anecdote was Conrad's favourite but it is not to be taken
as implying that Conrad's mind was unedified. It simply showed his
contempt for the way in which human affairs are conducted. It was
as if he said, "All politicians are such fools that you might as
well conduct the high businesses of state in the spirit of Morny.
You will only find Maires of the XIIIth Arrondissement to carry out
your orders."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He desired a stable world in which you could think and develop
the New Form. And because at no phase of the world's history has
there seemed to be a portion of the world more stable than was
England under the ruling classes of Lord Palmerston's time, he
desired to be of the type of a member of the ruling classes of
England in Lord Palmerston's day. He lived as such, and as such he
died. We are so far from those days; it seems hardly likely that
any one's withers will be wrung if we say that he might have had a
meaner ideal.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We come thus to Captain Marryatt. It would be too much to say
that Marryatt had any influence at all on Conrad as
writer&mdash;though Conrad was of opinion that Marryatt had
profoundly influenced his writing&mdash;but the effect of Marryatt
on Conrad as philosopher <i>tel quel</i>, and as English gentleman,
could not be too much stated. Indeed, in the course of our last
meeting, the writer reminded Conrad that almost the first literary
opinion Conrad ever uttered at the Pent was in eulogy of Marryatt.
Conrad replied that he remained exactly of that opinion: Marryatt
was, after Shakespeare, the greatest novelist as delineator of
character, that England has produced. The opinion must be limited
to what it covers, and that strictly. Conrad was not saying that
Marryatt was, say, nearly as great a poet as Shakespeare; he was
saying that Marryatt observed English character with exactitude and
rendered it without exaggeration, all other English novelists
getting their effects by more or less of caricature.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The books of the author of "Midshipman Easy" are so relegated to
oblivion, being considered as boys' books, that this pronouncement
may appear strange. It may, however, be recommended to the reader's
serious attention as the measured opinion of no mean critic. What
we are about at the moment is considering the effect of Marryatt
upon the character and psychology of Conrad.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p><i>That</i> influence at least was profound and lifelong, like
the undertone of a song. During all the years of our collaboration
it was always as if Conrad were saying, "Ah: but wait till I get to
my Napoleonic novel, with the frigates in the Mediterranean." That
was the golden age for such English as are held by the sea. And
during those years we planned rather elaborately a collaboration
set in late Napoleonic to Restoration days, the central figures
being Ney, and an English <i>milor</i> with the spleen, but the
narrator a frigate-lieutenant, protege of the <i>milor</i> who,
coming from the Mediterranean and gallant service with the
frigates, should introduce&mdash;the Marryatt touch!...We spent a
great deal of time over memoirs of the period, the writer occupying
himself with Dundonald, English <i>milors</i> and the part taken by
the Tsar in the execution of Ney, Conrad getting his information as
to the Restoration period in a way that was rather mysterious to
the writer, so did Conrad seem to have all those figures in his
mind...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We discussed this novel till very late indeed in our
association. On an occasion in July, 1916, Conrad said to the
writer, "Well, you'll be able to bring something back for the Ney
book, about campaigning in France," as we shook hands...Alas! that
which wiped out so many little villages under our eyes wiped out
that book too, the writer abandoning for many years all idea of
writing&mdash;losing indeed all ability to write. And Conrad
continued alone...Thus, in "The Rover", in the offing, you have the
vigilant and capable frigate captain!...And on the day of his death
Conrad was occupied&mdash;with Napoleon at Elba and the frigate
service of the Mediterranean, seeking to live again the glamour
that the English seanovelist had cast over his young years in
Poland. So tenacious are the glamours of our youth!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Yes! <i>That</i> influence at least was profound. He looked at
the world of human affairs with the eyes of Jack Easy and affronted
difficulties with the coolness of Percival Keene. At that statement
the reader should not smile. The tradition of the frigate service
of Dundonald and the rest was no mean one; its influence on the
British character was far-reaching, was all-important. And the
achievement and tradition of England during the last century cannot
be ignored by those who can be interested in the achievements and
traditions of mankind.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer has said too much in other places of the influence of
Marryatt on the writer himself and on Conrad to go picturesquely
once more over the matter. But there are those who have read
neither Marryatt nor the writer. Marryatt concerned himself mainly,
then, with the frigate warfare of Napoleonic times. And the frigate
warfare of Napoleonic times was, compared with the line of battle
warfare for which stand the names of Nelson and his great captains,
as something obscure, anonymous, desperate and very gallant. For
thousands who shall know the names of Nelson, Howe, or St. Vincent
there will be hardly one that has heard tell of Cochrane. Yet this
little service was incessant, pursued under desperate conditions of
weather and of inshore work, the frigates being only upon occasion
the mere eyes of the fleet, the great fleets with the great
first-raters rolling majestically from ocean to ocean, half the
world over and then back again to fight now and then a Trafalgar or
an Aboukir. But the frigates were at it every day in the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Such a service, without comfort, without advertisement, almost
without the glory of the King's uniform, for its officers dressed
like sweeps, remained midshipmen to the age of forty and were
betallowed to the elbow&mdash;was the meaning of England to Conrad,
as to the writer during his younger years. One saw the
self-sacrifice, the patience, the fidelity. And if Conrad in later
years wrote of fidelity as the key-word of his "message", it was of
this fidelity that he was thinking. Of fidelity not to a realm from
which they were for so long absent, and not to a royal countenance
which never shone upon them, but of fidelity to an idea, to a
service.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The idea was this: In the first place came the sea, the sea not
as a bitter element, but as an instrument by means of which the
frigates battled against inefficiency, strange customs, the eating
of frogs, wooden shoes. Upon the sea were only the
English&mdash;and the French; the English as the representatives of
that Almighty which holds the sea in the hollow of His hand, the
English, blond, hardy, cunning, vigilant, each one six foot and
over, jolly, in the exact image of their Maker, cordial. The
French, the subordinates, representatives of Satan, perpetually
driven off the sea to hide behind the moles of Toulon or of
Cherbourg, perpetually creeping out as do bedbugs from crevices in
walls...One Englishman was worth one, three, seventeen,
twenty-seven Frenchmen...There was the sea, then, and that its
business, its function.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Presumably the frigates did succeed in their work, though if you
read French textbooks you would hardly think so, any more than when
reading the Americans you will hear much about the <i>Shannon</i>
and the <i>Chesapeake</i>. According to the French it was <i>l'or
de la perfide Albion</i> that did the trick. In that way Conrad got
it both ways, since he liked a nation that had both its sea service
and its gold. Gold also is sterling, incorruptible, and has its
fidelities. In the meantime, there had grown up another service
with a tradition almost identical&mdash;that of the British
mercantile marine, of ships not too vast to be impermeable to the
weather, making, by means of the caprices and brutalities of the
winds, engrossed and perpetual departures and landfalls round
dangerous headlands. Nowadays you will find little enough
difference between the coastwise men of any nation but in the
seventies and eighties of last century Conrad, by dint of
experience, found in that service, muted but almost more patient
and engrossed, the tradition of Marryatt's frigates. It was
fidelity to an ideal, the ideal of the British merchant service; it
was still more a tradition working efficiently. For in that
service, all going to make up the record of British-owned bottoms,
even if they sailed under the flag of Siam, all going to contribute
to the long story of what is the shipshape, are hundreds of Dagoes,
Lascars, Swedes, Danes, Finns, Negroes, Americans, Kruboys...And
one Pole.</p>

<p>Conrad then, in his misty youth that seemed to pass in great
houses or in the prison yards of the exiled child, and mostly at
night or at nightfall, read with engrossment Marryatt and Fenimore
Cooper, and so sowed the seeds of his devotion to England. He had
his devotion to his art and his devotion to his second country. In
the end his devotion to his second country overcame his devotion to
his art. The only occasion on which the writer ever questioned the
actions of Conrad&mdash;and it is the truth that this was the only
occasion on which any action of Conrad's known to the writer was
ever even questionable!&mdash;was when that writer accepted
membership of the British Academy. This as a writer he should not
have done, nor as an artist. The body was without venerability,
committed to courses of propaganda, and of a habit, to be
destructive to the art by which Conrad had made his name, to which
he owed fidelity.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Accordingly on a given occasion the writer remonstrated against
this questionable action. It was during sad times for the nation,
in a gloomy room of the most architecturally lugubrious buildings
that are to be found near the Marble Arch in London. Conrad was
depressed; there was no one that was then not depressed. The
writer, the occasion being one for clearings-up of everything that
could be cleared up, put the question as to why Conrad had, how
Conrad could have, thus denied the gods of his manhood. A
knighthood yes! Any sort of Order, yes! A C.B.; an O.B.E.!...It had
not been ten years or much more since, when talking of the
possibilities of such a foundation, Conrad had said that were he
offered its insignia he would wear them on the seat of his
trousers&mdash;a gibe which we immediately introduced into "The
Inheritors."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The reader should understand that this matter is one which
divides forever&mdash;into sheep and goats&mdash;the world of the
arts. There are some few artists who will accept Academic honours;
to the majority of those who are really artists the idea is
abhorrent, and those who accept such honours betray their brothers.
To this majority Conrad had enthusiastically belonged. You had
Flaubert who refused, you had Zola who all his life sought,
academic distinction. For Conrad there had used to be no question
as to which to follow. Now he had followed Zola.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad answered with mildness. And nothing could have been more
unlike Conrad. Both of us being upholders of the duel, we had
always lived together under a sort of standard of formality. Except
upon Belgian railways when Conrad would refuse with fire to show
his ticket to collectors because he was an Englishman and they some
sort of Dagoes, the writer never remembers otherwise to have
remonstrated with the author of "Heart of Darkness."...But Conrad
answered with heavy and depressed mildness...Yes, to have accepted
that honour might have the aspect of denying the gods of his youth.
That was a thing to be regarded with depression. On the other hand
England had offered him hospitality; he had been granted fame in
England and the opportunity to live in Kent where the lines of the
fields run quietly one into the other. England was desirous of
founding an institution that should, as a part of its functions, do
some sort of honour to the trade of authorship. The company in
which he found himself, admirable as it was, was not exactly that
which could have been expected. But, if it was a question of his
private principles as against any honour he could show the English
State, his private principles must go by the board.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was a point of view.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-5" id="ch1-5"></a>V.</h2>

<p>The most English of the English, Conrad was the most South
French of the South French. He was born in Beaucaire, beside the
Rhône; read Marryatt in the shadow of the castle of the good king
Réné, Daudet on the Cannebière of Marseilles, Gautier in the tufts
of lavender and rosemary of the little forests between Marseilles
and Toulon, Maupassant on the French torpedo boats on which he
served and Flaubert on the French flagship, <i>Ville d'Ompteda</i>.
With the Sabran-Penthievres and other Macmahonists he painted red
the port of Marseilles, intrigued for Napoleon III, hired, since
there was nothing else to be hired, an unpainted four-in-hand from
a coachbuilder's yard and drove, buried in actresses and the opera
chorus, to the races. So he made the French navy too hot to hold
him. That, however, is also the spirit of the traditional British
navy. The writer is never tired of reciting the terms of the
offence for which his great-uncle, Tristram Madox, was cashiered:
in that, whilst drunk, he swam ashore from the flagship without
leave and riotously assaulted Mr. Peter Parker of Valetta,
tobacconist. The one offence is more French, the other more
English...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>As above, however, Conrad again and again recounted his
Marseilles exploit. No doubt with the fall of Macmahon and the
disappearance of any hope for the Bonapartists the chance of a
career for Conrad in the French navy so diminished as to leave that
service with few attractions. Conrad's influence and
<i>attachés</i> in France were all Third Empire. He would relate
the instance of the unvarnished coach with great energy and fire
and then, dropping his hands with mock senility, exclaim, "<i>Alas,
tel que vous me voyez</i> ...Now I am an extinct volcano..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was not, however, that. It was merely that diminished
circumstances had reduced the team of four to the old mare or some
<i>remplacant</i>. We would drive down to Hythe or hire a motor
that broke down eight times in eighteen miles and go between the
shallow downs up the Elham valley&mdash;at the top of which he
died&mdash;to Canterbury. And at once Conrad was the sailor ashore.
He <i>had</i> to find a bar and have a drink, the writer, with the
prudishness of the Englishman in his own county, waiting outside.
For you must not have a drink in the bar of your own county town. A
lunch at the farmer's ordinary with five pints of beer; tea in the
smoking room with whiskies brought in on the tray! But in the bar,
never! The point is a fine one. But Conrad, though at home he was
the English country gentleman and other things permitting, would
have bred shorthorns and worn leggings, threw, in his Jack-ashore
frame of mind, these considerations to the wind. A drink in the bar
was provided for in King's Regulations. You might not be thirsty:
it had to be.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad's biography as narrated in those days to, and in presence
of, the writer, might as well here come in...We have arrived, at
any rate in the writer's mind, at about the time when we dropped,
ostensibly for good, any hope of bringing "Romance" to a finish and
took to collaborating on "The Inheritors." By that date the writer
had heard enough of Conrad's autobiography, sufficiently repeated,
to have a rounded image of his past&mdash;such an image at any rate
as Conrad desired to convey. For, like every inspired raconteur
Conrad modified his stories subtly, so as to get in sympathy with
his listener. He did it not so much with modifications of fact as
with gestures of the hand, droppings of the voice, droopings of the
eyelid and letting fall his monocle&mdash;and of course with some
modifications of the facts. So the story, afterwards used in "A
Smile of Fortune", told to the writer alone was one thing and told
to his sprightly, very intelligent aunt, Mme. Paradowski, was
something quite different It would be thinner, less underlined,
more of a business-like subject for treatment if told to the writer
alone; when told to the French lady&mdash;who was also a
novelist&mdash;it would be much livelier, much more punctuated with
gestures and laughs&mdash;much more <i>pimenté</i>, in fact, the
story of a sailor's <i>bonne fortune</i>.</p>

<p>It was the only story of a <i>bonne fortune</i> that the writer
ever heard told by Conrad. And the note may as well here be made
that in all our extreme intimacy, lasting for many years, neither
of us ever told what is called a smoking-room story. We never even
discussed the relations of the sexes.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So, at the turn of the century&mdash;for "The Inheritors" must
have been published about 1901 and, having been written rather
fast, must have been begun in 1900&mdash;the history of Conrad
appeared much as follows to the writer. He was born&mdash;not, of
course, physically in Beaucaire, but in that part of Poland which
lay within the government of Kiev&mdash;in Ukrainia, in the Black
Lands where the soil is very fertile. He was born around 1858. At
any rate he was old enough to remember the effects of the Polish
Revolution of the early sixties&mdash;say 1862. The
oldest&mdash;the first&mdash;memory of his life was of being in a
prison yard on the road to the Russian exile station of the
Wologda. "The Kossacks of the escort," these are Conrad's exact
words repeated over and over again, "were riding slowly up and down
under the snowflakes that fell on women in furs and women in rags.
The Russians had put the men into barracks, the windows of which
were tallowed. They fed them on red herrings and gave them no water
to drink. My father was among them."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>(The implication is of course that Conrad's father died of
thirst behind those windows that were tallowed so that the men
should not look out and see their womenfolk. Actually, of course,
Conrad's father did not die in these circumstances, but it was not
until quite lately that the writer was aware of his
misapprehension...This, however, is the exact history of a
relationship.)</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad remained with his mother in exile until he was nine or
ten, then, his mother being threatened with an immediate death from
tuberculosis, they were allowed to return to Poland. Conrad's
mother was a woman of great beauty of physique and of character.
Her face was oval, her black hair braided round it, her eyes
intent, her manner quiet but spirited. His father was less
effectual, the prime mover of an abortive revolution, a fact which
Conrad deprecated. His father was not so dark as his mother;
untidy, bearded, with high cheek bones, he was the proprietor, not
professionally but as a revolutionist, of a famous newspaper in
which he wrote a great deal. He was constantly writing: his style
was not very distinguished.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Of his father Conrad spoke always deprecatorily. This was partly
politeness. Whoever you were, his interlocutor, all that pertained
to you&mdash;your father and all your ancestors&mdash;must be
superior to his. It was his poor little books, his poor little
brains, his poor little exploits set against all your splendours.
Partly, too, it really pained him to think that his father had been
a revolutionary&mdash;and an unsuccessful revolutionary at that; as
if he had been prenatally connected with something not shipshape!
For his mother he had on the other hand that passionate adoration
that is felt by the inhabitants of Latin and Western Slav countries
for their mothers and that seems so "foreign" to the Anglo-Saxon.
Oddly but comprehensibly, when he spoke of his mother as
revolutionary he was full of enthusiasm. For him the Polish
national spirit had been kept alive by such women as his mother:
the men were hopeless. Again not shipshape. This was not difficult
to understand. The men were prohibited from living a life of their
own. The only career that the Russians allowed them to study for
was that of the law. So they were all either lawyers or
babblers&mdash;or both&mdash;and without any practical training.
This for generations and generations...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>As for class&mdash;the Korzeniowskis were country gentlemen, for
all the world like an English County Family, with land lived on and
owned since the darkest ages, untitled, but aristocrats to the
backbone; what is called in England "Good people", a term which is
untranslatable into any other language and incomprehensible even to
Americans. This made Conrad feel at home in Kent; many times he
said so. The feudal spirit survived in the territories of the great
landowners.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad had an uncle&mdash;Paradowski&mdash;who was a great Pan,
guardian to the children of half the noble families of that
Government. He had a longish&mdash;as if squared&mdash;face, a long
nose, meditative hands that were always pausing in some action and
long brownish hair that fell rather Germanly over the collar of a
velvet coat. It was to his great country house that the emissary of
Palmerston had come. (The writer's friend Count Potocki tells the
writer that the name of this uncle must have been Bibrowski. The
name Paradowski remains, however, very firmly in the writer's mind.
Conrad was inordinately proud and fond of this uncle and fully four
fifths of his conversation when it referred to his Polish days
concerned itself with this relative: there were, for instance, the
Paradowski dragoons, a famous Russian regiment named after him or
his ancestors. Similarly in early days Conrad always wrote and
pronounced his patronymic as "Kurzeniowski"; the correct
transliteration would appear to be "Korzeniowski." It does not seem
to matter much.)</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>This uncle stood well with the Russians. Before that abortive
revolution he had been a close friend of one of the Grand Dukes and
had had a part in drafting the constitution that the Czar had
proposed to grant to Poland. In the revolution he had taken no
part, not because he was indifferent to the interests of Poland but
because he knew it must prove abortive and cause much suffering and
persecution to the Russian Poles. Besides, it brought about the
rescinding of the constitution. After the revolution he busied
himself with alleviating the sufferings of his compatriots; he fed
legions of the starving dispossessed; he secured the return of
their patrimonies to the children of the exiled. Amongst these last
was Conrad: his uncle secured the return to him of half the great
confiscated estate of his father and got him permission to reside
in Russian Poland, in his own great house. (The emissary of
Palmerston had by the by been sent away with a flea in his
ear.)</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Here for years and years Conrad read Marryatt&mdash;and Fenimore
Cooper. And it was one of the little ingenuous pleasures of Conrad
to remember that in Paris after Waterloo, as recorded in the
Memoirs, more crowds followed Sir Walter Scott and Fenimore Cooper
on the boulevards than ever followed the King of Prussia. It
pleased him to find one of his early heroes thus blessed by Fame of
the bronze lungs. To this information the writer added the other
that in that same Paris of that same date Assheton Smith, the
<i>milor</i> of incredible wealth and <i>spleen</i> was, according
to the journals, followed about by crowds even greater than
attached themselves to the Czar of Russia. Out of a sort of tacit
politeness we never tried to decide whether the King of Prussia or
the Czar of Russia had the larger following. But Assheton Smith was
to have been the central figure of our novel about the execution of
Ney&mdash;the <i>milor</i> with the spleen intervening nearly
successfully to save the <i>beau sabreu</i>r. This, not because he
felt any sympathy for Ney but because he desired to put a spoke in
the wheel of Wellington and Blücher and all the fighting fellows
who were beginning to think themselves of much too much importance,
though merely younger sons. However, he made too much progress in
the affections of the Czar's Egeria, so Ney was shot by the Czar's
orders, just opposite the Closerie des Lilas on a spot occupied now
by a station of the Seaux Railway ...to spite Assheton Smith.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer never understood why it was always night in Poland;
so, however, it remains for him: a long white house, in the dark,
with silver beeches in an avenue or, ghostly, in groups. Indoors
was Conrad, right through adolescence, forever reading in the
candlelight of an immense, stately library, with busts on white
plinths and alternate groups of statuary in bronze. His uncle would
be in a rather subterranean study at the other end of the vast
house&mdash;writing his memoirs. When these two ever met the writer
never knew; of meals or even of bed he heard nothing; it was a
perpetual reading. As for the uncle's memoirs...Years after, not so
long ago, the writer found Conrad in a state of extreme
perturbation. He said, "My dear faller, you must go with me to
Boulogne! You'll have to fight the second, of course. It's always
done in Polish duelling!" It is part of what gives vagueness to
this narrative that Conrad always credited the writer with an
almost supernatural prescience as to his, Conrad's, most remote or
most immediate past. He would say, "You remember when I was on the
<i>Flower of Surabaya</i>, old Corvin, the supercargo, had that
shaving set that I lost on the <i>Duke of Sutherland</i>..." naming
two ships and a supercargo of whom the writer had never yet
heard...So on this occasion the writer naturally agreed to go to
Boulogne and pictured an immense, black moustached opponent in a
busby, a frogged dolman, top boots and a cavalry sabre whose bare
blade he caressed with his left hand...And it was not for several
days, during which we made preparations for the journey, that the
reason for our journey itself was made clear to the writer. Conrad
was too distressed to talk about it.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It appeared that the uncle Paradowski, almost viceroy of Russian
Poland and guardian to half the sons and daughters of the Polish
nobility of his province, had had unheard-of opportunities of
learning all the matrimonial and family scandals of his neighbours.
All these he had set down in his journal&mdash;and this journal had
just been published. It had caused the wildest consternation in
Poland and as Conrad was the legal heir of M. Paradowski the
responsibility for the publication was considered to be his. The
son of one of the most horribly aspersed couples had therefore
challenged Conrad and was coming to Boulogne. Conrad was horrified
to the point of madness; and he was justified. That poor fellow
shot himself in despair over the revelations, in the railway
carriage, on the journey. So we never fought...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad emerges then from the glamourous shadows of Poland,
making the Grand Tour with a lively young tutor. For the first
time, in Venice, from a window, he saw in the Giudecca a
ship&mdash;a British schooner.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>As to biography during the next few years the writer becomes
hazy. Conrad himself perhaps wished to throw a haze over a part of
his life that was for him a period of indecisions. At one time he
would say that he had determined to go to sea, years before, when
first reading Marryatt; at another, that a blaze of desire sprang
up in him on sight of that British schooner with the emotional
lines of her hull; at one time that he rushed back to Poland to
communicate his decision to his uncle; at another that he finished
the Grand Tour on the conventional lines, but arguing with his
tutor and at last finally breaking very gradually the news to his
uncle. His uncle thought him mad; there need be no doubt about
that; no Pole had ever gone to sea; all Poles had always been
lawyers; Conrad must not go to sea but must study for the law. At
the university of&mdash;was it?&mdash;Lemberg.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad at any rate went to Marseilles, and entered the French
navy. By the influence of his uncle&mdash;the Poles have always had
great influence in the chancelleries and ministries of
Europe&mdash;he was granted a commission in that service. In it he
remained an indefinite time, leaving with the rank&mdash;he was
specific as to that&mdash;of <i>Lieutenant de Torpilleurs de la
Marine Militaire Française</i>. During that time, on the French
flagship <i>Ville d'Ompteda</i>, he had witnessed the bombardment
of a South American town. The town comes back to the writer as
Caracas; but apparently Caracas is inland, so the flagship can
hardly have bombarded it. Perhaps Conrad went with a landing party
inland to that capital. In that way he saw the landscape of the
track to the silver mine of "Nostromo."</p>

<p>There followed the period of sailor-ashorishness in Marseilles
with the Bonapartist aristocracy. After the episode of the
unvarnished coach loaded with actresses Conrad telegraphed to his
uncle to come and pay his debt and embarked on his Carlist
adventure. This is told sufficiently, as Conrad used to tell it by
word of mouth, in the episode of the <i>Tremolino</i> in "The
Mirror of the Sea." When taking this episode down from Conrad's
dictation&mdash;as indeed when taking others of his personal
recollections down from dictation at times when Conrad was too
crippled by gout and too depressed to write&mdash;the writer
noticed that Conrad sensibly modified aspects and facts of his
word-ofmouth narrations. The outlines remained much the same, the
details would differ.</p>

<p>As told by Conrad&mdash;and the writer must have heard all
Conrad's stories five times and his favourite ones much more
often&mdash;the Carlist adventure was as follows: At the date of
his leaving the French service the Carlist War was being
desultorily waged in the North of Spain. (The Carlists were the
supporters of Don Carlos, the legitimist Pretender to the Spanish
throne.) The cause of the Carlists sufficiently appealed to Conrad;
it was Legitimist; it was picturesque and carried on with at least
some little efficiency. It offered a chance of adventure. In
company with like-minded friends, then, Conrad set to work at
providing rifles for the army of the Pretender. They purchased a
small, fast sailing ship&mdash;the <i>Tremolino</i>, beautiful
name. And of all the craft on which Conrad sailed this was the most
beloved by him. In our early days her name was seldom off his
tongue and, when he mentioned her, his face lit up. Nay, it lit up
before he mentioned her, the smile coming, before the name, to his
lips.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer never heard, in those days, what make of ship she
was. He was expected to know that. Conrad would say, "You know how
the <i>Tremolino</i> used to come round..." So the writer imagined
her as a felucca, with high, bowed, white sails against storm
clouds and rustcoloured cliffs. She was the beautiful ship&mdash;as
Turgenev was the beautiful Russian genius.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Pacing up and down Conrad would relate how they ran those
rifles. The method was this: They would load the <i>Tremolino</i>,
at Marseilles, with oranges, bound ostensibly for Bordeaux or any
up-channel port. Thus, "If any Spanish gun-boat accosted us we
would have a perfectly good bill of lading. Out in the Channel we
would meet a British schooner and throwing the oranges overboard we
would load up with rifles..." Those particular sentences, with
their slightly unusual use of the word "would", Conrad never
varied...He would have begun his story, unemotionally, with such
historic explanations as his hearer seemed to need. Then he would
come to the <i>Tremolino</i> and his face would light up. This
emotion would last him for a minute or two. At, as it were, the
angle where Spain turns down from France in the Mediterranean, as
if the <i>Tremolino</i> had got thus far and was just going through
the blue water with her burden of oranges, he would render his
voice dry to say either, "The method was this..." Or, "Our modus
operandi was as follows..." And then, after taking a breath, "Out
in the Channel we..." He would then go on to explain the
necessities they had when making that landfall. "You could bribe
any Spanish <i>guarda costa</i> on land with a few pesetas or a
bottle or two of rum..." But the officers of the gunboats that
patrolled the coast were incorruptible...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>"So one night the landlord of the inn omitted to show the
agreed-on light. He was drunk. In the morning we saw a Spanish
gunboat steaming back and forth in the narrow offing. The bay was a
funnel, like this...We ran the <i>Tremolino</i> on a rock, set fire
to her. Swam ashore and got country clothes for a disguise and
proceeded to Marseilles as best we could. Penniless. Without a
penny."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In telling these stories Conrad would thus occasionally
duplicate his words, trying the effect of them. Then we would
debate: What is the practical, literary difference between
"Penniless" and "Without a penny"? You wish to give the effect,
with the severest economy of words, that the disappearance of the
<i>Tremolino</i> had ruined them, permanently, for many years...Do
you say then, <i>penniless</i>, or <i>without a penny</i>?...You
say <i>Sans le sou</i>: that is fairly permanent. <i>Un sans le
sou</i> is a fellow with no money in the bank, not merely
temporarily penniless. But "without a penny" almost always carries
with it, "in our pockets." If we say then "without a penny", that
connoting the other, "We arrived in Marseilles without a penny in
our pockets."...Well, that would be rather a joke: as if at the end
of a continental tour you had got back to town with only enough
just to pay your cab-fare home. Then you would go to the bank. So
it had better be "penniless." That indicates more a state than a
temporary condition...Or would it be better to spend a word or two
more on the exposition? That would make the paragraph rather long
and so dull the edge of the story...</p>

<p>It was with these endless discussions as to the exact incidence
of words in the common spoken language&mdash;<i>not</i> the
literary language&mdash;that Conrad's stories always came over to
the writer. Sometimes the story stopped and the discussion went on
all day; sometimes the discussion was shelved for a day or two.
There were words that we discussed for years. One problem was, as
has already been hinted at: How would you translate
<i>bleu-foncé</i> as applied to a field of cattle cabbage: the
large Jersey sort, of whose stalks varnished walking sticks are
made? Or <i>bleu-du-roi</i>? And again, what are the plurals of
those adjectives in French&mdash;as a side issue...That problem we
discussed at intervals for ten years&mdash;the problem of the field
of cabbages, not of course the plurals...Now we shall never solve
it...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad, then, again telegraphed to his uncle to come and pay his
debts...The writer used to have a great-uncle whose one expedient
in life was to take a cab. One day this gentleman, walking past
Exeter Hall, met a lion. Exeter Hall in the sixties was a
menagerie. When he was asked, "What <i>did</i> you do?" he would
reply in tones of mild disgust at the questioner's want of
<i>savoir faire, "Do?</i> Why I took a cab!" ...In the same way
Conrad used to telegraph to his uncle to pay his debts and to come
to Marseilles to do it!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He embarked in a French messageries steamer as a hand before the
mast and, as has been said, made one voyage to Constantinople,
seeing tents on the hills above the European city. He returned to
Marseilles. Perhaps his uncle had not yet arrived to pay his debts
or did so only just after. Or perhaps he came three times to
Marseilles. Conrad used occasionally to let drop that, as the
writer knew, he had run through three fortunes in his life. At any
rate the image remaining to the writer is that, as Conrad sailed
away, a ship's boy, in a British brig bound for Lowestoft, Pan
Paradowski stood on the edge of the Cannebiere, like a great land
lion, lamenting on the brink of the water his beloved, ugly
duckling of a nephew who should have become a seal...A sea
lion...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1-6" id="ch1-6"></a>VI.</h2>

<p>Lowestoft has always seemed to the writer to be a queer, bleak,
whitewashed little old place from which to begin the conquest of a
language, a conspiracy against a literature, a career of fame that
became world-wide. It used at any rate to be all that: queer,
bleak, whitewashed, with flagstaffs, coast guards, high skies and
northeast wind. The writer must have been there first at the age of
five or six, and, by stretching a point or so and ignoring a couple
of years, we used to arrive at the theory that coincidence had
brought us together thus early. That cannot actually have been the
case. When Conrad first heard or spoke an English word the writer
cannot have been much more than three: so we may be said to have
learnt grown-up English in about the same year...But we used to
keep a slight haze over our respective ages. Conrad was a little
sensitive about his years, towards forty-five, and the writer did
not then care.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Besides, Conrad liked coincidences&mdash;in our playtime. He
liked to amuse himself with resemblances between himself and other
great men&mdash;Johnson collected orange peel and dried it; so at
one time Conrad had done. Or he would find in memoirs accidental
traits of resemblance between himself and Napoleon, Louis XVIII,
Theophile Gautier or General Gallifet. He would look up from his
book and read the passage out with hilarious pleasure. He liked, as
has been said, to think that at one of the Chippendale desks that
we had at the Pent Christina Rossetti had written and at another,
given to the writer's father as a wedding present, Carlyle, who was
its donor. He would say that "Heart of Darkness" was written on the
same wood as:</p>

<p class="poem">Rest, rest, a perfect rest,<br>
Shed over brow and breast,<br>
Her face is towards the West,<br>
The peaceful land.<br>
She shall not see the grain<br>
Ripen on hill and plain,<br>
She shall not feel the rain<br>
Upon her hand...</p>

<p>and "The End of the Tether" before the glass bookshelves that
had seen Carlyle write "The French Revolution." It did not matter
that Christina wrote most usually on the corner of her washstand or
that Carlyle had bought the desk at a second-hand dealer's in the
street next Tite Street, Chelsea. It made indeed no difference that
he disliked the work of Carlyle or thought Christina the greatest
master of words in verse. The lines just cited were the only
English poetry that the writer ever heard Conrad quote. He had
literally no ear for English verse...But there "Heart of Darkness"
had to have been written, and there the poem; here "The End of the
Tether", and here "The French Revolution."...It was like building
retrospective castles in Spain; it was squeezing the last drop out
of the subject.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So with our coincidental careers. The coincidences had to be
there for moments of elation. The writer, after our visit to Mr.
Wells, happened to ask whether the great storm in which Conrad had
come up the Channel for the first time had been identical with the
great gale that had wrecked the <i>Plassy</i>. And immediately it
had to be. It could not have been by seven years or so. But it
<i>was</i>...For the rest of our lives it had to be. It shall. So
with Lowestoft. Conrad could bring himself to remember there a
little boy with long, golden hair, a bucket and a spade, who used
to march up to the young able seaman and ask him questions in an
unintelligible tongue...And indeed, in moments of <i>great</i>
effusiveness, patting the writer on the shoulder, Conrad used to
assert that it was one of the writer's books, seen on the bookstall
of Geneva railway station, that had first turned his thoughts to
writing English as a possibility. That <i>might</i> indeed have
happened. But one detail of Conrad's narration was too much for the
writer's bibliophilic prudishness&mdash;though he would connive at
any time at the twisting of manageable years between two friends.
But several times before the discovery of this immense coincidence
Conrad had related how he had stood on the Geneva railway platform,
looking at the bookstall and idly wondering what he was going to do
next with his life. He had been recovering from an illness, in the
same hydrotherapy as that in which Maupassant died. Another
coincidence. He had seen a row of small,
canary-yellow&mdash;remember the canary yellow&mdash;volumes. They
were the books of the <i>Pseudonym Library</i> that Mr. Garnett had
fathered&mdash;about the colour and not much larger they were than
a packet of Maryland cigarettes at 1 fr. 50. But they were famous
throughout Europe. There was no railway bookstall on which you did
not find them...And looking at them Conrad said, "Why should I not
write, too?"...The writer's third book had been published in that
very year, fathered too by Mr. Garnett, issued by the same firm in
a series called the <i>Independent Library</i>...It might very well
have been on the bookstall, the series having been intended for
foreign circulation. There was nothing to make the thing inherently
even improbable...Alas! The writer's work was bound in a sort of
decayed liver colour: the most hideous that the writer has ever
even imagined. "So it couldn't be me," as the old mare said. But
nothing would have pleased Conrad's generous and effusive moods
better than to claim the writer as his literary godfather. He was
like that.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Years later, the writer having landed in this country at Rouen,
it occurred to him as his heel struck the quay: Conrad began to
write "Almayer's Folly" in the stateroom of a ship moored in this
very port. When he looked up from his desk, through the porthole,
he used to see the inn at which Emma Bovary met her lover. Is that
then this very spot? Do I then begin where Conrad began that other
battle?...In an interval the writer asked Conrad whether these
spots could be coincidental. He at once began to be very animated
on a drooping occasion. "Yes, yes," he said. "Opposite the very
spot...Two doors to the left of the road that goes up to the Poste
Centrale...My dear Ford...The very spot." That coincidence the
writer will not attempt to disturb.</p>

<p>Conrad landed, then, at Lowestoft when the writer was about
three, and Conrad himself not much more than twenty, the writer is
fairly certain, in 1877. Here he heard his first English words, to
recognise them. They were: "Eggs and bacon or marmalade?" He was
sitting in the bar of a public-house he had been taken to by an old
gentleman who eventually invited him to stay. Every morning at
breakfast the old gentleman uttered the above morning shibboleth of
England and then went to his business. He was the proprietor of the
famous Lowestoft pottery works, so eventually Conrad served his
time as a Boy on a brig owned by the pottery proprietor. It made
fortnightly voyages to Newcastle for coal needed by the pottery. In
such coastwise service he passed the time necessary for him to
become by turn A.B., second mate and master. He became a
naturalised British subject just before passing for master...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was during all these years that he read. Men at sea read an
inordinate amount. During the watches when they are off duty they
can, if they are so minded, sit about by the hour with books,
engrossed, like children. A large percentage of the letters
received by writers from readers come from sailors either in the
King's or the merchant service. Conrad had a great many such
correspondents; one of his own, a naval officer, the writer
curiously shared with Conrad. As each of our books came out he
would write to its author, from off Gibraltar, from the China seas,
from some Pacific station&mdash;very good letters. He seemed to
have no idea of any relationship between his two addressees, but as
he never gave the name of a ship neither of us ever wrote to him.
His letters ceased after 1914.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was Conrad's great good luck to be spared the usual
literature that attends on the upbringing of the British writer. He
read such dog-eared books as are found in the professional quarters
of ships' crews. He read Mrs. Henry Wood, Miss Braddon&mdash;above
all Miss Braddon!&mdash;the <i>Family Herald</i>, rarely even going
as high as the late William Black or the pseudo-literary writers of
his day. He once or twice said that going down Ratcliffe Highway he
was jumped out at from a doorway by a gentleman who presented him
with a pocket copy of the English Bible. This was printed on rice
paper. He used the leaves for rolling cigarettes, but before
smoking always read the page. So, he said, he learned English. The
writer has always imagined this story to be one of Conrad's
mystifications. Normally he would express the deepest gratitude to
the writers of the <i>Family Herald</i> a compilation of monthly
novelettes, the grammar of which was very efficiently censored by
its sub-editors&mdash;and above all to Miss Braddon. She wrote very
good, very sound English; machined her plots inoffensively and
well; was absolutely workmanlike, her best novels being the later
and less-known ones. Long after this period of seamanship Conrad
read "The Orange Girl", a novel placed in the time of Charles II.
He recognised in it, so he then said, all the qualities that he had
found in this novelist's work when he had been before the mast.
Miss Braddon learned Greek at the age of eighty in order to read
Homer in the original. She died only very lately.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>From that time, for ten years, Conrad followed the sea. The deep
sea, reading all sorts of books. Once an officer with quarters of
his own he resumed his reading of French along with the English
popular works. He read with the greatest veneration Flaubert and
Maupassant; with less, Daudet and Gautier; with much less Pierre
Loti. Tormented with the curiosity of words, even at sea, on the
margins of the French books, he made notes for the translation of
phrases. The writer has seen several of these old books of Conrad,
notably an annotated copy of "Pecheur d'Islande"&mdash;and of
course the copy of "Madame Bovary" upon the end papers and margins
of which "Almayer's Folly" was begun.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Of Conrad's deep-sea life the writer proposes to say next to
nothing. Intimately mixed up as he was with the writing of so many
of Conrad's sea stories he could not disentangle to his own
satisfaction which version of a semiautobiographic story, like
"Heart of Darkness", was the printed story, which the preparation
for the printed story, as Conrad told it to the writer, which the
version that Conrad told for the pleasure of chance hearers and
which was, as it were, the official autobiographic account.
Occasionally, as in his account of his meeting with Roger Casement
on the fringe of the bush outside Boma, Conrad would turn to the
writer and say, "You'll keep that, <i>mon vieux</i>, for my
biography..." speaking semi-jocularly.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>However, by a curious fatality, during the late war the writer
happened to come across a largish body of writing in the form of
letters written by Conrad from aboard ship to a compatriot. By
Conrad as politician, not as seaman! It was precisely a body of
writing, since each of the letters was a sort of essay on
international politics, and it was curious in that it was to all
intents and purposes completely uninteresting. It was in a sense
passionate in that it was filled with aspirations that Great
Britain should join in one combination or another against Russia.
She was to join Germany, Austria, France&mdash;any one, so long
only as she fought the Bear. But all these letters were written
with a fluency, such that, had they come before the writer
editorially, he would at once have thrown them into the waste-paper
basket. It was as if Lord Macaulay had been writing leaders for a
popular paper...Before that one of Conrad's relatives had showed
the writer a number of letters that Conrad had written to the
<i>Indépendance Belge</i>. These were quite another
matter&mdash;admirably written, intensely emotional. As if Pierre
Loti had had some heart! They had in fact, as is to be expected, a
great deal of the body and substance of "Heart of Darkness."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At both of these documents however, the writer did no more than
glance. The lady had treasured up as cuttings her nephew's
correspondence and, when Conrad was out of the room, presented the
bundle to Conrad's <i>ami le poète</i>. He read them for perhaps
half an hour before Conrad came in again; then their author
exhibited so much perturbation that the writer desisted. The
probability is that Conrad burned the bundle...It was very similar
with the other letters. They were lent to the writer by their
addressee at a time when the writer was extremely occupied; he
glanced at them for long enough to form the opinion expressed above
and then put them away. Before he had had time to look at them
again it occurred to him that Conrad might prefer him not to read
them. He accordingly wrote to Conrad and received the answer that
Conrad would extremely prefer that the letters should not be reread
and the author returned them to their owner. It is to be hoped that
they will not be disinterred.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It should not be inferred that Conrad had anything to hide. He
disliked the writer's reading his early works out of the shyness
that attends the maturity of every author. This writer would give a
good deal if the shelf in the British Museum that contains his
early writings could be burned, and Conrad would occasionally say
that the idea of the writer or any one else reading certain of the
stories of "The Outpost of Progress" or even certain paragraphs of
his later work caused him to have <i>chair de poule</i> all down
his spine. It is like a feeling of physical modesty.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>However, in moments more robust he would declare that the
articles in the form of letters were remarkable productions. He
would remind the writer of his aunt's expressed opinion that those
letters formed magnificent prose; and in moments of depression over
his then work he would declare that what he had written in French
before ever trying English was infinitely above anything he could
do in the inexact, half-baked language that English was. He put it
that the idea of really <i>writing</i> English&mdash;an English
that should have an abiding value&mdash;never appeared to him
practical whilst he was at sea. He would write essays and long
letters with the idea of improving his vocabulary for social
occasions. Then, one day, writing an imaginary letter to the
<i>Times</i> about some matter professional to the British
Mercantile Marine, he felt as if he had really "bitten into his
pen."...The earlier letters at which the writer glanced
sufficiently confirmed this. It was not that they were bad: they
were just glib.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At what moment of writing or reading on the bridge, in what
harbour Conrad thus found the religion of English prose the writer
does not remember. It was probably in Sydney during a period in a
convalescent home. It comes back that this is what Conrad said, but
that may very well be a mistake...Conrad, however, used to say that
in that convalescent home they were fed on tomatoes and milk, a
horrible combination; occasionally also he used to say that his
early work was like tomatoes and milk taken together. A horrible
combination! he would add...Or, of course, the revelation of his
powers may have come to him in Rouen.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Anyhow, somewhere on the dark waters Conrad found religion.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We had left Lowestoft and passed for master...We made the voyage
in the <i>Judea, Do or Die</i>&mdash;actually the
<i>Palestine</i>&mdash;that you find narrated in "Youth." In the
East we passed so and so many years. You find the trace of them in
"The End of the Tether", to go no further outside "The Youth"
volume. We commanded the Congo Free State navy&mdash;for the sake
of "Heart of Darkness." So we have the whole gamut of youth, of
fidelity and of human imbecility...And if the writer write
"we"&mdash;that is how it feels. For it was not possible to be
taken imperiously through Conrad's life, in those unchronological
and burning passages of phraseology, and not to feel&mdash;even to
believe&mdash;that one had had, oneself, that experience. And the
feeling was heightened by Conrad's affecting to believe that one
had, at least to the extent of knowing at all times where he had
been, what seen, and what performed.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The scenes of Conrad's life as afterwards rendered, say in
"Heart of Darkness", are really as vivid in the writer's mind from
what Conrad said as from what Conrad there wrote. It is a curious
affair. Actually under the writer's eyes are the bright, lit-up
keys of a typewriter. Yet perfectly definitely he sees <i>both</i>
the interior and the outside of a palm-leaf hut, daylight shining
through the interstices. A man lies on the floor of the hut,
reaching towards a pile of condensed milk tins. The man is half in
shadow&mdash;half Conrad, half the writer; too tall for Conrad;
stretched out a full eight feet, trunk and arms. Outside an immense
grey tide, the other shore hardly visible: a few darkish trees of
irregular outline. And a man&mdash;coming. In a planter's dress:
breeches, leggings, a flannel shirt, a sombrero...Some time before
he had lifted up the branches of the forest on the opposite shore
and looked across at our hut...He makes a fire and gives us some
soup...He comes once a fortnight...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We had been at the sources of the Congo: nearly to Fashoda, says
the ungeographical part of our minds that once pored over a map of
Africa to see everywhere <i>Terra Incognita</i>&mdash;in the
eighties&mdash;-and that has never again looked at a map of Africa.
We had belonged to the Humanitarian Party. The Humanitarian Party
did not approve of feeding our black troops on black prisoners; the
Conservatives did. So the Conservatives had poisoned us or
something the equivalent. And had put our quasi corpse in charge of
native bearers to take us, dead or alive, down to Boma on the
coast. It was all one to the natives whether at Boma they delivered
us quick or dead: they were paid the same.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Half down the Congo they had dumped us in a hut that was a cache
for condensed milk. They had gone away for a fortnight to their own
village...We extracted the condensed milk from the tins by suction,
having first pierced them with a pocket knife...The condensed milk
was the very antidote for the poison!...The bearers, black, their
white teeth protruding, come back, not displeased to find us alive.
Not pleased...Astonished!...They carried Conrad down to Boma, a
sweltering collection of tin huts. The Bomese took great pains to
keep you alive: you must die at sea, otherwise the death rate of
the Congo Free State rises by one...</p>

<p>At Boma then, listless from the abominable huts, we strolled out
one day along the coast, between the satin sea and the steaming
trees. A man, with the sunlight on his face, in white tennis shoes,
with two bulldogs at his heels, stepped out of the dark forest. He
said Hullo! He had strolled across Africa from the Zanzibar side in
his tennis shoes, with no bearers, no escort but his bulldogs, no
arms. He had such a fascination for the black fellows. That was
Roger Casement...There was a great deal of light, the sky blue, the
sea dove-coloured and oily, the forest blackgreen, a wall; the
beach pink; the bulldogs crashed over it to sniff at our
heels...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was in pictures like that that the writer had Conrad's life,
up to about the time when we engaged on "The Inheritors." Half of
it came in a shyish way, for biography, half in pictures, the
result of stray anecdotes. Thus if one or other of us happened to
be nervous from overwork and we talked of nerves Conrad would say,
"By Jove, after I came out of the Ospedale Italiano and went into
the City to draw some pay, I was so frightened at the racket on the
Underground that I had to lie down on the floor of the compartment.
Nerves all to pieces..." So the writer has his picture of Conrad
lying between the seats on the things like duckboards that used to
floor the old Underground carriages; it was only by conjunctions
before and after that he pieced together that Conrad went into the
Italian Hospital for Seamen in London after coming back from Boma
and that from there he went to Switzerland, to the hydrotherapy
near Geneva in which Maupassant died.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>All to pieces as he then was he had to think of how he was going
to employ the rest of his life. For following the sea he imagined
that he would be no longer fit. When he was a little better he saw
on the bookstall of Geneva Station those yellow volumes. The sight
of them and the thought of Maupassant made him say, "By Jove! Why
not write?" When he had settled that he might write he had to
settle in which language his writing should be. There were French
and English. In English there were no stylists&mdash;or very rare
ones. French bristled with them. When he made the decision to write
in English the writer does not know. He used to say that it was in
Rouen harbour, opposite the hotel in which Emma Bovary had been
accustomed to meet Rodolphe.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Here, looking out of his porthole across the frozen ground at
the inn door, he began translating phrases from the scene between
Rodolphe and Emma at the cattle show. He said that he began with
Rodolphe's formal phrases of romantic love that were whispered
between the announcements of prizes for bullocks and so, working
outwards, reached the blanker pages of cover, title and half-title
pages. On these he began "Almayer's Folly." He was reading at the
time Daudet's "Jack" which immensely fascinated him though he found
it <i>trop chargé</i>&mdash;as who should say, too harrowing.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>What stands in the two paragraphs above Conrad told the writer
over and over and over again.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In the sad years for Europe, Conrad wrote a passage
contradicting the statement made by some one somewhere in print
that he had had to choose between writing in French or English. He
stated that from the first English had jumped at him and held him.
This was a politeness to England at a time when extravagantly
patriotic pronouncements were called for from persons of foreign
origin: Henry James imagined the <i>beau geste</i> of naturalising
himself as a British subject practically on his deathbed, Conrad
this other. From the national point of view it was desirable, from
the point of view of literary precision, to be regretted. For it is
obvious that any one who contemplates writing and is practically
bi-lingual must from time to time hesitate as to in which language
he will write. The writer has to make the choice every morning. He
had to make the choice on the morning after the day on which he
learned of Conrad's death. That was a choice a little more definite
than that Conrad made&mdash;but not much more. His relations and
connections in Belgium certainly pressed him to write in French
before he even thought of writing in English. Of that the writer
was assured by Conrad's aunt, who regretted to the last that Conrad
chose to write in a language that rendered him inaccessible to what
she considered to be the civilised world. She herself wrote several
novels, notably for the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The point is of no great importance. Obviously if, as Conrad
frequently asserted, the first English words that he ever heard
were the verses containing the pious aspiration, "We've fought the
Bear before, and so we will again, the Russians shall not have
Constantinople!" Those words might well jump at a young Pole, sick
to take part in politics. What is material is that Conrad always
knew French much better than he knew English. This only enhances
the glory of his achievements in our language. In French he was
perfectly fluent, in English never; abroad he was constantly taken
for a Frenchman; no one could ever have imagined him English from
his speech or bearing. Those points again are of no importance:
what is miraculous is that he took English, as it were by the
throat and, wrestling till the dawn, made it obedient to him as it
has been obedient to few other men. The fact is extraordinary, but
not incomprehensible. The writer writes French better than he does
English, not because he knows French better, but precisely because
he knows French worse; in English he can go gaily on exulting in
his absolute command of the tongue. He can write like the late Mr.
Ruskin or like the late Charles Garvice, at will. In writing, but
not in speaking French, he must pause for a word; it is in pausing
for a word that lies the salvation of all writers. The proof of
prose is in the percentage of right words. Not the precious word;
not even the startlingly real word.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We once discussed for a long time whether Conrad should write of
a certain character's <i>oaken</i> resolution. As a picturesque
adjective "oaken" has its attractions. You imagine a foursquare,
lumpish fellow, inarticulate and apt to be mulish, but of good
conscience. The writer must obviously have suggested the adjective.
We turned it down after a good deal of discussion, the writer being
against, Conrad for, its use. Conrad liked its picturesqueness and
was always apt to be polite to the writer's suggestions. He could
afford to be. We decided for "stolidity" which is more quiet in the
phrase. Eventually the whole sentence went...The story was Conrad's
"Gaspar Ruiz." That is a fairly exact specimen of the way we worked
during many years...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad then, in Rouen harbour, decided that he would write books
in English. From that point the following episodes come back to the
writer from Conrad's recounted autobiography. He lay for long in
that port, because the ship upon which he found himself as master
had been seized by the sheriff's officers, for debt. Not of course
for Conrad's debt. The ship was one of a projected French
Rouen-to-New York line that never got beyond that one ship, and
that one ship lay there for a long time, the financier having
failed to raise capital enough...There comes in here another rather
curious coincidence between the career of Conrad and the writer; it
cannot unfortunately be narrated for the moment, one of the parties
concerned being out of reach and probably still alive...Presumably,
however, if two people knock about the world in similar districts
for a number of years before acquaintanceship, they will come very
near touching hands several times all unconsciously...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Gradually, then, Conrad seemed to lose touch with the open sea.
There opened up more and more glimpses of shore careers, so that of
those relatively later days the record would seem to be one of
abortive voyages...Thus the writer remembers with peculiar
vividness a telegram coming to Captain Conrad, telling him to
assume command of a ship taking in cargo in Antwerp harbour, and a
journey out in midwinter...But it is only a vignette of a wintry
port with icy arc lamps amongst bare trees over black water: the
stowing was being done all wrong, the ship being a bad one to shift
her cargo. That was apparently why Conrad had been called in.
Whether she ever went to sea remains as a blank in the writer's
mind.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>By all accounts Conrad was a very efficient master&mdash;but
extravagantly nervous about details. All the several officers who
once sailed with him have narrated the same thing to the writer.
Conrad would indulge in extremely dangerous manoeuvres, going about
within knife-blades of deadly shores whilst his officers and crew
shivered; but over very small details of the stowing of spars and
the like he would go out of his mind and swear the ship to pieces.
In the same way, in writing he would attack subjects almost
impossible and go mad over a sentence; or, in driving, he would
shave stone posts like a madman, and then curse the stable-boy for
letting him come out with the old instead of the new whip...You get
an account of a going-about in "The Secret Sharer." It is, however,
possible that the minuteness of detail on which, according to his
officers, Conrad so insisted on board was not so very minute.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>There is for instance the story of the Conway boy. This Conrad
was fond of relating as an instance of the complete want of any
sense of responsibility in the character of the English&mdash;or at
any rate of the English when young. Conrad had then with him on a
vessel in Table Bay a third mate, or perhaps an apprentice, who had
just come from the <i>Conway</i> training ship. Bad weather
appeared to be coming on and Conrad asked the boy if he had seen
the cables properly stowed. The boy answered that he had. The
expected gale came on, blowing in-shore. It was necessary to let go
another anchor. As the cable ran out one of its links jammed...The
writer does not profess to understand this technical detail...The
ship at any rate was in imminent danger owing to the
neglect&mdash;the sheer irresponsibility&mdash;of that Conway boy.
The Conway boy, at frightful risk, jumped on the cable and kicked
the link into place, saving the ship...Conrad used to comment that
it was unimaginable that any French boy would have neglected the
supervision of that cable; had he done, however, the impossible,
and so neglected, he would probably not have jumped on the cable.
He would have committed suicide, out of shame and knowing that his
career was ended...It might have been better to have jumped on the
cable first, and then committed suicide. The matter under
consideration was, however, responsibility...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>If then one of the officers who had sailed with Conrad and
afterwards talked with the writer happened&mdash;as the writer
strongly suspected&mdash;to have been that Conway boy it is not
unlikely that he would enlarge on Conrad's hypercritical attention
to detail. The people you have strafed&mdash;and Conrad said he
strafed that boy until he precious nearly wanted to commit
suicide&mdash;well, they take it out of you like that afterwards.
That is only human nature.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At any rate Conrad, by all accounts, was a very admirable
officer. Yet he hated the sea...Over and over again he related how
overwhelming, with his small stature, he found negotiations with
heavy spars, stubborn cordage and black weather. He used to say,
half raising his arms, "Look at me...How was I made for such
imbecilities? Besides, my nerves were for ever on the racket..."
And he would recount how, when he had been running up the Channel
on a moonlight night, suddenly, right under the foot of the
<i>Torrens</i>, there had appeared the ghostly sails of a small
vessel. It was, he used to say, something supernatural, something
of the sort that was always happening at sea. He said it wasn't so
much that his heart was in his mouth for the seconds it took that
vessel to clear; it remained in his mouth for months after. It was
there yet when he thought of it...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>On the outward voyage of the <i>Torrens</i> he had had as a
passenger Mr. Galsworthy, going to the Cape. They had confided in
each other shyly&mdash;each of them was writing!...From that sprang
up a friendship that was lifelong...The bustle that arose in the
Pent when Conrad, opening a letter, exclaimed, "Hurray...Jack's
coming down!" The mare would have to go down to Dan West's at Hythe
half a dozen times that day...Once Mr. Galsworthy, arriving at
Sandling Junction, found the trap too loaded. He ran beside it all
the two and a half uphill miles to the Pent, talking pleasantly as
he trotted. The writer has never seen anything so effortless, for
Nancy went quite well, long ears and all...That became one of the
legendary feats of the Pent along with the writer's long shot at
the rat...It was the better performance...It is a pity that there
is no feat of Mr. Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham's to set beside
it. That mighty horseman also, with a letter announcing a visit,
could wake up the studious Pent as a junction springs into life at
the coming of a great mail train...Conrad had very good
friends.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Other departures from the sea of which Conrad liked to talk and
which the writer could never chronologically disentangle were his
caretaking of a warehouse on the Thames beside one of the
bridges...London Bridge probably...and his floating with Mr.
Fountain Hope of a South African gold mine...Why Conrad should have
found the superintending of a warehouse that transshipped tinned
meat attractive the writer does not know. Or perhaps he does. At
any rate, Conrad talked of that time with enthusiasm as a period of
fun. He had been found the job whilst waiting for a ship by a
friend with a name like Krieger, with whom he afterwards lost
contact. Occasionally Conrad would ask, "What's become of
Krieger?"...They enjoyed themselves together in a jack-ashore way,
going to the Royal Aquarium in the evenings or sitting on barrels
in the tobacconist's shop just near Fenchurch Street
Station&mdash;a great place to hear of a ship. Once when we were
going to see Captain Hope&mdash;another good friend of
Conrad's&mdash;at Stanford le Hope, Conrad pointed out to the
writer marks that he alleged his feet had kicked in that
tobacconist's counter-front...No doubt other sea captains awaiting
ships had borne their part.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In Fenchurch Street and particularly in the Station, Conrad was
a different man&mdash;with his echoes! The gloomy light framed him
very appropriately; truculences came into his voice; he knew all
the bars and became at once the cityman gentleman-adventurer with
an eye for a skirt that hadn't disturbed the dust that twenty
years. He had to have from that tobacconist a handful of
cigars&mdash;he who never smoked anything but innumerable half
cigarettes from year's end to year's end, lighting up and almost
immediately throwing away to light up again. There is no station
like Fenchurch Street on the road to Tilbury. Conrad could tell you
where every husky earringed fellow with a blue, white-spotted
handkerchief under his arm was going to...It most impressed the
writer that in the station barber's shop was a placard that read:
<i>Teeth scaled two shillings, extractions sixpence</i>...To come
home from the great waters to that!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In that mood must have been Conrad's city adventure. It was
perhaps the third fortune that he lost. He, Mr. Hope and a
brother&mdash;Mr. Hope may well correct the details: this is the
saga told in Fenchurch Street. (Do you know the story of Grunbaum
who asks Klosterholm: Is it true the story that I hear that
Solomons made forty thousand dollars in St. Louis in the retail
clothing trade? Well, replies Klosterholm, the story is true, it's
the details are wrong. It wasn't in St. Louis but in Chicago. It
wasn't in the retail trade but in the wholesale. It wasn't forty
thousand dollars, but a hundred and forty thousand. It wasn't his
money, but mine. And he didn't make it; he lost it.) Conrad, then,
Mr. Hope and a brother had staked out in the South African gold
fields a claim to about a third of what is now the De Beers Mine.
They came to London to float a company at the time of the boom in
South Africans. Their solicitor, to begin with, with all the deeds,
was lost in the <i>Kinfauns Castle</i>. Before they could get
others the boom was on the decline; by the time they were ready for
flotation the bottom dropped out of the market. One of the
blackmailing bucket-shopkeepers, who seem indispensable as members
of the British and all other Parliaments, turned his attention to
Conrad and Company. He demanded money as the price of a good report
in his blackmailing sheet. The adventurers told him to go to hell.
The prospectus of their mine was printed by the same firm as
printed the blackmailing sheet. When the prospectus came out the
little red patch on the map that should have showed the Conrad-Hope
property was well away in the territory of another company. The
blackmailer in his sheet jubilantly pointed out that the mine must
be bogus...They went nevertheless to flotation...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad used to describe how, having issued their prospectus on
the day of flotation, they sailed the Thames, jubilant in a steam
launch with cigars, champagne, plovers' eggs in aspic...God knows
what. They were to step ashore millionaires...They stepped ashore
to find the flotation a disastrous failure. Only one hundred and
eighty&mdash;some fabulously small number&mdash;shares had been
subscribed by the public.</p>

<p>That was Conrad's last commercial venture. Whether he
telegraphed again to his uncle he never said...Let us imagine for a
moment's pause what would have become of British Literature if that
flotation had succeeded...For Conrad was certainly a magnificent
business man of the imaginative type. It might well have been Park
Lane instead of the Pent. For Conrad hated writing more than he
hated the sea...<i>Le vrai métier de chien!</i></p>

<p>We come thus to the life purely literary.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>After two and a half years we had abandoned "Romance": the
problem of how to get John Kemp out of Cuba had grown too
difficult. The writer's invention at any rate had failed and Conrad
was too involved with his own work to do any inventing. Looking
back, the period in which slowly we dragged out that preposterous
series of fatalities seems one of long bush-fighting: as if we were
clearing a piece of land in which the vegetation grew faster than
could be dealt with by such cutting instruments as we had.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It is not to be imagined that we spent the whole of our times
upon this enterprise; we each at intervals carried on work of our
own. Then we would drop it, have another month's try at "Romance."
Then drop that again...Or sometimes one of us would write his own
work in the morning; the other would write away at "Romance"; in
the evenings and till far into the night we would join up. We
pursued this monstrous undertaking all over the shores and
near-shores of the British Channel; at the Pent, near Hythe in
Kent; at Aldington; at Winchelsea in Sussex; in Bruges...The most
terrible struggles of all took place in a windy hotel at Knocke on
the Belgian coast, with a contralto from Bayreuth practising in the
basement. Her voice literally shook the flimsy house. Whilst we
wrote or groaned on the fourth floor the glasses on a tray jarred
together in sympathy with the contralto passages of "<i>Die
Goetterdaemmerung</i>"...And there was a child very ill, with only
Belgian doctors; abscesses in the jaw and no dentist; gout; frigid
rooms into which blew the sands from Holland; intolerable winds;
interminable gusts of rain...It is thus the world gets its
masterpieces. Conrad was then beginning "Nostromo" in the mornings:
it was going to be a slight book and very quickly finished&mdash;to
make a little money.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was, however, before that that we abandoned "Romance." We
took up "The Inheritors", a queer, thin book which the writer has
always regarded with an intense dislike. Or no, with hatred and
dread having nothing to do with literature. What they have to do
with he cannot say; some obscure nervous first cause, no doubt,
that could not interest any one but a psychopathic expert.</p>

<p>Conrad had none of these feelings apparently. The writer's
dislike for the book began as soon as the last word was written, so
that he managed to shift the burden of proof-correcting&mdash;which
Conrad rather liked&mdash;On to his collaborator's shoulders and
from that day to this has never looked at the book. When then,
during the early days of the late European struggle we met finally
to settle up various matters, and when Conrad said, "As to
collaborations, when it comes to our collected editions, you had
better take 'The Inheritors' because it is practically all yours,
and that will leave me 'Romance'&mdash;not that 'Romance' isn't
practically all yours too" (Conrad talked like that!), the writer
was very pleased. His intention was to suppress the book. He
imagined that Conrad disliked it as much as he did himself, and was
just turning it over with polite contempt. So it would never have
appeared in either of our collected editions and would remain
unobtainable until, with the expiration of copyright, some German
research-worker might dig it up and make a pamphlet out of it.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>However, a little later, Pinker, having been informed that the
writer was dead or in an asylum, made in America a contract for the
collected edition of Conrad, including all our collaborations past
and to come. Thus, before the writer knew anything about it, there
"The Inheritors" was, out again, not merely in one, but in three
editions. He happened then, rather with regret, to mention the
republication to Conrad as a thing that he supposed Conrad had not
been able to prevent. Authors are forced by agents and publishers
into the republication of all sorts of works they may wish to
suppress&mdash;in the interests of a sacred "completeness." Conrad,
however, remarked with a great deal of feeling&mdash;with more
feeling than the writer otherwise remembers in him&mdash;"Why not?
Why not republish it? It's a good book, isn't it? It's a
<i>damn</i> good book!" And the writer let the matter go at
that&mdash;rather than imply that Conrad would have set his name to
a book that he did not consider good, or even damn good. He had
intended to raise the matter later so as absolutely to assure
himself as to what really was Conrad's view of this work. But that
is too late now. It must remain as Conrad's opinion that the book
is a <i>damn</i> good one.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That being so we had better go on a little to consider the
exegesis of this work...We had abandoned "Romance"; the writer had
just finished a preposterous work purporting to be a history of the
<i>Cinque Ports</i> in elephant folio. In revenge it was written
completely in sentences of not more than ten syllables. The South
African War was there&mdash;or thereabouts, the writer being an
excited Pacifist whose hat was from time to time bashed in by still
more excited patriots. Conrad was engaged with the end of "Heart of
Darkness", with thinking out "Typhoon" and with writing "Amy
Foster", a short story originally by the writer which Conrad took
over and entirely rewrote. The writer, in common with Conrad, had a
great admiration for Mr. Balfour; the writer at least had a
profound detestation for the late Mr. Chamberlain who, off his own
bat, had caused the war. How Conrad felt towards the late Mr.
Chamberlain the writer does not remember. He was certainly more
Imperialistic than the writer...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Since it may seem odd to the reader that one author, living in
close intimacy with another author, should not know what were his
friend's views upon a point of politics so important as a war it
might be as well to say a word or two upon how we <i>did</i> live
together. Our relationships were, then, curiously impersonal: never
once did the writer ask Conrad a question as to his past, his
ethical or religious outlook or as to any intimate point of his
feelings or life. Never once did Conrad ask the writer any such
question. Never once did we discuss any political matter.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We met at first as two English gentlemen do in a club: upon that
footing we continued. We took it for granted that each <i>was</i> a
gentleman, with the feelings, views of the world and composure of a
member of the ruling classes of the days of Lord
Palmerston&mdash;tempered of course with such eccentricities as go
with the spleen of the <i>milor anglais</i>. Such eccentricities we
allowed each to the other, but without question. Thus during the
South African War, as has been said, the writer was an active and
sometimes uproarious Pacifist. Not a pro-Boer; he would have hanged
President Kruger on the same gallows as Mr. Chamberlain. Or, later,
with an equal enthusiasm he supported Miss Christabel Pankhurst and
the Suffragettes. Now and then on idle occasions after lunch he
would declaim about either of these causes. Conrad would
listen.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>From time to time, particularly whilst writing "Heart of
Darkness", Conrad would declaim passionately about the gloomy
imbecility and cruelty of the Belgians in the Congo Free State.
Still more would he so declaim, now and then, after he had been up
to London and had met Casement, who had been British Commissioner
on the Congo and was passionately the champion of the natives. Then
the writer would listen.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>If Conrad differed from the writer he never argued, nor did the
writer ever argue with Conrad. Once in his hotter
youth&mdash;though he would do the same in his sober age!&mdash;the
writer put his name down as willing to go with a crack-brained
expedition to German Poland in order to fight the Prussians, and
Conrad never so much as remonstrated, though he expressed gloomy
anticipations as to what would happen to that expedition. The
writer's ambition, however, was to fight the Prussians; to that
Conrad offered no objection...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Or, again, the writer never in his life uttered one word of
personal affection towards Conrad. What his affection was or was
not here appears. And Conrad never uttered one word of affection
towards the writer: what his affection was or was not will never
now be known. Conrad was infinitely the more lavish of praise of
his collaborator's books: so lavish that at times the writer would
feel like a fatuous Buddhist idol whilst Conrad went on. The writer
on the other hand supposes that Conrad gathered somehow how deeply
his work was admired by his companion. Perhaps he did, perhaps he
did not; that, too, will never now be known. The writer cannot
remember ever to have addressed any particularly moving praise to
Conrad as to his work&mdash;except in his last letter but
one...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It is that that makes life the queer, solitary thing that it is.
You may live with another for years and years in a condition of the
closest daily intimacy and never know what, at the bottom of the
heart, goes on in your companion. Not really.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So there we lived, the two English gentlemen, the one bobbing
stiffly to the other, like mandarins...Our politics were what they
were; our creeds were what they were. Out of the loyalty that is
demanded of gentlemen we were both papists&mdash;but not the
faintest glimmer of an idea is in the writer's mind as to what
might have been the religious condition of Joseph Conrad, except
that, when out driving, he would turn back rather than meet two
priests. That is a Polish superstition. Once in our lives the
writer addressed a remonstrance&mdash;a reproach&mdash;to Conrad.
That has been already related. Once Conrad did the same to the
writer.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That was very characteristic. Conrad had very strongly the idea
of the Career. A career was for him something a little sacred: any
career. It was part of his belief in the shipshape. (The reader
must not believe that, though we did not question each other, we
did not voluntarily and at times the one to the other express our
passionate beliefs.) A career was a thing to be carried through
tidily, without mistakes, as a ship is taken through a voyage and
stowed away safely in a port. So one day, when the writer had both
started a Review and permitted some one to make a very indifferent
play out of one of his novels that was then being boomed by an
enthusiastic Press, Conrad positively addressed a letter of serious
and formal remonstrance to the writer.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But Conrad had certainly intensely disliked the <i>English
Review</i>, if not for its contents of conduct, then for its effect
on the writer's career. With a great deal of perspicacity he
pointed out that it is ruin for any imaginative writer to edit any
sort of periodical. In the first place it is a waste of time; in
the second place it raises for you such hordes of enemies that
eventually they will bring you down&mdash;or very nearly. All the
writers you discover or benefit will become your bitterest enemies,
as soon as your connection with a public organ ceases&mdash;or
sooner! That is human nature. Even Benjamin Franklin observes that
his eminently successful career was made by very carefully putting
himself in a position to receive&mdash;as often as
not&mdash;unneeded benefits. He thus made for himself so many
patrons who gave him friendly shoves on the way, whenever the
opportunity occurred. And, by never conferring benefits, or by very
skilfully obscuring the origin of such benefits as he did confer,
he made for himself no enemies at all...In addition, Conrad
continued, every soul who has ever written a favourable note about
you will deluge you with his manuscripts. You will be unable to
print them; you will have so many thousands to call you base
ingrate in private and to stone your work before the
public&mdash;again, as soon as you have no organ of your own in
which to revenge yourself...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But even conducting a review was as nothing to the sin of
allowing an indifferent play, made from one of your novels, to be
produced. In that day, in England, all novelists were obsessed by
the idea that if they could only get a play produced, fame, fortune
and eternal tranquillity, beyond the range of all temporal griefs,
would be for ever theirs. A novel <i>may</i> earn its hundreds. A
play&mdash;even an unsuccessful play&mdash;will earn thousands; the
receipts for a successful play run into the tens and hundreds of
thousands. In addition, in England at that date there was a glamour
of its own attaching to the Play. Even the Lord Chamberlain's
censorship was nearly almost abolished. There was something sacred
about it.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer was practically the only British novelist who did not
catch that malady. It poisoned the whole of Henry James's after
life; even Conrad was not immune. The writer was&mdash;and he got
it in the neck, as the phrase is. There was never&mdash;there was
<i>never</i> such a debacle as was that novel dramatised. It
contained five acts, each of innumerable scenes; the curtain was
down for twice as long as it was up; it played from 8 till 12.15.
Not ten people remained till the end. The Press next day was livid
with rage at the writer for daring to write a play without having
studied the technique of the drama. The writer's connection with
the <i>English Review</i> had just come to an end. He had had
nothing to do with that play. It had been extracted from his novel
by a dramatist. The writer had never even seen a rehearsal.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer did not mind; Conrad did. He minded horribly. Coming
down from Town the day after he had received that letter, the
writer just mentioned its reception, and left it at that. Conrad
did not. He repeated the contents of the letter all over again: the
writer was ruining his career. The writer said that he did not
care. At that Conrad suffered really as much as he had suffered
during the reading of the first draft of "Romance." It was in the
same department of suffering. He sat, rather curled up in the
corner of a sofa, sick-looking and wincing, flushed, and his
eyebrows contracted downwards.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>A frame of mind, a conception of life, according to which a man
did not take stock of the results of his actions upon himself, as
it were at long range, was something that he had never
contemplated. As he saw life, you wrote a book, lived
circumspectly, avoided making enemies, meddled only with what
immediately concerned you; or you passed for second mate, lived
circumspectly, avoided making enemies, concerned yourself only with
your ship and ship's company...Then you could foresee that in ten
years' time, in fifteen, in twenty, you would be promoted to the
command of the <i>Torrens</i>, the finest sailing ship afloat; to
be commodore of a great line; to be an elder brother of the Trinity
House...Or the Times would salute you as a great light in the
literary firmament; you would become the doyen of British letters
and an honorary member of the French Academy; you would have a
memorial service in Westminster Abbey. Or even be buried there: an
aspiration the fulfilment of which was forbidden to Nelson...He
desired the shipshape life.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That any <i>one&mdash;any</i> soul&mdash;could be indifferent to
these honours was new to him, and terribly painful. He had taken it
as so for granted that all proper men deserved this tranquil and as
if British peacefulness!...In the same way in His Majesty's Army it
<i>has</i> to be taken for granted that <i>every</i> officer
desires promotion to the rank, eventually, of honorary Colonel
commanding his regiment. Life could not otherwise go on. That any
officer should be indifferent to promotion then becomes painful: as
if you should not care about the dressing of the men of your unit
upon inspection by the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief...It is,
in effect, the same crime as not squeezing the last drop of blood
out of your subject when you are writing a book: the real crime
against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For <i>that</i> crime presumably is neither more nor less than
to be out of harmony with the universe, and for Conrad the universe
was the shipshape. Any soul wandering outside that corral in the
abyss was for him a matter purely of gloomy indifference..."The
fellow simply does not exist!" That was the formula...That any one
with whom he was on terms of intimacy should, all unsuspected, hold
such a philosophy was to him unspeakably painful&mdash;as if it
were a treachery to the British flag. It was as unspeakably painful
to him when later Casement, loathing the Belgians so much for their
treatment of the natives on the Congo, took up arms against his own
country and was, to our eternal discredit, hanged, rather than shot
in the attempt to escape...We might have achieved <i>that</i>
effort of our wooden imaginations...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It will be as well to attempt here some sort of chronology. This
is a novel exactly on the lines of the formula that Conrad and the
writer evolved. For it became very early evident to us that what
was the matter with the Novel, and the British novel in particular,
was that it went straight forward, whereas in your gradual making
acquaintanceship with your fellows you never do go straight
forward. You meet an English gentleman at your golf club. He is
beefy, full of health, the moral of the boy from an English Public
School of the finest type. You discover, gradually, that he is
hopelessly neurasthenic, dishonest in matters of small change, but
unexpectedly selfsacrificing, a dreadful liar, but a most painfully
careful student of lepidoptera and, finally, from the public
prints, a bigamist who was once, under another name, hammered on
the Stock Exchange...Still, there he is, the beefy, full-fed
fellow, moral of an English Public School product. To get such a
man in fiction you could not begin at his beginning and work his
life chronologically to the end. You must first get him in with a
strong impression, and then work backwards and forwards over his
past...That theory at least we gradually evolved.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At the beginning, then, of this chapter we had arrived at the
year 1900 or so. We went to Knocke in Belgium and took up "Romance"
once more, probably a year or so later; but Conrad's letter as to
an endangered career was not written until about 1908. It comes in
here as a light upon what did, upon what can have induced Conrad to
desire to take a hand in the production of the book called "The
Inheritors."...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this chapter the writer has read a
sufficiency of that work to satisfy him as to what it was all
about. The process was distasteful, but the subordinating of one's
nerves to duty is the first step towards a career or even towards
the writing of a novel. And what made Conrad passionately desirous
of laying hands on the writer's then subject was a sentence. One
sentence coming after an effective couple or so of sentences with
which the manuscript had opened.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The scene of that barratry is perfectly vivid to the writer at
this moment. He had driven over to the Pent rather shyly with the
manuscript of the opening chapters of the novel in his pocket.
Conrad was as yet unaware that a novel was in progress. He was
sitting in the parlour of the Pent with the monthly roses peeping
just above the window sill. After he had seen to the unharnessing
of the disgraceful Exmoor pony&mdash;who had only one
accomplishment, that of undoing the bolt of his oat chest with his
teeth, which was a damnable inconvenience, for the animal would
fill itself full to the lips with oats and then have to be walked
for seven or eight hours to save its life, and usually in the dead
of the night&mdash;after, then, the writer had seen to the
unharnessing of that plague, with the aid of a disreputable, aged
ex-time-serving soldier called Hunt, who had had sunstroke, ague
and malaria in Quetta with the Buffs, who claimed to be heir, in
Chancery, of half the County of Kent, who had always sore feet,
hobbled, and whose proximity resembled that of a rum-keg, and who
acted as our outdoor factotum and gardener, the writer went into
the parlour. Conrad was sitting reflecting and, beyond his saying,
"My dear faller..." we did not speak. We were so constantly about
each other's houses that quite often we could meet after driving
over without any particular greeting, as if one of us had just come
down from washing his hands in the bedroom...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad, then, was sitting gloomily reflecting&mdash;upon his
career, upon the almost impossibility of wrestling any longer with
the English that shall describe lagoons, shallows, brigs reflected
in breathless water, upon the possibility that he would have to get
over neck into debt before he should have finished "The
Rescue"&mdash;a slight book almost no longer than a novelette,
which was already mortgaged to Heinemann, that decent fellow who
never worried his authors to complete their manuscripts. And there
was the beginnings of another attack of gout in the right wrist;
and Nancy needed shoeing...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer then came in, and before sitting down drew the
manuscript of the first chapter of "The Inheritors" from his
pocket. Conrad said, "Another story...<i>Donne! Donne!</i>" Conrad
had no particular admiration for the writer's short stories. He had
simply taken "Amy Foster" from the writer, with no particular
apology, and had just rewritten it&mdash;introducing Amy herself,
who had not existed in the writer's draft. This, however, was a
novel, not a short story, and instead of giving the manuscript to
Conrad, who would merely have glanced at it perfunctorily and,
dropping it, would have returned to the contemplation of his debts
and gout, the writer sat down and began to read aloud.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At the end of the first paragraph Conrad said, "<i>Mais mon
cher, c'est tres chic!</i> What is it?" At the end of a sentence on
the sixth page he was exclaiming, "But what is this? What the devil
is this? It is <i>très, très, très chic!</i> It is <i>épatant</i>.
That's magnificent." And already the writer knew that either he was
in for another collaboration or that he would hand over the
manuscript altogether.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The sentence was:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I recovered my equanimity with the thought
that I had been visited by some stroke of an obscure and
unimportant physical kind.</p>

<p>The opening paragraphs had run:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Ideas," she said. "Oh, as for
ideas&mdash;"<br>
<br>
"Well," I hazarded, "as for ideas&mdash;"<br>
<br>
We went through the old gateway and I cast a glance over my
shoulder. The noon sun was shining over the masonry, over the
little saints' effigies, over the little fretted canopies, the
grime and the white streaks of bird-dropping...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>And as soon as the writer had let Conrad know that this was a
novel, not a short story, he knew that he was in for another
collaboration. Every word spoken added to that conviction...The
novel was to be a political work, rather allegorically backing Mr.
Balfour in the then Government; the villain was to be Joseph
Chamberlain who had made the war. The sub-villain was to be Leopold
II, King of the Belgians, the foul&mdash;and incidentally
lecherous&mdash;beast who had created the Congo Free State in order
to grease the wheels of his harems with the blood of murdered
negroes and to decorate them with fretted ivory cut from stolen
tusks in the deep forests...For the writer, until that moment, it
had appeared to be an allegorico-realist romance; it showed the
superseding of previous generations and codes by the merciless
young who are always alien and without remorse...But the moment
Conrad spoke, he spoke with the voice of the Conrad who was avid of
political subjects to treat and the writer knew that this indeed
was the Conrad subject...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>II.</h2>

<p>"The Inheritors" is a work of seventy-five thousand words, as
nearly as possible. In the whole of it there cannot be more than a
thousand&mdash;certainly there cannot be two&mdash;of Conrad's
writing; these crepitate from the emasculated prose like
firecrackers amongst ladies' skirts.</p>

<p class="newspaper">I had looked at her before; now I cast a
sideways, critical glance at her. I came out of my moodiness to
wonder what type this was. <i>She had good hair, good eyes, and
some charm</i>. Yes. And something besides&mdash;a
something&mdash;a something <i>that was not an attribute of her
beauty</i>. The modelling of her face was so perfect as to produce
an effect of transparency, <i>yet there was no suggestion of
frailness; her glance had an extraordinary strength of life. Her
hair was fair and gleaming, her cheeks coloured</i> as if a warm
light had fallen on them from somewhere. She was familiar till it
occurred to you that she was strange.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Do you not hear Conrad saying, "<i>Damn</i> Ford's women," and
putting in, "She had good hair, good eyes and some charm." And do
you not see the writer, at twenty-six, hitching and fitching with
"a something&mdash;a something&mdash;a something&mdash;" to get an
effect of delicacy, and Conrad saying, "Oh, hang it all, do let's
get some definite particulars about the young woman?"</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That was how, normally, we collaborated. But in this volume that
is the only discoverable passage with which Conrad notably
interfered. Occasionally he wrote in a whole speech that made a
situation. The difference between our methods in those days was
this: We both desired to get into situations, at any rate when any
one was speaking, the sort of indefiniteness that is characteristic
of all human conversations, and particularly of all English
conversations that are almost always conducted entirely by means of
allusions and unfinished sentences. If you listen to two Englishmen
communicating by means of words, for you can hardly call it
conversing, you will find that their speeches are little more than
this: A. says, "What sort of a fellow is...<i>you</i> know!" B.
replies, "Oh, he's a sort of a..." and A. exclaims, "Ah, I always
thought so..." This is caused partly by sheer lack of vocabulary,
partly by dislike for uttering any definite statement at all. For
anything that you say you may be called to account. The writer
really had a connection who said to one of her nieces, "My dear,
never keep a diary. It may one day be used against you," and that
thought has a profound influence on English life and speech.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer used to try to get that effect by almost directly
rendering speeches that, practically, never ended, so that the
original draft of "The Inheritors" consisted of a series of vague
scenes in which nothing definite was ever said. These scenes melted
one into the other until the whole book, in the end, came to be
nothing but a series of the very vaguest hints. The writer hoped by
this means to get an effect of a sort of silverpoint: a delicacy.
No doubt he succeeded. But the strain of reading him must have been
intolerable.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad's function in "The Inheritors" as it to-day stands was to
give to each scene a final tap; these, in a great many cases,
brought the whole meaning of the scene to the reader's mind.
Looking through the book the writer comes upon instance after
instance of these completions of scenes by a speech of Conrad's.
Here you have the&mdash;quite unbearably vague&mdash;hero talking
to the royal financier about the supernatural-adventuress heroine.
Originally the speeches ran:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"You don't understand...She...She will..."<br>
<br>
He said: "Ah! Ah!" in an intolerable tone of royal badinage.<br>
<br>
I said again: "You don't understand...Even for your own
sake..."<br>
<br>
He swayed a little on his feet and said: "Bravo...Bravissimo...You
propose to frighten..."<br>
<br>
I looked at his great bulk of a body...People began to pass,
muffled up, on their way out of the place.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The scene died away in that tone. In the book as it stands it
runs, with Conrad's addition italicised:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"<i>If you do not</i>" (cease persecuting her
had been implied several speeches before), <i>I said, "I shall
forbid you to see her.</i> And I shall...<br>
<br>
"<i>Oh, oh!" he interjected</i> with the intonation of a reveller
at a farce. "We are at that&mdash;we are the excellent
brother&mdash;" <i>He paused and then added: "Well, go to the
devil, you and your forbidding ." He spoke with the greatest good
humour.</i><br>
<br>
"I am in earnest," I said, "very much in earnest. <i>The thing has
gone too far.</i> And even for your own sake you had better..."<br>
<br>
He said: "Ah, ah!" in the tone of his "Oh, oh!"<br>
<br>
"<i>She is no friend to you</i>" I struggled on, "<i>she is playing
with you for her own purposes; you will</i>..."<br>
<br>
He swayed a little on his feet and said: "<i>Bravo...bravissimo. If
we cant forbid him we will frighten him. Go on, my good
fellow</i>..." and then, "<i>Come, go on</i>."<br>
<br>
I looked at his great bulk of a body...<br>
<br>
"<i>You absolutely refuse to pay any attention?</i>" I said.<br>
<br>
"<i>Oh, absolutely</i>," he answered.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At that point Conrad cut out a page or two of writing which was
transferred to later in the book and came straight on to:</p>

<p>"Baron Halderschrodt has <i>committed suicide</i>," which the
writer for greater delicacy had rendered, "Baron Halderschrodt
has..." Conrad, however, added still further to the effect by
adding:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Half sentences came to our ears from groups
that passed us: <i>A very old man with a nose that almost touched
his thick lips was saying:</i><br>
<br>
"<i>Shot himself...Through the left temple...Mon Dieu!</i>"</p>

<p>If the reader asks how the writer identifies which was his
writing and which Conrad's in a book nearly twenty-five years old,
the answer is very simple. Partly the writer remembers. This was
the only scene in the book at which we really hammered away for any
time and the way we did it is fresh still in his mind. Partly it is
knowledge; Conrad would never have written "a very old man" or
"almost." He would have supplied an image for the old man's nose
and would have given him an exact age, just as he had to precise
the fact that Halderschrodt had shot himself, and through the left
temple at that.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The only other passage in the book that the writer can quite
definitely identify as Conrad's is what follows. For the sake of
the adventuressheroine and an income the lugubrious hero&mdash;and
this is the point&mdash;has betrayed to Mr. Chamberlain and the
powers of evil, Mr. Balfour, Lord Northcliffe, Leopold of Belgium,
sound finance, the small investor and the past. He is alone at four
in the morning with the drunken journalist, the actual writer of
the leader that produces these sweeping results. The whole passage,
which is solid Conrad, is a matter of two pages. Here is the most
characteristic portion.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"You can't frighten me," I said..."No one can
frighten me now." A sense of my inaccessibility was the first taste
of an achieved triumph. I had done with fear. The poor devil before
me appeared infinitely remote. He was lost; but he was only one of
the lost: one of those that I could see already overwhelmed by the
rush from the floodgates opened at my touch. He would be destroyed
in good company; swept out of my sight together with the past they
had known and with the future they had waited for. But he was
odious. "I am done with you," I said.<br>
<br>
"Eh, what?...Who wants to frighten?...I wanted to know what's your
pet vice...Won't tell? You might safely&mdash;I'm off...Want me to
tell mine?...No time...I'm off...Ask the policeman...crossing
sweeper will do...I'm going."<br>
<br>
"You will have to," I said.<br>
<br>
"What...Dismiss me?...Throw the indispensable Soane overboard like
a squeezed lemon?...What would Fox say? ...Eh? But you can't, my
boy. Not you. Tell you...can't...Beforehand with you...sick of
it...I'm off...to the Islands...the Islands of the Blest...Come
too...dismiss yourself out of all this. Warm sand, warm, mind you.
You won't?" He had an injured expression. "Well, I'm off. See me
into the cab, old chap, you 're a decent fellow after all...not one
of these beggars who would sell their best friend...for a little
money ...or some woman. Well, see me off."<br>
<br>
...I went downstairs and watched him march up the street with a
slight stagger under the pallid dawn...The echo of my footsteps on
the flagstones accompanied me, filling the empty earth with the
sound of my footsteps.</p>

<p><br>
That occurs nearly at the end of the book. There is one other
passage of complete Conrad two pages further on:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I turned towards the river and on the broad
embankment the sunshine enveloped me, friendly, familiar, warm like
the care of an old friend. A black dumb-barge drifted, clumsy and
empty, and the solitary man in it wrestled with the heavy sweep,
straining his arms, throwing his face up to the sky at every
effort...<br>
<br>
The barge with the man still straining at the oar has gone out of
sight under the arch of the bridge, as through a gate into another
world. A bizarre sense of solitude stole upon me and I turned my
back upon the river as empty as my day. Hansoms, broughams,
streamed with a continuous muffled roll of wheels and a beat of
hoofs. A big dray put in a note of thunder and a clank of
chains...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Those two passages are practically all the Conrad writing that
there is in the book. We must have had a severe struggle over those
six or seven pages. That the writer realises because he remembers
still the sense of relief that attended his writing the
tremendously sentimental last scene, his wallowing in his own
juvenile prose and his own dreadful sentences. As thus:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I had had my eyes on the ground all this
while; now I looked at her, trying to realise that I should never
see her again. It was impossible. There was that intense beauty,
that shadowlessness that was like translucence. And there was her
voice. It was impossible to understand that I was never to see her
again, never to hear her voice after this.<br>
<br>
She was silent for a long time and I said nothing&mdash;nothing at
all...At last she said: "There is no hope. We have to go our ways;
you yours, I mine. And then if you will&mdash;if you cannot
forget&mdash;you may remember that I cared; that, for a moment, in
between two breaths, I thought of ...of failing. That is all I can
do...for your sake." ...I had not looked at her; but stood with my
eyes averted, very conscious of her standing before me; of her
great beauty, her great glory.</p>

<p>The punctuation of this passage is that of the uniform edition
of the "Collected Works of Joseph Conrad ", the cover of which
gives the book to Joseph Conrad alone. The punctuation and the
misprints, which are very many, are American and not the writer's.
The rest is.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Having achieved this ending the writer carried it over to the
Pent. Conrad glanced at two or three pages of the manuscript,
exclaimed, "Marvellous! My dear boy...My dear Ford. <i>Mon
vieux</i>, I don't know how you do it!" and put the manuscript down
on the table. The whole went that afternoon to the printers.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It has sometimes occurred to the writer to wonder whether Conrad
ever read&mdash;ever could have read&mdash;that passage. If he
never did the omission would have been all right. There was for
excuse the extreme fatigue of our struggle of wills that went on
whenever we really got down to a difficult passage; there was also
the fact that the writer was supposed to handle all the women in
the books we wrote together...Conrad, however, assured the writer
that he had very carefully corrected the proofs of the English
Collected Edition of the book, at a time when the writer was
elsewhere employed. This was when he also asserted that "The
Inheritors" was a <i>damn</i> good book. And if we add that he did
let his name as sole author remain on the cover of the book we must
imagine that he regarded it with <i>some</i> satisfaction. That his
name so appeared was of course no doing of Conrad's but was due to
the business talents of the late Mr. Pinker and the publishers. (An
author as a rule is not shown the cover of his book before
publication. And this is naturally more especially the case when it
is a matter of all the volumes of a collected edition.) But Conrad
offered to have all the copies of "The Inheritors" and "Romance"
called in and the covers altered. The writer, however, said that it
did not matter; as far as he was concerned Conrad might have signed
all his books. He might still. So the edition was left alone. But
at least Conrad did not mind the attribution.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Nevertheless the writer prefers to believe that Conrad never
read the last chapter of "The Inheritors." The factor of fatigue
would be quite enough to excuse it. The writer is ready to confess
that there are a few passages of "Romance" that he himself has only
read in French...And it was permitted to Conrad not to read the
passages concerning what he called "Ford's women." It had been only
with something like nausea that he had brought himself to approach
this lady for long enough to introduce the "she had good hair, good
eyes and some charm" of the opening quotation of this chapter. It
was only with difficulty that he was restrained from adding good
teeth to the catalogue. He said with perfect seriousness, "Why not
good teeth? Good teeth in a woman are part of her charm. Think of
when she laughs. You would not have her <i>not</i> have good teeth.
They are a sign of health. Your damn woman has to be healthy,
doesn't she?" The writer, however, stopped that...To-day he would
not.</p>

<p>Still the writer would rather believe that Conrad lied about the
reading, about the proofcorrecting, about anything; he would rather
Conrad had robbed an alms box than that he should have read that
dreadful prose and have called it damn good. The rest of the book
is badly written but not so dreadfully. Still it is bad enough: a
medley of prose conceived in the spirit of Christina Rossetti with
imitations of the late Henry James; inspired by the sentimentality
of a pre-Raphaelite actor in love scenes&mdash;precisely by Sir
Johnston Forbes Robertson dyspeptically playing Romeo to Mrs.
Patrick Campbell's Juliet; cadenced like Flaubert and full of
little half-lines dragged in from the writer's own verses of that
day. He was only twenty-six at the time and was very late in
maturing...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It runs like this: country atmosphere, romantic place-names and
all:</p>

<p class="newspaper">We were sauntering along the forgotten valley
that lies between Hardres and Stelling Minnis; we had been silent
for several minutes. For me at least the silence was pregnant
with...undefinable emotions...There was something of the past world
about the hanging woods, the little veils of unmoving mist&mdash;as
if Time did not exist in those furrows of the great world; and one
was so absolutely alone; (Conrad suddenly put in here: <i>anything
might have happened</i>. But the writer went on bravely.) I was
silent. The birds were singing the sun down. It was very dark among
the branches and from minute to minute the colours of the world
deepened and grew sombre...I was silent. A June nightingale began
to sing, a trifle hoarsely...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>You perceive: the writer got his nightingale in after all: a
marvel of oaken persistency. It may have been out of sheer agony
that Conrad burst in here:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I stretched out my hand and it touched hers. I
seized it without an instant of hesitation. "How could I resist
you?" I said, and heard my own whisper with a sort of amazement at
its emotion...</p>

<p>Do not be alarmed. Anything <i>might</i> have happened. But the
writer was there to save the young woman. Positively he
remarks:</p>

<p class="newspaper">I did not know what it might lead to: I
remembered that I did not know even who she was...I let her hand
fall. "We must be getting on," I said a trifle hoarsely...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>What then attracted Conrad to this farrago of nonsense? Partly
no doubt it was the idea of getting a book finished quickly; here
was another unexplored creek with possible gold in its shallows or
its huts. But it was only very partially that. There was some
mysterious attraction; Conrad's manner was too animated, his
enthusiasm too great at the first reading. It may have been partly
because the manuscript <i>was</i> read. The rhetorical will pass
when it comes in a human voice. The writer has very frequently
found good manuscripts that young men read to him, only to be
appalled by their ornamentation&mdash;or their baldness,
even!&mdash;when he afterwards read them for himself...Yet it
cannot have been wholly that; Conrad had opportunities enough of
going through the manuscript before the book was finished. Or it
may have been affection; Conrad may really have had an affection
for the writer. Yet it can hardly have been that...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer has sometimes imagined that, however much we might
have scoffed at jewels five words long that, on the stretched
forefinger of old time, sparkle for ever...however much we might
have scoffed, it was half-sentences of the writer's that,
inscrutably, jumped out of the prose and caught Conrad by the
throat. At the head of this chapter stands the mysterious phrase,
"Excellency, a few goats..." The writer imagined this. He wrote it
in a quite commonplace frame of mind, much as you might write an
order for a hoe when sending a list of agricultural instruments
that you required to your ironmonger. He wanted to provide an
obscure Lugareno with a plausible occupation. But no sooner had he
got the words on the paper than Conrad burst into one of his roars
of ecstasy. "This," he shouted when he was in a condition to speak,
"is genius!" And out of breath, exhausted and rolling on the sofa,
he continued to gasp, "Genius!...This is genius...That's what it
is. Pure genius...Genius, I tell you!" The writer agreed that it
<i>was</i> genius&mdash;for the sake of peace! And for twenty years
afterwards, in every second or third letter to the writer Conrad
returned to the charge. "Excellency, a few goats..." he would
write. "Do you remember?" Even this year in a letter to the
<i>Transatlantic Review</i>, allotting parts of "Romance" to its
various authors, he wrote, "Fifth Part, practically all yours,
including the famous sentence at which we both exclaimed: This is
genius! (Do you remember what it is?) with perhaps half a dozen
lines by me..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In a subsequent number of the periodical in question the writer
offered its readers as a prize a copy of "Romance" if any one of
them could identify that passage of genius. A great many replies
were received from readers offering passages of what, on the
surface, looks more like genius...But no one offered, "Excellency,
a few goats..." It is perhaps genius. But, frequently on receiving
a "Don't you remember the few goats?" letter from Conrad the writer
has felt as if he were getting credit for another immensely long
shot at a rat...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In "The Inheritors", then, there were several sentences which
Conrad applauded almost as rapturously. There was the one already
quoted about the stroke of an obscure and unimportant physical
kind...In that Conrad would like the words "obscure and
unimportant." Another&mdash;it came after the passage concerning
the suicide already quoted&mdash;is altogether the writer's and was
in the first draft:</p>

<p class="newspaper">De Mersch walked slowly along the long
corridor away from us. There was an extraordinary stiffness in his
gait, as if he were trying to emulate the goose step of his old
days in the Prussian Guard. My companion looked after him as though
she wished to gauge the extent of his despair.<br>
<br>
"You would say '<i>Habet</i>', wouldn't you?" she asked me.</p>

<p>This last sentence Conrad also called genius. Perhaps it may
be.</p>

<p>"The Inheritors" appeared. It caused no excitement; even to
ourselves it caused so little that the writer cannot so much as
remember opening the parcel that contained the first copies. By
that time Conrad had got over believing in its salable qualities;
the writer had never had any delusions. He had been too well
drilled by Mr. Edward Garnett.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was received by the English critics with a paean of abuse for
the number of dots it contained...One ingenious gentleman even
suggested that we had cheated Mr. Heinemann and the public who had
paid for a full six-shilling novel with words all solid on the
page. In America it attracted even less attention, but the
publishers, having issued the book with, as far as the writer can
remember, a fault on the title page, or possibly on the cover, it
was withdrawn after only four copies had been sold, and then
reissued. These four copies are said to command an exorbitant price
from collectors. The writer never remembers to have seen one.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>III.</h2>

<p>We returned then to "Romance."...</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the writer paid Conrad large sums for
the honour of collaborating with him, this being Conrad's
inducement for continuing those very arduous labours. This was not
the case. Even to lend money to Conrad was always a very difficult
operation. Frequently it was a very painful one, seeing the agony
of mind Conrad would be in over his debts or his complication of
affairs; so that to be refused the ease to oneself of making a
small loan had almost the aspect of a cruelty&mdash;as if a patient
in great pain should refuse, for the sake of conscience, the
alleviation of an anaesthetic. From the writer Conrad, except in
one extreme case, never accepted any loan that he did not see his
way plain to returning shortly and with an exact
punctuality&mdash;and he always repaid on the date thus appointed
by himself. The exception was a case of one of those complicated
disasters that from time to time overwhelm those who have no means
of making a livelihood, other than the frail, thin point of the
pen. Conrad had been ill, there had been illness in his household.
On top of it there came a bank smash, and Conrad was faced either
with paying immediately a fairly substantial sum, or with being
sold up. This sum the writer advanced to Conrad; it was in due time
repaid.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Illness and the anticipation of illness, debt, and still more
the vision of the approach of a time when he must inevitably incur
debt are, because of his necessary powers of the imagination, more
terrible to the novelist than to any other human creature. As
regards illness: In a society that has gradually become
self-protectively organised the vocations or professions are very
few in which the illness of a worker means entire cessation of
income. The shopkeeper's shop will go on&mdash;perhaps it will be
less efficiently conducted if its head is absent for any long
period; and so with the business of the merchant or the financier.
The doctor, the parson and the lawyer can find <i>locos
tenentes</i> of course at some expense. The working man has his
insurance; the serving class are to some extent protected by law.
The literary man has nothing. Even insurance against illness is for
him a very poor expedient since the things that will stop him
working are as frequently as not diseases in no way diagnosable.
The writer once suffered from a nervous breakdown that lasted for
two years and over, during which he was withdrawn from practically
all human activities, except taking the waters at various German
Spas. He was completely unable to write. Lie had been insured
against illness with a large and reputable society for a
considerable time; yet all that he was able to recover, by way of a
compromise, from that society was a sum a little less than a
quarter of the instalments he had paid. There was no redress:
apparently the laws of England hold that diseases of the nerves are
not illnesses.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Yet they will stop you writing. And to so admirable a family man
as was Conrad, half of whose mind at least was given to the matter
of securing comfort and permanent provision for those dependent on
him, whose agonies over this department of his life were
sempiternal and overwhelming, the mere illness of a member of his
family was sufficient to maim his working mind for long periods.
For the author's mind jumps very fast to extreme apprehensions, and
only too frequently he knows a great deal too much, for his peace
of mind, of the progress of illnesses. He is forced to that by the
very necessities of his profession in the course of which he must,
from time to time at least, describe the progress of one illness or
another Indeed, he writes because his memory is more tenacious and
more vivid in its functionings than that of other men. That causes
the anticipation of all misfortunes to weigh more heavily on
him.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That is if possible even more the case with the facing of debts
or the anticipation of debts. The layman incurs debts as a part of
the necessary business of life without which commercial operations
cannot be conducted. As often as not his creditors are great
corporations, unfeeling it is true, but immune from personal
suffering. If he himself goes bankrupt it is nowadays usually in
the form of a firm or a public company, and he will go on much as
before. To the novelist a debt is a sword in the hands of an
individual who himself may starve if he do not receive his due, who
is also an executioner, who is also a mysterious and dreaded force
of evil, unknown in his functionings. Unknown,
particularly...<i>What</i> happens if you are county-courted? What
sort of faces have broker's men? Do they despise or reprove you for
having dared to incur a debt that you cannot discharge?...The
pictured horrors of the situation are infinite: you imagine your
infant child turned out of its cot by rough men like the murderers
in the Tower, or still more terribly, you imagine your child old
enough to appreciate deprivations, squalors, and the
disgrace...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Almost the most vivid emotion that the writer can remember in
his whole life was caused by the first visit one of the greatest of
writers paid to the Pent. It has been already described in a book
of the writer's; but as no one discoverable ever read it it may
come in here again. We were sitting then on a quiet sunlit day in
the parlour of the Pent. Conrad was at the round table in the
middle of the room, writing, his face to the window; his
collaborator was reading some pages of corrected manuscript, facing
into the room. A shadow went over those pages from the window
behind. Conrad exclaimed, "Good God!" in an accent of such agony
and terror that the writer's heart actually stopped as he swung
round to the window to follow the direction of his companion's
appalled glance. It went through his mind, "This must be the
bailiff...He has debts of which I do not know...What's to be
done?...Are all the doors bolted?...What does one do?"</p>

<p>An extremely tall man with a disproportionately small, grave
head was stalking past the window, examining the house front with
suspicion...The family were all out driving. How could they be got
in if all the doors had to be bolted? Through the window? But if a
window is used as a place of ingress surely a bailiff can use it
too...One imagines that immense, grave fellow, in a pepper-and-salt
gamekeeper's coat with tails, putting one knee over the window sill
as a small boy is handed in...Surely an execution for debt cannot
take place after sunset?...Then they will have to remain out till
then. Or perhaps that is obsolete law...They could go into the
great barn...It is always warm and still there, with the scent of
hay: like an immense church.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The house was perfectly still. The tall figure with the aspect
of a Spanish alcalde disappeared from above the monthly roses. He
had been stalking, very slowly, like a man in a grave
pageant&mdash;a stork. Suddenly Conrad exclaimed in a voice that
was like a shout of joy, "By Jove!...It's the man come about the
mare!" Conrad was almost always going through some complicated
horse dealings with that mare of his. He was going to exchange her
for a pair of Shetland ponies and a chaff-cutting machine; he was
going to sell her in Ashford market as against part of the price of
a stout Irish cob, the remainder to be paid by the loaning of her
during hay-making to the farmer who hired the lands of the Pent;
she was to be exchanged with a horse dealer who was shortly going
out of business and had a most admirable roll-top desk and a really
good typewriter. Traps could be hired from the Drum Inn at
Stamford...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad's conviction restored life to the fainting Pent; it
breathed once more; the cat jumped off the window sill; the clock
struck four...The writer hurried, a little tremulous still, to open
the front door...The tall, thin, grave man looked gravely at him.
The writer exclaimed hurriedly, "The mare's out driving..." He
added, "With the ladies!" It's a great thing to be able to prove to
a horse dealer that your mare can really be driven by a lady. The
man&mdash;he resembled a sundial&mdash;said in the slow voice a
sundial must have, "I'm Hudson!" The writer said, "Yes, yes. The
mare's out with the ladies." Getting into his voice the resonance
of a great bell, the tall man with the Spanish sort of beard said,
"I'm...W...H...Hud...son. I want to see Conrad. You are not Conrad,
are you? You are Hueffer."...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer may very well have psychologised Conrad wrongly,
though he remains strongly un der the impression that after that
king of men had gone Conrad said, "By Jove, I thought he was a
bailiff!" But the occupation of writing to such a nature as
Conrad's is terribly engrossing. To be suddenly disturbed is apt to
cause a second's real madness...We were once going up to Town in
order to take some proofs to a publisher, and halfway between
Sandling and Charing Cross Conrad remembered some phrase that he
had forgotten to attend to in the proofs. He tried to correct them
with a pencil, but the train jolted so badly that writing, sitting
on a seat, was impossible. Conrad got down on the floor of the
carriage and lying on his stomach went on writing. Naturally when
the one phrase was corrected twenty other necessities for
correction stuck out of the page. We were alone in the carriage.
The train passed Paddock Wood, passed Orpington, rushed through the
suburbs. The writer said, "We 're getting into Town!" Conrad never
moved except to write. The house roofs of London whirled in
perspective round us; the shadow of Cannon Street Station was over
us. Conrad wrote. The final shadow of Charing Cross was over us. It
must have been very difficult to see down there. He never
moved...Mildly shocked at the idea that a porter might open the
carriage door and think us peculiar, the writer touched Conrad on
the shoulder and said, "We're there!" Conrad's face was most
extraordinary&mdash;suffused and madly vicious. He sprang to his
feet and straight at the writer's throat...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The lay reader&mdash;say an officer of His Majesty's
Army&mdash;should not here say, "Ah, these literary men!"...Let him
think of his own feelings when he is trying to write some
particularly complicated lie in an excuse to Orderly Room over
something or other...The writer once saw a colonel&mdash;and a
deuced smart colonel at that&mdash;in Orderly Room, snatch up a
revolver and <i>damn</i> near shoot an orderly who had interrupted
him in a literary composition. The Quartermaster whose job it was,
the Adjutant, and the writer, who had been called in, having all
failed, the C.O. was himself trying to explain to garrison
headquarters why the regiment's washing was given to the Riverdale
Laundry Company instead of to some firm recommended by G. H. Z. You
could almost swear his tongue followed his pen round and round in
his mouth in the effort of composition...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Well, the lay reader should understand that <i>our</i> tongues
really do follow our pens when we are engaged in writing the
specious lies on which our existence depends. And if our lies are
not con vincing, we, even as he, shall starve. And we are at it all
the time whilst he gives on an average not more than five minutes a
day for five days of the week to composing the misleading documents
that save him from having to resign his commission. And he has only
one Orderly Room and only one Assistant Adjutant to deceive: we lie
to thousands. If we are lucky, to tens of thousands! So we are
engrossed...It is not more easy for us to put words together; it is
more difficult because we have more sense of words. And we who go
at it with persistence, undespairing, in the face of inevitable
failure ...are the gallant spirits.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad at least was. It has to be remembered that he had to
wrestle, not with one language only, but with three. Or, say with
two and the ghost of one, for it happened to him occasionally to
say, "There's a word <i>so and so</i> in Polish to express what I
want." But that happened only very seldom. All the rest of the time
he got an effect to satisfy himself in French. This was of course
the case preponderantly in passages of some nicety of thought and
expression. He could naturally write, "Will you have a cup of tea?"
or "He is dead," without first expressing himself to himself in
French. But when he wrote a set of phrases like "the gift of
expression", "the bewildering", "the illuminating", "the most
exalted", "the most contemptible", "the pulsating stream of light",
or "the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness",
he was translating directly from the French in his mind. Or when he
wrote, "Their glance was guileless, profound, confident and
trusting", or, "The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds,
and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the
earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky&mdash;seemed to lead into
the heart of an immense darkness." Naturally, as a British master
mariner, he did not <i>have</i> to think of the offing as "<i>le
large</i>", but when he was trying the sound of that sentence for
his final cadence he <i>did</i> first say "<i>le large</i>" and
then said, "The open sea; the <i>way</i> to the open sea. No, the
<i>offing</i>." That the writer very well remembers...Conrad
moreover had for long intended to end the story with the words,
"The horror! The horror!" "<i>L'horreur!</i>" having been the last
words of Kurtz; but he gave that up. The accentuation of the
English word was different from the French; the shade of meaning,
too. And the device of such an ending, which would have been quite
normal in a French story, would have been what we used to call
<i>chargé</i>&mdash;a word meaning something between harrowing,
melodramatic, and rhetorical, for which there is no English
equivalent. Perhaps "overloaded with sentiment" would come as near
it as you can get: but that is clumsy...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But the mere direct translation from imagined French into
English was just child's play. It was when you came to the
transposing precisely, of such a word as <i>chargé</i> from French
into English, that difficulties began. The writer remembers Conrad
spending nearly a whole day over one word in two or three sentences
of proofs for the Blackwood volume called "Youth." It was two
words, perhaps&mdash;serene and azure. Certainly it was azure. "And
she crawled on, do or die, in the serene weather. The sky was a
miracle of purity, a miracle of azure." Conrad said, <i>azure</i>,
the writer <i>ay</i>sure&mdash;or more exactly <i>ay</i>syeh. This
worried Conrad a good deal since he wanted <i>azure</i> for his
cadence. He read the sentence over and over again to see how it
sounded.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The point was that he was perfectly aware that azure was a
French word, or in English almost exclusively a term of heraldry,
and his whole endeavour was given to using only such words as are
found in the normal English vernacular&mdash;or thereabouts, for he
never could be got really to believe how poverty-stricken a thing
the normal English vernacular is. The vocabulary that he used in
speaking English was enormous and he regarded it as a want of
patriotism to think that the average Englishman knew his language
less well than himself.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Mr. Henry James used to call Marlowe, the usual narrator for
many years of Conrad's stories, "that preposterous master mariner."
He meant precisely that Marlowe was more of a philosopher and had a
vocabulary vastly larger and more varied than you could possibly
credit to the master mariner as a class. Conrad, however, persisted
that Marlowe was little above the average of the ship's officer in
either particular, and presumably he knew his former service mates
better than did Mr. James&mdash;or the rest of us...Still he
<i>did</i> think that the word azure would be outside the ordinary
conversational vocabulary of a ship's captain...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We talked about it then for a whole day...Why not say simply
"blue"? Because really, it is not blue. Blue is something coarser
in the grain; you imagine it the product of the French
Impressionist painter&mdash;or of a house painter&mdash;with the
brush strokes showing. Or you think so of blue after you have
thought of azure. Azure is more transparent...</p>

<p>Or again the word "serene."...Why not calm? Why not
quiet?...Well, quiet as applied to weather is&mdash;or perhaps it
is only was&mdash;part of the "little language" that was being used
by the last Pre-Raphaelite poets. That ruled quiet out. Calm on the
other hand is, to a master mariner, almost too normal and too
technically inclusive. Calm is in a log-book almost any weather
that would not be agitating to a landsman&mdash;or thereabouts.
Dead calm is&mdash;again to a seaman&mdash;too technical. Dead
calmness precludes even the faintest ruffle of wind, even the
faintest cat's-paw on the unbroken surface of the sea.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer has heard it objected that Conrad was pernicketty;
why should he not use technical sea terms and let the reader make
what he could of it? But Conrad's sea is more real than the sea of
any other sea writer; and it is more real, because he avoided the
technical word.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The whole passage of "Youth" under consideration is as
follows&mdash;the writer is quoting from memory, but as far as this
passage is concerned he is fairly ready to back his memory against
the printed page:</p>

<p class="newspaper">And she crawled on, do or die, in the serene
weather. The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle of azure. The
sea was polished, was blue, was pellucid, was sparkling like a
precious stone, extending on all sides, all round to the horizon.
As if the whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel, one colossal
sapphire. And on the lustre of the great calm waters the
<i>Judea</i> moved imperceptibly, enveloped in languid and unclean
vapours...</p>

<p>That is as far as the writer's memory will carry him, though the
paragraph ends with the words, "The splendour of sea and sky."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>This then is almost the perfection of sea writing of its type.
(Stephen Crane could achieve another perfection by writing of the
waves as barbarous and abrupt: but that in the end is no less
anthropomorphic.) And the words serene and azure remained after an
infinite amount of talking so that the whole passage might retain
its note of the personality of Destiny that watched inscrutably
behind the sky. It was Destiny that was serene, that had purity,
that was azure...and that ironically set that smudge of oily vapour
from the burning vessel across the serenity of the miraculous
sapphire&mdash;so that youth might be enlightened as to the nature
of the cosmos, even whilst in process of being impressed with its
splendours.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>"Serene" as applied to weather; "azure" as applied to the sky
are over-writing a shade, are a shade <i>chargés</i> if they apply
merely to the sea and merely to the sky...But Conrad was obsessed
by the idea of a Destiny omnipresent behind things; of a Destiny
that was august, blind, inscrutable, just, and above all
passionless, that has decreed that the outside things&mdash;the
sea, the sky, the earth, love, merchandising, the winds&mdash;shall
make youth seem tenderly ridiculous and all the other ages of men
gloomy, imbecile, thwarted&mdash;and possibly heroic...Had the
central character of this story been a fortyish man you would have
had, added to the burning ship with its fumes, dirty weather,
dripping clothes, the squalid attributes of the bitter sea. As it
was an affair of <i>youth</i> you have serene weather and a miracle
of purity, to enhance the irony of Destiny.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3-0" id="ch3-0"></a>Part III. IT IS ABOVE ALL TO
MAKE YOU SEE...</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-1" id="ch3-1"></a>I.</h2>

<p>The time has come, then, for some sort of critical estimate of
this author. Critical, not philosophical. For the philosophy of
Joseph Conrad was a very simple one; you might sum it all up in the
maxim of Herrick's: To live merrily and trust to good letters.
Himself he summed it up in the great word "Fidelity", and his last
great novel turned upon a breach of trust by his typical hero, his
King Tom. It is the misfortune of morality that the greatest
thrills that men can get from life come from the contemplation of
its breaches!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>About Conrad there was, however, as little of the moralist as
there was of the philosopher. When he had said that every work of
art has&mdash;must have&mdash;a profound moral purpose, and he said
that every day and all day long, he had done with the subject. So
that the writer has always wished that Conrad had never written his
famous message on Fidelity. Truly, those who read him knew his
conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a very few
simple ideas&mdash;and it might have been left at that. For it was
the very basis of all Conrad's work that the fable must not have
the moral tacked on to its end. If the fable has not driven its
message home the fable has failed, must be scrapped and must give
place to another one.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But the impulse to moralise, to pontify, is a very strong one,
and comes in many treacherous guises. One may so easily do it
unawares: and instances of Conrad's pontifications are far enough
to seek, considering the temporal eminence to which he attained. He
let, otherwise, his light so shine before men that few would be
inclined to claim him amongst the preachers.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He was before all things the artist and his chief message to
mankind is set at the head of this chapter..."It is above all
things to make you <i>see</i>..." Seeing is believing for all the
doubters of this planet, from Thomas to the end: if you can make
humanity see the few very simple things upon which this temporal
world rests you will make mankind believe such eternal truths as
are universal...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That message, that the province of written art is above all
things to make you see, was given before we met; it was because
that same belief was previously and so profoundly held by the
writer that we could work for so long together. We had the same
aims and we had all the time the same aims. Our attributes were no
doubt different. The writer probably knew more about words, but
Conrad had certainly an infinitely greater hold over the
architectonics of the novel, over the way a story should be built
up so that its interest progresses and grows up to the last word.
Whether in the case of our officially collaborated work or in the
work officially independent in which we each modified the other
with almost as much enthusiasm and devotion as we gave to work done
together, the only instance that comes to the writer's mind in
which he of his own volition altered the structure of any work
occurred in the opening chapters of "The Rescue."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Of that book Conrad made many drafts, over a very great number
of years. The writer seems to remember, but is not quite certain,
having heard Conrad say that he had meant to take up the story of
"The Rescue" immediately after the publication or the finishing of
"Almayer's Folly." And it obviously belongs to the group of
subjects set in Malaysia or thereabouts, of the date, say, of
"Karain" from "Tales of Unrest", or "The Lagoon", that was
published in the same volume, dated 1898. (In the matter of books
published in London in the nineties, dates of publication, if these
are of any importance, are sometimes hazy. Thus the writer's first
book was published in 1891, but the date given on the title page is
1892. The ingenious publisher, who was also Conrad's, hit on this
stratagem, afterwards imitated by American magazines, with the idea
of beguiling the possible buyer into the belief that he was
purchasing a brand new book eighteen months or so after it had been
published.) "Karain", then, the one of his early short stories that
Conrad liked best, was published in <i>Blackwood's</i> in 1897 and
then in a volume that is dated 1898. It was, as far as the writer's
memory serves him, written in 1896.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The relationship of "Karain" to "The Rescue" is obvious. For two
years Conrad carried the idea of the novel about with him and then,
after the publication of "The Nigger of the Narcissus" by Heinemann
in 1898, he definitely sketched the plot of "The Rescue" to
Heinemann himself. On this sketch he obtained one of his advances
from that kindly man. Immediately afterwards he began his first
draft of the novel...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That advance remained an old man of the mountain for years and
years. There were the glorious schemes for finishing off such and
such a book by such and such a date and then quickly writing two or
three stories like "Gaspar Ruiz" for a periodical that paid great
prices, thus getting free forever of indebtedness!...Then there
came always the grim remembrance, "There's that advance of
Heinemann's on 'The Rescue.'..." That no doubt rather hypnotised
his will when he attacked, as he constantly did, that particular
book. He made at least six separate beginnings of a chapter, or a
chapter and a half each, with every different kind of arrangement
of paragraphs and openings. At last, towards 1906, Conrad, in one
of his crises of rearrangement had got his affairs nearly
straightened out. He then once more remembered with despair
Heinemann's advance which, together with "The Rescue" itself, had
remained out of sight for four or five years. So the writer said to
Conrad, "You'd better give me those manuscripts and let me put
together some sort of a beginning for you." Conrad was then
wrestling with the opening chapter of "Chance" which he expected
with any luck to finish, slight affair as it was going to be, in
about three months. It was actually finished seven years later.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Openings for us, as for most writers, were matters of great
importance, but probably we more than most writers realised of what
primary importance they were. A real short story must open with a
breathless sentence; a long-short story may begin with an "as" or a
"since" and some leisurely phrases. At any rate the opening
paragraph of book or story should be of the tempo of the whole
performance. That is the <i>règle generale</i>. Moreover, the
reader's attention must be gripped by that first paragraph. So our
ideal novel must begin either with a dramatic scene or with a note
that should suggest the whole book. "The Nigger of the Narcissus"
begins:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr. Baker, chief mate of the <i>Narcissus</i>,
stepped in one stride out of his lighted cabin into the darkness of
the quarter deck...</p>

<p>"The Secret Agent":</p>

<p class="newspaper">Mr. Verloc, going out in the morning, left his
shop nominally in charge of his brother-inlaw...</p>

<p>"The End of the Tether":</p>

<p class="newspaper">For a long time after the course of the
steamer <i>Sophala</i> had been altered...</p>

<p>this last being the most fitting beginning for the long-short
story that "The End of the Tether" is.</p>

<p>"Romance", on the other hand begins:</p>

<p class="newspaper">To yesterday and to to-day I say my polite
<i>vaya usted con dios</i>. What are those days to me? But that
far-off day of my romance, when from between the blue and white
bales in Don Ramon's darkened store room in Kingston...</p>

<p>an opening for a long novel in which the dominant interest lies
far back in the story and the note must be struck at once.</p>

<p>"The Inheritors" first lines are:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Ideas," she said. "Oh, as for ideas..."</p>

<p>an opening for a short novel.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad's tendency and desire made for the dramatic opening; the
writer's as a rule for the more pensive approach; but we each, as a
book would go on, were apt to find that we must modify our
openings. This was more often the case with Conrad than with the
writer, since Conrad's books depended much more on the working out
of an intrigue which he would develop as the book was in writing:
the writer has seldom begun on a book without having, at least, the
intrigue, the "affair", completely settled in his mind.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The disadvantage of the dramatic opening is that after the
dramatic passage is done you have to go back to getting your
characters in, a proceeding that the reader is apt to dislike. The
danger with the reflective opening is that the reader is apt to
miss being gripped at once by the story. Openings are therefore of
necessity always affairs of compromise.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The note should here be struck that in all the conspiracies that
went on at the Pent or round the shores of the Channel there was
absolutely no mystery. We thought just simply of the reader. Would
this passage grip him? If not it must go. Will this word make him
pause and so slow down the story? If there is any danger of that,
away with it. That is all that is meant by the dangerous word
<i>technique</i>.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Tremendous readers, both of us, we tried to gather from the
books we had read what made one book readable and the other not.
English gentlemen of the Palmerston days, there was no nonsense
about us; we tried to turn out the sort of book that, from "Lady
Audley's Secret" to Boswell's "Johnson", and from "Midshipman Easy"
to "Education Sentimentale", the English gentleman might read in
his library, with the cedar trees on the lawn outside it&mdash;or
the flag lieutenant, in harbour, during the dogwatches.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We had the intimate conviction that two and only two classes of
books are of universal appeal: the very best and the very worst.
The very worst, securing immediate attention by way of some trick,
gradually fade from the public memories; the very best, being solid
and shipshape productions of solid and shipshape men with no
nonsense about them, remain. We attempted then to turn out solid
and shipshape books.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>There was really nothing more to it, Conrad being the more
solid, the more shipshape and the more determined of the two, the
writer being the more tenacious..."You have a perfect right to say
that you are rather unchangeable," Conrad wrote not long before his
end, "Unlike the serpent (which is Wise) you will die in your
original skin."...That is to say that the writer never made
concessions. We elaborated certain principles and the writer saw to
it that we did work along those lines. Conrad would occasionally
try to rush a position, being worn out by the long drag of work.
That is why the ends of his books have sometimes the air of being
rather slight compared with the immense fabrics to which they are
the appendages. In effect, Conrad was the more determined&mdash;to
get something done; the writer, more listless, never cared much
whether a thing were done or not. He insisted, however, that if it
were done it should be done to contract.</p>

<p>It was a combination not really unfortunate. The cases must be
rare in which one man of letters can have had at his disposal for a
number of years the whole brain of another man of letters of an
unpliant disposition. Conrad so had the writer's. For it was quite
definitely the writer's conviction that the only occupation fitting
for a proper man in these centuries is the writing of
novels&mdash;and that no novel worth much could be written by
himself or any other man&mdash;at any rate, by himself&mdash;before
he has reached the age of forty. So till he had attained that age
the writer was determined never to attempt the production of
anything that was not either a pastiche or a <i>tour de
force</i>&mdash;just for practice in writing. One must roll one's
hump around the world first...Thus, rather listlessly and a little
disdainfully, from time to time the writer turned out historical
novels&mdash;which were received with very great
acclamations&mdash;and books of connected essays that were received
with acclamations almost greater. But the writer was not disturbed;
a historical novel even at the best is nothing more than a <i>tour
de force</i>, a fake more or less genuine in inspiration and
workmanship, but none the less a fake. Even "Salammbo" is that. A
book of connected essays...well, it is not a novel! In addition the
writer did attempt two pastiches in the manner of Mr. Henry James,
written, one of them, as a variation on a book of essays to give
the effect of a tour in the United States&mdash;an international
affair. The other was the product of an emotion, as you get over
things by writing them down in your diary.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>From time to time gentlemen of the Press anxious to depreciate
the writer have said that he imitated the work of Conrad. This was
not the case. It is a curious characteristic of the work of Conrad
that, not only can you not recognisably imitate it, you hardly ever
feel even the impulse to do so, and the one writer who really
sedulously be-aped the more exotic romances of the author of "An
Outpost of Progress" achieved performances so lugubrious that he
seems to have warned off any other imitators of his example. The
fact is that Conrad, like Turgenev, is very little mannered; his
temperament had no eccentricities that could be easily imitated;
his vocabulary was as much the result of difficulties as of
arbitrary selection; his cadences were so intimately his own that
they were practically unimitable. The writer probably more than any
other man must have had opportunities of studying the way prose
came to Conrad but the writer does not remember more than three
sentences that he ever wrote&mdash;apart from sentences that he
actually composed for Conrad himself&mdash;in which he either
consciously tried for some purpose or other to get the cadence of a
sentence of Conrad's, or as to which he felt, after having written
them, the satisfaction which he might imagine himself feeling if he
<i>had</i> written a Conrad sentence. If the accusation had been of
imitation of Mr. Henry James it might have been just enough, though
a pastiche is not exactly the same thing as an imitation, being an
exercise in the manner of a writer rather than an attempt to make a
living by concealed plagiarism...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Still, whatever may have been the writer's occupations, he was
ready to be pulled off them at any moment at the instance of
Conrad's necessities. And this probably <i>was</i> of service to
the author of "The Rescue." ...As regards the opening of that book
the writer very well remembers how the rearrangement was made...In
all Conrad's drafts the opening was dramatic. In most of them it
began with a speech of Tom Lingard's, one of them with the words,
"You've been sleeping&mdash;you. Shift the helm. She has got stern
way on her." One version even began as far back, in the book as it
stands at present, as an interview between Lingard and Mrs.
Travers...Conrad had meant that to be the dramatic opening; in that
case he would have had to introduce an immense retrospection giving
the biographies of Lingard, of Carter, of the Travers, of Jaffir,
of the Malay serangs ...of everybody and everything.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>On the impracticability of that we both agreed and the writer
took the various drafts away to Aldington to study. A good many of
the drafts that the writer made opened with a passage of
description, "Out of the level blue of a shallow sea Carimata
raises a lofty barrenness of grey and yellow tints, the drab
eminence of its arid heights," the writer thinking that a slow
passage of geographical significance ought, logically, to open what
seemed likely to be a very long book. Then one day it occurred to
him to ask, "Why, after all, not have a historical opening and so
avoid, later on, the necessity to slow the story down in order to
get in the history?" So at the opening, at any rate of one draft,
of chapter two, he found the passage beginning, "The shallow sea
that foams and murmurs on the shores of the thousand islands, big
and little, which make up the Malay Archipelago has been for
centuries the scene of adventurous undertakings."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>And all this passage seeming to him to be admirable, beautiful
and engrossing prose, it struck him that it might be relied on at
once to grip the reader's attention and to give the note of the
coming story. So in "The Rescue" you have the opening historical
passage, the geographical passage and then Lingard's words:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"You've been sleeping&mdash;you. Shift the
helm. She has got stern way on her."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3-2" id="ch3-2"></a>II.</h2>

<p>It might be as well here to put down under separate headings,
such as "Construction", "Development", and the like, what were the
formulae for the writing of the novel at which Conrad and the
writer had arrived, say in 1902 or so, before we finally took up
and finished "Romance." The reader will say that that is to depart
from the form of the novel in which form this book pretends to be
written. But that is not the case. The novel more or less
gradually, more or less deviously, lets you into the secrets of the
characters of the men with whom it deals. Then, having got them in,
it sets them finally to work. Some novels, and still more short
stories, will get a character in with a stroke or two as does
Maupassant in the celebrated sentence in the "Reine Hortense" which
Conrad and the writer were never tired of&mdash;quite
intentionally&mdash;misquoting: "<i>C'était un monsieur à favoris
rouges qui entrait toujours le premier</i>..." He was a gentleman
with red whiskers who always went first through a
doorway...<i>That</i> gentleman is so sufficiently got in that you
need know no more of him to understand how he will act. He has been
"got in" and can get to work at once. That is called by the
official British critics the static method and is, for some reason
or other, contemned in England.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Other novels, however, will take much, much longer to develop
their characters. Some&mdash;and this one is an example&mdash;will
take almost a whole book to really get their characters in and will
then dispose of the "action" with a chapter, a line, or even a
word&mdash;or two. The most wonderful instance of all of that is
the ending of the most wonderful of all Maupassant's stories,
"Champs d'Oliviers", which, if the reader has not read, he should
read at once. Let us now take a heading. (This method has the
advantage that the lay reader who cannot interest himself in
literary methods and the Critic-Annalist whose one passion is to
cut the cackle and come to the horses can skip the whole chapter,
certain that he will miss none of the spicy titbits.)</p>

<p class="cp">GENERAL EFFECT</p>

<p>We agreed that the general effect of a novel must be the general
effect that life makes on mankind. A novel must therefore not be a
narration, a report. Life does not say to you: In 1914 my next-door
neighbour, Mr. Slack, erected a green house and painted it with
Cox's green aluminum paint...If you think about the matter you will
remember, in various unordered pictures, how one day Mr. Slack
appeared in his garden and contemplated the wall of his house. You
will then try to remember the year of that occurrence and you will
fix it as August, 1914, because having had the foresight to bear
the municipal stock of the City of Liege you were able to afford a
first-class season ticket for the first time in your life. You will
remember Mr. Slack&mdash;then much thinner because it was before he
found out where to buy that cheap Burgundy of which he has since
drunk an inordinate quantity, though whisky you think would be much
better for him! Mr. Slack again came into his garden, this time
with a pale, weaselly-faced fellow, who touched his cap from time
to time. Mr. Slack will point to his house wall several times at
different points, the weaselly fellow touching his cap at each
pointing. Some days after, coming back from business, you will have
observed against Mr. Slack's wall...At this point you will remember
that you were then the manager of the fresh-fish branch of Messrs.
Catlin and Clovis in Fenchurch Street...What a change since then!
Millicent had not yet put her hair up...You will remember how
Millicent's hair looked, rather pale and burnished in plaits. You
will remember how it now looks, henna'd; and you will see in one
corner of your mind's eye a little picture of Mr. Mills the vicar
talking&mdash;oh, very kindly&mdash;to Millicent after she has come
back from Brighton...But perhaps you had better not risk that. You
remember some of the things said by means of which Millicent has
made you cringe&mdash;and her expression!...Cox's Aluminum
Paint!...You remember the half-empty tin that Mr. Slack showed
you&mdash;he had a most undignified cold&mdash;with the name in a
horseshoe over a blue circle that contained a red lion asleep in
front of a real-gold sun...</p>

<p>And, if that is how the building of your neighbour's greenhouse
comes back to you, just imagine how it will be with your love
affairs that are so much more complicated...</p>

<p class="cp">IMPRESSIONISM</p>

<p>We accepted without much protest the stigma "Impressionists"
that was thrown at us. In those days Impressionists were still
considered to be bad people: Atheists, Reds, wearing red ties with
which to frighten householders. But we accepted the name because
Life appearing to us much as the building of Mr. Slack's greenhouse
comes back to you, we saw that Life did not narrate, but made
impressions on our brains. We in turn, if we wished to produce on
you an effect of life, must not narrate but render impressions.</p>

<p class="cp">SELECTION</p>

<p>We agreed that the whole of Art consists in selection. To render
your remembrance of your career as a fish salesman might enhance
the story of Mr. Slack's greenhouse, or it might <i>not</i>. A
little image of iridescent, blue-striped, blackstriped, white fish
on a white marble slab with water trickling down to them round a
huge mass of orange salmon roe; a vivid description of a horrible
smell caused by a cat having stolen and hidden in the thick of your
pelargoniums a cod's head that you had brought back as a
perquisite, you having subsequently killed the cat with a hammer,
but long, long before you had rediscovered her fishy booty...Such
little impressions might be useful as contributing to illustrate
your character&mdash;one should not kill a cat with a hammer! They
might illustrate your sense of the beautiful&mdash;or your
fortitude under affliction&mdash;or the disagreeableness of Mr.
Slack, who had a delicate sense of smell&mdash;or the point of view
of your only daughter, Millicent.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We should then have to consider whether your sense of the
beautiful or your fortitude could in our rendering carry the story
forward or interest the reader. If it did we should include it; if
in our opinion it was not likely to, we should leave it out. Or the
story of the cat might in itself seem sufficiently amusing to be
inserted as a purposed <i>longueur</i>, so as to give the idea of
the passage of time...It may be more amusing to read the story of a
cat with your missing dinner than to read, "A fortnight elapsed..."
Or it might be better after all to write boldly, "Mr. Slack, after
a fortnight had elapsed, remarked one day very querulously, 'That
smell seems to get worse instead of better.'"</p>

<p>SELECTION (SPEECHES)</p>

<p>That last would be compromise, for it would be narration instead
of rendering: it would be far <i>better</i> to give an idea of the
passage of time by picturing a cat with a cod's head, but the
length of the story must be considered. Sometimes to render
anything at all in a given space will take up too much
room&mdash;even to render the effect and delivery of a speech. Then
just boldly and remorselessly you must relate and <i>risk</i> the
introduction of yourself as author, with the danger that you may
destroy all the illusion of the story.</p>

<p>Conrad and the writer would have agreed that the ideal rendering
of Mr. Slack's emotions would be as follows:</p>

<p class="newspaper">A scrawny, dark-brown neck, with an immense
Adam's apple quivering over the blue stripes of a collar, erected
itself between the sunflower stems above the thin oaken flats of
the dividing fence. An unbelievably long, thin gap of a mouth
opened itself beneath a black-spotted handkerchief, to say that the
unspeakable odour was sufficient to slay all the porters in Covent
Garden. Last week it was only bad enough to drive a regiment of
dragoons into a faint. The night before the people whom he had had
to supper&mdash;I wondered who could eat any supper with any
appetite under the gaze of those yellow eyes&mdash;people, mind
you, to whom he had hoped to sell a little bit of property in the
neighbourhood. Good people. With more than a little bit in the
bank. People whose residence would give the whole neighbourhood a
lift. They had asked if he liked going out alone at night with so
many undiscovered murders about..."Undiscovered murders!" he went
on repeating, as if the words gave him an intimate sense of relief.
He concluded with the phrase, "I <i>don't</i> think!"</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That would be a very fair <i>rendering</i> of part of an
episode: it would have the use of getting quite a lot of Mr. Slack
in; but you might want to get on towards recounting how you had the
lucky idea of purchasing shares in a newspaper against which Mr.
Slack had counselled you...And you might have got Mr. Slack in
already!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The rendering in fact of speeches gave Conrad and the writer
more trouble than any other department of the novel whatever. It
introduced at once the whole immense subject of under what
convention the novel is to be written. For whether you tell it
direct and as author&mdash;which is the more difficult way&mdash;or
whether you put it into the mouth of a character&mdash;which is
easier by far but much more cumbersome&mdash;the question of
reporting or rendering speeches has to be faced. To pretend that
any character or any author writing directly can remember whole
speeches with all their words for a matter of twenty-four hours,
let alone twenty-four years, is absurd. The most that the normal
person carries away of a conversation after even a couple of hours
is just a salient or characteristic phrase or two, and a mannerism
of the speaker. Yet, if the reader stops to think at all, or has
any acuteness whatever, to render Mr. Slack's speech directly,
"Thet there odour is enough to do all the porters in Common Gorden
in. Lorst week it wouldn' no more 'n 'v sent a ole squad of
tinwiskets barmy on the crumpet..." and so on through an entire
monologue of a page and a half, must set the reader at some point
or other wondering how the author or the narrator can possibly,
even if they were present, have remembered every word of Mr.
Slack's long speech. Yet the object of the novelist is to keep the
reader entirely oblivious of the fact that the author
exists&mdash;even of the fact that he is reading a book. This is of
course not possible to the bitter end, but a reader <i>can</i> be
rendered very engrossed, and the nearer you can come to making him
entirely insensitive to his surroundings, the more you will have
succeeded.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Then again, directly reported speeches in a book do move very
slowly; by the use of indirect locutions, together with the
rendering of the effects of other portions of speech, you can get a
great deal more into a given space. There is a type of reader that
likes what is called conversations&mdash;but that type is rather
the reader in an undeveloped state than the reader who has read
much. So, wherever practicable, we used to arrange speeches much as
in the paragraph devoted to Mr. Slack above. But quite often we
compromised and gave passages of direct enough speech.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>This was one of the matters as to which the writer was more
uncompromising than was Conrad. In the novel which he did at last
begin on his forty-first birthday there will be found to be hardly
any direct speech at all, and probably none that is more than a
couple of lines in length. Conrad indeed later arrived at the
conclusion that, a novel being in the end a matter of
convention&mdash;and in the beginning too, for the matter of that,
since what are type, paper, bindings and all the rest, but matters
of agreement and convenience&mdash;you might as well stretch
convention a little farther, and postulate that your author or your
narrator is a person of a prodigious memory for the spoken. He had
one minute passion with regard to conversations: he could not bear
the repetition of "he said's" and "she said's", and would spend
agitated hours in chasing those locutions out of his or our pages
and substituting "he replied", "she ejaculated", "answered Mr.
Verloc" and the like. The writer was less moved by this
consideration; it seemed to him that you could employ the words "he
said" as often as you like, accepting them as being unnoticeable,
like "a", "the", "his", "her", or "very."</p>

<p class="cp">CONVERSATIONS</p>

<p>One unalterable rule that we had for the rendering of
conversations&mdash;for genuine conversations that are an exchange
of thought, not interrogatories or statements of fact&mdash;was
that no speech of one character should ever answer the speech that
goes before it. This is almost invariably the case in real life
where few people listen, because they are always preparing their
own next speeches. When, of a Saturday evening, you are conversing
over the fence with your friend Mr. Slack, you hardly notice that
he tells you he has seen an incredibly coloured petunia at a market
gardener's, because you are dying to tell him that you have
determined to turn author to the extent of writing a letter on
local politics to the newspaper of which, against his advice, you
have become a large shareholder.</p>

<p>He says, "Right down extraordinary that petunia was..."</p>

<p>You say, "What would you think now of my..."</p>

<p>He says, "Diamond-shaped stripes it had, blueblack and
salmon..."</p>

<p>You say, "I've always thought I had a bit of a gift..."</p>

<p>Your daughter Millicent interrupts, "Julia Gower has got a pair
of snake-skin shoes. She bought them at Wiston and Willocks's."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>You miss Mr. Slack's next two speeches in wondering where
Millicent got that bangle on her wrist. You will have to tell her
more carefully than ever that she must <i>not</i> accept presents
from Tom, Dick and Harry. By the time you have come out of that
reverie Mr. Slack is remarking:</p>

<p>"I said to him use turpentine and sweet oil, three parts to two.
What do you think?"</p>

<p class="cp">SURPRISE</p>

<p>We agreed that the one quality that gave interest to Art was the
quality of surprise. That is very well illustrated in the snatch of
conversation just given. If you reported a long speech of Mr.
Slack's to the effect that he was going to enter some of his
petunias for the local flower show and those, with his hydrangeas
and ornamental sugar-beet, might well give him the Howard Cup for
the third time in which case it would become his property out and
out. He would then buy two silver and cut-glass epergnes, one to
stand on each side of the Cup on his sideboard. He always did think
that a touch of silver and cut glass...If, after that, you gave a
long speech of your own&mdash;after, naturally, you had added a few
commonplaces as a politeness to Mr. Slack&mdash;if you gave a long
speech in which with modesty you dwelt on the powers of observation
and of the pen that you had always considered yourself to possess,
and in which you announced that you certainly meant to write a
letter to the paper in which you had shares&mdash;on the statuary
in the facade of the new town hall which was an offence to public
decency...And if in addition to that you added a soliloquy from
your daughter Millicent to the effect that she intended to obtain
on credit from your bootmakers, charging them to your account, a
pair of scarlet morocco shoes with two-inch heels with which to go
joy-riding on the Sunday with a young actor who played under the
name of Hildebrand Hare and who had had his portrait in your
paper...If you gave all these long speeches one after the other you
might be aware of a certain dullness when you reread that <i>compte
rendu</i>...But if you carefully broke up petunias, statuary, and
flower-show motives and put them down in little shreds, one
contrasting with the Other, you would arrive at something much more
coloured, animated, lifelike and interesting, and you would convey
a profoundly significant lesson as to the self-engrossment of
humanity. Into that live scene you could then drop the piece of
news that you wanted to convey and so you would carry the chapter a
good many stages forward.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Here, again, compromise must necessarily come in: there must
come a point in the dramatic working up of every scene in which the
characters do directly answer each other, for a speech or for two
or three speeches. It was in this department, as has already been
pointed out, that Conrad was matchless and the writer very
deficient. Or, again, a point may come in which it is
necessary&mdash;in which at least it is to take the line of least
resistance&mdash;to report directly a whole tremendous effort of
eloquence as ebullient as an oration by Mr. Lloyd George on the
hymns of the Welsh nation. For there are times when the
paraphernalia of indirect speech, interruptions, and the rest
retard your action too much. Then they must go; the sense of
reality must stand down before the necessity to get on.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But, on the whole, the indirect, interrupted method of handling
interviews is invaluable for giving a sense of the complexity, the
tantalisation, the shimmering, the haze, that life is. In the
pre-War period the English novel began at the beginning of a hero's
life and went straight on to his marriage without pausing to look
aside. This was all very well in its way, but the very great
objection could be offered against it that such a story was too
confined to its characters and, too selfcentredly, went on, <i>in
vacuo</i>. If you are so set on the affair of your daughter
Millicent with the young actor that you forget that there
<i>are</i> flower shows and town halls with nude statuary your
intellect will appear a thing much more circumscribed than it
should be. Or, to take a larger matter. A great many novelists have
treated of the late War in terms solely of the War: in terms of pip
squeaks, trench coats, wire aprons, shells, mud, dust, and sending
the bayonet home with a grunt. For that reason interest in the late
War is said to have died. But, had you taken part actually in those
hostilities, you would know how infinitely little part the actual
fighting itself took in your mentality. You would be lying on your
stomach, in a beast of a funk, with an immense, horrid German
barrage going on all over and round you and with hell and all let
loose. But, apart from the occasional, petulant question, "When the
deuce will our fellows get going and shut 'em up?" your thoughts
were really concentrated on something quite distant: on your
daughter Millicent's hair, on the fall of the Asquith Ministry, on
your financial predicament, on why your regimental ferrets kept on
dying, on whether Latin is really necessary to an education...You
were there, but great shafts of thought from the outside, distant
and unattainable world infinitely for the greater part occupied
your mind.</p>

<p>It was that effect, then, that Conrad and the writer sought to
get into their work, that being Impressionism.</p>

<p><i>But these two writers were not unaware that there are other
methods; they were not rigid in their own methods; they were
sensible to the fact that compromise is at all times necessary in
the execution of every work of art.</i>
</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Let us come, then, to the eternally vexed seas of the Literary
Ocean.</p>

<p class="cp">STYLE</p>

<p>We agreed on this axiom:</p>

<p>The first business of Style is to make work interesting: the
second business of Style is to make work interesting: the third
business of Style is to make work interesting: the fourth business
of Style is to make work interesting: the fifth business of
Style...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Style, then, has no other business.</p>

<p>A style interests when it carries the reader along; it is then a
good style. A style ceases to interest when by reason of disjointed
sentences, over-used words, monotonous or jog-trot cadences, it
fatigues the reader's mind. <i>Too</i> startling words, however
apt, <i>too</i> just images, <i>too</i> great displays of
cleverness are apt in the long run to be as fatiguing as the most
over-used words or the most jog-trot cadences. That a face
resembles a Dutch clock has been too often said; to say that it
resembles a ham is inexact and conveys nothing; to say that it has
the mournfulness of an old, squashed-in meat tin, cast away on a
waste building lot, would be smart&mdash;but too much of that sort
of thing would become a nuisance. To say that a face was cramoisy
is undesirable; few people nowadays know what the word means. Its
employment will make the reader marvel at the user's erudition; in
thus marvelling he ceases to consider the story and an impression
of vagueness or length is produced on his mind. A succession of
impressions of vagueness and length render a book in the end
unbearable.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>There are, of course, pieces of writing intended to convey the
sense of the author's cleverness, knowledge of obsolete words or
power of inventing similes: with such exercises Conrad and the
writer never concerned themselves.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We used to say, the first lesson that an author has to learn is
that of humility. Blessed are the humble because they do not get
between the reader's legs. Before everything the author must learn
to suppress himself; he must learn that the first thing he has to
consider is his story and the last thing that he has to consider is
his story, and in between that he will consider his story.</p>

<p>We used to say that a passage of good style began with a fresh,
usual word, and continued with fresh, usual words to the end; there
was nothing more to it. When we felt that we had really got hold of
the reader, with a great deal of caution we would introduce a word
not common to a very limited vernacular, but that only very
occasionally. Very occasionally indeed; practically never. Yet it
is in that way that a language grows and keeps alive. People get
tired of hearing the same words over and over again...It is again a
matter for compromise.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Our chief masters in style were Flaubert and Maupassant:
Flaubert in the greater degree, Maupassant in the less. In about
the proportion of a sensible man's whisky and soda. We stood as it
were on those hills and thence regarded the world. We remembered
long passages of Flaubert; elaborated long passages in his spirit
and with his cadences and then translated them into passages of
English as simple as the subject under treatment would bear. We
remembered short, staccato passages of Maupassant; invented short,
staccato passages in his spirit and then translated them into
English as simple as the subject would bear. Differing subjects
bear differing degrees of simplicity. To apply exactly the same
timbre of language to a dreadful interview between a father and a
daughter as to the description of a child's bedroom at night is
impracticable because it is unnatural. In thinking of the frightful
scene with your daughter Millicent which ruined your life, town
councillor and parliamentary candidate though you had become, you
will find that your mind employs a verbiage quite different from
that which occurs when you remember Millicent asleep, her little
mouth just slightly opened, her toys beside the shaded
night-light.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Our vocabulary, then, was as simple as was practicable. But
there are degrees of simplicity. We employed as a rule in writing
the language that we employed in talking the one to the other. When
we used French in speaking we tried mentally to render in English
the least literary equivalent of the phrase. We were, however, apt
to employ in our conversation words and periphrases that are not in
use by, say, financiers. This was involuntary, we imagining that we
talked simply enough. But later a body of younger men with whom the
writer spent some years would say, after dinner, "Talk like a book,
H...Do talk like a book!" The writer would utter some speeches in
the language that he employed when talking with Conrad; but he
never could utter more than a sentence or two at a time. The whole
mess would roar with laughter and, for some minutes, would render
his voice inaudible.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>If you will reflect on the language you then employed&mdash;and
the writer&mdash;you will find that it was something like,
"Cheerio, old bean. The beastly Adjutant's Parade is at five ack
emma. Will you take my Johnnie's and let me get a real good fug in
my downy bug-walk? I'm fair blind to the wide to-night." That was
the current language then and, in the earlier days of our
conversations, some equivalent with which we were unacquainted must
normally have prevailed. That we could hardly have used in our
books, since within a very short time such languages become
incomprehensible. Even to-day the locution "ack emma" is no longer
used and the expression "blind to the wide" is
incomprehensible&mdash;the very state is unfamiliar&mdash;to more
than half the English speaking populations of the globe.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So we talked and wrote a Middle-High English of as unaffected a
sort as would express our thoughts. And that was all that there
really was to our "style." Our greatest admiration for a stylist in
any language was given to W. H. Hudson of whom Conrad said that his
writing was like the grass that the good God made to grow and when
it was there you could not tell how it came.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Carefully examined, a good&mdash;an interesting&mdash;style will
be found to consist in a constant succession of tiny, unobservable
surprises. If you write&mdash;"His range of subject was very wide
and his conversation very varied and unusual; he could rouse you
with his perorations or lull you with his periods; therefore his
conversation met with great appreciation and he made several fast
friends"&mdash;you will not find the world very apt to be engrossed
by what you have set down. The results will be different if you put
it, "He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into
an aggravated witch-dance; he could also fill the small souls of
the pilgrims with bitter misgivings; he had one devoted friend at
least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither
rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Or, let us put the matter in another way. The catalogue of an
ironmonger's store is uninteresting as literature because things in
it are all classified and thus obvious; the catalogue of a farm
sale is more interesting because things in it are contrasted. No
one would for long read: Nails, drawn wire, 1/2 inch, per lb...;
nails, do., 3/4 inch, per lb...; nails, do., inch, per lb...But it
is often not disagreeable to read desultorily: "<i>Lot</i> 267.
Pair rabbit gins. <i>Lot</i> 268, Antique powder flask. <i>Lot</i>
269, Malay Kris. <i>Lot</i> 270, Set of six sporting prints by
Herring. <i>Lot</i> 271, Silver caudle cup..." for that, as far as
it goes, has the quality of surprise.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That is, perhaps, enough about Style. This is not a technical
manual, and at about this point we arrive at a region in which the
writer's memory is not absolutely clear as to the points on which
he and Conrad were agreed. We made in addition an infinite number
of experiments, together and separately, in points of style and
cadence. The writer, as has been said, wrote one immense book
entirely in sentences of not more than ten syllables. He read the
book over. He found it read immensely long. He went through it all
again. He joined short sentences; he introduced relative clauses;
he wrote in long sentences that had a gentle sonority and ended
with a dying fall. The book read less long. Much less long.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad also made experiments, but not on such a great scale
since he could always have the benefit of the writer's performances
of that sort. The writer only remembers specifically one instance
of an exercise on Conrad's part. He was interested in blank verse
at the moment&mdash;though he took no interest in English verse as
a rule&mdash;and the writer happening to observe that whole
passages of "Heart of Darkness" were not very far off blank verse,
Conrad tried for a short time to run a paragraph into decasyllabic
lines. The writer remembers the paragraph quite well. It is the one
which begins:</p>

<p class="newspaper">She walked with measured steps, draped in
striped and fringed cloths, treading the earth proudly with a
slight jingle and flash of barbarous ornaments...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But he cannot remember what Conrad added or took away. There
come back vaguely to him a line or two like:</p>

<p class="newspaper">She carried high her head, her hair was
done<br>
In the shape of a helmet; she had greaves of brass<br>
To the knee; gauntlets of brass to th' elbow.<br>
A crimson spot...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That, however, may just as well be the writer's contrivance as
Conrad's: it happened too long ago for the memory to be sure. A
little later, the writer occupying himself with writing French
rhymed <i>vers libre</i>, Conrad tried his hand at that too. He
produced:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Riez toujours! La vie nest pas si gate,<br>
Ces tristes jours quand à travers la haie<br>
Tombe le long rayon<br>
Dernier<br>
De mon soleil qui gagne<br>
Les sommets, la mantagne,<br>
De l'horizon.</p>

<p>There was a line or two more that the writer has forgotten.</p>

<p>That was Conrad's solitary attempt to write verse.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>We may as well put the rest of this matter under a separate
heading:</p>

<p class="cp">CADENCE</p>

<p>This was the one subject upon which we never came to any
agreement. It was the writer's view that every one has a natural
cadence of his own from which in the end he cannot escape. Conrad
held that a habit of good cadence could be acquired by the study of
models. His own he held came to him from constant reading of
Flaubert. He did himself probably an injustice.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>But questions of cadence and accentuation as of prosody in
general we were chary of discussing. They were matters as to which
Conrad was very touchy. His ear was singularly faulty for one who
was a great writer of elaborated prose so that at times the writer
used to wonder how the deuce he <i>did</i> produce his effects of
polyphonic closings to paragraphs. In speaking English he had
practically no idea of accentuation whatever, and indeed no
particular habits. He would talk of Mr. Cunninghame Graham's book
"Success" alternately as "<i>Suc</i>cess" and "Suc<i>cess</i>" half
a dozen times in the course of a conversation about the works of
that very wonderful writer. Over French he was not much better. He
became quite enraged when told that if the first line of his verse
quoted above was to be regarded as decasyllabic&mdash;and it
<i>must</i> by English people be regarded as
decasyllabic&mdash;then the word <i>vie</i> must be a monosyllable
in spite of its termination in e. He had in the second line quite
correctly allowed for <i>tristes</i> as being two syllables, and
<i>tombe</i> in the third. In the clash of French verse-theories of
those days he might be correct or incorrect without committing a
solecism, but he could not be incorrect in the first line and
formal in the others. Conrad's face would cloud over. He would
snatch up a volume of Racine and read half a dozen lines. He would
exclaim contemptuously, "Do you mean to say that each of those
verses <i>con</i>sists of ten syllables?"...Yet he would have read
the verse impeccably...He would flush up to the eyes. He would cry,
"Did you ever hear a Frenchman say 'vee-yeh' when he meant 'vee?'
You never did! <i>Jamais de la vie!</i>" And with fury he would
read his verse aloud, making, with a slight stammer, <i>vie</i> a
monosyllable and, with impetus, two syllables each out of
<i>tristes</i> and <i>tombe</i>. He would begin to gesticulate, his
eyes flashing...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>One would change the subject of discussion to the unfailing
topic of the rottenness of French as a medium for poetry, finding
perfect harmony again in the thought that French was as rotten for
verse-poetry as was English for any sort of prose...</p>

<p>The curious thing was that when he read his prose aloud his
accentuation was absolutely faultless. So that it always seemed to
the writer that Conrad's marvellous gift of language was, in the
end, dramatic. When he talked his sense of phonetics was dormant,
but the moment it came to any kind of performance the excitement
would quicken the brain centres that governed his articulation. It
was, indeed, the same with his French. When conversing desultorily
with the writer, he had much of the accent and the negligence of an
aristocratic, meridional lounger of the seventies...But when at
Lamb House, Rye, he addressed compliments to Mr. Henry James, you
could imagine, if you closed your eyes, that it was the senior
actor of the Théâtre Français, addressing an eulogium to the bust
of Molière...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Probably the mere thought of reading aloud subconsciously
aroused memories of once-heard orations of Mr. Gladstone or John
Bright; so, in writing, even to himself he would accentuate and
pronounce his words as had done those now longdefunct orators...And
it is to be remembered that during all those years the writer wrote
every word that he wrote with the idea of reading aloud to Conrad,
and that during all those years Conrad wrote what he wrote with the
idea of reading it aloud to this writer.</p>

<p class="cp">STRUCTURE</p>

<p>That gets rid, as far as is necessary in order to give a pretty
fair idea of Conrad's methods, of the questions that concern the
texture of a book. More official or more learned writers who shall
not be novelists shall treat of this author's prose with less
lightness&mdash;but assuredly too with less love...Questions then
of vocabulary, selection of incident, style, cadence and the rest
concern themselves with the colour and texture of prose and, since
this writer, again, will leave to more suitable pens the profounder
appraisements of Conrad's morality, philosophy and the rest, there
remains only to say a word or two on the subject of form.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Conrad, then, never wrote a true short story, a matter of two or
three pages of minutely considered words, ending with a
smack...with what the French call a <i>coup de canon</i>. His
stories were always what for lack of a better phrase one has to
call "long-short" stories. For these the form is practically the
same as that of the novel. Or, to avoid the implication of saying
that there is only one form for the novel, it would be better to
put it that the form of long-short stories may vary as much as may
the form for novels. The short story of Maupassant, of Tchekhov or
even of the late O. Henry is practically stereotyped&mdash;the
introduction of a character in a word or two, a word or two for
atmosphere, a few paragraphs for story, and then, click! a sharp
sentence that flashes the illumination of the idea over the
whole.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>This Conrad&mdash;and for the matter of that, the
writer&mdash;never so much as attempted, either apart or in
collaboration. The reason for this lies in all that is behind the
mystic word "justification." Before everything a story must convey
a sense of</p>

<p>inevitability: that which happens in it must seem to be the only
thing that could have happened. Of course a character may cry, "If
I had then acted differently how different everything would now
be." The problem of the author is to make his then action the only
action that character could have taken. It must be inevitable,
because of his character, because of his ancestry, because of past
illness or on account of the gradual coming together of the
thousand small circumstances by which Destiny, who is inscrutable
and august, will push us into one certain predicament. Let us
illustrate:</p>

<p>In rendering your long friendship with, and ultimate bitter
hostility towards, your neighbour Mr. Slack, who had a greenhouse
painted with Cox's aluminum paint, you will, if you wish to get
yourself in with the scrupulousness of a Conrad, have to provide
yourself, in the first place, with an ancestry at least as far back
as your grandparents. To account for your own stability of
character and physical robustness you will have to give yourself
two dear old grandparents in a lodge at the gates of a great
nobleman: if necessary you will have to give them a brightly
polished copper kettle simmering on a spotless hob, with
silhouettes on each side of the mantel: in order to account for the
lamentable procedure of your daughter Millicent you must provide
yourself with an actress or gipsy-grandmother. Or at least with a
French one. This grandmother will have lived, unfortunately
unmarried, with some one of eloquence&mdash;possibly with the great
Earl-Prime Minister at whose gates is situated the humble abode of
your other grandparents&mdash;at any rate she will have lived with
some one from whom you will have inherited your eloquence. From her
will have descended the artistic gifts to which the reader will owe
your admirable autobiographic novel.</p>

<p>If you have any physical weakness, to counterbalance the
robustness of your other grandparents, you will provide your
mother, shortly before your birth, with an attack of typhoid fever,
due to a visit to Venice in company with your father, who was a
gentleman's courier in the family in which your mother was a lady's
maid. Your father, in order to be a courier, will have had, owing
to his illegitimacy, to live abroad in very poor circumstances. The
very poor circumstances will illustrate the avarice of his
statesman father&mdash;an avarice which will have descended to you
in the shape of that carefulness in money matters that, reacting on
the detrimental tendencies inherited by Millicent from her
actress-grandmother, so lamentably influences your daughter's
destiny.</p>

<p>And of course there will have'to'be a great deal more than that,
always supposing you to be as scrupulous as was Conrad in this
matter of justification. For Conrad&mdash;and for the matter of
that the writer&mdash;was never satisfied that he had really and
sufficiently got his characters in; he was never convinced that he
had convinced the reader; this accounting for the great lengths of
some of his books. He never introduced a character, however
subsidiary, without providing that character with ancestry and
hereditary characteristics, or at least with home
surroundings&mdash;always supposing that character had any
influence on the inevitability of the story. Any policeman who
arrested any character must be "justified", because the manner in
which he effected the arrest, his mannerisms, his vocabulary and
his voice, might have a permanent effect on the psychology of the
prisoner. The writer remembers Conrad using almost those very words
during the discussion of the plot of "The Secret Agent."</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>This method, unless it is very carefully handled, is apt to have
the grave defect of holding a story back very considerably. You
must as a rule bring the biography of a character in only after you
have introduced the character; yet, if you introduce a policeman to
make an arrest the rendering of his biography might well retard the
action of an exciting point in the story...It becomes then your job
to arrange that the very arresting of the action is an incitement
of interest in the reader, just as, if you serialise a novel, you
take care to let the words "<i>to be continued in our next</i>"
come in at as harrowing a moment as you can contrive.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>And of course the introducing of the biography of a character
may have the great use of giving contrast to the tone of the rest
of the book...Supposing that in your history of your affair with
Mr. Slack you think that the note of your orderly middle-class home
is growing a little monotonous, it would be very handy if you could
discover that Mr. Slack had a secret, dipsomaniacal wife, confined
in a country cottage under the care of a rather criminal old
couple; with a few pages of biography of that old couple you could
give a very pleasant relief to the sameness of your narrative. In
that way the sense of reality is procured.</p>

<p class="cp">PHILOSOPHY, ETC.</p>

<p>We agreed that the novel is absolutely the only vehicle for the
thought of our day. With the novel you can do anything: you can
inquire into every department of life, you can explore every
department of the world of thought. The one thing that you can not
do is to propagandise, as author, for any cause. You must not, as
author, utter any views; above all, you must not fake any events.
You must not, however humanitarian you may be, over-elaborate the
fear felt by a coursed rabbit.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>It is obviously best if you can contrive to be without views at
all; your business with the world is rendering, not alteration. You
have to render life with such exactitude that more specialised
beings than you, learning from you what are the secret needs of
humanity, may judge how many white-tiled bathrooms are, or to what
extent parliamentary representation is, necessary for the happiness
of men and women. If, however, your yearning to amend the human
race is so great that you cannot possibly keep your fingers out of
the watch-springs there is a device that you can adopt.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you feel tremendously strong views as to
sexual immorality or temperance. You feel that you must express
these, yet you know that like, say, M. Anatole France, who is also
a propagandist, you are a supreme novelist. You must then invent,
justify and set going in your novel a character who can
convincingly express your views. If you are a gentleman you will
also invent, justify and set going characters to express views
opposite to those you hold...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>You have reached the climax of your long relationship with Mr.
Slack; you are just going to address a deputation that has come to
invite you to represent your native city in the legislature of your
country. The deputation is just due. Five minutes before it arrives
to present you with the proudest emotion of your life, you learn
that your daughter Millicent is going to have a child by Mr. Slack.
(Him, of course, you will have already "justified" as the likely
seducer of a young lady whose cupidity in the matter of bangles and
shoes you, by your pecuniary carefulness, have kept perpetually on
the stretch.) Mr. Slack has a dipsomaniac wife so there is no
chance of his making the matter good...</p>

<p>You thus have an admirable opportunity of expressing with
emphasis quite a number of views through the mouth of the character
whom you have so carefully "justified" as yourself. Quite a number
of views!</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>That then was, cursorily stated, the technique that we evolved
at the Pent. It will be found to be nowadays pretty generally
accepted as the normal way of handling the novel. It is founded on
common sense and some of its maxims may therefore stand
permanently. Or they may not.</p>

<p class="cp">PROGRESSION D'EFFET</p>

<p>There is just one other point. In writing a novel we agreed that
every word set on paper&mdash;<i>every</i> word set on
paper&mdash;must carry the story forward and that, as the story
progressed, the story must be carried forward faster and faster and
with more and more intensity. That is called <i>progression
d'effet</i>, words for which there is no English equivalent.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>One might go on to further technicalities, such as how to
squeeze the last drop out of a subject. The writer has, however,
given an instance of this in describing how we piled perils of the
hangman's rope on the unfortunate John Kemp. To go deeper into the
matter would be to be too technical. Besides enough has been said
in this chapter to show you what was the character, the
scrupulousness and the common sense of our hero.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>There remains to add once more:</p>

<p><i>But these two writers were not unaware</i>&mdash;were not
unaware&mdash;<i>that there are other methods of writing novels.
They were not rigid even in their own methods. They were sensible
to the fact that compromise is at all times necessary to the
execution of a work of art.</i></p>

<p>The lay reader will be astonished at this repetition and at
these italics. They are inserted for the benefit of gentlemen and
ladies who comment on books in the Press.</p>

<p class="cp">LANGUAGE</p>

<p>It would be disingenuous to avoid the subject of language. This
is the only matter on which the writer ever differed fundamentally
from Conrad. It was one upon which the writer felt so deeply that,
for several years, he avoided his friend's society. The pain of
approaching the question is thus very great.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Conrad's dislike for the English language, then, was, during all
the years of our association, extreme, his contempt for his medium
unrivalled. Again and again during the writing of, say, "Nostromo"
he expressed passionate regret that it was then too late to hope to
make a living by writing in French, and as late as 1916 he
expressed to the writer an almost equally passionate envy of the
writer who was in a position to write in French, propaganda for the
government of the French Republic...And Conrad's contempt for
English as a prose language was not, as in the writer's case,
mitigated by love for English as the language for versepoetry. For,
to the writer, English is as much superior to French in the one
particular as French to English in the other.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Conrad, however, knew nothing of, and cared less for, English
verse&mdash;and his hatred for English as a prose medium reached
such terrible heights that during the writing of "Nostromo" the
continual weight of Conrad's depression broke the writer down. We
had then published "Romance" and Conrad, breaking, in the interests
of that work, his eremitic habits, decided that we ought to show
ourselves in Town. The writer therefore took a very large, absurd
house on Campden Hill and proceeded to "entertain." Conrad had
lodgings also on Campden Hill. At this time "Nostromo" had begun to
run as a serial in a very popular journal, and on the placards of
that journal Conrad's name appeared on every hoarding in London.
This publicity caused Conrad an unbelievable agony, he conceiving
himself for ever dishonoured by such vicarious pandering to
popularity.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>It was the most terrible period of Conrad's life and of the
writer's. Conrad at that time considered himself completely
unsuccessful; ignored by the public; ill-treated by the critics (he
was certainly at that date being treated with unusual stupidity by
the critics); he was convinced that he would never make a decent
living. And he was convinced that he would never master English. He
used to declare that English was a language in which it was
impossible to write a direct statement. That was true enough. He
used to declare that to make a direct statement in English is like
trying to kill a mosquito with a forty-foot stock whip when you
have never before handled a stock whip. One evening he made, in
French, to the writer, the impassioned declaration which will be
found in French at the end of this volume. On the following
afternoon he made a terrible scene at the writer's house...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>The writer was at the time very much harassed. The expense of
keeping up a rather portentous establishment made it absolutely
necessary that he should add considerably to his income with his
pen&mdash;a predicament with which he had not yet been faced. There
was nothing in that except that it was almost impossible to find
time to write. An epidemic of influenza running through the house
crippled its domestic staff so that all sorts of household tasks
had of necessity to be performed by the writer: there were, in
addition, social duties&mdash;and the absolute necessity of
carrying Conrad every afternoon through a certain quantum of work
without which he must miss his weekly instalments in the popular
journal...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>At an At Home there, amongst eminently decorous people, a
well-meaning but unfortunate gentleman congratulated Conrad on the
fact that his name appeared on all the hoardings and Conrad
considered that these congratulations were ironical gibes at him
because his desperate circumstances had forced him to agree to the
dishonour of serialisation in a popular journal...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Conrad's indictment of the English language was this, that no
English word is a word; that all Eaglish words are instruments for
exciting blurred emotions. "Oaken" in French means "made of oak
wood"&mdash;nothing more. "Oaken" in English connotes innumerable
moral attributes: it will connote stolidity, resolution, honesty,
blond features, relative unbreakableness, absolute
unbendableness&mdash;also, made of oak...The consequence is that no
English word has clean edges: a reader is always, for a fraction of
a second, uncertain as to which meaning of the word the writer
intends. Thus, all English prose is blurred. Conrad desired to
write prose of extreme limpidity...</p>

<p>We may let it go at that. In later years Conrad achieved a
certain fluency and a great limpidity of language. He then
regretted that for him all the romance of writing was
gone&mdash;the result being "The Rover", which strikes the writer
as being a very serene and beautiful work...In between the two he
made tributes to the glory of the English language, by implication
contemning the tongue that Flaubert used. This struck the writer,
at that time in a state of exhausted depression, as
unforgivable&mdash;as the very betrayal of Dain by Tom
Lingard...Perhaps it was. If it were Conrad faced the fact in that
book. There are predicaments that beset great Adventurers, in dark
hours, in the shallows: the overtired nerve will fail...We may well
let it go at that...</p>

<p>§</p>

<p><i>"For it would be delightful to catch the echo of the
desperate and funny quarrels that enlivened these old days. The
pity of it is that there comes a time when all the fun of one's
life must be looked for in the past..."</i>
</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Those were Conrad's last words on all the matters of our
collaborations here treated of. They were, too, almost his last
words...For those who can catch them here, then, are the
echoes...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4-0" id="ch4-0"></a>Part IV. THAT, TOO, IS
ROMANCE...</h2>

<p>With the turn of the century we took up again "Romance."</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>For a long time we had talked of going to Bruges in order to get
quiet in which to finish this work; this not because the Pent was
noisy, but its corners seemed to be filled with the whispering
echoes of our struggles. The crux of the difficulties in this book
had arrived. By that time a great deal of it was finished and in
about its present condition.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>Conrad's allotment of the authorship of the parts of this work
had better be given here again.</p>

<p>"I suppose our recollections agree," he writes to the author.
"Mine in their simplest form, are:</p>

<p>"First part, yours; Second part, mainly yours, with a little by
me on points of seamanship and suchlike small matters; Third part
about 60 per cent, mine with important touches by you. Fourth part
mine, with here and there an important sentence by you: Fifth part
practically all yours, including the famous sentence at which we
both exclaimed: 'This is Genius' (Do you remember what it was?)
with perhaps half a dozen lines by me."</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>The writer's recollection agrees except as to the Fourth part,
which does not contain one word by the writer. How that came about
shall now be recounted.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>The writer with his family and paraphernalia had transported
themselves to Bruges to await Conrad and his. Bruges is a grey,
silent town with crowstep gables to the house fronts, its shadows
being shot with the gleams from canals that run through the
streets. Its roof-level is dominated by an immense belfry from
which there descend chimes. The chimes are practically never
silent. Beautifully and drowsily five minutes before every quarter
of the hour they begin to announce that the quarter is about to
strike; for ten minutes after the quarter has struck they go on
announcing that the quarter has struck. The hour is greeted for a
quarter of an hour by chimes that announce that the hour is about
to strike; for forty-five minutes after the hour has struck they
continue to announce that the hour has struck. The hours and the
quarters are struck on great bells whose overtones go on
reverberating for fifty and for ten minutes respectively.</p>

<p>...That is impressionism: the impressionism of those who in
Bruges lie awake at night. There are in Bruges a great number of
churches&mdash;all with bells&mdash;and some very lovely, bright
little pictures by Van Eyck. There was also an English pension to
which we had agreed to go. Conrad liked to be amongst English
people when abroad...Bruges is also very relaxing: except at night
it is difficult not to sleep.</p>

<p>§</p>

<p>The Contents page of "Romance" looks like this:</p>

<p class="cp">PART FIRST<br>
The Quarry and the Beach<br>
<br>
PART SECOND<br>
The Girl with the Lizard<br>
<br>
PART THIRD<br>
Casa Riego<br>
<br>
PART FOURTH<br>
Blade and Guitar<br>
<br>
PART FIFTH<br>
The Lot of Man</p>

<p>...whose names are five sweet symphonies in the <i>capa y
espada</i> manner. They are all Conrad's, those names. There was
nothing he loved so much as inventing titles for Parts: it was like
being a herald proclaiming war from the steps of St. Paul's...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>On arrival in Bruges the author was carrying the manuscript of
Parts One, Two and Three complete. The end of the book was also
done by then, exactly as it stands, except for the peroration over
which, subsequently, we worked for twenty hours on end. We were to
meet, cheered by the new atmosphere of Bruges and, in a rush,
finish off Part Four and the opening of Part Five...In three or
four days. Then we would take a week's holiday and look at the
churches. We had also planned an excursion to Ghent: two sailors
ashore after a four years' voyage. For, by that time, we had been,
on and off, four years over "Romance."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So there we were in Bruges, in the English pension, waiting for
Conrad. The English pension seemed to be distinguished chiefly by
brown linoleum, bentwood chairs in long perspectives, long teeth in
withered faces, dimness and placards forbidding you to take water
between certain hours from certain taps&mdash;and by complete,
absolute, unshakable lassitude. There was no place in which to
write. When, with a desperate struggle of the will, the writer took
a private sitting room on the ground floor, little boys from the
school opposite used to throw in at the windows envelopes full of
ink which made a delectable mess. About the shadowy streets and
along the dim canals the Briton was pursued by crowds of little
boys whose shouts of <i>Vivent les Boers!</i> gave temporary
animation to Bruges la Morte.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad delayed to come..."Romance" was thus hung up. We had
agreed that the writer would work in the mornings on "Romance"
whilst Conrad wrote&mdash;probably "Typhoon"&mdash;at the same
time. We would play dominoes in agreeable cafés during the
afternoons and after dinner collaborate gaily. The work would take
only a few days...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was impossible to do anything during the day in Bruges but
lie on one's bed; at night it was impossible to sleep for chimes
and mosquitoes...Conrad delayed to come...The diet of the English
pension&mdash;thin slices of cold mutton, potatoes boiled in water,
"greens" boiled in water which remained with the greens&mdash;began
seriously to deteriorate a digestion used to food more elaborate.
The taste of the greens was never out of the mouth...We hesitated
to change our lodging because Conrad was coming to-morrow. He liked
to be amongst English people when abroad. It was perhaps
"To-morrow" that he was then writing, or both "To-morrow" and
"Typhoon." The withered faces and the long teeth that phantasmally
loomed in the more dim places of the English pension were curious
to know why we needed a private sitting room...To write a book
in?...A novel? Oh, good gracious...They had never been in a pension
with a novelist before...Was it quite...Of course you locked your
door at night...But they had always thought...Like common soldiers,
you know...Not allowed in the best...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Telegrams went back and forth between the pension and the
Pent..."Book just being finished," came the cheerful news from the
Pent. Pinker would come down with large sum...The early summer
waned; the dog-days were intolerable there...The French-Swiss
governess, indispensable, declared she would not stop another day
in Bruges...Little boys calling her <i>Sale Anglaise</i> had thrown
ink over her pink-striped, best dimity dress...Agitated packings
began. In the midst of them a telegram from Sandling Junction to
say, "Starting."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>There was, of course, a rush to Ostend where the boat comes in.
Travellers not coming by boat are not allowed on the Ostend-Bruges
Express. The writer visited the <i>sous chef de gare:
Statie-Onderovoorste</i>. He removed his hat, bowing with exquisite
politeness, and announced to a uniformed man as big as a sea-lion
"<i>qu'il serait infiniment reconnaissant si M. Le Chef de Gare lui
accorderait la permission</i>..." The sea-lion mumbled, "<i>Wat
wolt gi?</i>...Wadger want?" The writer wanted permission to travel
by the Ostend-Bruges Express. The sea-lion waved a flapper and
cried: "Vat do <i>I</i> kerr?...Do wadger want...Ko er-way..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad appeared on the platform, overburdened by the weight of a
large-small boy, not very well...Bearers staggering after that
Congo caravan...The scared face of Amy Foster, maid, who had never
been abroad...A swarm of frightened ticket collectors running
alongside. Conrad infuriated...The caravan is assimilated by the
express...The timid ticket collectors waver round the open door of
the carriage bleating, "Tickets, pliss. Billets.
<i>Koupangs...Bitte die Fahrkarten</i>..." Conrad, exhausted but
volanic, sunk on the cushions, exclaims, "Dirt:
foreigners...<i>Sales Beiges</i>...Damn, damn, <i>damn!</i>..." The
sea-lion in an unbuttoned blue tunic with gilt buttons&mdash;a
tunic large enough to be a truck cover&mdash;waddles like a great
sow amongst a poultry yard of ticket collectors. He exclaims,
"<i>Det maakt mix...Verrokter Engelsker</i>...Ko away..." The
ticket collectors disperse...Whether Conrad had any tickets the
writer never knew. He certainly never showed them...It is perhaps
in that way that one <i>ought</i> to handle foreigners...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad remained wrapped in a comminative gloom, the train going
over the flat lands. He contrived to communicate to the milder
writer that all ...all...all these things: the train, the boat, the
mislaid trunks, the ticket collectors and the whole dreary waste of
foreigners were his&mdash;the writer's&mdash;fault...One ought to
be English...The writer ought to be English...Why wasn't he English
to the soul? Asking permission of a <i>Statie-Onderovoorste</i>!
...It made these fellows not know their places...But it would be
all right when we got to the English pension, amongst English
people...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>At the first sight of the first placard on the first landing,
surrounded by long teeth that peeped from the gloom of corridors,
Conrad stiffened, like a sudden corpse.</p>

<p>WATER MUST NOT BE DRAWN FROM THIS TAP BETWEEN THE HOURS OF
ELEVEN AND TEN MORNING OR EVENING. GUESTS WILL BE STRICTLY SILENT
ON THE STAIRS. A FINE OF ONE FRANC TWENTYFIVE WILL BE ENACTED FOR
EVERY FIVE MINUTES LATE AT MEALS. No SMOKING IN THE DININGROOM
SALONS STAIRS BATH ROOMS OR W.C.S. BOOTS ARE NOT CLEANED IN THE
CORRIDORS. ANGLICAN SERVICE DAILY IN THE DINING-ROOM FROM NINE
THIRTY TO ONE...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Thus England spoke.</p>

<p>What Conrad said made all the glimmering teeth vanish from those
corridors for the next seven hours. He disappeared. Gone.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>He seemed to be gone for days...But within seven hours we were
all aboard the tram for Knocke...He had met an admirable Abbe in
the Place du Beffroi...He had been directed to that seashore.
Admirable hotel...Wonderful domino players...Charming Dutch,
French, Spanish, German fellow guests...Belgians not so bad...Best
class...Director of Brussels orchestra...Wagnerian
cantatrice...Unsurpassed sands...Cooking...Hum, hum...Four francs a
day bath and <i>vin compris</i>...r A little music with the
<i>chasse café, mon vieux</i>...We will finish "Romance" in a
week...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>It was not so bad. When Conrad really went at it he fell on his
feet all right...Knocke was just within the Belgian border. You
could run in a sand-yacht in front of the dunes, right to Sluys,
far in Holland...The hotel was very airy, the fellow guests were
pleasant. You could play in domino or <i>écarté</i> tournaments or
sandtennis ones. Even Miss Benny van der Meer de Walcheren was
charming when, at meals, her voice was not shaking the glasses on
the trays in the sixth-floor back bedroom where we tried to
collaborate...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Alas! A child fell ill; the book would not go in the mornings in
the top room; "Romance" in the mornings would not go, either, on
the corner of the café table: doctors had to be fetched at
midnights in the teeth of westerly gales, the foam white like a bar
across the sky, the sand skinning your lips. The child was very
ill...The writer developed symptoms of idiocy never before
suspected...Owing to the illness of the child it was impossible for
Conrad to invent the escape of John Kemp from the Casa Riego in Rio
Media. The writer was set to invent...He invented John Kemp
boarding the <i>Lion</i>, or some other ship, with the fainting
Seraphina on one arm: Kemp swarming up a rope with his burden and
shooting two negroes whose white teeth gleamed at the wheel...It
became touch and go with the child. Conrad had very bad gout, his
wrist all wapped up. He groaned all day long in the top room.
Writing was impossible. From time to time he would smile
distractedly to the writer and say, "If I didn't know that you,
<i>mon vieux</i>, were writing away at that book I should go
mad..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Alas! ...In the café downstairs the sand and the draughts
filtered round the writer's ankles. The ink was full of sand, the
typewriter was stopped by sand, the marble table on which one wrote
was like ice. Autumn was there; the voice of Miss Benny competed
with great gales off the leaden North Sea...The child lived to
become an admirable son, and to make the proudest of fathers that
Conrad was, the discreetly proudest of grandfathers...So Conrad had
mind enough to read how the bodies of those white-teethed niggers
falling on the wheel made the pirate ship come about, and how John
Kemp exclaimed to the villainous O'Brien, "Foiled! And by a
stripling!"...It was not really as bad as that; but that was how it
felt as the writer sat by with Conrad reading the manuscript.
Conrad had too bad a headache, and was too bad with the gout to be
read to in the top room that contained a deal table, an unmade-up
bed, some ash trays and a portrait of Leopold, King of the
Belgians, hanging on the wall askew...Leopold had his revenge for
"The Inheritors" as he simpered down over his preposterous
beard&mdash;the ugly Jew!...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>The writer almost turned. Not because Conrad did not like John
Kemp's pistol practice, but because Conrad's belief in the writer's
omniscience should have put him to the job of writing sea
adventures, which was trying him altogether too high. For Conrad
really had that belief; that is the one certainty that the writer
has as to how Conrad really regarded him. He may have had affection
for the writer or he may not; he may have had admiration for his
gifts or he may not. The one thing certain is that he really
regarded him as omniscient. Otherwise he would never have put him
at the jobs that he did put him at. For of our establishment the
writer was Bill the Lizard. It was, "Here Bill...Where's
Bill?...Bill, the master says that you've got to go up the
chimney!" all day long...And proud, too! The writer would have to
supply authentic information about Anarchists as about Cabinet
Ministers, about Courts of Justice as about the emotions of women,
about leases, mining shares, brands of cigarettes, the verse of
Christina Rossetti...He did, too, and was mostly treated with an
exaggerated politeness. As to the accusation of omniscience and the
politeness there is documentary evidence: you may read in the
preface of "The Secret Agent" of "the omniscient friend who first
gave me the first suggestion of the book." Or again&mdash;-this is
Conrad giving you the writer:</p>

<p class="newspaper">The subject of "The Secret Agent"&mdash;I mean
the tale&mdash;came to me in the shape of a few words uttered by a
friend, in a casual conversation about anarchists or rather
anarchists' activities; how brought about I do not remember
now...<br>
<br>
I remember, however, remarking on the criminal futility of the
whole thing, doctrine, action, mentality...Presently ...we recalled
the already old story of the attempt to blow up Greenwich
Observatory...That outrage could not be laid hold of mentally in
any sort of a way...<br>
<br>
I pointed all this out to my friend who remained silent for a
while, and then remarked in his characteristically casual and
omniscient manner: "Oh, that fellow was half an idiot. His sister
committed suicide afterwards." ...It never occurred to me later to
ask how he arrived at his knowledge. I am sure that if he had once
in his life seen the back of an anarchist, that must have been the
whole of his connection with the underworld...</p>

<p>That passage is curiously characteristic Conrad...For what the
writer really did say to Conrad was, "Oh, that fellow was half an
idiot! His sister murdered her husband afterwards and was allowed
to escape by the police. I remember the funeral..." The suicide was
invented by Conrad. And the writer knew&mdash;and Conrad knew that
the writer knew&mdash;a great many anarchists of the Goodge Street
group, as well as a great many of the police who watched them. The
writer had provided Conrad with anarchist literature, with memoirs,
with introductions to at least one anarchist young lady who figures
in "The Secret Agent." Indeed, the writer's first poems were set up
by that very young lady on an anarchist printing press.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Acquiring such knowledge is the diversion of most youths, the
writer having once been young. There are few English boys of spirit
who have not at one time or other dressed up in sweaters and, with
handkerchiefs round their necks, gone after experience amongst the
cutthroats at Wapping Old Stairs...But Conrad, when he met the
writer after the publication of "The Secret Agent" with preface in
1920, remarked almost at once and solicitously:</p>

<p>"You know...The preface to 'The Secret Agent.'...I did not give
you away too much...I was very cautious."...He had wished politely
to throw a veil of eternal respectability over the writer. And he
had been afraid that the suggestion that the writer had once known
some anarchists, thirty-five years before, might ruin the writer's
career!...And of course few men in self-revelations and prefaces
have ever so contrived under an aspect of lucidity to throw over
themselves veils of confusion.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For the sake of completing the picture of collaborators at work,
whilst we are quoting, the writer will quote here a passage from
Stephen Crane that has always pleased the writer very much. "You
must not be offended," he writes to some one, "by Hueffer's manner.
He patronises Mr. James, he patronises Mr. Conrad. Of course he
patronises me, and he will patronise Almighty God when they meet,
but God will get used to it, for Hueffer is all right." With the
additional information that it was according to Conrad that Henry
James always referred to the writer as <i>votre ami, le jeune homme
modeste</i>, the writer will leave the reader to make what he can
of it. Relationships are extraordinarily indefinable things.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But with the Fourth Part of "Romance" the writer really did
momentarily feel that he was being tried too high. And he
protested. He pointed out that he knew nothing about the sea,
except that it was salt and bitter. He ought not to have been set
to contrive the escape of John Kemp by sea. He could have done it
overland, and would have made Kemp just as hangable.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Conrad grumbled rather suspiciously that the writer had managed
all right with the pirate attack on the <i>Breeze</i> in Part II.
The writer pointed out that it was one thing to elaborate a scene
from the evidence of a trial and to write: "a quarter of a mile
astern and between the land and us, a little schooner, rather low
in the water, curtsying under a cloud of white canvas&mdash;a
wonderful thing to look at." Any one who could describe a pint pot
could write that. But with the impression that the writer knew all
about his, Conrad's past, at the back of his mind, Conrad said,
still suspiciously, "That's all right...What's the matter with
it?..." The implication being that the writer really knew all about
seafaring and had just not tried when he invented those niggers at
the wheel.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>...The fact was that Conrad suspected the writer of not having
taken trouble with the passage, because of going joy-riding with
Miss Benny on a sand-yacht into Holland. Something like that...</p>

<p>In any case, that was the end of the writer's invention of parts
of "Romance." Conrad took over the Fourth Part which begins, "There
was a slight, almost imperceptible jar, a faint grating noise, a
whispering sound of sand&mdash;and the boat, without a splash,
floated." In the literature of romantic adventure there is nothing
more admirable&mdash;unless only, Conrad would have added, "The
Purple Land."</p>

<p>So the writer failed Conrad as any other King Tom always fails
any Malay Prince, for the labours Conrad put into that immense wad
out of the book must have been agonising, and in that matter the
writer was past help...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But it must not be imagined that that ended our labours. The
Parts once joined up, we went right over the book again, working
upon every passage with microscopes. It then went to the printers
and there was an interval. But the proof corrections we made were
so overwhelming that when we were halfway through the Second Part,
Messrs. Smith and Elder sent the manuscript back, suggesting that
we might as well make our corrections on that. We went through it
all again and, even after that, corrected elaborately. On the last
section of the proof we worked at the Pent from ten in the morning
till fire-lighting time of the next morning. What our labours
amounted to was what follows. This passage from the end of
"Romance" has been printed elsewhere as well. The reader may not
have seen that book. We worked all that day on those passages,
putting in sentences and taking them out; there was a great deal
more Conrad at one time, a great deal more Hueffer at another. It
all went but what here is given. We were, you see, shortening,
shortening, shortening&mdash;for the sake of <i>progression
d'effet</i>.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch5-0"></a>PART V. THE END</h2>

<p><i>It takes long enough to realise that some one is dead at a
distance. I had done that. But how long, how long it needs to know
that the life of your heart has come back from the dead. For years
afterwards I could not bear to have her out of my sight.</i>
</p>

<p>Of our first meeting in London all I can remember is a
speechlessness that was like the awed hesitation of our overtried
souls before the greatness of a change from the verge of despair to
the opening of a supreme joy. The whole world, the whole of life,
with her return had changed all around me; it enveloped me, it
enfolded me so lightly as not to be felt, so suddenly as not to be
believed in, so completely that that whole meeting was an embrace,
so softly that at last it lapsed into a sense of rest that was like
the fall of a beneficent and welcome death.</p>

<p><i>For suffering is the lot of man</i>, but not inevitable
failure or worthless despair which is without end&mdash;suffering,
the mark of manhood, which bears within its pain a hope of felicity
like a jewel set in iron...</p>

<p>Her first words were:</p>

<p>"You broke our compact. You went away from me whilst I was
sleeping." Only the deepness of her reproach revealed the depth of
her love, and the suffering she too had endured to reach a union
that was to be without end&mdash;and to forgive.</p>

<p><i>And, looking back, we see Romance&mdash;that subtle thing
that is mirage&mdash;that is life. It is the goodness of the years
we have lived through, of the old time when we did this or that,
when we dwelt here or there. Looking back it seems a wonderful
enough thing that I who am this and she who is that, commencing so
far away a life that, after such sufferings borne together and
apart, ended so tranquilly there in a world so stable&mdash;that
she and I should have passed through so much, good chance and evil
chance, sad hours and joyful, all lived down and swept away into
the little heap of dust that is life. That, too, is Romance.</i>
</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p class="cp">L'ENVOI</p>

<p>The writer has always considered that that man may be said to
have lived happily who has a happy death. What are all the glories
of Napoleon as set against his fretted and fretful end? Death is no
doubt to all kind; a dulling of the faculties sets in and it is,
however fast, a gradual, restful affair. But how kind must death be
to the faithful worker, who, having toiled all his life, can say
with his last breath, I have achieved. His last backward glance
must show all his reverses as mere reverses; but all his progresses
have had such permanence as is vouchsafed to us mortals. So the
writer in these sad months and years has one certain
happiness...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>In the days here mostly treated of, Conrad had a very dreadful,
a very agonising life. Few men can so much have suffered; there was
about all his depressed moments a note of pain&mdash;of agony
indeed&mdash;that coloured our whole relationship; that caused one
to have an almost constant quality of solicitude. It is all very
well to say that he had his marvellous resilience. He had, and that
was his greatness. But the note of a sailor's life cannot be called
preponderantly cheerful whose whole existence is passed in a series
of ninety-day passages, in labouring ships, beneath appalling
weathers, amongst duties and work too heavy, in continual
discomfort and acute physical pain&mdash;with, in between each
voyage, a few days spent as Jack-ashore. And that, in effect, was
the life of Conrad.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>His resilience was his own; his oppressions were the work of
humanity or of destiny. That is why his personality struck so
strong a note of humour. The personality of Conrad as it remains
uppermost in the reader's mind was threefold, with very marked
divisions. There was the Conrad with the sharp, agonising intake of
the breath who feared your approach because you might jar his
gout-martyrised wrist, or the approach of fate with the sharp pain
of new disaster. There was the gloomy aristocrat&mdash;as man and
as intellect&mdash;who mused unceasingly upon the treacheries, the
muddles, the lack of imagination, the imbecilities which make up
the conduct of human affairs; who said after the relation of each
new story of incapacity and cruelness: "<i>Cela vous donne une
fière idée de l'homme</i>"...But most marked in the writer's mind
was the alert, dark, extremely polished and tyrannous personality,
tremendously awake, tremendously interested in small things,
peering through his monocle at something close to the ground,
taking in a characteristic and laughing consumedly&mdash;at a
laborious child progressing engrossedly over a sloping lawn, at a
bell-push that functioned of itself in the doorpost of a gentleman
who had written about an invisible man&mdash;or at the phrase:
"Excellency, a few goats..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Once the writer, in one of his more gorgeous frames of mind, was
standing outside his bank, wearing a dazzling huit-reflets, a
long-tailed morning coat, beautiful trousers and spats, a very high
collar that was like enamel, a black satin stock, and dangling a
clouded cane...Just like that! Bored stiff! Thinking nothing at all
he gazed down Pall Mall...There approached him an old, shrunken,
wizened man, in an unbrushed bowler, an ancient burst-seamed
overcoat, one wrist wrapped in flannel, the other hand helping him
to lean on a hazel walking stick, cut from a hedge and prepared at
home. It had in one tortured eye a round piece of dirty window
glass. It said, "<i>Ford</i>..." "How dare..." The writer said to
himself, "this atrocious old usurer..." For naturally, no one but a
moneylender would have dared ...in such a get-up.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But, within three minutes, as he stood and talked, the bowler
hat was jetty black, the overcoat just come from Poole's, the beard
torpedo-shaped, black, and defiant, the confident accents dusky and
caressing; the monocle sparkled like cut crystal, the eyes glowed.
And, almost more wonderfully, Pall Mall became alive as we went
towards the Bodega; it became alive as towns of the true belief
awaken in the presence of the Prince of True Believers, come to
saunter through his slave market...That, too, was Romance...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>But, indeed, with Conrad in it, London was another place. The
writer knows his London, has written about it silly books that have
been violently if undeservedly belauded; there is not much that you
could tell him about what lies two miles or so west of Piccadilly
and no one should go anywhere else&mdash;at any rate, not in that
frame of mind. But with Conrad at your elbow it became
extraordinarily altered and more vivid. It was not, of course, that
he discoursed archaeologies or told you what famous men had lived
in such a house in Panton Street. It was simply that he looked at a
house front and laughed; or at a hat on a cabman, or his horse, or
a tree in a London square, or the skirt of a girl with a bandbox,
crossing the road in front of the Ritz, or at the Foreign Office
facade...Once we were sitting in the front row of the stalls at the
Empire&mdash;and Conrad was never tired of wondering at the changes
that had come over places of musical entertainment since his time,
when they had lodged in cellars, with sanded floors, pots of beer
and chairmen. On that night at the Empire there was at least one
clergyman with a number of women; ladies is meant...And, during
applause by the audience of some <i>too</i> middle-class joke, one
of us leaned over towards the other and said, "Doesn't one feel
lonely in this beastly country!"...Which of us it was that spoke
neither remembered after, the other had been at that moment
thinking so exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>And that must not be taken as want of patriotism to Great
Britain on the part of either of us. To the measure of our
abilities we were ready to do our bits each for the little bit of
scarlet on the map, and that seems to be all that is wanted...But
in any popular assembly, anywhere, the artist must needs feel a
foreigner and lonely. He must have the feeling that not one soul of
all those thousands would understand one word of what he was
talking of if he really talked of the things that occupied his
mind. You are a part of the mob, at times with some of the
mob-psychology yourself. But if you draw into yourself and resume
your individuality you are frightened. That is what it is. You are
frightened. If that House knew what you were thinking of their
entertainment and themselves they would tear you to pieces on the
instant&mdash;precisely as a foreigner. That is the same all over
the world; but it is at its worst in Anglo-Saxondom.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Indeed, in that frame of mind, Conrad was very impartial. He
used to shock the writer who, as a Briton, knows nothing about his
Imperial possessions, by declaring that the French were the only
European nation who knew how to colonise; they had none of the
spirit of Mr. Kipling's "You-bloody-niggerisms" about them, but
regarded black or tan or black and tan as all one humanity with
themselves, intermarrying, working peacefully side by side, and
side by side, in Algerian cafés of an evening, sitting and drinking
their aperitifs. And they provided the nigger with exactly the same
<i>mairies</i>, frescoes, statuary in the midst of jungles,
representation in Paris and maddening regulations for obtaining
<i>permis de chasse</i> or money from the Post Office as are
provided in any French town from Pont l'Evèque to Aigues Mortes.
That seemed to Conrad the way to colonise: and indeed one never
heard of any Secessionist movements in the French colonies, from
Algeria to Annam. But be that as it may, with all his gloomily
fatalistic views of the incapacity of Anglo-Saxons as colonists
other than by butchery and the sjambok, in "Heart of Darkness" it
is a French, not a British, ship-of-war that bombards the
unanswering bush from the tepid seas of African coasts.</p>

<p class="newspaper">There wasn't even a shed there and she was
shelling the bush...Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles
of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the
greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down. In the
empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was,
incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the
six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white
smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile give a feeble
screech&mdash;and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was
a touch of insanity in the proceeding...</p>

<p>It was not that Conrad was markedly humanitarian; it was that he
disliked waste of human effort even when it is expended in
meaningless cruelty.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>So, against the cruelties of fate, he stood up...There was an
occasion when the whole of the manuscript of the last instalment of
"The End of the Tether" for <i>Blackwood's</i> was burnt shortly
before it was due for publication. That sounds a small thing. But
the instalments of <i>Blackwood</i> are pretty long and the idea of
letting <i>Maga</i> miss an instalment appalled: it was the almost
unthinkable crime...The manuscript had been lying on the round,
Madox Brown table, under a paraffin lamp with a glass reservoir, no
doubt also an eighteen-forty contrivance: the reservoir had
burst...For a day or so it was like a funeral: then for moral
support or because his writing room was burnt out, Conrad drove
over to Winchelsea, to which ancient town the writer had removed.
Then you should have seen Romance! It became a matter of days; then
of hours. Conrad wrote; the writer corrected the manuscript behind
him or wrote in a sentence&mdash;the writer in his study on the
street, Conrad in a two-roomed cottage that we had hired
immediately opposite. The household sat up all night keeping soups
warm. In the middle of the night Conrad would open his window and
shout, "For heaven's sake give me something for <i>sale
pochard</i>; it's been holding me up for an hour." The writer
called back, "Confounded swilling pig!" across the dead-still,
grass-grown street...</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>Telegrams went back and forth between ancient Winchelsea and the
ancient house of Blackwood in Edinburgh. So ancient was that house
that it was said to send its proofs from London to Edinburgh and
back by horse-messenger. We started the manuscript like that. Our
telegrams would ask what was the latest day, the latest hour, the
latest half-minute that would do if "The End of the Tether" was to
catch the presses. Blackwoods answered, at first Wednesday morning,
then Thursday. Then Friday night would be just possible...At two in
the morning the mare&mdash;another mare by then&mdash;was saddled
by the writer and the stable boy. The stable boy was to ride to the
junction with the manuscript and catch the six in the morning mail
train. The soup kept hot; the writers wrote. By three the writer
had done all that he could in his room. He went across the road to
where Conrad was still at it. Conrad said, "For God's
sake...Another half-hour; just finishing..." At four the writer
looked over Conrad's shoulder. He was writing, "The blow had come,
softened by the spaces of the earth, by the years of absence." The
writer said, "You must finish now." To Ashford junction was
eighteen miles. Conrad muttered, "Just two paragraphs more." He
wrote, "There had been whole days when she had not thought of him
at all&mdash;had no time." The writer said, "You absolutely must
stop!" Conrad wrote on, "But she loved him, she felt that she had
loved him after all," and muttered, "Two paragraphs..." The writer
shouted&mdash;it had come to him as an inspiration&mdash;"In the
name of God, don't you know you can write those two paragraphs into
the proofs when you get them back?..."</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>That was what life was like with us. At our last sitting over
"Romance" we began, at the Pent, at ten in the morning. We worked
solidly till dinner, not lunch time; played two games of chess,
began again at nine and, just as we finished, the dilapidated Hunt
fell back and dropped the kindling-faggot wood wrapped in newspaper
that he was bringing in to light the fire with...As for the last
two paragraphs of "The End of the Tether", they never got written.
Conrad disliked the story as being too sentimental and never wanted
to touch it again. So the close remains, for Conrad, a trifle bald.
It was to have ended with two polyphonic paragraphs in a closing
rhythm&mdash;as it might be: the coming-on of an incommensurable
darkness!</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>And then we had the Jack-ashore touch. It brought into play
Conrad's incomparable business powers. The Insurance Man came to
look at the blistered table and the holes in the carpet, both of
which had belonged to Madox Brown. They were therefore on their
last legs. The Insurance Man, a gloomy sportsman in a long
overcoat, sat on a small chair, gazing at the ruins and leaning his
chin on the crook of his umbrella. "It looks a very <i>old</i>
carpet," he said. "Almost time the moths had it, isn't it?" "But
that's just what makes its value," Conrad said. "My dear faller,
consider the feet that have walked on it." "The table's very old,
too," the Insurance Man said gloomily. "That's why it's so
immensely valuable," Conrad said. "Consider all the people with
great names that have sat round it. It's an historic table. That's
what it is." "I'm afraid," the Insurance Man said, "that we can't
pay for historic associations." "But that's just exactly what you
<i>do</i> have to pay for," Conrad cried. "That before everything.
Consider what you would have to pay if Windsor Castle burned down.
Yet that's most incommodious as a residence. Dreadfully
oldfashioned." The Insurance Man shivered and drove away more
depressed than ever...Eventually the Company repaired the table so
that the top shone as it can never have shone since 1840: they
replaced the carpet and paid quite a substantial sum for the
historic associations.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>What we did with that windfall the writer cannot remember.
Perhaps we hired the amazing vehicle in which we made our first
motor trip: a pink char-à-banc on solid wooden, iron-tyred wheels,
of almost no horse power. It broke down eight times in thirty-six
miles and we pushed it hilariously up the slightest incline. But it
was a good beanfeast. Conrad had hired that machine from the
retired master mariner who, all unconsciously, had sat to him for
"Falk." He was reputed to have become a cannibal after the screw
dropped off his vessel in the Antarctic, drifting helpless for
months. The disappointing thing about that ride was that the
children were in no sort of a way impressed. It was no good
pointing out to them that that carriage ran without horses; they
just accepted that fact along with every other phenomenon and
considered that a carriage with a horse or two was a much more
spirited affair.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>We went in that vehicle through Postling, through Lyminge,
Barham and Elham along the shallow depression that is the Elham
Valley&mdash;past the house, about eight miles from the Pent, in
which he eventually died&mdash;to Canterbury, where he lies buried.
That was a happy day. We put up at the Falstaff Inn where, as they
say, Chaucer stayed with his pilgrims...And the happy thought of
which the writer spoke at the beginning of this chapter is
this...Yesterday a young lady came into his office and said that
she had interviewed Conrad just before&mdash;for a Kansas
paper&mdash;Conrad who had never allowed himself to be interviewed.
He had received her with great charm; had told her many beautiful
things; the writer does not interfere with the charming young
lady's story by here repeating them...But he must have been just
the old Conrad of the old days. And he did not have to say,
<i>Alas! that there comes a day when all the fun of life lies in
the past</i>. For, after lunch he had out his own car and drove the
young lady all over Barham Downs, by Stelling Minnis and Upper and
Lower Hardres&mdash;in the forgotten valleys of "The Inheritors"
opening. From time to time he said, "This is what I like; this is
what I really like in life." And he stopped the car in Postling Gap
that looks over the lands of the Pent, right away over the Stour
Valley that is like the end of a bowl, over the Channel, to France
on a clear day. He said, "This is the view I love best in the
world!" That was his last Wednesday but one and the writer hopes
that he will never speak with any one who saw Conrad later.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>For that is the happy memory to have. He surely could look back
on life, so much of it passing in that country that he loved, and
could say with his dying breath that all his reverses had been
temporary but that his achievements truly had all such permanence
as is vouchsafed to us men...That is to be granted what we Papists
call the cross of the happy death.</p>

<hr><h2><a name="ch6-0"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<p>FOR those not dreading more emotion than the English language
will bear, the writer appends what follows, which was written
immediately after learning of the death of Conrad. It contains
something that is not in the foregoing pages. The writer could not
face its translation. It is reprinted from the <i>Journal
Littéraire</i> of Paris for August 16, 1924.</p>

<p class="cp">§</p>

<p>L'INTELLIGENCE, a dit M. H. G. Wells, consiste dans la faculté
de découvrir des relations entre des analogies éloignées. Ce
pouvoir était le grand don de mon ami...</p>

<p>J'ai écrit "mon ami" et je me mets à réfléchir...Pourquoi
n'avoir pas écrit: "Ce grand maître qui vient de trépasser..." ou
"Ce grand gentilhomme anglais qui suivait la mer...", ce qu'il eût
préféré, lui-même?</p>

<p>Car, né en Pologne, au siècle dernier, il fut d'abord lieutenant
de torpilleur de la marine militaire française&mdash;puis une
espèce de gentilhomme anglais du siècle de la reine Elizabeth, des
Drake, des Grenville&mdash;et des grands poètes, les contemporains
de Shakespeare. Pour comprendre le génie de Conrad, il faut se
souvenir que la civilisation polonaise s'est arrêtée vers la fin du
dix-septième siècle, siècle de ses gloires guerrières et de sa
chute. Et Conrad garda jusqu'à la fin de sa vie la mentalité de ce
siècle de grands gentilshommes qui "suivaient la fortune sur la
mer" et qui étaient des grands poètes.</p>

<p>La plus forte influence qui s'est fait sentir sur la vie de
Conrad&mdash;sur sa vie littéraire, sur ses voyages, sur la façon
dont il affronta sa carrière pénible et glorieuse&mdash;émane des
romans du Capitaine Marryatt. Un grand&mdash;un très grand
romancier-marin anglais. Les livres de Marryatt parlent presque
exclusivement de la guerre des frégates dans la Méditerranée du
temps de Napoléon Ier...Et, au moment de sa mort, Conrad était en
train d'écrire un roman sur ce même sujet.</p>

<p>"Peter Simple", "Percival Keene", "Japhet in Search of a
Father", "Midshipman Easy"...surtout peut-être "Midshipman
Easy"...ce sont les livres qu'il faut lire si l'on veut comprendre
la simple philosophie de l'âme anglaise&mdash;et de l'âme de
Conrad...</p>

<p>Quelle est la profession de foi d'un Anglais du dix-neuvième
siècle? Il pense que dans les questions de marine militaire, il
vaut trois&mdash;que dis-je?&mdash;sept, huit, dix-sept Français;
qu'en mer, il existe seul et règne tandis que les Français restent
à tout jamais ses subordonnés; que les Anglais sont les
représentants du Plus Haut qui tient la mer dans le creux de sa
main; que les Français, soutenus par un diable personnel,
n'existent que pour être chassés de la mer, pour se cacher derrière
les digues de Toulon; que tout Anglais, et surtout l'Anglais qui
"suit la mer" est courageux, hautain, hardi, probe, avisé, blond,
de six pieds de hauteur...Et cette profession de foi simpliste,
Joseph Conrad Kurzeniowski, en a été imbibé à l'âge de huit ans,
dans la Vologda, en lisant ses premiers romans&mdash;les romans du
Capitaine Marryatt qui jouissaient d'une popularité incroyable en
Pologne, de, disons, 1840 à 1870...Et les derniers mots que Conrad
m'a adressés sur cette question furent justement que Conrad restait
du même avis: après Shakespeare, Marryatt était le plus grand
romancier anglais. Je venais de lui rappeler que nos relations
littéraires s'étaient nouées vingt-cinq ans auparavant par
l'expression d'une opinion identique&mdash;même par des mots
identiques...</p>

<p>L'ironique destin a voulu que ses premiers voyages se fissent
sous le pavillon français. Il parlait l'anglais jusqu'à sa mort
d'un bon accent méridional français qui le rendait presque
incompréhensible à tout Anglais qui ne parlait pas au moins un peu
le français: il pensait, il me l'a avoué pour la dernière fois en
mai de cette année, toujours en français. Aujourd'hui il est mort:
le plus grand maître, le plus grand dompteur de ces choses sauvages
que sont les mots, les rythmes, les phrases et les cadences de la
langue anglaise&mdash;le plus grand que nos îles aient vu...</p>

<p>Plutôt petit de taille, les épaules très larges, les bras longs,
la barbe courte et les cheveux très noirs, les dents très blanches,
doué d'une voix profonde, quand son attention était vraiment
éveillée, il insérait un monocle dans l'ceil gauche et vous
regardait de très près...</p>

<p>Il possédait&mdash;pendant les jours de notre pauvreté
commune&mdash;une extraordinaire voiture à quatre roues,
poussiéreuse, en osier noir et une femelle quadrupède, chevaline, à
longues oreilles que tout le monde prenait pour un mulet...Et nous
avons passé des heures, des journées, des nuits entières, balancés,
cahotés, très fiers, dans notre calèche qui roulait entre les haies
vertes et soignées, l'été, grises et en haillons épineux, l'hiver.
Et nous nous demandions sans cesse l'un à l'autre:</p>

<p>"Comment allez-vous 'rendre' en mots ces grands champs de blés
que sillonnent les vents faibles?...Comment, donc, mon vieux
Ford..."</p>

<p>Lundi passé&mdash;c'est bien aujourd'hui dimanche&mdash;je
passais, balancé, cahoté, par le trot saccadé d'un quadrupède
féminin septuagénaire, dans une voiture de louage quelconque,
noire-grise et poussiéreuse...Et nous nous promenions entre les
champs de blés dont les vents faibles sillonnaient les surfaces
roussâtres...Et je me disais: c'est la vraie vérité que je me
disais:</p>

<p>"Eh bien, mon vieux, comment allez vous `rendre,' ces champs de
blés, ces petits clos, ces petites collines vertes et
ondulantes&mdash;de la France?"</p>

<p>Et je continuais à y penser tout en discutant le prix de ce
parcours avec le cocher vieux et sournois; tout en achetant mes
billets; en achetant le Daily Mail que jamais, jamais de ma vie je
n'acheterai plus; et même en lisant les mots: <i>Sudden Death of
Joseph Conrad</i>.</p>

<p>Je m'occupais de la recherche des mots justes qui rendraient ces
champs chuchotants et dorés...Et j'entendis ma voix qui criait: à
ma compagne: "<i>Look...Look</i>...Regardez!" Et j'indiquais le
journal qu'elle tenait et dont je pouvais lire les majuscules
noires...<i>Mort soudaine de Joseph Conrad</i>.</p>

<p>Et, d'un coup, j'ai vu, s'étalant devant les bâtiments de cette
gare de banlieue parisienne&mdash;j'ai vu une nuit de clair de lune
dans une petite ville très ancienne qui domine là-bas la Manche.
C'était sur une vérandah à toit de verre où grimpaient des vignes
fanées...Et, dans les taches d'ombre noires, et les taches k
lumière blanches, il était une heure du matin, et debout, Conrad
parlait...</p>

<p>Il nous racontait comment, sous les palmiers des îles
malaisiennes, assis, les jambes croisées, par terre, il enseigna,
l'usage de la machine à coudre aux petites femmes des rajahs
mussulmans malaisiens...Et, dans les entreponts de son schooner
amarré au quai croulant, se trouvaient des caisses et des caisses
de fusils cachés sous les caisses de machines à coudre...Car les
rajahs des îles malaisiennes n'aiment guère leurs seigneurs
hollandais, et, là-bas la guerre a duré non pas cinq, mais trois
cent cinquante ans.</p>

<p>Et puis je m'entendis, me disant à moi-même:</p>

<p>"C'est le mur du silence éternel qui descend devant vous!"</p>

<p>Que voulez-vous? Je ne deviserai jamais devant des littérateurs
français sur le mot juste...La modestie m'en défend! Et jamais je
ne reverrai Joseph Conrad qui était le dernier Don Quixote de la
Manza du mot juste en Angleterre. Mettez si vous voulez que la
jument fut sa Rossinante, les champs de blés indescriptibles ses
moulins à vent, sa voiture en osier noir le char triomphal de son
apothéose sur l'Ile...et moi-même sûrement son Sancho...Et lui qui
me disait sans cesse:</p>

<p>"Mon cher; c'est, notre métier, un vrai métier de chien...Vous
écrirez, et vous écrirez...Et personne, personne au monde ne
comprendra, ni ce que vous voulez dire, ni ce que vous avez donné
d'effort, de sang, de sueur. Et à la fin vous vous direz: C'est
comme si j'avais ramé toute ma vie dans un bateau, sur un fleuve
immense, dans un brouillard impénétrable...Et vous ramerez et vous
ramerez et jamais, jamais vous ne verrez un poteau sur les rives
invisibles pour vous dire si vous montez le fleuve ou si le courant
vous entraîne...et vous connaîtrez la disette; les nuits froides,
faute de couvertures; les viandes amères, et le sommeil hanté de
regrets. Et vous ne trouverez jamais, jamais pendant toute votre
vie, une âme pour vous dire si à la fin vous êtes le plus grand
génie du monde...Ni non plus si vous êtes le dernier, le plus
infecte descendant de...Ponson du Terrail..."</p>
