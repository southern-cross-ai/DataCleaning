A Village In The Lowlands</b>
</h2>

<p>Do you love the mountains, English reader? the romantic peaks of
the Rhine country, the poetic heights of the Alps, the more gently
undulating slopes of your own South Downs? As for me, I must
confess to an absorbing, a passionate fondness for the lowlands,
the wild, mysterious plains of Hungary, that lie, deep down,
between the Danube and the Theisz, and, whenever I stand on those
vast <i>pusztas</i>, (The <i>pusztas</i> are the vast sandy plains
in the lowlands of Hungary) it always seems to me that the mind
must be more free, when the gaze can wander untrammelled to that
far-distant horizon, which fancy can people at its own sweet
will.</p>

<p>See how far away that horizon seems, there, where earth and sky
meet in a soft-toned line of purple, the merging of the blue sky
with the ruddy, sandy soil of the earth. The air trembles with the
intense heat, and as the eye tries to define what lies beyond that
mysterious vastness, lo! there suddenly rises on the distant
horizon a vision of towers, minarets, and steeples, white and
cool-looking, mirrored in some fairy pond that must lie, somewhere
&mdash; there &mdash; beyond where the eye can reach. Fondly it
rests on the mystic, elusive picture, thrown on the blue canvas by
the fairy hand of the fitful Fata Morgana; entranced, fancy
pictures those towers and minarets, peopled with beings of some
other world, half earthly, half heavenly, who have found birth in
that immeasurable distance, which begins where vision ends.
Blinded, the eye closes for one moment, as a respite from the
golden vision, and lo! when it gazes again, towers and minarets
have disappeared, and, far away, only a few melancholy weeping
willows or a cluster of slender poplars break the even purple line
of the skies. Fondly then, fancy dwells on its dreams, and hardly
now dares to call real that distant, muffled sound, the gallop of a
hundred hoofs, falling on the soft, dry earth. Perhaps it is a
fairy sound, and that herd of wild horses, thundering past, their
manes shaking, their tails lashing, are some fairy beasts belonging
to the ghouls who dwell in Fata Morgana&rsquo;s distant minarets.
Yet the sound is real enough; wildly the horses gallop past,
followed by the <i>csik&oacute;s</i> (herdsman) on his bare-backed
mare, his white lawn shirt flying out like wings, as he passes, and
cracking his lasso, as he drives his herd before him. For a moment
all seems life upon the plain, for to the right and to the left the
wild fowl rise affrighted overhead, and, on the ground,
bright-coloured lizards rush nervously to and fro. Then the gallop
dies away in the distance, the herdsman&rsquo;s whip has ceased to
crack, the birds have gone to rest, and the mind is left wondering
whether this bit of tumultuous life was not another day-dream,
painted, and then erased by fancy.</p>

<p>Silence reigns again: a silence rendered absolute through the
drowsiness of all animal life, in the heat of the noonday sun. To
the right and left, limitless fields of watermelons turn their
huge, emerald-green carcases towards the burning sun; beyond them,
the golden sea of wheat, the waving plumes of maize, tremble and
nod at every passing breeze, whilst, from everywhere, the
sweet-scented rosemary throws a note of cool grey-green on the
glowing colours of the soil. Far, very far away, a windmill
stretches out its long wings, like a gigantic bird of prey, and
right across the plain, the high-road, riddled with ruts, wanders
northwards, towards Kecskem&eacute;t. And that is all! Nothing
more. Only sky, and earth, and vastness&mdash;immeasurable
vastness&mdash;all one&rsquo;s own: to grasp, to understand, to
love!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Midway between the two prosperous provincial towns of
Kecskem&eacute;t and Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, on the very confines of
the great N&aacute;dasdy plain, nestles the tiny village of
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s, with its few thatched cottages,
and its old mediaeval church, cool and grey-looking, in the glare
of the noonday sun. Near it, the presbytery, painted a brilliant
yellow, with vivid emerald-green shutters, and surrounded by a
small garden, where, amidst tall hollyhocks and fragrant
mignonette, on hot summer afternoons, worthy old Pater Ambrosius
wanders in his threadbare, well-worn cassock, telling his beads in
a drowsy voice.</p>

<p>Then, there is the small <i>cs&aacute;rda</i> (wayside inn),
with its thatched roof all on one side, for all the world like a
tipsy peasant&rsquo;s hat, where, in the cool of the evenings,
after the work is done, the herdsmen from the plain meet their
friends from the village and smoke their pipes underneath the
overhanging willow tree, to the tune of a primitive gipsy band with
their sweet-sounding fiddles and droning bag-pipe.</p>

<p>Then, if the innkeeper be not within sight, and his pretty young
wife ready for a bit of flirtation and gossip, the latest
eccentricities of the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t are discussed over a
draught of good red wine.</p>

<p>What the peasantry of the county of Heves gossiped about before
my lord started his craze for machinery and building, must
certainly remain a puzzle; for since the remarkable contrivances of
wood and iron, which reap the corn and bind it into sheaves without
help of human hand, had first been established at Bidesk&uacute;t,
they had remained the one all-absorbing topic of conversation.</p>

<p>The Hungarian peasant of the alf&ouml;ld (lowland) is an
easy-going, lazy, cheerful, and usually good-tempered individual,
well content with the numerous gifts God grants him in this land of
plenty; but, in the matter of my lord&rsquo;s agricultural
innovations, tempers had begun to run high, and, in spite of the
fact that Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, the most popular, as he was
the most wealthy peasant farmer in the county, had refused to
countenance such proceedings, nightly meetings were held at the
inn, wherein universal condemnation was expressed of my lord and
his misdoings.</p>

<p>Vas Berczi, who had once travelled on a railway between
Kecskem&eacute;t and Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, and had arrived home again
safe and sound, and who in consequence, was looked upon as an
oracle, second only to Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s himself, had
brought his rough brown fist with a crash upon the table; and,
having expectorated on the ground with every sign of superstitious
horror, had emphatically declared that it was impossible to grind
corn into flour without touch of miller&rsquo;s hand, unless Satan
himself did the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say, Berczi,&rdquo; said a
young peasant, his bronzed cheek quite pale with terror,
&ldquo;that <i>that</i> is what my lord is going to do inside the
building?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Berczi nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, my children, that I have it from Jank&oacute;
himself, my lord&rsquo;s valet, that, inside that building, which
may God annihilate before it is put to such sacrilegious use, the
corn of Bidesk&uacute;t will all be ground into flour, and never
hand of man touch it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was dead silence for a few moments; even the gipsies
ceased to play: they were staring, horror-struck, at the wise
bearer of these extraordinary tidings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, maybe, Jank&oacute; also told you to what use the
monstrous chimney would be put?&rdquo; hazarded a timid voice at
last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jank&oacute; must be a liar,&rdquo; decided the village
oracle, sententiously, &ldquo;or else a fool. What do you think he
said about that chimney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one could conjecture; they all shook their heads sadly,
filled with awe. Berczi waited, as a true orator should, preparing
for a great effect, then he leaned forward on the rough, wooden
table and signed to those around to come nearer. There were certain
things which could only be mentioned in whispers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jank&oacute; declares that the huge fire, for which that
monstrously tall chimney has been built, is required in order to
set a certain machine &mdash; he called it &mdash; in motion, which
is to grind the corn into flour. Jank&oacute; is a liar!&rdquo; he
repeated, but this time with less emphasis and with an anxious look
around, altogether unworthy of the wisest man in
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s. But all cheeks had become very
pale, and no one dared to formulate the thoughts, which were
running riot in the stolid, superstitious peasant minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it at all,&rdquo; said a young
herdsman at last, as, with a trembling hand, he raised a jug of
wine to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who but the devil can find use for a fire big enough to
fill that tall chimney with smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evil will come, sooner or later, my children!&rdquo;
concluded the village oracle, solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, in the meanwhile,&rdquo; said a swarthy giant, with
great, brown elbows resting on the table, &ldquo;it is a fact that,
while the work in the fields is to be done by Satan and his agency,
our lads are to remain idle and take to drink for want of honest
toil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks uncommonly like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is to become of us? Who will pay us wage? How
are we going to live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t has made a compact with the
devil,&rdquo; thundered the giant. &ldquo;How do we know, that when
our bodies are starved to death, he has not arranged to deliver up
our souls to his friend Satan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hastily the young men crossed themselves, and their eyes, dark
and full of terror, wandered superstitiously round. The quiet
little village street lay peaceful and calm in the gathering shades
of evening. Behind them, through the open door of the inn, could be
heard the voice of the busy hostess, singing some quaint and sweet
ditty, as she busied herself with tidying up the parlour and
kitchen, after the day&rsquo;s work. Overhead the cool, grey-green
weeping willow softly sighed in the gentle summer breeze. Nothing
surely to disturb the happy quietude of these simple peasant minds,
and yet, superstititous terror seemed to lurk in every corner, and
the eyes of none dared wander beyond the village towards the
horizon, where, on ahead, a large building with its tall chimney
could still be seen dimly outlined in the west</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am for asking Pater Ambrosius to say a special Mass to
keep the devil away,&rdquo; suggested a young herdsman at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pater promised me he would bless plenty of holy water
next Sunday; we shall want it in our homes,&rdquo; said Vas Berczi,
with a feeble attempt at consolation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing the devil hates like holy water, I am
told,&rdquo; whispered the giant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might ask Pater Ambrosius to sprinkle the entire
building with holy water,&rdquo; suggested one of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it not be better if the Pater blessed the next
rainfall, so that it should rain holy water down that chimney and
put out the fire the devil has lighted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no rain last St. Swithin&rsquo;s day,&rdquo;
said Berczi, who was of a decidedly pessimistic turn of mind;
&ldquo;we shall get none for at least another ten days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough for the devil to settle down in the village,
and then, not the Archbishop, not the Pope in Rome, himself, can
drive him out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, we are all a set of cowards,&rdquo; said the
swarthy giant, suddenly jumping to his feet and pointing a huge,
muscular fist towards the west. &ldquo;We have allowed my lord to
enter into compact with the devil, we have stood idly by, while
brick upon brick was piled up to construct a palace for Satan. Now,
we are told that on the day after to-morrow, all the devils in hell
will be at work in that mill of Lucifer, that, on the day after
to-morrow, the beautiful corn of Bidesk&uacute;t will be ground
into flour, through no other help but that of a huge fire and a
monstrous chimney, and some contrivance made of iron which I could
not forge on my anvil, though I have done some pretty tough
smith&rsquo;s work in my day: and do you mean to tell me, mates,
that we are going to stand by and look on while the bread is being
taken out of our mouths and our souls delivered over to the enemy
of man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&mdash;Well spoken, S&aacute;ndor the
smith!&mdash;We will not stand it!&rdquo; was the universal chorus
of approbation, whilst Berczi, who did not approve of any
one&rsquo;s talk save his own, shrugged his shoulders in contempt.
&ldquo;We should be cowards if we put up with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant&rsquo;s peroration had helped to rouse the sinking
spirits. There was a general cry to the gipsies to strike up, and
the <i>czig&aacute;ny</i> (gipsy), seeing the more lively temper of
the company, attacked with renewed vigour an inspiriting Magyar
tune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Lotti! more wine! quick!&rdquo; shouted one or two
of the older men, while the others filled fresh pipes preparatory
to listening more attentively to S&aacute;ndor the smith&rsquo;s
vigorous diction.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, out came the pretty hostess, with two or
three bottles and jugs in her plump hands, and showing a row of
snow-white teeth in a merry smile.</p>

<p>She was wonderfully agile in avoiding the venturesome arms
stretched out to catch her slim waist, and as soon as she had put
jugs and bottles down, she administered one or two vigorous
corrections on the cheeks of the more foolhardy of her
admirers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you all making such a noise about all of a
sudden?&rdquo; she said, with a toss of her tiny dark head.
&ldquo;I thought you were up to some mischief, you were so quiet
just now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great things are happening, Lotti, my soul,&rdquo; said
the smith, with the importance befitting his newly-found
popularity. &ldquo;We have important things to discuss which are
not fit for women&rsquo;s ears to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lotti looked at him while fun sparkled out of her bright, dark
eyes; she shrugged her plump shoulders and said with a merry
laugh:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! dear me, S&aacute;ndor! how big we talk, now
that Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s (In Hungarian the surname always
precedes the Christian name.) does not happen to be here. I know
what you are all concocting though I pretend I do not hear. You
know Andr&aacute;s won&rsquo;t allow you to say disrespectful
things about my lord, or to brew mischief against him, and so you
wait till you know he is well out of sight, and hatch all sorts of
wickedness behind his back. But, I tell you, he is not so far as
you all think. He will catch you at your tricks never fear, and
then&mdash;you know he has a devil of a temper all his
own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have a devil of a temper too, my pretty
Lotti,&rdquo; retorted the giant laughing, &ldquo;and you are very
venturesome to have roused the anger of S&aacute;ndor the smith. Do
you think we are so many children, afraid of Andr&aacute;s as of a
schoolmaster? You shall kiss me for that piece of impudence, Lotti;
ay! you shall kiss me three times, which will make your lord and
master so jealous that he will break his new stick across your
plump shoulders. And then, who will be frightened? Eh, my pretty
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with true Hungarian light-heartedness, the swarthy giant,
forgetting the devil and his works, the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t and
his steam-mills, proceeded with a merry laugh to chase the pretty
woman round the table; while the young herdsmen, delighted with the
scene&mdash;which was much more in accordance with their lazy,
sunny dispositions than talks of devil or plots against my
lord&mdash;took part, some for the smith, some for Lotti, by
placing an obstructive arm either in her way or in that of her
pursuer, while the bronzed musicians played a merry
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s (the national Hungarian dance) and the
village echoed with gaiety and noise.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2<br>
A Popular Favourite</b>
</h2>

<p>Hot, panting, and excited, the pretty hostess ran round and
round the table under the willow tree, closely pressed by
S&aacute;ndor the smith, who, however, had previously drunk a
little too much of the good wine for which the county of Heves is
famous, to be steady enough on his legs for a successful
pursuit.</p>

<p>She had paused on one side of the table, holding both her hands
against her heart, which was beating very hard, with the madcap
race and the laughter. S&aacute;ndor the smith had paused on the
opposite side, both antagonists eyeing one another ready for a
spring; the young peasants were laying wagers for or against the
combatants, and encouraging both to resume the fight, when suddenly
&mdash; without any warning &mdash; two strong arms closed round
pretty Lotti&rsquo;s waist, from behind, and two loud kisses were
imprinted on both her dimpled cheeks, while a laughing voice
shouted across to the giant:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went to work the wrong way, my friend S&aacute;ndor.
This is the way to do it, is it not, Lotti?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while she struggled, the new-comer succeeded in stealing one
or two more kisses from the pretty woman, then he lifted her bodily
off her feet, and carried her to her own door, and having placed
her in safety within the parlour he shut the door, and turned with
a merry laugh towards the smith, who had borne his discomfiture
with a good-humoured growl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a bottle of wine with me, S&aacute;ndor, to
compensate you for that lost kiss. Lotti, my pigeon,&rdquo; he
shouted, rapping at the door, &ldquo;as soon as your little heart
has ceased to beat quite so fast, bring out some more wine, enough
to go round. And you, <i>czig&aacute;ny</i>, let us have the
liveliest tune you can play, while we all drink to good fellowship,
to pretty women, and to our beloved Magyar country, which may God
bless and protect!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no resisting the young peasant&rsquo;s cheerful voice
and contagious laugh. Very soon Lotti reappeared, pouting but tidy,
with half a dozen fresh bottles which she placed on the table,
taking care to give her burly antagonist a wide berth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so very angry with S&aacute;ndor, Lotti?&rdquo;
asked the new-comer, with a smile; &ldquo;why, he only wanted to
kiss you, and surely you have allowed him to do that, before now,
without so much fuss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and said with quite a touch of malice
in her voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask him, Andr&aacute;s, why it was we quarrelled; why he
wanted to kiss me, and why I would not let him; and see if he will
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she ran back to the house, but before finally closing the
door, she turned again and added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was because they were talking a lot of nonsense about
my lord and the mill, and I would not let them, for I knew they
would not have done it if you had been there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with this parting shot the triumphant little person slammed
the door of her parlour to, and very soon her high-pitched voice
was heard singing an accompaniment to the gipsies&rsquo; primitive
instruments.</p>

<p>Outside, beneath the overhanging willow tree, there had been
silence after the young hostess&rsquo;s malicious little speech.
The young herdsmen and peasants, like so many chidden children, had
left their wine untasted and were staring before them, silent and
shamefaced, while the burly giant, and even Berczi the oracle,
smoked away at their pipes, while stealing furtive glances at the
new-comer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! and what is it all about?&rdquo; asked the latter,
looking round at the men with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That infernal steam-mill again, I suppose?&rdquo; he
added with a sigh.</p>

<p>Again there was no reply, but presently there came a grunt from
old Berczi:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know that it was going to be started on its
godless work on the day after to-morrow, Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose that from the day after to-morrow we can
all lie down and starve, for there will be no more work for honest
hands to do, when Satan turns on his fire and his smoke, and sows,
reaps, binds, and grinds God&rsquo;s corn on God&rsquo;s
earth,&rdquo; added the village oracle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what I was saying when that little cat interrupted
me,&rdquo; said S&aacute;ndor the smith, &ldquo;was
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But very quietly Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s rough brown hand was
placed on the giant&rsquo;s arm, and his cheery voice interrupted
calmly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you were saying, S&aacute;ndor, and what all the
others agreed with at once, because they knew it was quite true,
was that it did not matter what the devil and my lord did over
there at Bidesk&uacute;t, for there was always Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s at Kisfalu, who would find work for all willing
hands, and whose purse is long enough to prevent any one for
leagues around to want for anything, let alone to
starve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was dead silence, while the look of shame deepened
on the faces of all. The gipsies were playing a tender, appealing
tune, a Hungarian folk-song that would soften the heart of any
hearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a good sort, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said the
village oracle, while S&aacute;ndor the smith drank a mugful of
wine to get rid of an uncomfortable lump in his throat,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no &lsquo;but&rsquo; my mates. We must stand by
one another, and, believe me, that is all nonsense about the devil
turning the machinery. I can&rsquo;t explain it all to you, but
Pater Ambrosius has promised me this evening, that to-morrow,
instead of a sermon, he will make it quite clear to you, what it is
that will grind the corn in my lord&rsquo;s new mill. Then you will
understand all about it, just as I think I understand it, and, till
then, I want you all to try and forget that accursed mill, or at
any rate not to brood over it. It is getting late and I have a long
ride home, but will you all promise me that, until to-morrow after
Mass you will try not to think about the mill? And this is to all
of you and your very good healths,&rdquo; he added, raising his mug
of wine. &ldquo;Have I your promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We promise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer was unanimous. Evidently the rich young peasant was
popular; his words had carried weight. The mugs of wine were
emptied, and a sigh of relief and satisfaction escaped the lips of
all. The gipsies started a livelier tune, as Andr&aacute;s uttered
a soft call:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Csillag, my beauty, where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the sound of hoofs on the dry, sandy earth, and a
lovely black mare, sleek and graceful, emerged from out the
darkness, and coming quite close to the table where the peasants
were drinking, found her way to her master&rsquo;s side, and there
waited quietly for him. She carried neither saddle, stirrup, nor
bridle, but the peasants on the Hungarian pusztas need no such
accessories. Their horses seem almost a part of themselves, as they
ride at breakneck speed across the sandy plains.</p>

<p>In a moment, Andr&aacute;s was astride across his mare, and with
a shout of &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; to his friends, a responsive
&ldquo;&Eacute;ljen!&rdquo; (Long live!) from them, he had galloped
away into the darkness.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter

Pride Of Race</b>
</h2>

<p>All was astir in the castle, in the stables, the farmyard, the
park and garden of Bidesk&uacute;t. The innumerable grooms,
coachmen, cooks, and maids rushed hither and thither, like so many
chickens let loose, busy, each with his or her own work, hot,
panting, and excited. The Countess, herself, accustomed as she was
to the boundless hospitality of a Hungarian nobleman, could not
quite shake off the electrical wave of excitement which pervaded
the whole house. The festivals in honour of her birthday, coupled
with those for the opening of the new steam-mill, were in full
preparation. To-day, still, the big house was fairly free from
guests; but to-morrow, probably, the stream of arrivals would
commence, and would continue throughout the day.</p>

<p>As to the numbers of the invaders it was wholly problematical:
it was generally known throughout the county that the 28th of
August was Countess Irma&rsquo;s birthday, that Bidesk&uacute;t
itself had some sixty guest chambers, and that any Hungarian noble,
far or near, with all his family, was sure, during the few
days&rsquo; gaiety by which the occasion was annually celebrated,
to find the warmest welcome, the most lavish hospitality, the
richest and choicest of wines, in the time-honoured traditions of
the Hungarian lowland.</p>

<p>Therefore Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri,and the Countess Irma, his
wife, were at this season of the year always prepared to receive a
number of guests; oxen, sheep, and lambs were indiscriminately
slaughtered, also geese, ducks, poultry of every kind; the whitest
of bread baked, the oldest casks of wine tapped, the finest cloths,
sheets, and napkins aired, all ready for the probable hundred
guests, their children, their coachmen and valets, their couriers,
and their maids.</p>

<p>In one of the old-fashioned, lofty rooms of the ancestral home
of Bidesk&uacute;t, the lord thereof and his aristocratic wife sat
discussing the final arrangements for the entertainment of all the
expected and unexpected guests. Fine old oak and mahogany chairs
and tables, turned and carved by the skilful hands of a village
carpenter, furnished the room, whilst curtains of thick unbleached
linen, embroidered in exquisite designs of many colours, hung
before the small leaded windows, and tempered the glare of the
midday sun.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri, jovial and good-tempered, was smoking
his favourite pipe, while Countess Irma was telling off, on her
slender fingers, the row of guests she was expecting on the
morrow:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Egregyis are sure to come,&rdquo; she said,
meditatively, the Kant&aacute;ssys, the V&eacute;cserys, the
Palotays, the Arany, the Miskolczys, and the Bart&oacute;cz: these
are all quite certain. You cannot reckon less than four servants to
each, and with their children and any friends they may bring with
them, will make no less than seventy that we are quite sure of.
Then another forty or fifty always come, beyond those one expects.
You remember last year we sat down one hundred and seventy to
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined my lord, &ldquo;you give
what orders you like, and kill whatever you wish eaten. Thank God
there is plenty of food in Bidesk&uacute;t to feed every friend and
his family for as long as they choose to take a bite with us. If
there is not enough room to give them each a separate bed, then we
can lay straw all round the riding school, and the younger men can
sleep there, and leave the good rooms for the ladies and children.
Kill, my dear, by all means; let Panna slaughter what poultry she
will, pull up what cabbages and carrots she wants, there is plenty
and to spare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bidesk&uacute;ty, proud and secure in his fat lands, which
yielded him all that could enable him to exercise the lavish
hospitality for which his country is famous, leaned back in his
arm-chair, and puffed away contentedly at his long cherry-wood
pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could have got Ilonka a new silk dress for the
occasion,&rdquo; said Countess Irma, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; laughed her lord, jovially, &ldquo;Ilonka
will look bewitching in that bit of muslin I bought from the Jew
for her for a couple of florins, and you know quite well that
greasy bank-notes and other portraits of our well-beloved majesty,
Francis Joseph, are very scarce in this land of ours. And I say
thank God for that! We never want for anything we cannot have.
Why,&rdquo; he added with a pleasurable chuckle, &ldquo;if it were
not for my mill and my machinery I should never wish to see a
bank-note from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you will go on spending it on that accursed
steam-mill and those reaping machines, which the peasants fear and
hate, and I must say I do not blame them for that. God never had
anything to do with those things. They are the devil&rsquo;s own
invention, Gyuri, and I cannot help dreading that some trouble will
come of it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! you talk like some of those superstitious peasants
themselves. You women cannot understand the enormous boon and
profit it will be to me and to my land, when my steam-mill is
regularly at work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The profit may or may not come by and by; I dare say I do
not understand these things, but I do see that you cannot possibly
go on spending money with both hands on those inventions of
Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty did not reply. He had found by long experience
that it was always best to oppose silence to his wife&rsquo;s
voluble talk whenever the subject of his favourite and costly fad
cropped up between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri,&rdquo; resumed Countess Irma, &ldquo;it is not too
late. Will you give up this folly, and not mar the jolly times we
always have on my birthday, by starting that mill on its ungodly
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied her lord, driven out of his
stronghold of silence by this direct question, &ldquo;you are
supposed to be an intelligent woman; therefore, you do not imagine
that I have spent close upon a million florins in building a mill,
and do not mean to see it at work now that it is
finished?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have only gone on with the thing from a feeling of
obstinacy, Gyuri; it is not too late to give in. There is not a
soul who has not dissuaded you from continuing these terrible
new-fangled notions, which have already made you hideously
unpopular on your own estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more her lord had entrenched himself behind a barrier of
impenetrable silence. Dreamily he went on smoking his long-stemmed
cherry-wood pipe, and allowed the flood of his wife&rsquo;s
eloquence to spend itself over his unresisting head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri,&rdquo; continued the Countess, &ldquo;I have
noticed that you have received lately a great many visits from the
Jews. When we were first married, never one of them darkened our
doors. You know I hate all your machinery fads, so you tell me
nothing of what you are doing with them, but no Jew would come
here, unless there was something to buy or sell, or money to lend
at usury. You will indeed bring shame upon us, if you begin to sell
your lands, your corn, or your wine, just like any Jew tradesman.
There is plenty and to spare, I know, you have said it yourself,
but the corn does not grow upon a Hungarian nobleman&rsquo;s estate
that he should dirty his fingers by taking money for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; suggested the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t
mildly, &ldquo;when I took over this property, after my
father&rsquo;s death, I found over thirty thousand measures of
wheat rotting away, without the slightest use being made of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why not? why should it not
rot? If there is too much of it, even to give away? In my
father&rsquo;s house in one year three thousand measures of wheat
went bad, and he would have allowed fifty thousand to go the same
way sooner than sell it. Take money for it? . . . Horrible!&rdquo;
she added, with all the pride of her long line of ancestry.</p>

<p>Again her husband did not reply; perhaps he thought of the fact
that neither his wife nor any of her sisters would probably have
had a roof over their heads at this moment if they had not been
married; for not only the corn, but the fields, the beasts, the
farms, and even the ancestral home had long since passed into the
hands of the Jews; their father had not sullied his fingers by
trafficking with his corn and timber, but had mortgaged his land,
his house, his all, up to the hilt, and left his children proud as
Lucifer, but without a groat apiece.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma was still a very handsome woman, in spite of
her forty-odd years. Her figure was shapely, her skin still fresh,
her hair as black as the raven&rsquo;s wing. She had been a great
beauty in her day, and had been the acknowledged belle of the two
carnivals she spent at Budapesth. Her mother had brought her up in
the firmly-rooted principle that it is the duty of every Hungarian
aristocratic girl to be beautiful, and to make a good marriage, and
the young Countess Irma, when she reached the age of eighteen, was
quite ready to do both. The first year of her going out she picked
and chose carefully amongst her adorers, for she had many. High
lineage and vast estates were an absolute <i>sine qua non</i>
before any partner dared even to ask her to dance the cotillon.
&ldquo;Humanity begins with the Barons,&rdquo; was her
much-repeated statement, which virtually choked off any aspirant to
her hand who was not thus elevated in the human scale. But alas!
the first year went by, and Countess Irma had not found the proper
<i>parti</i> that would suit her own and her mother&rsquo;s pride,
and the following year it was vaguely whispered in the aristocratic
club of Budapesth that she had not been heard to make her sweeping
statement on the subject of humanity once during the carnival.</p>

<p>The next carnival came and went, and Countess Irma, to her
horror, noted that at two balls of the season she was obliged to
have a headache before the cotillion, for she had not secured a
partner. Things were beginning to look absolutely tragic when
suddenly Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri appeared upon the scene. He was
young, good-looking, owned half the county of Heves, and professed
to be violently in love with the somewhat faded beauty; true, he
was not a Baron, and therefore a couple of years ago might have
been ranked on a level with the Countess&rsquo;s lapdog and pet
canary; but since then much water had flowed down the Danube and
the world was becoming more radical throughout. Bidesk&uacute;ty
paid his court, was duly accepted, and the Countess Irma was heard,
at the great Casino ball, to remark that humanity embraced every
Hungarian noble who owned half of any county.</p>

<p>They had led a very comfortable married life together, Gyuri
being always willing to give way to his wife in all matters;
fortunately her tastes were very similar to his in all but one
respect; like him, she loved the almost regal life of a Hungarian
nobleman upon his estates, and, like him, once married, she cared
nothing for Budapesth, where money was necessary, of which they had
very little, and where she would perforce have to eat the meat of
other people&rsquo;s oxen and calves, and vegetables grown in some
alien garden; like him, she was absolutely indifferent as to the
political aspect of the country; she loved it because it was her
own country and therefore must be better than anybody else&rsquo;s,
and because better corn and wine grew there, fatter beasts were fed
there, than in any other country in the world; but, as to the
changes of ministry up there in Budapesth, as to parliaments,
elections, union with Austria, or complete severance, neither she
nor her lord cared anything about that; so long as her daughter
Ilonka, in her turn, made a suitable marriage, and her husband did
not get into the Jews&rsquo; hands through his unfortunate fondness
for agricultural improvements, she would just as soon have seen
Hungary in the hands of Russians, Hottentots, or even Germans.
Serenely she would have sailed through life, satisfied that all was
for the best in this best possible world, if alas! the crumpled
roseleaf had not troubled her, in the shape of her husband&rsquo;s
unfortunate craze for machinery, which reeked of
&ldquo;bourgeoisism,&rdquo; and was altogether unworthy of a
Hungarian nobleman, whose duty it was to eat and drink, to live in
a lordly manner, to entertain his friends, and to leave all other
matters to people who had no ancestors, and formed therefore no
integral part of humanity.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter

The Money-Lender</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenstein the Jew is downstairs, my lord,&rdquo;
announced Jank&oacute;, Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s valet,
respectfully opening the door; &ldquo;he says your lordship has bid
him come this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Countess Irma made no comment; before a servant, even the most
trusted, she never gainsaid or argued with the head of the house,
but invariably set the example herself of complete respect and
deference. Nothing could be gained now by commenting on the arrival
of Rosenstein, whose shuffling steps she could already hear in the
passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! my dear,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty, a little
nervously, &ldquo;perhaps you had better have another interview
with Panna, while I speak with Rosenstein, and, remember, you have
my permission to kill everything on the farm you want, and to order
whatever you like, so long as you see that there is plenty to eat,
and we bring no shame on the hospitality of Bidesk&uacute;t. Tell
the Jew to come in,&rdquo; he added, turning to his valet,
&ldquo;and mind he wipes his dirty shoes before he walks across the
hall.&rdquo; The next moment the Jew, with doubled spine and
obsequious bow, entered humbly into the room. As the Countess
sailed majestically past him, he tried to stoop still lower, and to
kiss the hem of her gown, but gathering her skirts closely round
her, and without vouchsafing him the merest look, she left her
husband alone with him.</p>

<p>Rosenstein&rsquo;s age could not be easily guessed at, not even
approximately; his scanty hair, of a dull carroty colour, hung from
beneath a faded skull-cap, in two locks on each side of his face.
His long gaberdine, buttoned all the way down the front, hung
loosely on his spare frame, and was worn almost threadbare on the
sharp, protruding blades of his shoulders. He rubbed his thin,
claw-like hands incessantly together, and his watery blue eyes were
fixed on the floor, all the time the noble lord deigned to converse
with him. Only from time to time, when he thought himself
unobserved, he threw a sharp, malignant look at the Hungarian, then
his thin lips almost disappeared between his teeth, and there was
that in his colourless eyes which would have taught a shrewd man to
beware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you brought me the money?&rdquo; asked
Bidesk&uacute;ty, peremptorily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my lord, it is this way: your lordship
knows that I am a poor man, and cannot possibly find so great a sum
myself, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the usual lie,&rdquo; interrupted
Bidesk&uacute;ty, laughing. &ldquo;Never mind telling me about the
obliging friend who is willing to come to the rescue, at the cost
of exorbitant interest, for which you will have to promise my best
bit of land as security. Tell me quickly if you will take
Z&aacute;rda as security for the two hundred and fifty thousand
florins, and what interest you will want for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Z&aacute;rda is very poor security, noble lord, for a
quarter of a million. There is no house, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! the devil take these Jews,&rdquo; thundered
Bidesk&uacute;ty, &ldquo;they have lived in mud huts all their
lives, their ancestors were vermin in the gutter, and now they want
a house to live in. Z&aacute;rda will never get into your dirty
hands, never fear; I will redeem it, and all my lands, as soon as
my mill is at work, and my flour becomes famed throughout the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship speaks words of wisdom,&rdquo; said the
wily Jew, throwing surreptitiously a sarcastic glance at
Bidesk&uacute;ty, &ldquo;the steam-mill is a grand speculation, for
it will lessen labour, and therefore improve the condition of your
peasantry. That is the reason why my friends are not averse to
letting me have the money, which I am most desirous of lending to
your lordship for so noble a purpose on the not very good security
of Z&aacute;rda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your confounded tongue about Z&aacute;rda; it will
be ample honour for you in exchange for your cursed money, if ever
your dirty foot even treads its soil. What about the
interest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein had bitten his lips hard while Bidesk&uacute;ty
poured out this flood of abusive language. He and his race,
patient, tenacious, thick-skinned, are used to this accompaniment
to the ever-increasing monetary transactions they have with the
extravagant, proud Hungarian nobility. They take it as part of the
contract, and charge interest accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lord,&rdquo; he said mildly, &ldquo;I was forced
to accept my friends&rsquo; conditions as regards the interest; I
am a poor man myself, and after I have paid them but little will
remain for me on which to live: fortunately I have simple tastes,
and one hundred measures of wheat out of the fifty thousand they
will require a year will be quite enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand measures of wheat? You scoundrel!
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not I, noble lord, I protest, it is my friends:
they say the price of wheat will be lower than ever this year; that
is why the hundred head of cattle, in addition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred head of cattle, besides? You low dog,
villainous usurer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of which I shall only get one ox and one calf for myself,
my lord; and how is a poor man to live? My friends will not let me
have the money without they have ninety-eight head of cattle, and
the wheat, not to speak of the five hundred head of sheep, and the
eight hundred poultry, of which they will only allow me twenty-five
for myself for arranging this very difficult matter for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You infernal scoundrel, if you do not hold your tongue I
will call Jank&oacute; in to give you such a beating as you never
had in your life. Ten thousand measures of wheat, forty oxen,
twenty calves, three hundred sheep, and five hundred poultry I will
give you, but not a grain of corn, or tail of lamb
beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew&rsquo;s eyes twinkled beneath their thin purple lids,
but he kept them steadily fixed on the floor, as he shook his head
doubtfully and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to my friends very clearly on the subject,
I have told your lordship their final word as to the interest; they
will not go back on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I tell you, man, that I will not pay such usury, and
if you dare stand there, and demand it, I will have you beaten by
the servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I much regret, my lord,&rdquo; said Rosenstein,
humbly, &ldquo;that we shall not be doing business
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, you cursed, dirty Jew, may the devil get into that
wooden head of thine! I tell you I must have that money at once.
The wages of the Budapesth engineers and workpeople are in arrears,
and I still owe part of the money for the machinery, the devil take
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your lordship wishes, I will speak to my friends
again, but I have little hope that they will give in about the
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, stop those lies! you know I do not
believe in them; I will give you ten thousand measures of
wheat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty thousand, my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty, I say. Sixty head of cattle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hundred, my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighty; and may the devil give them the plague as soon as
your dirty hands have touched them. Four hundred
sheep&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five hundred&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said twenty thousand measures of wheat, eighty head of
cattle, four hundred sheep, and five hundred fowls; and may I join
you and your lot down in hell if I give you anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, most noble lord, I must assure you that unless my
friends get fifty thousand measures of wheat, one hundred head of
cattle, five hundred sheep, and eight hundred fowls, they will not
advance the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was decidedly exasperating. Bidesk&uacute;ty was badly in
want of the money, and the cursed Jew was obstinate; it looked very
much as if the nobleman would have to give way to the usurer. A
disgraceful thing, surely, absolutely unheard of in past
generations, when these wretches were only too happy to lend their
money to the noble Barons who required it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, you scoundrel,&rdquo; decided Bidesk&uacute;ty
at last, &ldquo;I have told you my final word with regard to that
interest. Take what I offered and go in peace. But if you persist
in demanding your usurious percentage, since I must have the money,
I will pay it, but then I will hand you over to the lacqueys for a
sound beating before you leave this house. Now choose which you
will have, will you take twenty thousand measures of wheat, eighty
head of cattle, four hundred sheep, and five hundred fowl, or
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take fifty thousand measures of wheat, your
lordship,&rdquo; repeated the Jew quietly, &ldquo;one hundred head
of cattle, five hundred sheep, and eight hundred
fowls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the beating, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew paused a while, and looked up one instant at the
aristocratic figure before him. Tall and powerful, with
proud-looking eyes and noble bearing, Bidesk&uacute;ty stood as the
very personification of the race which for centuries had buffeted,
tormented, oppressed the Jews, denying them every human right,
treating them worse than any dog or gipsy. Was the worm turning at
the latter half of the nineteenth century? Would the oppressed,
armed with their patiently amassed wealth, turn on the squandering,
improvident oppressor, secure in the gold, which very soon would
rule even this fair Arcadia, the Hungarian lowlands?</p>

<p>Dreamily the Jew rubbed the threadbare patch across his
shoulders, which plainly testified that he was not new to these
encounters with irate noblemen and their lacqueys; then he assented
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the beating, most noble lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty laughed heartily. All his wrath had vanished.
Since he could have the treat of seeing the Jew well flogged, he
thought he had not paid too high a price for his pleasure.
Rosenstein unbuttoned his threadbare garment, and taking out two
large sheets of paper from an inner pocket, spread them out upon
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil is that?&rdquo; asked
Bidesk&uacute;ty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will your honour be so kind as to sign? It is merely an
acknowledgment of the debt, and a guarantee that the interest will
be paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had become purple with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You confounded dog, and is not the word of a Hungarian
nobleman enough? What can your greasy bits of paper compel me to
do, if my own word of honour does not bind me to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, my lord,&rdquo; said the Jew, with the requisite
amount of softness that turneth away wrath, &ldquo;it is not for
myself. My friends will require some guarantee from me. They are
not used to dealing with honourable lords like yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew had said this with a slightly sarcastic intonation,
whilst his mild blue eyes rested maliciously on Bidesk&uacute;ty,
who, however, noted neither the tone nor the look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall be made to eat a piece of pork for this
confounded impudence,&rdquo; he said, as he pulled savagely the
papers towards him.</p>

<p>He did not take the trouble to read over the documents; such a
proceeding, as suggesting knowledge of business matters, would have
been wholly unworthy of so noble a descendant of the
Bidesk&uacute;tys who helped to place King M&aacute;ty&aacute;s on
the throne. In large, somewhat shaky schoolboy hand, he traced his
name at the bottom of both the pages without further protest. He
had caught sight of a well-filled, very greasy pocketbook, which
bulged out of Rosenstein&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the money,&rdquo; he said, throwing down the pen,
&ldquo;and after that for the pleasure of seeing my men give you
the soundest hiding you ever had in your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew read both documents over carefully, threw the sifted
sand over the august signature, then deliberately folded them up
and placed them in his pocket. Bidesk&uacute;ty was getting
impatient, jerkily he puffed away at his cherry-wood pipe, whilst
his eyes travelled longingly towards the panoply of sticks and
riding-whips which adorned his wall. Evidently he thought that they
would lose nothing by waiting, for he did not speak, till one by
one Rosenstein counted out two hundred and fifty notes of one
thousand florins each, which passed from his own greasy fingers
into the noble lord&rsquo;s aristocratic palms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any time,&rdquo; added the Jew, &ldquo;that your
lordship will require my services, I shall be most pleased to
intercede with my rich friends, who, I feel sure, will, on my
recommendation, always oblige your lordship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t was not listening; he had thrust
the bank-notes into his pocket, and, opening the door, shouted
loudly for Jank&oacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this cursed Jew,&rdquo; he said jovially,
&ldquo;down to the kitchen, and see if he will sooner eat a bit of
pork, or take a hiding from some of you. Stay!&rdquo; he added,
seeing that Jank&oacute;, a sturdy peasant, had already seized the
Jew by the collar, &ldquo;I want to see the fun. Come along, old
chap, you know you made your choice; perhaps you will find that
extra bit of interest well worth half an hour&rsquo;s trouble. And
if they happen to kill you, the whole of your tribe can share
between them the fifty thousand measures of wheat, and the rest of
the confounded stuff. Now then, Jank&oacute;, you can try that new
riding-whip of yours on him. Come along, I am in a
hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein had become livid. Perhaps at heart he never quite
believed that Bidesk&uacute;ty meant to put his threat in
execution, but now there seemed no doubt about it, for
Jank&oacute;, with a vigorous kick directed against his lean
shanks, had already persuaded him to follow his tormentor
down-stairs.</p>

<p>Noisy talk and boisterous laughter proceeded from the kitchen,
where a number of cooks in white caps and aprons, assisted by an
army of kitchen-maids and scullions, were busy preparing meat,
bread, cakes, and what not for the coming festivities. Silence fell
all round as the master entered, laughing joyously and followed by
sturdy Jank&oacute; pushing the thin, trembling figure of the Jew
before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Panna! Mariska! Zsuzsi! all of you. Bring a chair
and table here, for I have brought you a guest, an honoured guest,
whom you must treat with respect. You must give him the choicest
piece off that pig we killed yesterday. Ha! ha!&rdquo; he chuckled,
looking round at Rosenstein, who, helpless under
Jank&oacute;&rsquo;s grip, was looking savagely round him, like a
fox caught in a trap, and throwing deadly looks of hatred at the
noble lord before him. The merry peasant girls had caught the
spirit of the fun; Panna, Zsuzsi, Mariska, the bright-eyed village
beauties, had already bustled round the big centre table. They had
spread a clean white cloth, brought out plate, knife, and fork, and
set a chair before it.</p>

<p>With much laughter and cries of delight, two powerful peasant
lads had lifted the struggling Jew off his feet and seated him
forcibly in the chair, while they wound some rope round him and
secured him firmly to his seat. This was rare fun;
Bidesk&uacute;ty, astride on a chair, was giving laughing
directions to his servants, while the girls from every part of the
house came running in, their bright-coloured petticoats swinging
round their shapely limbs, their arms bare, their faces aglow with
excitement, and stood in the doorways, convulsed with delight at
seeing a Jew made to eat a bit of pork. Suddenly a great ripple of
laughter greeted the arrival of Benko, the portly chief cook, in
snow-white jacket, trousers, and cap, with an immense apron across
his burly front, and carrying high up in triumph, a gigantic leg of
pork, roasted to a turn, the crackling still spluttering, brown and
delicious-looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty,
whilst the girls clapped their hands with delight, and Jank&oacute;
officiously took a large napkin and tied it under the Jew&rsquo;s
chin. He could scarcely do it for very laughter, tears were
streaming down his cheeks, and he had to stop every now and then in
order to hold his aching sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, old fellow, I&rsquo;ll warrant you have never
had so good a feast in all your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein certainly did not look as if he enjoyed the fun,
which made it all the more amusing. His face was absolutely
ghastly, his eyes rolled round and round, more in rage than in
fear. He could not move, for he was tightly pinioned to the chair,
and each of his hands, which had been made to grip a knife and
fork, was firmly held by the steel-like grasp of a young herdsman.
But the looks which he threw at his chief tormentor were so full of
deadly hatred that perhaps had the noble lord stopped to note them,
he would have paused, awed at the infinite depths of human passion
that lay behind those mild, colourless, watery eyes.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Benko had carved two magnificent slices of
meat, and with much laughter, the two men were gradually forcing
the Jew to put one piece after another into his mouth. He tried to
struggle, but in vain; his tormentors had a very tight hold of him,
and when he made futile efforts not to swallow the morsels
forbidden by the laws of his race, they held his mouth and nose in
a tight grip, so that he was forced to swallow, lest he should
choke.</p>

<p>There never had been such laughter in the kitchen of
Bidesk&uacute;t; merry peals rang right through the house, so that
the Countess and Mademoiselle Ilonka sent to know what the fun was.
All the servants had crowded in, and for a quarter of an hour all
the coming festivities were forgotten, the bread left in the oven,
the huge roast on the spits, in the joy of seeing a Jew swallow two
slices of pork. Rosenstein, after the first few struggles for
liberty, had resigned himself to his fate, further persuaded into
submission by the ominous cracking of the herdsmen&rsquo;s whips in
the scullery beyond. Bidesk&uacute;ty had laughed till he cried.
Certainly he had ceased to regret those last measures of corn, and
extra head of cattle and sheep, which were to pay the exorbitant
interest on the Jew&rsquo;s money, since they had procured him the
best fun he had had for many a day.</p>

<p>At last it was decided that the Jew had eaten as much as he
conveniently could; moreover, there really was no time for any more
merriment that day, if full justice was to be done to the plenteous
hospitality of Bidesk&uacute;t. The noble lord gave the signal, and
the Jew was released from his bonds; trembling with rage, he tried
to make his way out of the kitchen, through the laughing groups of
pretty maids, who, with mock gravity, dropped him ironical
curtsies, to speed the parting guest.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty evidently thought that the Jew had paid
sufficiently for his outrageous demands, for Rosenstein was spared
the promised beating; one or two cracks across his lean shanks,
from the long whips of the young herdsmen, was all he had to
endure. He did not stop to rub the sore places, nor did he cast
another look at his tormentors. With all the speed his shuffling
feet would allow, he hurried out of the lordly abode of his debtor;
his lips tightly compressed, his fingers nervously clutched
together, he crossed the hall, the park, and the acacia plantation.
Outside the gates he stopped, and, like Lot&rsquo;s wife, he looked
back.</p>

<p>The ch&acirc;teau of Bidesk&uacute;t, the ancestral home of the
Bidesk&uacute;tys ever since they had helped Hunyady
M&aacute;ty&aacute;s to the throne, was in itself not a very
imposing building, except perhaps owing to its vastness: a low,
regular, two-storied construction, built in a quadrangle round a
courtyard in the middle. The stone had been plastered and painted
over a bright yellow, after the fashion of the beginning of the
century, and a double row of green shutters ran like two
bright-coloured belts all round the house. The garden was mostly
laid out in quaint, conventional beds of standard rose trees, each
surmounted with a gaily-coloured glass ball, that threw pretty
patches of brightness against a background of tall, sweet-scented
acacias. A wide, circular stone stair led from the lower to the
vast upper hall, which occupied a large portion of the main wing,
and was <i>par excellence</i> the great dining-hall, where two
hundred guests could dine without being crowded, at the two huge
horse-shoe tables that stood on the tiled floor. Half-way up the
stairs, in a niche in the stone wall, a gigantic granite statue of
Attila frowned down on those who passed.</p>

<p>The guest-chambers formed two sides of the quadrangle, and
opened out under a veranda on to the courtyard, in the middle of
which there was a round garden, bordered with dwarf acacias, and
laid out with more beds of standard rose trees and coloured glass
balls. The veranda ran round, supported by columns, in the capitals
of which swallows had built their nests. The last side of the
quadrangle contained the vast kitchen, offices, and rooms for the
women and indoor servants; the others&mdash;gardeners, grooms,
herdsmen, and shepherds&mdash;slept under the blue vault of heaven,
wrapped in their great sheepskin coats.</p>

<p>For full five minutes Rosenstein the Jew stood at the gates, his
thin hands clutching the iron fretwork, his colourless eyes aglow
with inward passion, the very personification, the living statue of
a deadly, revengeful hatred. For full five minutes he stood there,
till he saw a graceful vision in white come wandering down the
sweet-scented alley, then he once more turned towards the village
and went his way.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5" id="Chapter5"></a>Chapter
5<br>
An Old Miser</b>
</h2>

<p>Turning his back on the great gates, Rosenstein the Jew walked
away towards the plain.</p>

<p>To his right and left, as he walked, the county of Heves, with
Bidesk&uacute;t, Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda, stretched out in all
its midsummer splendour; as far as the eye could reach, waving
fields of golden wheat, the finest the world produces, graceful
plumed heads of maize, and the glistening green of watermelons
gladdened the eye with their richness and plenty. The Jew&rsquo;s
gaze rested contentedly and somewhat sarcastically on all the rich
property, and every now and then he rubbed his thin, shrivelled
hands together.</p>

<p>The roads, as is usual during the dry season, were lined with
deep ruts and fissures, and the Jew&rsquo;s feet became sore with
hard and weary walking. But he seemed not to care. Thoughts, which
evidently were exceedingly pleasant, helped to soften the hard road
for him, and his hand wandered lovingly to the pocket, lately
filled to overflowing with bank-notes, now comparatively empty,
save for the documents that bore the prodigal lord&rsquo;s
signature.</p>

<p>The road along which Rosenstein was walking was bordered on
either side for some distance with tall, slender poplars, the
silver-lined leaves of which trembled at every breeze; in front,
far ahead, could be dimly discerned the vast sandy plain, with its
ruddy arid soil, its deep blue sky overhead, and its quaint
tumble-down inn on the wayside.</p>

<p>All was silence and peace around, save for the occasional
distant sound of a herd of wild horses, galloping madly across the
plain, or overhead the strident cry of the stork calling to its
mate; only in the heart of the solitary human wayfarer, in the
midst of this vast peaceful immensity, there lurked passions,
turbulent and wild, envy, hatred, and malicious triumph.</p>

<p>Rosenstein seemed to feel no fatigue. He had walked for three
hours along the dreary road, and had now at last caught sight of
the quaint wayside inn, only a kilometre beyond.</p>

<p>The Jew with the diffidence taught to his race by centuries of
derision had gradually come near. His narrow, light-coloured eyes
peered anxiously round, evidently in search of some one. Loud
laughter and mocking comments from the two sturdy young peasants
who were sitting, sipping their wine, and smoking their long pipes
lazily, greeted his arrival.</p>

<p>Rosenstein ventured a few modest raps on the table, but as no
one came in answer, he gathered up sufficient courage to peep in at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to enter my kitchen, you dirty
Jew!&rdquo; said a shrill voice from within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I would not for worlds, and I would not trouble you
at all, only Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s from Kisfalu has told me
to meet him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! he has not come yet, and you cannot wait inside
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interior of the inn looked decidedly cooler than the
exterior, for through the thickly thatched roof and walls, mostly
wood and mud, the fierceness of the sun could hardly enter; close
to one of the windows, the owner of the shrill voice sat; a buxom
figure of a lowland peasant woman, in multi-coloured petticoats,
full-sleeved lawn shift, and tight-fitting corselet; she was lazily
turning her spinning-wheel with one foot, while her well-shaped
fingers deftly spun the fine flax thread. The fire in the huge
earthen oven had been allowed to die out, and on it shone the many
vessels, pots, and pans, glistening with polish, which had served
to cook the mid-day meal.</p>

<p>With a sigh the Jew had turned away from the door and the
inviting coolness within, and taken humbly his seat in the very
glare of the sun, for the young peasants had disdainfully refused
to make way for him at the table under the willow tree. There he
sat patiently, not daring to ask for wine or even water, for fear
his presumption might entail his banishment from the precincts of
the inn altogether, when he would perforce have had to wait on his
feet until it was Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s good pleasure
to arrive. His ears, however, well-trained to catch every scrap of
conversation that was not meant for them to hear, were sharply on
the alert. The two young herdsmen lazily smoking their long pipes,
and drinking deep draughts of Hungarian wine, were whispering
excitedly together. The Jew, while seemingly overcome with fatigue
and the heat, his eyes closed, his mouth open, lost not a word of
what they said.</p>

<p>The young peasants were discussing the eternal topic of the lord
of Bidesk&uacute;t&rsquo;s mysterious buildings and contrivances,
that were supposed to do the work they and their fathers before
them had done with their own hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard my master say,&rdquo; said the one,
&ldquo;that it will grind as much corn in one day as would take a
month with six windmills at work to do; and that three men with it
can do the work of twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not hear much about it in the kitchen,&rdquo;
replied the other, &ldquo;but my mother has learned a good bit from
Jank&oacute;, my lord&rsquo;s valet; and he says that my lord sits
up now till the middle of the night, with one candle and some huge
books in front of him, and, although Jank&oacute; has learned to
read and to write, he could not make head or tail of what was in
those books, the letters all seemed mixed up anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure the devil has printed them himself; truly
the holy Virgin can have nothing to do with things that in some
mysterious way do the work of twenty men. Mark me, evil will come
on your lord and his house, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can come but evil, of bringing the devil into the
village? Jank&oacute; told my mother that the big books came from a
place called England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once saw a picture,&rdquo; said the other,
mysteriously, &ldquo;of some people, that the Pater over at
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s told me came from England. They
looked very like what we do,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only they have big teeth, and red hair, like the Jews.
England is very far from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have to get in a boat, and go across the sea to
get there; I have heard my lady say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you cross the sea without being drowned?&rdquo;
asked the herdsman who had first spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the other, shaking his head
sadly at the immensity of the problem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be better if my lord went on the sea and got
drowned, rather than make himself one with the devil, and bring
some terrible misfortune on the village, ay, probably on the whole
county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any evil comes on the village through these
contrivances of Lucifer, we shall have to fight the devil, somehow.
We have sisters, mothers, wives; we must protect them from
Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their whisperings had become very low, the Jew tried in vain to
catch any more snatches of their conversation, an awed,
superstitious look was on both their young faces; their bronzed
cheeks were quite pale, and their bright, dark eyes peered
anxiously round as if expecting every moment to see the evil one
appear from out the wall. Rosenstein caught them both pointing the
first and fourth finger at him, while expectorating three times on
the ground in his direction, a sure way of keeping Satan at a
distance, should he have chosen the disguise of a Jew usurer in
which to haunt the county of Heves.</p>

<p>The sun was gradually sinking lower and lower on the horizon.
The intense heat had somewhat subsided, and the two young herdsmen,
having finished their wine, prepared to depart to rejoin their
herds.</p>

<p>They turned into the inn to pay their few groats for the drink,
and kiss the buxom landlady, as is always customary when she
happens to be young and comely, and her husband not within
sight.</p>

<p>Far out on the horizon, a tiny speck had gradually grown larger
as it drew nearer, and Rosenstein, with a sigh of contentment,
noted that the speck soon assumed the shape of a man on horseback.
The two herdsmen as they departed down the road had also looked at
the fast approaching speck, and pronounced it to be Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s on his black mare; nearer and nearer it drew, and now
Rosenstein could easily distinguish the broad figure and bronzed
face of the rich peasant as he rode saddleless and stirrupless at
breakneck speed, his white lawn shirt and full trousers fluttering
in the breeze, as if they were the wings which helped the
swift-footed mare on her wild career.</p>

<p>The pretty landlady came to her door to greet the new guest, for
he always had a merry jest for her, ay! and often a bright bit of
ribbon, or a shiny locket, which he had bought from some pedlar on
the way, and gladdened her heart and her vanity with it.</p>

<p>Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s had brought his mare to a
standstill, and she stood calm and placid, not having turned a hair
during her mad canter, while her master dismounted, and patted her
sleek neck, and whispered soft endearing words to her, to which she
responded by rubbing her nose against his hand.</p>

<p>The Jew did not dare approach him, until it was
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s own good pleasure to notice the humble
presence of the descendant of Israel. Truly a fine figure was that
typical representative of a prosperous Hungarian peasant. Tall,
above the average of his race, with straight, broad shoulders, his
face bronzed by the sun, his foot, small and arched, firmly planted
on the soil, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was decidedly good to look
at, as every girl in the county of Heves had declared for the past
ten years, since it had transpired that old Kem&eacute;ny had
proved himself to be the miser which every one had always suspected
him to be, and had died, leaving coffers full of gold and
bank-notes which made his handsome son nearly as rich as my
lord.</p>

<p>The old man&mdash;Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s father&mdash;had been a
curious figure among his fellow peasants on this side of the Tarna,
in his shabby <i>bunda</i> (huge sheepskin mantle), and his coarse
linen, and with his sharp features, tightly compressed lips, and
bushy eyebrows, so different from the merry, open countenance of a
Hungarian peasant.</p>

<p>It was vaguely whispered, that far back, some hundreds of years
ago, the Kem&eacute;nys had had a Jewish ancestress, and it was
generally admitted that from that hereditary taint&mdash;for taint
it was for any peasant to have even a drop of Jew blood in his
veins&mdash;old Kem&eacute;ny had inherited his love of money, his
avarice, his greed of gain.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, his life at Kisfalu&mdash;a tumble-down
thatched farm he rented from the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t&mdash;was
known to be of the most parsimonious kind. While he was young, he
kept one servant to wash and cook for him, fed himself on pumpkin,
milk, and rye bread, slept on the bare boards, and never set foot
in either inn or church, where, of necessity, he would have had to
leave some kreutzers (farthings) behind.</p>

<p>Gradually, year by year, he added first a field, then another,
then bits of vineyard to the farm, while his cattle, horses, pigs,
and sheep multiplied exceedingly. But old Kem&eacute;ny never
changed his mode of life. He now had to employ a great deal of
labour in his fields and vineyards, and for this he paid as wages
the few coppers or the measures of wheat that were customary,
neither more nor less. He was his own overseer and spared himself
neither morning, noon, nor night. His rents he paid in kind, as the
lord of Bidesk&uacute;t demanded, but on the surplus he neither fed
nor clothed himself as all&mdash;peasant or noble&mdash;do in the
Hungarian lowlands. He neither ate wheaten bread, nor drank good
wine, he wore no fine linen, or warm woollen garments; all his
produce, animal and vegetable, he sold every year to the Jew
traders, and at a high price too, for the lands round Kisfalu
proved fatter and richer than some of Bidesk&uacute;t itself. As to
what he did with the money he amassed year after year, no one in
Aroksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s, or the other villages round, ever knew.
He spoke to no one, never stopped to gossip on Sunday afternoons,
or at even, when the work was done. The sowers, reapers,
grape-gatherers, and wine-pressers were never allowed within the
actual precincts of the farm; what was due to them for their
labour, in money or in kind, he gave them, but never a word that
would give anybody the least idea of what was going on within that
shrewd, thin head of his. As for the Jew Rosenstein, who did all
his selling for him, and who was the only and very frequent visitor
at the farm, it was of course quite impossible to glean anything in
the way of information from him; for even had any of the shepherds
or herdsmen so far bemeaned themselves as to gossip with a Jew, old
Rosenstein would never have spoken of any financial transaction in
which he had a hand.</p>

<p>Late in life old Kem&eacute;ny gave still further food for
gossip by marrying, without giving to any one for miles around
previous warning of his intention of doing so. He had always been
considered, owing to his parsimonious habits and eccentricities,
such a confirmed bachelor that the news that he had one day gone to
the other side of the Tarna and brought home a bride, took the
village by storm. Great hopes, were at first entertained of hearing
from the new wife all that had been a mystery in old
Kem&eacute;ny&rsquo;s life; but either that the inhabitants of the
opposite side of the Tarna were also a secretive and parsimonious
lot, or that the wife was drilled to obey her husband, certain it
is that Kem&eacute;ny Etelka proved as mysterious, as silent as her
lord. She went to church every Sunday, true; but she never stopped
outside the porch for a bit of gossip; she never placed a single
copper in the plate, and though her husband rented the biggest farm
in the county of Heves, she never wore anything but a cotton dress,
and always walked to church barefoot. She was a pale, gentle
creature, and many noticed that during Mass she very frequently
cried.</p>

<p>Two years after their marriage Andr&aacute;s was born. A fine
boy he was from the first, and much admired by all the women, when
his mother brought him to church with her. There was absolutely no
preventing his being kissed and petted, when he walked so proudly
by her side, his little dark head erect, his bright eyes looking
proudly round him. His mother had to stop now every Sunday outside
the church to hear his praises sung by every woman in the
village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the beautiful little angel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A true Magyar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The handsomest boy this side of the Tarna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it was with difficulty the mother succeeded in parrying the
indiscreet questions which inevitably followed this overflow of
admiration for her boy.</p>

<p>As for old Kem&eacute;ny, it was impossible to kindle a spark of
pride in him, by talking to him of his boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another mouth to feed,&rdquo; he would say dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! you niggardly old miser, you have enough and to
spare, to feed a dozen sturdy lads like your little Andr&aacute;s
boy. What is the use of hoarding? He will never want.&rdquo; And
one or two of the older peasants, contemporaries of his own, would
try to break through the barrier of old Kem&eacute;ny&rsquo;s
impenetrable silence over his own affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plenty and to spare?&rdquo; rejoined the old man crossly,
&ldquo;when not a groat have I got, even to buy myself a pair of
boots. Plenty, indeed, when every florin, every ear of wheat, every
blade of grass has to go into my lord of Bidesk&uacute;t&rsquo;s
pocket in payment of rent for the tumble-down old farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are either a liar or a fool, old chap, for if it
takes every bit of a field to pay the rent of that field, it is the
work of an ass to labour it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And loud laughter greeted this speech of undisputable logic.</p>

<p>This sort of banter angered old Kem&eacute;ny exceedingly, and
all reference to his supposed wealth drove him into a perfect fury.
As he grew older, therefore, he gradually discontinued every
intercourse with his fellow-men, avoided the village altogether,
and never walked down the main roads. The labourers all declared
that during one entire vintage time he was never once seen to open
his lips. He was soon positively hated by all, and deep was the
compassion felt for the gentle wife, who had never known a
day&rsquo;s pleasure, never been allowed to dance the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, in the great barn on Sunday afternoons, or
to join the wedding and christening parties, as they occurred in
the village.</p>

<p>As for Andr&aacute;s, as he grew up, life seemed indeed a dreary
thing. His father, who never spared himself, knew no mercy for him.
Every season of the year was one of incessant toil for the
fast-growing lad. He became his father&rsquo;s overseer, his
drudge, his slave; not one single groat did he ever get to spend in
merrymaking with the young peasants of his own age in the village
inn, not one with which to buy a bit of ribbon for the girl who had
looked coquettishly at him during Mass on Sunday. From morning to
night it was toil in the fields, the yards, or the vineyards, and
many were the heavy blows that fell on his young shoulders from his
stern father&rsquo;s knotted stick.</p>

<p>Gradually the bright, sunny expression in his eyes faded, and a
kind of defiance seemed to perpetually sit on his proud, handsome
face. He was soon old enough to notice that his father was an
object of hatred and derision, his mother and himself of contempt
and compassion; he saw how much coarser was his linen, how much
shabbier his boots than those of the shepherds or herdsmen who
worked for wage and slept under the blue vault of heaven; he saw
that his mother walked barefoot, whilst Zsuzsi, Panna, Mariska,
wore beautiful red boots; he saw that she never put a farthing in
the plate for the good old Pater; and all that galled him, and made
him hate the tyrant, whose eccentric miserliness deprived him of
all the pleasures which made life bright to others as young as
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s! the gipsies over from Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s
are going to play in the barn this afternoon. You will come?&rdquo;
asked a young lad of him one Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s bit his lip hard. He would have loved to go and
hear his favourite tunes played by the picked men of the county,
and to show the pretty girls how well he could step the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s; but gipsy music and pretty girls meant
money, fifty kreutzers at least for the one, and twenty for the
others for a bit of ribbon or a handkerchief, and Andr&aacute;s,
the rich farmer of Kisfalu&rsquo;s son, had not a copper coin in
his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not come,&rdquo; he said a little sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gipsies will have plenty of money from all of
us,&rdquo; said another kindly; &ldquo;it will not matter if you do
not give them anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should I not give them anything?&rdquo; retorted
Andr&aacute;s fiercely; &ldquo;if I wanted to hear the
<i>czig&aacute;ny</i> I could do so. But I said I would not come.
It is no one&rsquo;s business to ask my reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one did ask you, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said one of the
herdsmen, shrugging his shoulders, whilst another laughed and
turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do ask you, why your hair is black and your
moustache short. And if you do not tell me why your impudent tongue
happens to be red, I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that country where the sun is hot and the tempers fierce, a
quarrel often arises out of the merest banter. A jest roughly
expressed and misunderstood, a word inadvertently spoken, and
tumultuous passions rise to the surface, like the bubbles in a
glass of champagne; knives are brought out, eyes glare, lips are
compressed, and often a severe wound, sometimes even a sudden and
tragic death, is the outcome of a quarrel of five minutes between
comrades of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had become livid with rage, his eyes glared round
him, as if in defiance to the whole village to dare make fun of
him. His hand had sought and grasped the heavy clasp-knife inside
his belt, and the other fell heavily on the shoulder of the daring
mocker, forcing him to turn and face him whom he had ventured to
deride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! hey! and what do I see? My children, the day of the
Lord will surely not be polluted by your quarrels. Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s, put back your knife! your mother&mdash;ah! she is a
saint!&mdash;will be waiting at the cross-road for you; shall I go
and tell her that I left her only son with a knife in his hand,
after he has promised half an hour ago to forgive so that he may be
forgiven? Come, come; give me that knife, and do not look so
fiercely at me. I am only a weak old man, and not worth quarrelling
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the good old priest who, having said his Mass, was going
home for his mid-day meal, his well-worn, shabby old cassock held
high above his lean shanks to protect it from the mud. Quite gently
he placed his kindly hand on Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s wrist, and the
young man let fall to the ground the knife that he held.</p>

<p>Then, without a word, he turned and fled towards the cross-road,
on the way to Kisfalu, where his mother stood waiting for him.</p>

<p>After that episode he, like his father, ceased to go to church;
he wished to avoid the mocking laughter and the kindly sympathy
which alike stung and wounded his pride. With passionate devotion
he poured all the pent-up flood of his intensely affectionate
nature on the mother who bore her hard lot with such exemplary
patience. Worked to death almost as he often was on field and farm,
he never was too tired to try and lighten some of his
mother&rsquo;s tasks. For her he would wash and cook&mdash;ay! spin
and weave&mdash;for the sake of the delight of seeing the loved one
rest peacefully for an hour in her arm-chair.</p>

<p>These two, mother and son, were all in all to each other. Their
pride had shut them out from their own little world yonder in the
village, and even out in their fields. From the head of the house,
the father, the husband, they had neither sympathy, nor even
ordinary kindness. His greed of money seemed to grow with age. A
kind of monomania had seized him. He suspected his own wife and
son, and kept his money and his affairs as much hidden from them as
from every one else. They knew that he was passing rich, for
Andr&aacute;s by now was an experienced farmer and knew the value
of those rich fields, those fine vineyards, those numerous herds of
sheep, but the pleasures that those riches could give, the
plentiful fare, the merry-making, dancing, <i>czig&aacute;ny</i>
music, abundant wine, were all denied to them. As to the authority
of him who was her lord and master, and his father, neither wife
nor son thought for one moment to question. In that land where
civilisation is still in its infancy, a kind of worship surrounds
the head of the house; he is placed there by God himself, with
divine rights over all his family; they neither question his
decisions, however unreasonable they may seem, nor deny him their
respect, however thoroughly he may have forfeited it.</p>

<p>And thus a few years sped on, and Andr&aacute;s was now
two-and-twenty: the most hard-worked, the most robust and practical
tiller and reaper of the soil on the lowlands. From his hard
training he had learned to work without complaint, to be content
with little, to keep his own counsel, and to despise money; from
his own heart he had learned one thing only, but that he had
learned thoroughly, namely to love his mother. All ideas of love in
another direction, the love for a being who was not his own flesh
and blood, but oh, who was so infinitely dearer, <i>that</i> was
denied to him. If at times thoughts of a wife and family flitted
through his mind,&mdash; for does not a hermit also dream of
paradise? &mdash;he perforce had to chase them away. Old
Kem&eacute;ny last year had said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I married when I was fifty. When Andr&aacute;s is that
age, I shall be underground, then he can do as he pleases; till
then I cannot allow another mouth to be fed under this
roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in this as in all things what could Andr&aacute;s do but
obey? and chase far into the distance dreams of a brighter
future?</p>

<p>One memorable day, old Kem&eacute;ny, apparently still full of
vigour, fell, struck as a withered oak by a sudden blast. After a
hard day&rsquo;s work in the vineyards, while Andr&aacute;s had
stolen half an hour&rsquo;s respite from wine-pressing in order to
help his mother with the bread-baking, two sturdy lads brought the
old miser home, on a rough stretcher, put hastily together. He
seemed to know no one. His tongue babbled half-articulate sounds,
his face was distorted, all awry. The village doctor bled him, and
though floods of thick, dark blood flowed from his arm, it seemed
in no way to bring him to consciousness. For two long days he still
breathed on; Andr&aacute;s and his mother watched him dutifully to
the last. At times they thought that something oppressed the brain
already o&rsquo;erclouded by death; at times the lifeless eyes
would almost resuscitate, to glower anxiously round. But whatever
he wished to say, whatever parting injunction he may have wished to
leave to his son, Andr&aacute;s never knew; he and his mother did
not weep when they at last closed the eyes of their hard
taskmaster, gone to his eternal rest. They asked the kind old
priest to say a dozen Masses for the repose of his soul, and
Andr&aacute;s, with his own hand, knocked together the boards of
oak which contained his father&rsquo;s remains.</p>

<p>Old Kem&eacute;ny found his place among his kind, in the little
churchyard of &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s: his wife had twined
two wreaths of marguerites and cornflowers, which she placed on his
grave; they faded the same afternoon, as the sun was very hot, and
they were never replaced.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6" id="Chapter6"></a>Chapter

The Tenant Of Kisfalu</b>
</h2>

<p>The village and countryside never actually learned, as it had
hoped to do, what wealth Andr&aacute;s found hidden away after his
father&rsquo;s death. And, truly, though old Kem&eacute;ny was
eccentric in one way, his son bade fair to outdo him in that
respect, for his conduct after his father&rsquo;s death was
peculiar in the extreme. For three consecutive years, he and his
mother continued their existence at the tumble-down old farmhouse
of Kisfalu. True, Andr&aacute;s would not allow his mother to do
any kind of work, and paid two village girls to wash and cook for
them both; otherwise their life remained the same. He himself
supervised all the labour, and continued his father&rsquo;s
dealings with Rosenstein the Jew, but the greater part of his time
he spent with the good priest at &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s,
who, it soon transpired, taught him to read and to write, and many
other things that a peasant lad does not usually learn.
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, whatever his motives were, brought the
same energies to bear upon his mental work that he had done upon
physical toils. His father, he soon discovered, had, owing to his
wonderful avarice and greed of gain, left him a very large amount
of money; so large that, at first, Andr&aacute;s and his mother,
accustomed to their constantly empty pockets, hardly realised its
full value,or the benefits which it would confer upon them. Their
slowly-thinking peasant minds hardly could understand that all
those old wine barrels which had been filled with gold and silver
pieces by the eccentric old miser were all absolutely theirs, and
meant so much comfort and luxury to them who, up to now, did not
know what it was to sleep in a comfortable bed, or to eat their
entire fill. Money has so very little meaning in that land of
plenty that, just for a moment, Andr&aacute;s viewed his wealth
with a feeling that was almost one of disappointment. He hardly
knew himself what he had really expected when with his own hands he
had driven the last nails in the boards which covered him who had
been the arbitrary master of Kisfalu; hardly knew what he used to
hope for when, on hot summer nights, after a hard day&rsquo;s toil,
his young shoulders still sore from the paternal correction for
some real or imaginary offence, he used to stroll out upon the vast
<i>puszta</i> and, his gaze lost in the far-off immensity of the
horizon, he vaguely wondered at the meaning of the word
&ldquo;happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And those mountains of gold and silver, jingling and glittering,
seemed so poor, so tawdry in comparison with those nightly
day-dreams. Presently, however, the shrewd mind, inborn in every
peasant, rose to the conception, still weak and far distant, of all
that riches might mean. He remembered chance derisive words his
father had from time to time thrown out, as if involuntarily, on
the subject of the heavy sacrifices the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t
often made to get a handful of this gold with which to gratify his
every whim. If it was not too great a sacrifice to give up bits of
land one&rsquo;s ancestors had owned for hundreds of years, in
order to handle some of these gold pieces, why then, since they had
as it were dropped into his lap, he would try and learn, study to
find out, what was the best use to be made of it. The lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t parted with his land to obtain gold, why should not
he, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, the peasant, the son of the
eccentric old miser of Kisfalu, part with the gold to gain the
land? Oh! to absolutely call some of that loved soil <i>his</i>,
the soil which from his childhood he had learned to coax into
yielding to his avaricious father all the treasures it contained,
his own; that he could share all products with his mother, and
perhaps, who knows? in time to come with some one else who would
call him husband, and some one else wee and very dear, who would
learn to say &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Oh! for the delight of owning
every grain of wheat, the fleece of every sheep, every drop of milk
from his cows, and not to have to give of the first and of the best
to the noble lord out there at Bidesk&uacute;t, who never came to
Kisfalu, who trafficked with the devil, and allowed Satan to work
the land that should have been sacred in his eyes.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s, who had in twenty years of enforced
self-restraint learned to keep his own counsels and to whisper to
no one what was passing in his mind, never communicated his
thoughts to any one. No one knew what treasures were found in old
Kem&eacute;ny&rsquo;s coffers, no one knew if the dead man had
indeed been a liar or a fool. The work in the field continued.
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s flour was as fine and white as
his father&rsquo;s had been, the linen woven from his flax the
softest in the county, his wine the most delicately flavoured; no
wonder that the Jew traders from Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s were always
seen at Kisfalu, in every season of the year, when there was aught
to sell. As for Andr&aacute;s, who never in his life had bought,
sold, or exchanged, he very soon learned the full value of the
products which the fat land yielded him.</p>

<p>For three years he learned from the good old priest how to read,
to write, and to reckon; with the patient stolidity with which he
had accepted his daily hard tasks from his father, he fulfilled now
the task his own shrewd mind had allotted to himself. He soon found
out that the Jews played upon the credulity of the peasants, that
they presented in a distorted aspect the value of the trifling
loans they made, and the usurious interest they received. To fathom
the actual value of the exchange, the money for the product,
Andr&aacute;s resolutely imposed the task upon himself. The peasant
mind in Hungary is a merry one, full of love for pretty girls, gay
dancing, poetic music, but it is obstinate and tenacious, and that
tenacity Andr&aacute;s&mdash;who knew little of love or
pleasure&mdash;applied entirely to the furtherance of his aim.</p>

<p>Little by little, he employed some of his money in improving the
old farmhouse, he rendered it comfortable for his mother to live
in, and also&mdash;he could not himself give any reasons for doing
it&mdash;he added a few rooms, furnished them cosily with furniture
he bought at Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, and even papered the walls over
the whitewash, which, when finished, caused a veritable procession
from the two neighbouring villages to see this luxury which had
become far famed.</p>

<p>Gradually, as he felt more at home in his altered circumstances,
and saw his mother more happy and cheerful, he lost that
taciturnity which his wounded pride had as it were built round him,
and began to mix more freely among the peasants in the neighbouring
villages. Soon the sunny nature inherent in every Hungarian
reasserted itself; gradually he took up every habit which those of
his age pursued. He again went to church with his mother, but now
they both stopped at the porch after Mass, and Andr&aacute;s
ventured on looking at the pretty girls in their Sunday finery, and
on asking them for a dance or two in the afternoon in the big barn.
He did not find them unapproachable: the belief had gained ground
that old Kem&eacute;ny had left masses of money, and that
Andr&aacute;s was wealthy beyond any Jew for miles round; ay! some
even asserted that he was becoming almost as rich as the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t himself.</p>

<p>A certain romanticism hung round him, owing to his lonely
childhood, his mysterious learning&mdash;which in the minds of his
neighbours had assumed boundless proportions,&mdash;and above all
owing to his manly bearing, his fine eyes, which had retained a
certain defiant fierceness, only tempered by his now frequent and
cheerful smile. Soon half the village beauties were in love with
him, and many were the quarrels with jealous swains that
Andr&aacute;s had to fight out, after the Sunday afternoon dance.
But now the venom had gone out of his disposition; the quarrels,
fierce for a moment, always ended suddenly by Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s
cheerful good-natured giving in, and by a couple of bottles of the
best wine the county of Heves produced, in which to drown any
lurking feeling of jealousy against the handsome youth who was so
liberal, and such a merry companion.</p>

<p>But in spite of his attraction towards the fair sex,
Andr&aacute;s was still single, and still the devoted son in
prosperity which he had been in time of trouble. He flirted with
all, made merry love to many, but not one of the bevy of pretty
girls, who trotted briskly to church on Sunday mornings, could
boast of having induced the rich Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s to
think of sharing his fabulous wealth with her. When the older women
or men threw chaffing hints out, as to the probable future mistress
of Kisfalu, Andr&aacute;s would laugh and say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! hey! but the pity is I love them all, and I cannot
bring the lot to Kisfalu; there is no room, and my dear mother
would not approve, and&mdash;if I choose &mdash;how can I choose
one among a hundred beauties&mdash; without being very rude to the
ninety-nine others that I love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If his mother gently expressed a wish to see at some future time
her grandsons round her knee, Andr&aacute;s would throw his arms
round her neck, and kiss her rough cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there is only one
saint in the county of Heves; you are the saint. When an angel
comes down from heaven I will ask her to marry me; but until then I
will be content to love my saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother sighed, the girls cried, and Andr&aacute;s, at
five-and-thirty, was still a dutiful son in single blessedness.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7" id="Chapter7"></a>Chapter

Principal And Interest</b>
</h2>

<p>The hostess had drawn a measure of her oldest wine and placed it
on the table which was best shaded from the sun; she was busy with
her apron, wiping off any particle of dust that may have remained
on the table or bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! but you grow prettier and prettier every day,
Zsuzsi, of my soul!&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s hearty voice
close to her ear, as he put an arm round her buxom waist, and
imprinted a good sound kiss on the nape of her snow-white neck.
&ldquo;If I were your lord and master, which, for many reasons, I
do wish I were, I would not know a moment&rsquo;s peace; he must,
have a hard time, keeping the fellows off that slim waist of
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Andr&aacute;s had drawn the pretty woman on his knee, and
was making her blush with the admiring glances he cast at her,
while drinking deep draughts of her delicious wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Andr&aacute;s! you don&rsquo;t know! that is just the
trouble!&rdquo; said the pretty hostess, while a tear or two
moistened her eyes, making them appear even brighter than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Lotti? Tell me. Is it a new ribbon
you want, my dove, or a new silk dress for Sunday? Tell me what you
want, my pigeon, and you shall have it; only do not cry, in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, for I cannot stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! it is not a ribbon, or even a dress,
Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said the pretty woman, now fairly bursting
into tears. &ldquo;What is the good of my good looks when my
husband has ceased to love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ceased to love you, my rose? Has K&aacute;lm&aacute;n
gone blind? or has he gone squinting in another
direction?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which it is, but I know he does not
love me; Andras,&rdquo; she added, her voice shaking with tears,
&ldquo;he has not beaten me for three weeks!&rdquo; Andr&aacute;s
gave a long whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! that is serious! and you?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I gave him plenty of cause! I danced the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s with Horty Rezs&ouml;, for two hours, till I
was ready to faint, and actually did drop into his arms, but when I
came home, K&aacute;lm&aacute;n, who had been there and seen it
all, and even saw Rezs&ouml; kiss me after the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, went quietly to bed, and never even as much
as boxed my ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the neglected wife burst into a deluge of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very humiliating,&rdquo; she added between her
sobs. &ldquo;Panna, last Sunday, could scarcely move her back, or
lift her arm, and Lujza had quite a deep blue mark across her
shoulders. That is real love, if you like; their husbands must have
loved them deeply to be so jealous that they beat them like that. I
could not show as much as a pinch on my arm, so I wore my sleeves
long to hide my shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! there! my pretty flower,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, consolingly, &ldquo;leave off crying, and promise to
dance every cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s with me next Sunday, and I will
swear that I will squeeze that slim waist of yours so tightly and
look so deeply into your bright eyes, that K&aacute;lm&aacute;n
will break his stick across your pretty back for jealous rage.
Come, bring out some wine for that old scarecrow of a Jew over
there; he looks hot and thirsty, and I want some talk with him,
which I cannot do if his mouth is parched and dry.&mdash;Here, give
me another kiss &mdash; another &mdash; and another. &mdash; Why,
the devil take him! if K&aacute;lm&aacute;n saw me now, there would
not be a white spot left on those plump shoulders of yours, they
would be black and blue, fit to make Panna, Lujza, and the lot of
them green with envy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughing, quite consoled, the buxom landlady ran back into the
cottage, and half reluctantly placed a large jug of wine before the
Jew.</p>

<p>Rosenstein had sat very patiently in his corner, the last rays
of the setting sun falling upon his meagre back; he looked a comic
figure, like some huge scarecrow outlined against the sky; quietly
he had waited while Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s pursued his
flirtation with the hostess, but his bird-like face brightened up
when he heard the young peasant ordering a measure of wine for him.
He was not accustomed to attentions of this sort from any one,
except from good-natured Andr&aacute;s, who knew from his own
earlier experiences what it was to be very hot, very thirsty, and
without a bottle of wine before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my pretty pigeon, go in!&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
giving the young woman another parting kiss. &ldquo;What I have to
say to this old Jew is of no interest to those pink ears, which are
only made to hear words of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You send me away?&rdquo; she said with a pout; &ldquo;you
are going to talk secrets and affairs with that horrid old
Rosenstein. Why must I not hear? I can keep secrets&mdash;You are
not going to borrow money of him, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my soul, you may be sure of that,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, laughing, &ldquo;so run away. The secrets Rosenstein
and I are going to talk about are neither worth the keeping, nor
the gossiping.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pretty hostess, willy-nilly, had to go; Andr&aacute;s had
learned throughout his life the lesson of obedience so completely
that he had an irresistible way of teaching it to all those with
whom he came in contact.</p>

<p>He beckoned to Rosenstein, and the Jew, hastily finishing his
wine, came near with that humble obsequiousness and deferential
smile which those of his race have for centuries been taught to
wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old scarecrow! tired of waiting, eh?&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, genially. &ldquo;Hey! hey! pretty women will take up
such a lot of a fellow&rsquo;s time, and I have wasted so precious
little of it that way in my life that I have a great deal of
love-making to do before I have my full share of the best side of
this world. Come and sit down here in the shade. &mdash; Not too
near me!&rdquo; he added, laughing, and making way for Rosenstein
on the bench close to him.</p>

<p>The Jew himself was in rare good humour; Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s
merry laugh was very infectious, and Rosenstein, between his thin
lips, made a low, chuckling little noise, which might have passed
off for a laugh.</p>

<p>The young peasant pushed jugs and bottles to one side. Wine is
heating, and when talking to a Jew the head must be kept very cool;
a pipe only is always a good friend and counsellor, and
Andr&aacute;s, throwing back the wide lawn sleeves of his shirt,
leaned both elbows on the table, and having filled his long
cherry-wood pipe, &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; he said to the
Jew.</p>

<p>Rosenstein had taken out of his pocket one of the documents
signed that morning&mdash;unread&mdash;by the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t. The other reposed snugly in an inner pocket, and
evidently was not intended for any but his own private perusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noble lord of Bidesk&uacute;t wanted 250,000
florins,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;he is starting his steam-mill on
its work tomorrow, and has to pay heavy wages to the Budapesth
workmen, whom he is bound to employ, since the men about here will
not now go within a league of the building, for fear they should
meet the devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean to say,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
incredulously, &ldquo;that that cursed mill is completed, and that
he actually means to work it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, most decidedly he does, in spite of every
dissatisfied peasant on his estate, in spite of the fact that Pater
Ambrosius specially said Masses for the destruction by fires from
Heaven of the building of Lucifer. It is, in fact, to begin work
to-morrow or the day after. His corn, all lying in magnificent
stacks, is ready to be threshed by the supernatural agency, and
that which is already threshed will be ground into finer flour than
the B&aacute;n&aacute;t has ever known, at the word of command of
the devil and his satellites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew had said this with many sarcastic intonations, but
Andr&aacute;s, who, in spite of his learning, had not quite shaken
off all peasant superstitions, listened to him with awe and
incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think my lord is a fool,&rdquo; he said at last;
&ldquo;if there was the slightest use or good to be gained by
employing three men instead of twenty, and spending the wages of
two hundred in doing so, I could understand it. But this flour will
not be any finer by it, and he will enrage every peasant on his
estate. He <i>is</i> a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He certainly is under the impression that he will become
the richest man this side of the Tarna, and in the meanwhile is
busy ruining himself in trying to become rich. However, according
to your wish, I handed him over the 250,000 florins on the
following security and interest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, old man! I said I would not lend any more. I
wish to buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did all I could. I offered what money my lord cared to
ask. He will not sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look of very deep disappointment clouded over the young
peasant&rsquo;s face, the hand which held the pipe closed so
tightly over the slender stem that it nearly broke it in half.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a fool,&rdquo; he repeated after a slight pause.
&ldquo;The loans are not for a great number of years and, though
the interest is low, he will never be able to repay the capital,
which he is spending entirely on that confounded machinery and
building of his. Sooner or later he will have to part with the
land. I want it now, to-day. I am rich. I would pay him any money
he wants. He is a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noble lord says he will not part with a foot of his
land to a peasant or to a Jew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, by God!&mdash;&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, bringing
his heavy fist crashing down upon the table.</p>

<p>The shaft which the Jew had with wondrous cunning aimed at his
client had struck home. The insult supposed to have been hurled at
the peasant by bracketing him with one of the despised race made
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s cheeks livid with rage, but the old habit of
self-restraint got the better of him. Before this man whom he
employed he forced himself to remain calm, and repeated very
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said the Jew, eagerly, &ldquo;your position
is better and better every year. Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri has now
mortgaged every foot of his land to you, with the exception of the
house and garden of Bidesk&uacute;t itself, and a few stables
round. Mark my words, the money you lent him to-day, on the
security of Z&aacute;rda, will not last him six months at the
present rate at which he is spending every florin he gets. Six
months hence he will want some more, and then, more and more again.
You have plenty, you could let him have plenty, but he will not
have a foot of land left to mortgage. Then you can foreclose at a
small additional sacrifice; and the land is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will then try and get the money with which to meet his
debts from those whom he calls his equals,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, surlily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They never have any ready money to spare, those noble
lords on the lowlands; they spend every kreutzer they have in
eating, drinking, and trying to outdo their neighbours in splash
and gorgeousness; moreover, since you were willing to lend more
money on the land than it is honestly worth, no one would care to
take on the mortgages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more they would if the money had been lent by one of
your tribe, and the usurious interest almost ruined the owner of
the land. What I ask is so low. Any one can pay it and yet make a
large profit for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know! I know!&rdquo; said the Jew, hastily. &ldquo;I
have often advised you to ask more reasonable interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot do usury. I must place my money since I have got
it, and I wish to buy the land, but my mother and I will not dirty
our fingers with usury. What interest is my lord paying me for this
last 250,000?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five thousand measures of wheat, forty head of cattle,
and fifty sheep,&rdquo; said Rosenstein, handing the document
across to Andr&aacute;s. Anxiously he watched the young man&rsquo;s
face, while he read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is all right enough,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
folding the paper and putting it into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what profit you are
making out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know best, that I make none, save what you are good
enough to give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I gave you two hundred florins to do this work, are
you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, perfectly, perfectly. I am a poor man
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever I hear that you have cheated me in any of these
dealings, I will break every bone in that shrivelled-up old body of
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are joking! How could I cheat you? even if I wished,
which I swear by Abraham I would never think of doing. You have
seen the document signed by the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t; you do not
imagine he would sign without reading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t imagine he would be quite such a fool!
but I daresay he gives you a little something for yourself:
doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;he offered me one hundred florins
this morning, and,&rdquo; added the Jew with a peculiar hissing
sound between his teeth, &ldquo;he gave me a good
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! well then! that is all right, old scarecrow!
isn&rsquo;t it? You do not often have a good dinner; you are too
mean to feed yourself properly. So he fed you well, did he? I am
glad of that. I hope you thanked him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no time to do much thanking to-day,&rdquo; said
the Jew, &ldquo;but my thanks will keep. I hope in about two
years&rsquo; time to have repaid him in full, for the good dinner
he gave me this morning. He! he! he!&rdquo; he added, rubbing his
thin hands gleefully together, &ldquo;I am deeply in the debt of
the most honourable lord! but Moritz Rosenstein never forgets, give
him two years, and he will repay, he won&rsquo;t mind the interest,
he! he! he! he! he will pay that too&mdash;in full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had ceased to listen to him; he had taken out
Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s note of hand, and read it through very
carefully. Evidently he was fully satisfied with its contents, for
again he folded it up, and replaced it in the inner pocket of his
jacket.</p>

<p>Dreamily he continued smoking, taking no heed of Rosenstein, his
gaze riveted far across the plain towards that distant sunset,
beyond which lay that loved land which, from his childhood, he had
tended and tilled, in sorrow and with bitter tears, for the tyrant
who now lay underground. To acquire that land, and now make it all
his own, was the dream which filled his mind, unformed,
half-educated as it was. It was a dream that had risen within him
from the moment he realised that wealth was within his grasp. For
that one aim, he toiled by day and studied by night. No labour was
too hard, no task too difficult. He knew the noble&rsquo;s
hereditary contempt for the peasant, guessed that it would be a
hard matter to force the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t to sell his land
to the despised, low-born peasant, thus laying as it were the seeds
of equality between them, but in time he hoped he would win,
already he held heavy mortgage on that land he loved so well. It
was almost, but not quite, his own. Rosenstein promised that soon
it would be his. Lovingly he scanned the flat horizon, tried to
look beyond the sunset, past the barren plain, whose soil now
looked cool and grey, in contrast to the brilliant gold of the last
rays of the setting sun. There lay Kisfalu with its rich fields,
its green vineyards, the house where he was born, where lived his
mother, where, please God and his own indomitable will, his son
would also be born, live and die in peace, his own ground, his own
land, his! his! his!</p>

<p>As for Rosenstein, he was nursing pleasant dreams of wealth
coupled with vengeance. He was content to sit quietly, and think
over the time when the proud man, who had made him the jest and
jeer of his servants, would perforce be leaving his ancestral home,
and he, the despised Jew, who had received many a caning within its
walls, would buy it, under the hammer; for beneath it, it would
come; nothing could save it, considering the usurious interest
Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri was paying unbeknown to the proud young
peasant, who had learned much, but not enough to be quite even with
a Jew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is getting late, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said the pretty
hostess, coming to the door; &ldquo;you have a good three
hours&rsquo; ride before you, if you are going back to Kisfalu,
remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going back home,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, rousing
himself from his day-dreams. &ldquo;Come and kiss me for being such
an attentive time-keeper. Here are ten florins for the wine I have
drunk, and the oats Csillag has eaten, and mind you have that new
bit of ribbon in your hair next Sunday, and won&rsquo;t we make
K&aacute;lm&aacute;n jealous over the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s? Two
hours, mind! heigho! Csillag, my beauty, are you rested? and has
that featherbrain of a woman given you a good measure of oats?
Here, old scarecrow, next week I shall want to see you about some
lambs you can sell for me. I have two hundred beauties. I shall
want a heavy price for them. You can come over to Kisfalu. We shall
be busy threshing. Good-night, my pigeon; give us a kiss and tell
K&aacute;lm&aacute;n he is a blind fool. God be with you! Come,
Csillag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And saddleless, stirrupless, without use of bit or rein,
Andr&aacute;s jumped on his lovely mare, and waving a last adieu to
the pretty hostess, galloped away towards the sunset, and was soon
but a mere speck upon the vast horizon.</p>

<p>Rosenstein looked a long time after him. His pale eyes twinkled,
his lips parted in an acid smile, his thin hand felt coaxingly for
the second document signed by Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri, which
contained some clauses that would have cost the Jew many a broken
bone at the hands of the young man who had galloped away so
merrily. Then he too turned his back upon the inn, and went his
way.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8" id="Chapter8"></a>Chapter
8<br>
First Arrivals</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I think, after all, I will wear my blue sash and bows,
R&oacute;za, the pink will make me look so pale. Oh, dear! oh,
dear! how late it is! I have heard the czig&aacute;ny tune up half
an hour ago; I shall never get dressed to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little maid rushed hither and thither, bustling round
her young mistress, changing the blue sash for the pink, then, back
again to the blue, arranging a stray golden curl, putting a stitch
here and there, eager, excited, and proud. Proud of such a
mistress, the prettiest heiress in the lowlands. Bidesk&uacute;ty
Ilonka, then barely seventeen, was reputed to be the beauty of the
countryside, the fairest in that land where all women are fair,
with the graceful, yet full figure of the Hungarian race, the
peach-like skin, the golden hair, and forget-me-not eyes, that are
calculated to drive any inflammable Magyar heart to despair. Since,
according to the noble hostess of Bidesk&uacute;t, it is the duty
of every aristocratic Hungarian girl to be beautiful, Ilonka
certainly fulfilled that duty to absolute perfection, and the
Countess, her mother, had little fear but that her daughter would
fulfil her other duty with equal perfection, and make the most
suitable marriage her fond motherly heart could desire.</p>

<p>Downstairs the agitation was becoming positively electrical. The
Countess herself, in the tight-fitting silk dress that had formed
part of her trousseau, and had passed through many stages of
promiscuous and antiquated attempts at modernisation, was giving
her final look round to the gorgeously laid-out table in the big
hall. The heavy oak buffet, which stood the whole length of the
hall, almost broke down under the weight of the huge dishes of meat
and fish of every description, that filled every available corner,
whilst the two horseshoe tables literally creaked beneath the
enormous baskets of grapes and melons which threw a penetrating
scent around.</p>

<p>Gigantic bottles of wine stood ready to hand, between each of
two guests, and a couple of huge casks on tall trestles each side
of the buffet were ready tapped, in case the bottles did not prove
sufficient. The valets in their best tight-fitting Magyar frock
coats, and still tighter breeches, with boots of the shiniest
leather, lined the lower hall below, awaiting the arrivals. Outside
a band of czig&aacute;ny, the czimbalom player in the middle, the
leader well to the fore, had turned ready to strike up the
R&aacute;k&oacute;czy march directly the distant cracking of a whip
would announce the first arrvial.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma expected one or two of the nearer neighbours
in time for mid-day dinner: they would come in their own coaches
all the way from either side of the Tarna. Bidesk&uacute;t had
supplied the relays for those of the guests who came from a
considerable distance, and already the day before carriages had
gone off in every direction from which the main road branched off
and visitors might be expected to arrive; whilst the smartest
coaches harnessed with the pick of the Bidesk&uacute;t stables had
been sent overnight to Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, to bring from the
railway station there those who from the still more distant
counties were obliged to travel by train. These would mostly be the
younger and smarter people, who had been to Budapesth, or even to
Vienna, and had become accustomed to those terrible inventions of
Satan, akin to Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s threshing machines, the
railway trains. All older people preferred the mode of travelling
that had been good enough for their fathers and their
grandfathers&mdash;the cumbersome but comfortable barouche
harnessed with four sure-footed Hungarian horses from their own
herds, who did not rush along at devilish speed on metal tracks,
which surely never were forged anywhere but in Satan&rsquo;s own
workshop.</p>

<p>Huzza! Hurrah! The distant shouts, the thundering gallop of
horses, and clinking of harness, announced about eleven
o&rsquo;clock the first arrivals. &ldquo;Tune up,
czig&aacute;ny!&rdquo; thunders Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s voice from
an upper window, and at a sign from the leader the czimbalom starts
the opening bars of that most inspiriting R&aacute;k&oacute;czy
march. . . . Here they come! the Kant&aacute;ssys, the nearest
neighbours, who only live some twenty leagues away, and have driven
over in two carriages full; they are a large family, and bring
several servants. Intensely Magyar in character is their turn-out,
their coachmen and grooms wearing the national costume, full white
lawn trousers and sleeves that flutter in the wind, short,
gaily-embroidered leather jacket, round cap, and shiny boots. With
the most dexterous precision the driver guides his fiery team of
five Hungarian horses, three leaders and two wheelers, through the
wide-open gates of Bidesk&uacute;t, to a perfect standstill before
the door. Their brilliant red leather harness, with their quaint
tassels, and shiny brass bosses, glitters and jingles in the hot
mid-day air.</p>

<p>Three prettily dressed girls, two young men, the portly Count
Kant&aacute;ssy, and his thin, sour-looking wife, all step out of
the big coaches, and find their way, chattering, eager, and
excited, through the hall, and up the stairs past the Hun
warrior&rsquo;s frowning statue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Isten hozta!</i>&rdquo; (God has brought you), many
handshakes and kisses are exchanged, as Jank&oacute; solemnly opens
the sitting-room door where Bidesk&uacute;ty and his wife await
their guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mariska, how tall you have grown! and, Sarolta, I
would not have known you, and little Emmike is growing a pretty
girl after all!&rdquo; says the hostess, as each of the young
girls, with a little curtsey, comes up daintily to kiss her
hand.</p>

<p>The Countess Kant&aacute;ssy&rsquo;s eldest daughter, and her
own Ilonka, were of an age, and decidedly likely to be rival
beauties; but Countess Irma noted with satisfaction that Mariska
had two pimples on her forehead, which showed very conspicuously,
though her mother had made her bring a curl right down on purpose
to hide them.</p>

<p>The girls stand aside, modest and blushing, while their parents
talk; the mothers, after the first few remarks on the subject of
the bad roads, are already discussing the probable <i>partis</i> in
view; the fathers expatiating on the perfection of the harvest this
year, and the promise of a glorious vintage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, my dear,&rdquo; whispers Countess
Kant&aacute;ssy, volubly, &ldquo;how much Bart&oacute;cz Zsiga
admires Mariska; he would in every way be a suitable <i>parti</i>
for her, but unfortunately he is, as you know, in the diplomatic,
and in France and in England he has gathered a notion that girls
ought to do other things besides looking pretty. I believe those
foreign girls are terribly forward; some of them read novels, and
go out by themselves. Thank goodness! there is nothing of the sort
about Mariska; she is as modest and innocent as ever I could
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is indeed a pretty girl!&rdquo; says the hostess,
with a decided want of conviction, &ldquo;and Bart&oacute;cz Zsiga
would be an excellent <i>parti</i> for her. Of course, you know
that we have refused him for Ilonka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You surprise me, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Countess,
with some acidity. &ldquo;I should have thought that Ilonka was not
at all his style. Only the other day he was saying that he thought
she was too fair. Don&rsquo;t you think so yourself? No? Ah, well!
perhaps you may be fortunate in finding a man who admires that pale
complexion; I found that Mariska&rsquo;s pink cheeks were immensely
admired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, so far, has never lacked admirers,&rdquo; rejoins
the hostess, sweetly; &ldquo;indeed, we find it quite an occupation
to refuse marriage proposals for her, she has so many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, dearest,&rdquo; retorts the Countess
Kant&aacute;ssy, as a parting shot, &ldquo;she is an only child,
and men know that she will inherit the whole of Bidesk&uacute;t and
Kisfalu, and that she will have Z&aacute;rda as a dowry. . . . But
where is the dear child?&rdquo; she adds, feeling that, perhaps,
the conversation was becoming uncomfortable. &ldquo;Mariska, my
child, I feel sure Countess Irma will allow you to go to Ilonka,
who must have finished dressing; you will be glad to see each
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarolta and Emmike may go too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the three girls, glad to get away from the overawing
presence of their elders, prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, Mariska! you may all three take off your hats and
gloves, and arrange your hair, before you come down
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And like little birds out of their cage, the three girls, making
an old-fashioned curtsey, fluttered out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are charming!&rdquo; says the hostess,
condescendingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they are very well brought up,&rdquo; admits the
fond mother, proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; here breaks in the stentorian
voice of the portly Count Kant&aacute;ssy, &ldquo;believe me, your
craze about those absurd machines is absolutely without
common-sense. Did not your father and my father, your grandfather
and my grandfather, sow and reap the finest corn in the world, and
grind it into the whitest flour, without the help of those
outlandish inventions? What do you hope to get with them? except to
fall into the hands of the Jews; for those things cost money,
which, so far, thank God, none of us have had any need
of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, in England&mdash;&rdquo; began
Bidesk&uacute;ty with a wise expression of face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! do not talk to me about that accursed country. What
do I know about it, except that it is near the sea, that their corn
is coarser than that which we give to our pigs, and that they make
wine out of gooseberries? I ask you what can they know about corn?
or about grapes? Why the devil don&rsquo;t they produce them with
their inventions of Satan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of the labour and the fatigue it will
save!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose labour? whose fatigue? That of the lazy,
good-for-nothing peasant. You give him more leisure to enrich
himself, till he will own more land than we do, and drive us nobles
out of our homes, very much like those cursed Jews are beginning to
do. As long as you make the peasant work for you, and give him no
wages and plenty of kicks, he will respect and fear you. Give him
time to work for himself, to become rich, to own big lands, and he
will begin to think that he is your equal, and want to kneel beside
you at church in your pew, and think that his son can marry your
daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no difficulty in keeping the peasant in his
proper place, even the rich ones; now there is Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s, who rents my farm at Kisfalu. That man is reputed to
own some four or five millions of money, which his miserly old
father is said to have left in wine barrels, and yet he is
perfectly content to rent Kisfalu from me; and I am sure, whenever
I meet him, he always most politely takes his cap off to me, as his
ground landlord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you mean to tell me that there is a peasant on your
estate who owns millions of money? Somebody has been stuffing you
up with fairy tales, my friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no fairy tale, though the amount may be a trifle
exaggerated; he certainly has a very great deal of money, and does
a good trade, I am told, with his beasts and his wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I call it confoundedly impudent of a peasant
to be so rich. I wonder he has not offered to buy some of your land
from you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he has never done that. Some people think he does
quiet money-lending on his own account, but that I cannot say. I
have never had anything to do with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I suppose you have a Jew or two with whom you
deal?&rdquo; suggested Count Kant&aacute;ssy, with a loud laugh.
&ldquo;Those confounded mills must have cost a pot of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they have,&rdquo; said poor Bidesk&uacute;ty,
shaking his head at the remembrance of the ruinous transaction he
concluded yesterday; &ldquo;and those confounded Jews charge such
terrible percentage. I soon shall not have enough flour of my own
to provide this house with bread. I should not mind if that miserly
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s would buy a bit of land from
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he never asked you to sell him Kisfalu?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, that I know of; that is the curious thing about it
all. I often wish he would, because, of course, I cannot offer the
property to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to be sensible enough to know his own
place,&rdquo; retorted the Count; &ldquo;a peasant indeed! owning
that beautiful Kisfalu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has, in any case, plenty of money. What he does with
it I cannot imagine. After all, the dream of every peasant ever
since they were made free is to own a bit of land all his
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A piece of land, his own?&rdquo; rejoins the irate Count,
&ldquo;My good Bidesk&uacute;ty, where in the world have you picked
up those new-fangled notions? Do they come across from England,
together with those God-forsaken machines? Because, if so, believe
me, let the whole lot sink to the bottom of the sea, together with
that beer-producing country, which may the devil take away. Their
own indeed! Time was, when I was a youngster, when let alone the
land, but even their lazy, good-for-nothing bodies belonged to the
nobles, they and their sons, ay, and their daughters too! And now
you talk of their owning land, their becoming rich!
Preposterous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the fat old Count, portly and apoplectic, turned away in
disgust from his friend who held such ridiculous notions, in order
to appeal to the lady who had begun life by stating that
&ldquo;humanity began with the Barons,&rdquo; and from whom,
therefore, he was always sure of warm support. &ldquo;Whom do you
expect today?&rdquo; asked Countess Kant&aacute;ssy, throwing
herself nobly in the breach. She was not quite sure whether her
husband&rsquo;s last remark was altogether good form, and thought a
change of conversation would be beneficial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We expect most of our guests, who come by train. The
Egregyis, I think, are sure to drive, for you know Aunt Irma has
never been on the railway in her life; they might not arrive till
to-morrow, as the roads have been very bad all the way. But the
Bart&oacute;cz, the Mad&aacute;chs, the Palotays, and two or three
more, will be here almost directly. I believe the train comes in
some time during the morning,&rdquo; she added vaguely; &ldquo;it
usually has a long wait at Palota, for the Baroness is never ready,
and they always wait for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do believe here they are!&rdquo; says Bidesk&uacute;ty
with delight, sure now to escape another assault from his friend on
the subject of his beloved machines.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9" id="Chapter9"></a>Chapter
9<br>
Beautiful Ilonka</b>
</h2>

<p>Thundering gallop outside, shouting, yelling, and laughter,
proclaim the arrival of the carriages from Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s
railway station. In a moment the huge house is filled as with a
crowd. Groups of young girls fluttering like chickens round their
mamas, portly papas mopping their beading foreheads&mdash;for the
sun is grilling on this August day,&mdash;maids, valets, and
couriers seeking and finding their sweethearts they had left last
year, stealing kisses, exchanging &ldquo;<i>Isten hoztas</i>&rdquo;
(God has brought you), till the hall, the stairs, and passages
would seem to a sober-minded Englishman a very pandemonium, peopled
with semi-lunatics.</p>

<p>The hostess has to find an amiable word for all: one of praise
for the beauty of every girl, of admiration for the bearing of
every young man; compliments to the mamas and papas on the charms
of their progeny. As for Bidesk&uacute;ty, the host, he is
laughingly assailed on all sides by inquiries after his machines
and his mills: the laughing-stock of all these easy-going,
prosperous, aristocratic sons of the Hungarian soil. Surely it is
folly to talk of improving a land that produces so much prosperity,
that yields such boundless hospitality.</p>

<p>The young girls, with becoming shyness, keep close to their
mamas&rsquo; petticoats; each comes forward in the approved fashion
to kiss the Countess Irma&rsquo;s hand, and receive a friendly tap
on the blushing cheek. The young men tap their heels together and
make the most military of salutes. Most of them are still in the
&ldquo;one year&rsquo;s volunteer&rsquo;s&rdquo; uniform of some
cavalry regiment; some show by their more serious manner and the
foreign cut of their clothes that they are preparing for the
diplomatic service; others in rough homespuns, and tight-fitting
Hungarian breeches and shiny leather boots, intend, obviously, to
serve neither country nor government, but to stay at home, as their
fathers have done, and superintend the tilling of the land that
will become their own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is Ilonka?&rdquo; is the general question that
comes from every side; while Kant&aacute;ssy, with the privilege of
an old friend, and a noted wag, declares that he will go and fetch
her, even if she is still in her bath.</p>

<p>The Countess Kant&aacute;ssy has just time to protest: &ldquo;In
Heaven&rsquo;s name, Jeno, do be careful how you speak!&rdquo; and
to note with satisfaction that the innocent ears of her daughters
have been spared their father&rsquo;s profligate talk, when a merry
peal of laughter is heard from the garden below, and old Baron
Palotay, who is a near relative, playfully rushes to one of the
windows, and pulls the curtains to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for money!&rdquo; he declares. &ldquo;The sight is
worth a florin a-piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And indeed the picture outside was worth a heavy price to see.
In a simple white muslin dress, her fair hair tied in a graceful
knot at the back of her tiny head, her wide-brimmed hat fallen down
her back, thus framing the daintiest face that ever smiled on
mankind, Ilonka was plucking a few roses, her only ornaments, and
tying them in a knot for her belt. No wonder the younger men
crowded to the windows to watch the dainty apparition, no wonder
the mamas looked envyingly at the fairest among the fair, no wonder
the Countess Irma, with characteristic pride, looked triumphantly
at her female guests, and musingly at the group of men, from which
she would have no difficulty in selecting a most suitable
<i>parti</i>.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the radiant apparition, followed by the three
Kant&aacute;ssy girls, whose by no means despicable beauty acted
but as a foil to her own charms, came in fresh and rosy, as merry
as a lark, conscious of her own beauty, like a very little queen,
gladdening her courtiers with her presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old uncle&rsquo;s privilege, my dear,&rdquo; asserted
old Palotay, as he imprinted a kiss on the pretty girl&rsquo;s
cheeks, and all the young men looked as if they wished their hair
would suddenly turn white, and earn them the same coveted
privilege.</p>

<p>But Ilonka smiled and curtsied to all with equal grace, kissed
the fat or lean hands of the elder ladies, allowed, smiling, every
elderly man to kiss her pretty cheek. Only the sharp eyes of her
mother noted the scarcely perceptible blush, the faint quiver of
the delicate eyelid, the softly whispered &ldquo;God has brought
you!&rdquo; when she first caught sight of Mad&aacute;ch Feri.</p>

<p>He was a young man who still wore the one year&rsquo;s
volunteer&rsquo;s uniform of a Hussar regiment; tall and slenderly
built, he looked exceedingly handsome in the tight-fitting tunic
and scarlet breeches that made a bright patch of colour beside
Ilonka&rsquo;s white gown. But his father had wasted his
son&rsquo;s patrimony in overlavish hospitality; the ancestral home
had fallen into the hands of the Jews, and the Mad&aacute;chs lived
in a small house at Kecskem&eacute;t, and could not afford to put
their son into the diplomatic service. There had been some talk of
his marrying the daughter of a rich Viennese merchant. But, most
unaccountably, the young man seemed obstinate, and old Count
Mad&aacute;ch apparently had no influence over his son, and allowed
him to remain single when a rich marriage, which would have
retrieved the fallen fortunes and regilt the ancestral coronet,
should have been contracted long ago. Feri was said to have a
leaning for the army, which was not considered a very aristocratic
profession for a descendant of the ancient family of Mad&aacute;ch,
whose ancestry was lost in the mazes of the Tartar invasion. No
wonder, therefore, that Countess Irma frowned when she noted her
daughter&rsquo;s blush, and heard the tone of that &ldquo;<i>Isten
hozta</i>&rdquo; (God be with you), so sweet and so heartfelt.
Ilonka, however, unconscious of the gathering storm, stood happy
and blushing now, laughing merrily, promising dances for this
evening&rsquo;s ball, and agreeing to innumerable riding, boating,
and fishing parties for the next few days.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the big hall clock strikes the hour of two,
and punctual to the minute old Jank&oacute; opens the doors, and
announces that the Countess is served.</p>

<p>All are equal in this hospitable house, there is no formula of
etiquette or precedence; jovially the host and hostess show the
way, and young and old, with much laughter and pleasant
anticipation, file into the dining-hall. Already the gipsy band is
stationed at one end; as the guests come in, they start the
merriest cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, and keep it up till every one has
found the place they wanted most, next to the person near whom they
would prefer to sit.</p>

<p>At the head of the table the good-looking face of the host beams
delighted on his guests; whilst at the opposite end the Countess,
enthroned like a queen, listens to the various compliments on the
beauty of her table-decorations, the size of her fruit, the
picturesqueness of her garden. Perhaps she is aware that half the
flattering speeches are but the usages of a flowery language, the
custom of the country; she has to do the same when she, in her
turn, visits her neighbours, although she may be convinced that all
her arrangements, her household, and her cuisine are superior to
those of every other mortal in the world. Still flattery is
pleasant to listen to, when one is convinced that, in any case, it
falls far beneath the reality.</p>

<p>Well out of sight of her mother, Ilonka sits, blushing and
happy. Feri has, with wonderful tactics, secured a seat next to
her, and, with delight, the young people can look forward to
sitting side by side for at least three hours; for surely all that
food and drink will take their elders some time to consume. With a
loud &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;ljen!</i>&rdquo; (Long live!) directed with
full glasses towards the host and hostess, the company have fallen
to; and for fully five minutes, while the first hunger is appeased
with a plateful of steaming soup, nought interrupts the merry music
of the <i>czig&aacute;ny</i>, save the clink of glasses, and of
silver spoons.</p>

<p>The servants go round briskly to fill and refill the glasses as
they become rapidly empty; and after the first few minutes the
tongues are loosened again.</p>

<p>Poor Bidesk&uacute;ty has to endure a vigorous attack from every
side on the eternal subject of his new mill and machinery.
Obstinate, he holds his ground, propounds his theories, of which he
himself is not very clear. The entire bevy of his older guests, all
in his own rank of life, and most of them prosperous, rich
landowners, prophesy the most dire disasters, which are sure to
befall him, if he persist in his new-fangled notions brought from
abroad, from the blowing up of the infernal machine by the
revengeful flames of heaven to the revolt of the entire peasantry
against these inventions of the devil. The idea of any improvement
in the way in which many generations had carried on their farming
was, to these Magyar nobles, nothing short of the ravings of a
lunatic; it was an unheard-of precedent in the history of the
Hungarian lowlands.</p>

<p>But the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t had nursed his fad ever since, a
young boy, his father had first tried to drive it out of his head;
fostered by opposition, it had grown to a conviction. He was
sanguine of success. In order to pander to his craze originally he
had dipped pretty deeply in borrowed coffers; now, like the true
gambler, he staked more and more, secure in the conviction that
ultimately fortune would be his, a boundless fortune, built on the
secure foundation of his highly improved produce obtained at a
minimum cost of time and labour.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had with infinite patience perused a number of
heavy books which he had sent for from Budapesth, and had persuaded
himself that he was thoroughly imbued with the progressive notions
of Western countries. In imagination he saw himself the recognised
authority on matters agricultural from the confines of Poland to
the shores of the Lajtha. From the perusal of those heavy books he
had gathered, with an infinitesimal and somewhat addled quantity of
knowledge, a certain desire for something different to his present
mode of life; he began to dream of riches; he who came from a race
that were content to live from the product of the soil began to
have vague, undefined longings for other luxuries besides that of
fine white bread and rich old wines; the word
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; was just beginning to have a distinct though
still obscure meaning for him, and he was beginning to realise that
the life of a Hungarian noble on his estate might perhaps be better
filled than by watching his corn grow, or breaking wild horses into
harness. Sometimes the original old man would crop up, as when he
found amusement in terrorising Rosenstein, but, on the whole, a
vague feeling of his dignity as a man lurked in his mind beside the
empty pride of ancestry.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the table, Ilonka had at last broken the
happy silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me you were not coming,&rdquo; she said, after
they each had eaten their soup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you knew better,&rdquo; he rejoined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did not know. I heard you had been to Budapesth
for the carnival, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could not have thought anything but that you are
fairer than the most beautiful girl I could meet anywhere, and that
whenever I looked at a pretty face in Budapesth I thought all the
more of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought of me?&rdquo; she said with playful
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I did, Ilonka,&rdquo; said the young man with
suppressed passion, &ldquo;you know I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; she said nervously, &ldquo;mama is
looking, and I am sure Madame de Kant&aacute;ssy can
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had perforce to whisper very low, so low that not even the
flies could hear as they buzzed lazily overhead. But Ilonka must
have heard something, something that made her blush, and cast her
blue eyes down on her plate. It was very pleasant to be talking
thus, to be nibbling slily at the forbidden fruit, whilst
mama&rsquo;s eyes had perforce to wander everywhere, and the noise
of talk and laughter, and that of the gay czig&aacute;ny band,
drowned the sound of the young man&rsquo;s whispered words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall pass my officer&rsquo;s examination next month,
Ilonka,&rdquo; said Feri, tentatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I shall pray for another war against the
Prussians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? you might have to go and get killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I might,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;that
certainly would be a most complete solution of the difficulty. But,
if I lived to do something great, enormous, which would draw the
attention of my country on my poor self, then,
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;then&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They both lapsed into silence, and from Ilonka&rsquo;s eyes a
tear fell down on the bunch of roses in her belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; They both knew what a vague word that
was; they both felt that however great their love, however deep
their sorrow, their whole fate and happiness depended on that
problematical &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; the consent of the parents,
without which no well-born girl in Hungary could marry, slave as
she is to their old-fashioned whims, their considerations of rank
and wealth, all the glitter which is necessary to the old, and
seems so paltry, so tawdry to the young.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you have made me very happy,&rdquo; said the
young man, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy? How?&rdquo; she asked innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By saying &lsquo;perhaps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants were handing round the meat, the fruit, the salads.
All round them was noise, gaiety, loud laughter, sometimes coarse
jest. These two sat, like tiny birds hidden beneath overhanging
boughs, secure from storm and stress of weather without, content to
steal a few glances from each other&rsquo;s eyes, to snatch a word
of what lay nearest to their heart, in the intervals of evading the
prying eyes of their elders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful Ilonka is very silent over there,&rdquo; came
in loud, laughing accents from the farther end of the table, and
old Kant&aacute;ssy, boisterous and good-humoured, raised an
overflowing glass of wine high above his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink to the prettiest girl on the lowlands,&rdquo; he
added rising. &ldquo;Beautiful Ilonka, to your bright eyes, to your
pink cheeks, and your merry laugh, which I have not heard this last
half-hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an excuse for refilling the glasses, and all the young
people got up, and walked round to where Ilonka was sitting,
blushing to the very roots of her hair, and touched glasses with
her, and said, &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;ljen!</i>&rdquo; (Long live!); the
young girls all kissed her, the young men looked as if they wanted
to, the old ones took leave without permission; and so the hubbub
lasted for quite a long time, every one&rsquo;s attention being
drawn to Ilonka, so that the one topic of conversation which
interested her was perforce interrupted during that time.</p>

<p>Presently, however, young Bart&oacute;cz, who was just out of
the Oriental Academy, and was going into the diplomatic service,
rose to make an elaborate speech in honour of the hostess&rsquo;s
birthday. Every one was deeply interested, and Ilonka had occasion
to whisper sadly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much use thinking of it; mama will never
consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think your father will say, Ilonka?&rdquo;
She shook her pretty head wisely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa is too much worried with his machines and his
arguments with the peasants: he will listen to anything mama says,
in order to have peace at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, I wish we had lived many hundred years
ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, then, I could have come on
K&oacute;p&eacute;&rsquo;s back, in the middle of the night, and
climbed the walls of Bidesk&uacute;t with the aid of a rope and
carried you away with me by force, in spite of mother and father
and everybody. Money did not matter in those days, nor family
either. All were equal, and a man could marry whom he
loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must have been nice not to have had to ask mama
whom one may love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot ask that now, Ilonka,&rdquo; he corrected
seriously; &ldquo;nobody can dictate to you as to whom you should
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use of loving,&rdquo; she rejoined
innocently, &ldquo;if you may not marry whom you love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is much joy to me, Ilonka, in loving you, even
though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! I am sure mama is looking this
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man from the Oriental Academy had finished speaking;
once more the ceremony had to be gone through of touching glasses
with the hostess, and wishing her a happy birthday. Ilonka was
obliged, like every one else, to go up to her mother, to kiss her
hand, and speak a short speech of felicitations. Her young heart,
still only half understanding the emotions that threatened to fill
it, went out for one moment to the mother who held her whole fate
in her hands. When she had wished her pretty birthday wish, instead
of demurely kissing her mother&rsquo;s hand, she threw her arms
impetuously round her neck and asked for a loving kiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, my child, you will crush your dress,&rdquo; said
the Countess Irma, reprovingly.</p>

<p>And Ilonka, vaguely feeling as if she had done something wrong,
something she knew not what, went back to her place quite shy and
tearful.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10" id=

A Love Idyll</b>
</h2>

<p>After this, gaiety became decidedly more boisterous; the
men-servants were kept constantly busy, filling and re-filling the
glasses and the bottles out of the great casks, one of these having
already run dry. The <i>czig&aacute;ny</i> were not allowed, even
for a moment, to stop the music, and, hot and panting, they kept up
the lively cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s with much spirit. The good
Hungarian wine was getting into the heads of some of the noble
Hungarian barons there, and a quantity of wine in their heads
invariably produces the most passionate fondness for the national
songs of their country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, <i>czig&aacute;ny</i>!&rdquo; said G&eacute;za
V&eacute;csery, a man of vast property in the county of
Zempl&eacute;u, of which he was Lord Lieutenant, &ldquo;play me
that favourite song of mine, &lsquo;<i>K&aacute;ka
t&ouml;v&eacute;n k&ouml;lt a rucza!</i>&rsquo; Play it so that you
draw every tear from my eyes, and every florin from out my
pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Binecz Mark&oacute; began with tender tones on his
instrument to bring forth the melancholy sounds of that sweetest of
Hungarian songs.</p>

<p>While everybody talked as merrily as ever, G&eacute;za
V&eacute;csery had drawn a chair close to the czig&aacute;ny band,
and, sitting astride upon it, with a half-empty bottle of wine in
his hand, he gave himself over to the delights of listening to his
favourite tune, letting his head beat time to the quaint rhythm.
For fully half an hour he sat there, forcing the czig&aacute;ny to
repeat the same tune over and over again, while, to testify to his
intense enjoyment, tears flowed thick and fast down his cheeks, for
truly &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;rva vigad a Magyar!</i>&rdquo; (The
Hungarian weeps whilst he makes merry).</p>

<p>He evidently had quite forgotten the end of the dinner, for he
took no further heed of anything round him, his enthusiasm seemed
to grow at every repetition; his &ldquo;<i>Ujra!</i>&rdquo;
(Encore!) waxed louder and more imperative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slower!&rdquo; he shrieked at times; at others
&ldquo;Faster!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Louder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not go to
sleep, you lazy dog!&rdquo; or &ldquo;What has happened to that
cursed fiddle of thine? It has no tone! Ah, I understand,&rdquo; he
added, rising excitedly, &ldquo;it is thirsty, it wants to drink,
and this wine is a drink fit for angels; here, czig&aacute;ny,
fiddle! drink! drink! it will revive you! drink, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, not very steady on his feet, the Lord Lieutenant rose, and
taking the fiddle out of the leader&rsquo;s hand, he laughingly
poured the whole contents of the bottle he was holding into its
body.</p>

<p>Nobody took much notice of his playful antics; the gipsy very
calmly let him amuse himself with his fiddle; he well knew that
good compensation would follow the destruction of the
instrument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try that now, czig&aacute;ny,&rdquo; said G&eacute;za
V&eacute;csery, handing the man his fiddle back; &ldquo;I am sure
it will play a great deal better for having drunk good Hungarian
wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the fiddle utterly refused to give forth
any sound under the circumstances. The gipsy, with absolute
stolidity, made one or two attempts at scraping the catgut. The
sounds which he drew from it amused the Lord Lieutenant hugely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try again, czigany!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Here, you
don&rsquo;t know how to do it; let me show you!&rdquo; and he
pulled the instrument out of the man&rsquo;s hand. But this time,
either his hand was more clumsy, or the swarthy musician turned the
fiddle over on purpose, anyhow the inevitable catastrophe occurred,
and the wine flowed out freely, and deluged the noble lord and the
gipsy practically from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! what waste of good wine!&rdquo; said V&eacute;csery,
laughing. &ldquo;Ah, well, it is an ungrateful fiddle. Here,
czig&aacute;ny, you will want something to wipe its mouth
dry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he took several bank-notes out of his pocket, and stuffed
them into the fiddle with as much delight as he had poured the wine
into it previously; then he allowed the gipsy to have his
instrument again. He had had enough fun for the present.</p>

<p>Moreover every one seemed to be rising to adjourn to different
parts of the house for smoking or for strolling in the garden.</p>

<p>Feri had tried to remain close to Ilonka, but this was
distinctly not proper, for all the young men were together smoking,
while all the girls, like a veritable bevy of gay-plumaged,
chattering birds, put their pretty heads together, and whispered of
things which only have interest for those dainty bits of
femininity.</p>

<p>That day was perhaps the happiest one two young people at any
rate experienced. Ilonka, throwing all prudence to the wind, and
wilfully defying mama&rsquo;s blackest looks, gave herself over to
the delights of her day-dreams. As a child, playing with an
absolutely novel and fascinating toy, quite unable to understand
that it is brittle, and only made for momentary pleasure, she
coquetted and flirted with this pleasant emotion, which a handsome
young officer&rsquo;s ardent words had kindled in her heart.</p>

<p>All day she dreamed of what she so little understood: of a
man&rsquo;s passion, of marriage, and blissful life with one whom
it was paradise even to listen to, when he whispered so often, and,
oh! so ardently, &ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evening, during the long waits of the cotillon, during
the cosy moments of supper, during the inspiriting hour of the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;, Mad&aacute;ch Feri was close to her. As he
sat near her he could feel the dainty muslin frock against his knee
and, trembling, his hand would seek the soft fabric and stroke it
tenderly, or crush it nervously, as his passion grew stronger and
stronger every moment, for this exquisite type of lovely
girlhood.</p>

<p>And as innocently as a child she would return his ardent gaze,
not comprehending what it was that brought a warm blush to her
cheek and made her own little hand tremble and her heart palpitate.
She felt as it were shut off from the gay world of those around
her, walking through the figures of quadrille or cotillon, not
heeding other hands she touched, other eyes she met, or listening
to other words, save those few she had now heard so often, and yet
which seemed to gather an infinity of sweetness, as they were
repeated again and again: &ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Love! What did the child know of love &mdash; of the strength of
the torrent she, with her own dainty hand, had unchained? She had
known Mad&aacute;ch Feri all her life; when, a veritable queen of
four years old, she had lorded it over the handsome boy of some
five years her senior, he had said, &ldquo;I love you,
Ilonka!&rdquo; He had said it then, he whispered it now, and as her
heart had responded then, it re-echoed now, childlike, sweet, and
innocent.</p>

<p>And the young man, though with more knowledge of the world, and
a dim foreshadowing of the inevitable ending to this happy
day-dream, gave himself over to the happiness of the moment. He
could not say much to her, for there were too many there who might
overhear the words so sweetly foolish, that love in its infancy
babbles to one ear alone, but he could, from time to time, pick up
her fan or handkerchief, and in handing them back to her feel for
one instant her tiny finger against his hand. He could, when no one
was looking, and all the mamas were intent in watching some
intricate figure of the dance, lean forward and look for a brief
moment right into those blue eyes which she had a playful habit of
keeping irritatingly cast down.</p>

<p>All this and more, he could and did do, talking but a few most
commonplace topics with her, forced to avoid what lay so near his
heart, but gazing at her all the time, drinking in every line of
that graceful girlish figure, the bit of white neck that peeped out
slily from out the soft folds of white muslin, the tiny pink ear,
half veiled by stray golden curls, the heavy, drooping lashes, that
cast a glowing shadow on the soft, peach-like cheeks.</p>

<p>Ah! she was divinely pretty, this dainty product of a rich
fertile land, a bit of exquisite jewellery, set in a framework of
semi-barbaric surroundings, and hemmed in by an impenetrable wall
of conventionality, which had cramped her budding character, and
was threatening to shape this perfect work of the Creator into one
of the thoughtless, soulless dolls, that those of her kind and
breeding all gradually become: a pretty ornament to the great,
hospitable castles of which they all ultimately become mistress: a
respectful wife to their husbands&mdash;the head of the house:
content to follow the traditions that have existed for hundreds of
years: dressing perhaps a little differently to what their
grandmothers, or great-grandmothers did, decking their dainty
bodies with perhaps differently shaped garments: but allowing their
minds, their souls, to remain on the self-same level, without any
attempt at cultivating mental gifts, which they persist in looking
on as bourgeois, and unworthy their long line of ancestry who had
fought and made their country great without reading a book or
writing a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo; whispered the young man at
every interval between the figures of the cotillon.</p>

<p>And Ilonka&rsquo;s ears were agreeably tickled by those tender
and passionate words that, in her youth, her innocence, her warped
education, she understood so little. How could a young girl
understand? brought up, as she had been, kept away, till she was
&ldquo;out&rdquo; from every society save that of her father and
her mother, never reading a line that did not pass under the
rigorous censorship of her mother&rsquo;s eyes, taught and shown
nothing which might lead her to understand the depth of a human
heart, the passions that fill a man&rsquo;s soul.</p>

<p>Poor little girl! what did she know of love? save that it was so
pleasant to hear about it from this one being who danced the
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s so divinely, and looked so handsome in his
volunteer&rsquo;s uniform; she allowed herself and him to dream
this day dream, not accustomed to look at the future, accepting the
present, which was so fair, never guessing that such dreams ever
ended, and that there was such a thing as a world which was not
made up of muslin frocks, of cotillons, and handsome volunteer
officers, where harsh words often took the place of softly
whispered &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; where reality with remorseless
fingers scattered the poetic imaginings of young girls to the four
winds, leaving them often sadder, sometimes hardened, always
disillusioned, for no reality, however golden, can come up to those
visions born in the brain of a girl of seventeen.</p>

<p>When every one had gone to bed, after hours of dancing,
amusement, and excitement, to dream of more excitements, more
amusements, more dancing, Ilonka well knew that her mother&rsquo;s
entrance into her room at that unaccustomed hour meant a very
serious lecture. She had the whole of the day thrown prudence to
the winds, and, in spite of mama&rsquo;s black looks, and whispered
comments of the older ladies, had singled out Mad&aacute;ch Feri
for her most special favours.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma had no intention of being unkind. In her
inmost heart she firmly believed that she was devoted to her
daughter, and only considered her happiness, when she tried to
instil into her that love of birth and estates, in which she
herself had been brought up. She so firmly believed that every
description of misery would be the result of poverty or of a
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>, that she would have considered herself a
most unnatural and culpable mother if she did not in good time draw
a picture of those evils before Ilonka, in such a way as to make
her shun the attentions of a &ldquo;detrimental,&rdquo; and repulse
them if they came her way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to tell you, Ilonka, that I was extremely
displeased with you,&rdquo; she began drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With me, mama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your conduct with that penniless Mad&aacute;ch is
positively indecent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one remarked on it to-night. I assure you I blushed
for you the whole evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor little girl! she was so appealing, so sorrowful; she felt a
little guilty certainly, but she had had such a very enjoyable day.
Two great tears were already trickling down her cheeks: mama always
had the power of making her unhappy.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;mama&rdquo; embarked on the usual lecture: of how a
young noble girl should behave, how she should never allow one
young man more than another to pay any attention to her unless her
parents have previously authorised her to do so; that conduct such
as Ilonka&rsquo;s to-night was unmaidenly, and that, if it was not
mended the next day, she would have to spend the rest of the time
that the guests were in the house, in her own apartments, by
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama&rdquo; was exceedingly eloquent, and Ilonka very,
very unhappy. When her mother finally left her, after half an
hour&rsquo;s steady preaching on children&rsquo;s obedience and
maidenly reserve, the poor little girl threw herself on the bed in
a passionate flood of tears. Never in all her long,
seventeen-year-old life had she been so unhappy. A most delicious
bit of romance had come in that life, and caressed her young mind
with poetic dreams, such as she hardly understood herself; stern
reality, wearing &ldquo;mama&rsquo;s&rdquo; best silk gown, had,
with be-ringed, aristocratic fingers, chased those daydreams away.
Hers was a child&rsquo;s grief who sees its most cherished toy
taken away from it, without understanding the reason of the
cruelty; but is there anything in its way more pathetically
hopeless than a child&rsquo;s grief? There seems such a total want
of hope in it, for the child mind only understands the present, it
cannot conceive that there may be a future, capable of alleviating
its sorrows.</p>

<p>Ilonka cried till she fell asleep, and in her sleep she once
more dreamed such dreams that made her forget the realities, her
stern mama, the midnight lectures, and once more brought, floating
before her mind, visions of a handsome young face, with a pair of
dark eyes which, somehow, always made her blush when they met her
own, and to her ear the softly whispered words, sweeter than song
of birds or chorus of angels: &ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11" id=

The Gathering Storm</b>
</h2>

<p>One of the busiest times on the Hungarian lowlands is this
gathering in of the second harvest, which has to be done quickly
before the early autumn rains set in, leaving plenty of margin for
threshing before the vintage time commences. Every year at this
time the fields round Kisfalu teem with work. The hundreds of
labourers, employed by the rich Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, have
little time for gossip and rest, for the eye of the master is
everywhere, and it is pleasure to work under it, since he has a
cheery word, a merry jest for all, which is encouraging when the
sun on the bare back burns to the bone, and the muscles ache with
the wielding of the heavy scythes.</p>

<p>But, to-day, a curious look of general idleness seems to pervade
the atmosphere, and to have settled on the rich
peasant-farmer&rsquo;s fields, and he himself, riding from group to
group, vainly tries, by encouragement or upbraiding, to keep his
troop of mowers to the task. They stand about, their scythes lying
idle at their feet, their pipes in their mouth, their gaze fixed on
one particular point of the horizon the other side of the plain,
where a column of black smoke obscures the soft-toned purple line
of the sky. With arms, feet, and torso bare, their legs encased in
the loose lawn trousers of their national attire, they quietly
allow the burning noonday sun to frizzle their backs, and smoke,
gazing meditatively afar, or congregate in eager, excited groups to
whisper whenever the master&rsquo;s back is turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! you lazy good-for-nothings,&rdquo; says
Andr&aacute;s from time to time, &ldquo;you need my late
father&rsquo;s heavy stick on your shoulders this morning. Here,
Rezs&ouml;, take up your scythe. Miska, throw away that pipe
directly. Come, all of you, and when I am back in half an hour,
mind I see this field as level as the plain yonder, or I swear I
will let some of you have a taste of my new knotted
stick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shamefacedly a group of idlers break up, thoughtfully one or two
take up their scythes and draw them slowly aslant the waving
corn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; says one of them,
with sudden resolution, as he once more throws his scythe down.
&ldquo;How can we toil on God&rsquo;s earth with our two hands
while the devil is at work not four leagues away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; says Andr&aacute;s, cheerily, &ldquo;if my
lord has engaged the devil to work for him, that is no reason why
you should allow my corn to go to hell for want of active
cutting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know well, Andr&aacute;s, that we will all work
for you till our backs break, if need be, but, somehow, to-day, it
is impossible. How do we know,&rdquo; added the peasant, surlily,
&ldquo;that next year you will not also let us starve and employ
the devil to do the work for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well spoken, Rezso,&rdquo; said another, a
young athlete, with muscular arms and broad chest, that shone in
the sun like dull ivory turned brown with age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s not much use toiling on the dear
lowlands, now, since the devil is to do the reaping; next year I
suppose he will do the sowing too, and we can all lie down and wait
till starvation overtakes us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time the Tarna came and flooded us all, before the
devil takes possession of our souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! tut!&rdquo; says Andr&aacute;s, impatiently,
&ldquo;what have we, at Kisfalu, to do with the devil of
Bidesk&uacute;t? I think my lord is a fool with his machinery, but
I think you are all fools to trouble your heads about him; ay, and
knaves too if you steal my day, and do nothing for the wage I give
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very well, Andr&aacute;s, but you cannot employ
every able-bodied man this side of the Tarna. I wish you could, for
then my brother would not have to work for the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t, which he does, in fear and trembling, lest the
devil should make a pick-a-back of him, every time he stoops down
to mow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there are both my younger brothers, driving
those devilish contrivances, that reap and bind the corn all by the
turn of a wheel. The younger one, Laczi, told me,&rdquo; added the
peasant in an awed whisper, &ldquo;that he distinctly saw a black
man with a tail and long pointed ears, sitting between the horns of
one of the oxen, that was, poor innocent thing, dragging the cursed
machine. I tell you Laczi nearly fell off his seat with
fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With having had a draught too much of that wine your
mother gave him before he started work in the morning,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, trying to laugh. But his laughter was forced and
unnatural. All Pater Ambrosius&rsquo;s teaching had not quite wiped
the superstitions of his kind out of his head, and though he forced
himself not to look that way, his eyes also instinctively wandered
across his cheery fields and beyond the sandy plain to that column
of black smoke that he knew proceeded from the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t&rsquo;s new building.</p>

<p>He had heard from Rosenstein that all the machinery necessary
for converting wheat into flour by the help of steam was fixed
ready inside the mill, and that my lord intended to begin work this
day. Of course, Pater Ambrosius had thoroughly explained to him the
uses and powers of steam, but Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, in spite
of his riches and in spite of these teachings, was still the
peasant at heart, and he could not help shuddering and looking
behind him anxiously every time he caught sight of the clouds of
smoke which made an ugly blot on the vast horizon, that he had
learned to love and regard as his own. He was evidently at a loss
how to quiet his workmen&rsquo;s fears, since he was not very free
from them himself. An anxious crowd had gathered round the master,
all eager to gain some sort of comfort from him, for next to Pater
Ambrosius, no one, not even my lord, was thought to possess as much
learning as Andr&aacute;s; young men and old crowded round him,
eager, excited, glad of a chance to pour forth their anxiety into
their master&rsquo;s ever-sympathising ears. Each had a tale to
tell him of father, brother, or son, who during the long hours of
labour close to the mysterious building (which surely was a place
of worship dedicated to the devil) had in some guise or other felt
the presence of the Evil One, who now walked up and down the main
road and called in at farm and inn, since my lord had invited him
to earth. The women too had given up their work of binding, and
they also had many a tale to tell. Angrily they stamped their tiny
brown feet on the earth and shook their fists at the distant column
of smoke, which was the first sacrifice offered to Satan on the
beautiful lowlands. In gaily coloured cotton petticoats, and full
embroidered lawn shifts, their slim waists held in by a
tight-fitting corslet, their heads protected from the burning sun
by a red or yellow kerchief tied in a becoming knot over the brow,
they looked a very picturesque set of angry furies, enough surely
to frighten the most enterprising devil from the neighbourhood.
Andr&aacute;s felt that it was useless now to talk about work
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Erzsi, my pretty one,&rdquo; he said merrily, &ldquo;if
you throw such burning looks across to Bidesk&uacute;t, you will
surely bring the devil straightway here; he will think it is a
spark from his own furnace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! leave me alone, with your jests to-day,
Andr&aacute;s, my father is at work in that very mill of Satan. My
lord offered high wages for the work, and threatened not to employ
him at all this harvest time if he refused to do it; so he went to
confession and communion this morning, and the Pater gave him a
whole litre of holy water. But I tell you, my mother cried fit to
break her heart when he started to the godless work, and I do not
think somehow that I shall ever see him again. Oh! why does not the
devil take my lord away since he is so fond of his company?&rdquo;
and pretty Erzsi shook a menacing fist at the distant cloud of
smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son Imre has to do some work too, right inside the
building,&rdquo; said an older woman, in a voice choked with sobs;
&ldquo;I declare if any harm comes to him, I will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! hush!&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t let me hear that sort of language round Kisfalu.
The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t is your master, you must work for him
as he commands. The devil can have no power over you if you do your
duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not duty to serve one who is in league with the
devil,&rdquo; asserted Erzsi, hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; murmured some of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not let Laczi work for him again,&rdquo; said one
of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has no right to give over our souls to the
devil,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he has promised the devil so many souls in
exchange for the work the Evil One does for him,&rdquo; suggested
an old wrinkled woman, whose sons were all employed at
Bidesk&uacute;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we do not know which of us may be carried off
next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t will repent it,&rdquo; came
in what now had become threatening accents.</p>

<p>This handful of easy-going, somewhat lazy, always merry
peasantry were gradually working themselves up to a state of
hysterical excitement, caused by superstitious fear; and they
absolutely refused to listen to Andr&aacute;s. He was doing his
utmost to pacify the women, who made matters infinitely worse by
sobbing and moaning, and calling on God to punish the miscreant who
had brought the enemy of mankind to this beloved land of peace and
plenty.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud shriek from one of the women made all heads turn
in the direction to which she was pointing, with long gaunt arm
stretched out, and shaking like poplar leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; she cried with trembling lips,
&ldquo;the fires from hell! Miska! Andor! Ivan, my sons! they will
be buried in the flames the Evil One has kindled! Help! help! I see
them perishing before my eyes! Curse the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t!
the fury of the devil is upon us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All looked horror-struck, trembling at the distant column of
smoke, through which from time to time a shower of sparks appeared;
these looked to the poor ignorant folk as the very fires from
below, in which they and their families were about to be
annihilated.</p>

<p>The women threw their arms up in the air, yelling out curses on
the head of him who had brought this evil in the land. Some had
thrown themselves on the ground, and burying their faces between
their knees, moaned and sobbed, while rocking their bodies to and
fro, in an agony of grief. The men raised menacing fists at the
distance, and cursed between their teeth, though no less
bitterly.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was for once in his life quite at a loss for
pleasant words or merry laugh with which to cheer up his labourers,
whom he loved as his friends and equals, into whose feelings and
thoughts he always knew so well how to enter, since he was one of
them, placed in nowise above them through his wealth. It almost
broke his heart to see his sturdy lads standing defiant, idle, and
cursing, so different to the usual, merry lightheartedness with
which they invariably worked for him, and which is the essence of
the Hungarian character. He had neither the learning, the
eloquence, nor the conviction of Pater Ambrosius, which perhaps
might have quieted these superstitious terrors, he had only a great
fondness for his fellow-men, and this he exerted heartily, and with
many a: &ldquo;Now then, Panna, my soul! don&rsquo;t take it to
heart,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Erzsi, my pretty one, your father is quite
safe. Come! come! take my word for it, no harm will come to any
one. I do not understand the cursed things: but believe me the
devil has nothing to do with the making of them!. . . Why; you all
must remember the workmen coming from Budapesth to put up the
machinery. They surely did not look like devils. It is all right .
. . you will soon get used to seeing many things done by machinery,
which you used to do with your hands. They are harmless enough, I
know, and if the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t does not give you all
enough wage to last you through the winter, why I can always find
work for those extra hands who do not want to remain idle. Now
then, all of you, look me straight in the face, instead of at that
black smoke which is far away. Will you do your duty by me, and go
back to your work? It is the best way I assure you to keep the
devil from your doors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, while Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s
stood between them, his merry brown eyes gleaming, forcing each
head, as by the magnetic current of his own kind heart, to turn
towards those frank eyes of his so full of sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will try, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said one or two of the
men, while the women began to wipe away their tears and to bend
once more to their work.</p>

<p>The groups gradually dispersed and found their way back to their
task, whilst Andr&aacute;s, with a sigh and a shake of the head,
mounted his mare and rode off to some farther field, where he found
the same idle groups of men and women, the same superstitious
terror, the same menacing attitude. Till close upon noon he rode
hither and thither, in spite of the fact that as the sun rose
higher over his head he could less and less shake off a feeling of
dark presentiment which against his better judgment gradually
filled his mind; until at last he found that instead of upbraiding
and cheering the superstitious or the discontented he was listening
with awe and in silence to the various tales of terror or of evil
his own workpeople were never weary to relate. Tired, enervated,
and anxious, he rode home at midday for his meal. The farmhouse of
Kisfalu was now exceedingly homelike and comfortable. Andr&aacute;s
had built an outhouse to which he had relegated kitchen and
wash-house, whilst the main little building, with a picturesque
veranda running round it covered with sweet-scented honeysuckle and
jessamine, was kept entirely for living-rooms. The big sitting-room
cut the house as it were in half, from the front door, which opened
on to the veranda, to the two windows opposite, which looked out on
the immeasurable puszta beyond. From it right and left opened four
rooms, two at each side, which were the bedrooms, those on the left
being newly built, and beautifully papered and painted.</p>

<p>As Andr&aacute;s entered, the room was half in darkness, the
rays of the sun being well-tempered by cool-looking green shutters.
Close to the window, getting the only ray of daylight necessary for
her work, sat old Kem&eacute;ny Etelka at her spinning. Drowsily in
the noonday heat her bare feet turned the wheel, while in low, soft
tones she hummed to herself snatches of melancholy Hungarian
songs.</p>

<p>There was no beauty about the rugged face now; whatever charm of
freshness it may have possessed in youth was obliterated during the
long years of patient slavery Etelka had undergone beneath the
dreary roof of her miserly lord. There were deep lines of
humiliations and sufferings patiently endured round the drooping
mouth, and the eyes looked dull and lustreless from many shed and
unshed tears. But at the sound of her son&rsquo;s heavy tread on
the veranda the old face became radiant with a happy smile, and
seemed suddenly transfigured: the eyes sparkled and the white teeth
that peeped between the shrivelled lips gave quite a renewed look
of youth to the melancholy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Isten hozta!</i> [God has brought you] my son,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you are earlier than I expected. S&aacute;ri,
Katinka,&rdquo; she called loudly, &ldquo;bring the
<i>guly&aacute;s</i> [stew] at once, the master is home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had entered very dejectedly; he threw his hat on
one side, then having kissed his mother:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing with the fellows, mother, to-day. They
seem unable to work; hardly is my back turned when all eyes stare
straight across the puszta to where a column of black smoke reminds
them of that accursed steam-mill. I am thankful you have closed the
shutters so that I can see nothing more of that invention of the
devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you call it so, my son,&rdquo; said
Etelka with a sigh; &ldquo;you know what I used to tell you about
it when first Rosenstein said that my lord was going to grind his
corn with the help of fire and smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, dear, you are a saint, and as I am sure you must
have been in heaven some time or other in your life you must have
learned there that the devil does not trouble himself much about
our concerns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! but my son, how can you talk like that? Pater
Ambrosius himself says the devil walks about the earth trying to
tempt souls to be wicked and to go to hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, but he does not get into engines and drive
them; the steam does that. I have read about it in books. I do not
understand the things, and I do not think I want to; I am sure my
flour last year fetched a higher price than any in the country, and
if it is every year as fine and white as last I shall never want to
better my farming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile, Andr&aacute;s, it is terrible to
think that my lord&rsquo;s folly drags so many of our dear friends
at Bidesk&uacute;t into the clutches of Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was about to reply, when his mother placed a
warning finger on her mouth. The two pretty peasant girls came in
who did Etelka&rsquo;s household work, two little orphan girls who
had lost their father and mother a few years back in the last
cholera epidemic, and whom Etelka had brought to Kisfalu, and
taught to cook, to wash, and to spin. They were bringing in the
steaming <i>guly&aacute;s</i> (stew), the roasted potatoes, and
baskets of melons and peaches for dinner, carrying the heavy dishes
on their small heads, and supporting them with one graceful curved
arm, while the other was placed akimbo on the hip.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s jumped up merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh! mother dear, there is nothing like a good dish of
guly&aacute;s to make one forget one&rsquo;s troubles; here
S&aacute;ri, my pretty one, give me a kiss and the biggest jug you
have in your kitchen so that I may go and draw the wine; we shall
all want plenty to drink, for it is hot out in the fields, I can
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Andr&aacute;s went to draw the wine in the brick cellar
which he had built on the shady side of the house, S&aacute;ri and
Kati spread the substantial fare; on the oak table, polished till
it shone like a mirror, they had placed the savoury stew, the
potatoes, and fruit. At the head of the table came the
mistress&rsquo;s arm-chair and next to it the master&rsquo;s. They
themselves had their places at the bottom of the table. While
waiting for her son, Etelka had distributed the
<i>guly&aacute;s</i> in heavy glazed earthenware plates, and as
soon as Andr&aacute;s came back with the jug in his hand, all fell
to with spoon and knife, while the master poured the wine out in
mugs for everybody.</p>

<p>But the meal was not as merry as usual. Both Etelka and
Andr&aacute;s were anxious and silent, and the two little maids
dared not chatter. They felt awed and sad, for they had never seen
the master so quiet. One of them dropped a few tears in her plate;
she thought something dreadful must have happened.</p>

<p>When each had finished her mug of wine and, Etelka having risen,
the plates and dishes were removed, Andr&aacute;s was able to speak
on the subject that was so near to his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I have been thinking the last half-hour, while
eating the <i>guly&aacute;s</i>, that I am very lazy and
good-for-nothing not to try and see whether I cannot even at this
last moment persuade my lord to give up his obstinate ideas about
that cursed mill. I cannot help thinking Rosenstein must have been
only half-hearted when he told my lord for me of all the evils
which I know will come if he will go on irritating the peasants
with those new-fangled notions of his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenstein declared that my lord would not listen to any
talk. He has set his heart on those cursed mills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had resumed her spinning, and the drone of the wheel made a
gentle accompaniment to their talk. Andr&aacute;s felt enervated,
still vaguely anxious; he was walking up and down the long narrow
room, and every now and then, impatiently, he pushed aside the
shutters and gazed with a deep frown between his brows at the cloud
of black smoke which still rose out there, far ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Pater Ambrosius ever spoke about it to my
lord?&rdquo; he mused aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kind Pater would not dare say much, for fear of
irritating my lord against him, and then he would have to leave his
church of &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s where he has been over
forty years. This would break his heart. No! no!&rdquo; added the
old woman, &ldquo;the Pater would not dare speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, mother, I will dare,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s resolutely. &ldquo;It is not too late, and I am sure
I shall find the right words in my heart with which to persuade my
lord of all the unhappiness his folly is causing, all the anxiety
and the fright. He must be a kind man, he will listen to me. After
all,&rdquo; he added, throwing his head back and standing very
erect, &ldquo;I employ as many hands as he does; I have lent him
enough money to give me the right to speak to him, if I want to. I
can buy his whole cursed mill from him and then destroy it if I
choose, and I would do it whatever price he may ask for it sooner
than see all the men surly and defiant, and hear the women cry as I
did to-day. Give me your blessing, mother; I will ride to
Bidesk&uacute;t at once. It is not too late yet to drive the devil
to the other side of the Tarna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my son,&rdquo; said Etelka, but she shook
her head. &ldquo;The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t is a proud man, he
will not listen to a peasant,&rdquo; she urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A peasant! who could buy every foot of land he owns even
after he had lent him the purchase money twice over already,&rdquo;
retorted Andr&aacute;s proudly. &ldquo;Mother, do not discourage
me. The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t owes me much; he must be grateful,
if he is a man, for the loan of my money, which he has almost got
as a gift, and which keeps him out of the clutches of the Jews. He
must render me service for service and sell me his fad, so that I
may destroy it. Send word round to the fields that the men can go
quietly back to work. To-morrow we will begin to pull down that
mill of the devil, and send the machinery back to hell.&rdquo; He
was quite happy now and his mother heard him singing all the way to
the stables, and talk merry nonsense to his mare as he stroked her
sleek neck, and whispered to her whither he meant to take her. Two
minutes after that Etelka, having raised the shutters, looked out
on to the plains as her handsome son galloped past, swinging his
hat in wild delight. She watched him until he and his mare were but
a mere speck on the blue horizon, then she again shook her head,
but there was a proud look on her face, and a tear of joy in her
eye as she once more settled down to her spinning.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12" id=

Lord And Peasant</b>
</h2>

<p>Andr&aacute;s rode gaily and full of hope across the desolate
puszta, his mind busy in arranging the best plan with which to
overthrow my lord&rsquo;s resistance, should he prove obstinate in
the nursing of his folly. The peasant never for a moment supposed
that the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t would not immediately see in their
right light all the evils which were gathering over his head, and
all the sorrows and haunting terrors his unnecessary fads were
causing among those who were to a great extent dependent upon their
lord for wage. He had left his own fields behind and to the left,
and his mare galloped across the plain, throwing clouds of dust
round her as her hoofs fell on the sandy soil. The sun shone
glaring overhead. The heat was intense, but Andr&aacute;s felt
neither dust nor glare of sun; his eyes were riveted on that
distant column of smoke, which he hoped to smother by the strength
of his will, exerted to its fullest extent on behalf of his
fellow-workers, his servant comrades. Of the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t he knew nothing. When years ago he decided to place
the vast wealth his father had left him at small interest with my
lord, a certain shyness, born of long suppression and loneliness,
had induced him to employ the Jew Rosenstein as an intermediary;
and as years went on and the transaction continued, the inborn
hatred of every Hungarian peasant for all money-lending business
had kept him away from the aristocratic borrower. He longed to buy
Kisfalu. This was his dream. He was willing enough to pay double or
treble its value for the happiness of owning that beloved land. But
Rosenstein, who made a usurious profit out of trafficking with
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s money, kept lord and peasant apart; neither
knew how willing the other would have been to conclude the
transaction once for all. The interest, paid in kind, Rosenstein
collected for, and subsequently bought from, Kem&eacute;ny. The
rents of Kisfalu Andr&aacute;s paid entirely in money, and the
noble lord, always in want of cash, sent his bailiff every
quarter-day for the gold. Thus the game of hide-and-seek went on,
in which Rosenstein was the only winner, the other two merely
dupes. Andr&aacute;s, however, firmly believed that though
Bidesk&uacute;ty had repeatedly refused to sell Kisfalu to a
peasant, yet a feeling of gratitude must exist in his heart towards
that same peasant who was willing to keep him out of the
Jews&rsquo; clutches by exacting but a nominal interest for his
money. On that feeling of gratitude Andr&aacute;s meant to rely
when formulating his request: he was willing enough to part with
more money if he could buy and destroy what caused so much sorrow
in the village and on the fields.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;t lay the other side of the wide plain, and to
reach the big house, Andr&aacute;s had to gallop many miles through
the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t&rsquo;s property. Here, as in Kisfalu,
the work in the fields was idle; Andr&aacute;s could see small
groups of labourers talking excitedly and pointing with menacing
fists towards the steam-mill close by on the left. He would not
stop to speak to them, though many hailed him with a shout. He was
sick at heart with these terrors he could not alleviate.</p>

<p>He kept to the main road, down the alley of poplars, which threw
narrow, gaunt shadows across, that looked like long arms stretched
menacingly towards the mill. It was still emitting volumes of smoke
through its tall chimney, and Andr&aacute;s was glad that it lay
well to the left, away from the main road, and that he was not
obliged to lead Csillag past the dreaded building.</p>

<p>He wished to keep his spirits up, and talked gaily to the mare.
A group of a dozen labourers barred the way ahead, in front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! friend Andr&aacute;s! whither so quickly?&rdquo;
they shouted from afar. Andr&aacute;s, perforce, had to slacken the
mare&rsquo;s speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pass,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;I am on my
way to Bidesk&uacute;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not go there, Andr&aacute;s, the devil is at
work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to drive the devil away that I am going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot do it; go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they all stood in a ring round horse and rider, so that
Andr&aacute;s perforce had to stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see those stacks, Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo; said one
of the men; &ldquo;that wheat is to be threshed and ground into
flour, all within a day, and never the hand of thresher or miller
is to touch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the eternal story told with blanched cheeks and quivering
lips. Oh! for wings with which to fly to Bidesk&uacute;t and stop
this worship of devil&rsquo;s work before it be too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me pass, Miska,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s cheerily,
&ldquo;we will stop the devil and his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will you do it, friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my secret; let me pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can do nothing; and if harm comes to you, there will
be nobody to look after us in winter, now that my lord employs no
labour and lets Satan do his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! leave me alone about Satan,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, impatiently. &ldquo;Leave Csillag alone, or she will
rear. I tell you I am going to stop the devil and his work. I give
you my word no wheat shall be ground inside that mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my word! There! let Csillag go! God be with you
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men obediently stood aside, and with a merry farewell he
galloped off down the road towards the great gates of
Bidesk&uacute;t. The peasants turned awhile to look after him; some
shook their heads, but all murmured, &ldquo;God be with you,
Andr&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the gates Andr&aacute;s brought the mare to a standstill. He
had never ridden up the majestic acacia drive, and a certain
feeling of awe, born of centuries of peasant submission to their
lord, made him dismount and start to walk up towards the house.
Csillag remained outside, waiting patiently for her master, as safe
from thieves&rsquo; hands as she would be in her own stables. No
one could have mounted her against her will except her master. She
looked about for a shady spot, and there she retired, content to
wait till he came back.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s followed the long sweet-scented alley; from afar
he could hear the sounds of gaiety within the castle, loud peals of
boisterous laughter, and lively <i>czig&aacute;ny</i> music, shouts
of &ldquo;<i>&Eacute;ljen!</i>&rdquo; and the clinking of knives
and forks against the china. The long-taught deference of the
peasant for the noble induced him to avoid the main entrance and
noble staircase. He turned towards the left side of the building
from which proceeded laughter of no less boisterous kind, together
with delicious scents of roast meats and fragrant fruit.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s pushed open the wide double doors and found
himself in the vast kitchen, where two days before Rosenstein the
Jew had been made to break the laws of his religion in order to
gratify the whim of a spendthrift lord.</p>

<p>As merry as ever, but busy beyond description, the cooks,
kitchen-maids, and scullions filled the vast kitchen with laughter,
chatter, and animation. A universal shout of astonishment, but of
real joy, greeted Andr&aacute;s as he entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has brought you, Andr&aacute;s!&rdquo; shouted
Benk&oacute;, the portly cook. &ldquo;Here Zsuzsi, bring a chair,
quick! No, not that one! the big arm-chair! Panna, wipe the table,
quickly! Miska, bring that fine piece of lamb! Friend
Andr&aacute;s, you will surely honour it by tasting it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And young kitchen-maids and scullions busied themselves round
the unexpected guest. He was a stranger to these walls, but not
indeed to any of their inmates. Every peasant in the county knew
him, loved him, owed him gratitude for some kindness or other,
whether he were labourer or servant, man or maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye! Thank ye, all!&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
putting up his hand, to parry some of the more boisterous welcomes.
&ldquo;I have not come to eat my lords meat in his kitchen, though
all of you are welcome to eat mine at my mothers table. To-day I
have come to speak with my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but I do not think you can do that,&rdquo; said fat
Benk&oacute;, the cook. &ldquo;My lord has company, nearly two
hundred barons and baronesses, counts and countesses are dining up
there in the great hall. Hey! if you could only taste some of the
delicious things I have dished up for the midday meal!&rdquo; he
sighed with professional pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my lord cannot stay all day at his meal, and what I
have to say to him is of the greatest importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will wait,&rdquo; said Benk&oacute;, scratching
his head, thoughtfully, &ldquo;till Jank&oacute; comes down, he can
whisper in my lord&rsquo;s ear that you would speak with him, and
then, perhaps&mdash;. And here is Jank&oacute;,&rdquo; he added, as
that worthy appeared at the door, &ldquo;Jank&oacute;, come here,
this is Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s of Kisfalu. Bow to him,
Jank&oacute;, as you would to my lord. . . . And now listen,
Jank&oacute;, Andr&aacute;s wishes to speak to my lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His lordship does not like being interrupted at
dinner,&rdquo; said Jank&oacute;, thoughtfully scratching his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; says Andr&aacute;s impatiently,
&ldquo;you are all very good and kind fellows, but there is a
little too much talking. I am in a hurry. Go up, Jank&oacute;,
there&rsquo;s a good man, and whisper in my lord&rsquo;s ear that
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, from Kisfalu, wishes to speak with him
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will reply,&rdquo; said Jank&oacute; meekly,
&ldquo;that Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s may go to the
devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! he will not say that, Jank&oacute;,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, quietly; &ldquo;but if he does, tell him that it is
a matter which may cost him very dearly, if he does not hear it in
good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a curious thing that every one always did exactly what
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s wanted. There was a great deal of
familiarity between him and every peasant for leagues around. His
wealth he did not in any way consider as having placed him above
his equals, but he had learned to command, because his will was
strong and self-centred, and having in his early youth learned
implicit obedience he knew how to enforce it, now that he was his
own master. Jank&oacute; went off shaking his head dubiously.</p>

<p>Silence had fallen on the inmates of the kitchen. Perhaps they
felt that they had been a little too familiar with the rich farmer
who came to speak with my lord. Panna shyly had dusted the big
arm-chair, and stood irresolute as to whether she should draw it
near the table. Benk&oacute; had sent the scullions flying in every
direction, and had respectfully placed a bottle of wine and a glass
on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you honour us all, Andr&aacute;s, by drinking
this wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! with the greatest pleasure, Benk&oacute;, my good
fellow! If it was your wine, I tell you I should drink that bottle
full, and ask for more. But till I know if his lordship is friend
or foe, I will not drink his wine. Panna my soul, give up dusting
that chair, it is almost as smoothly polished as your own pretty
cheeks. No! I will not drink the wine of Bidesk&uacute;t, but I
tell you what! I will kiss all its pretty girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And laughing Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s took each pretty
kitchen-maid by the waist and since they did not struggle very
hard, he soon had made each one as pink as a peony. This restored
merriment all round. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was not proud!
Long live Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s! When Jank&oacute; came back
with the astonishing announcement that my lord would see
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s in his smoking-room, he found the
latter sitting, all smiles, in the big arm-chair, with a dozen
pretty faces beaming at him from every side of the kitchen.</p>

<p>To reach my lord&rsquo;s smoking-room Jank&oacute; had to lead
Andr&aacute;s up the great staircase and across one end of the main
hall, where the noble lord of Bidesk&uacute;t was exercising his
boundless hospitality towards his aristocratic guests.
Andr&aacute;s as he hurried through behind the
<i>czig&aacute;ny</i>, so as to pass unperceived, caught a sudden
fitful vision of bright-coloured dresses, pretty faces, and gay
uniforms that reminded him of the tangled bit of garden where roses
and lilies grew wild, and which his mother tended, outside the
house at Kisfalu.</p>

<p>Jank&oacute; left him alone in the smoking-room, and
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s looked round him, astonished at what
seemed to him visions of beauty and luxury of which he had never
dreamed. He thought of his own little low-roofed sitting-room,
where his mother sat spinning all the day, so different to this
place, which, simple as it was, surpassed any ideas he may ever
have had of gorgeousness and elegance.</p>

<p>How long he stood waiting, planted there where Jank&oacute; had
left him, he could not have said. Dreamily he gazed out on to the
park with its standard rose trees and many-coloured glass balls,
which glittered in the sun, and his ears were agreeably tickled by
the merry peals of laughter from the big hall; one or two high
silvery tones struck him now and then as the prettiest tune he had
ever heard. He looked at all this luxury, and wondered how a man
could wilfully risk losing all that, for the sake of a cursed fad,
how he could risk being forced to leave this gorgeous house, those
rosebushes, and the sight of those gaily-decked butterflies, who
laughed so merrily in the great hall. Any man owning all these
things, calling the land on which he stood his, was a fool to
jeopardise an inch of it for the sake of a wicked caprice. . .
.</p>

<p>The opening and shutting of a door, and a very stiff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has brought you,&rdquo; interrupted
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s meditations, and forced him to turn round to
where stood the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t. He saw a merry, kindly
face, a little haughty perhaps, but still&mdash;. Andr&aacute;s
gazed ruefully at his own peasant attire, his hard brown hands, his
leather belt, and shirt-sleeves, and understood how my lord would
feel that there was, in spite of money affairs, still a wide
difference between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; asked Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri, as
he sat down and took one of his long pipes from the rack. He did
not ask Andr&aacute;s to sit or to smoke, and while he filled his
pipe he looked with a great deal of curiosity at the handsome young
peasant whose riches were reported to be fabulous. Though he had
often seen him in the village or in the fields he never had had an
opportunity of standing face to face with him, or of talking to
him.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had lost any latent shyness. He had frowned a
little when he saw that my lord sat down and left him to stand like
one of his servants. However, he knew that he must be patient if he
wished to be listened to at all, and quite quietly he drew a chair
towards him, and also sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I have to say,&rdquo; he began resolutely,
&ldquo;will not take long. I know your lordship is kept very much
in ignorance of many things that happen on your
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you have not come all the way from Kisfalu to tell
me of those things which I do not know?&rdquo; laughed
Bidesk&uacute;ty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, most noble lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s.
&ldquo;It would save time if your lordship would let me tell you my
errand without interrupting me. One of the things your lordship
does not know is, that there is at the present moment terrible
dissatisfaction for leagues around in the village and on the
fields. The peasantry are frightened. They do not understand things
very clearly, and nobody has been at much pains to explain anything
to them. To-day they are in a very dejected, terror-stricken mood,
to-morrow, who knows? they might get infuriated, and it is not good
to irritate a lowland peasant too far. He is like the puszta,
smooth and at peace as a calm lake; but once let the winds from
heaven stir it up, and banks of sand which were harmless enough
rise like columns towards the sky, and woe betide then, if anything
happen to stand in its way. Higher and higher the sand will rise,
lashed by the fury of the wind, and when it can rise no more, it
will sink crashing to the ground, burying beneath it all human life
that has tried to stand up and oppose it in its wrath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk like a book, my friend,&rdquo; said my lord,
smiling, and puffing away at his pipe, &ldquo;but you talked of
saving time, and I do not yet know the purpose of your
errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to plead for the poor, the ignorant, on your
lordship&rsquo;s estate. There are hundreds there who for
generations have worked God&rsquo;s bountiful earth for you and
your forefathers, sowing and reaping, threshing and grinding the
fine corn and flour, which is famed throughout the world. They have
toiled and you have earned; but they are content; they want to go
on serving you, my lord; they are willing to take wage from you,
and remain poor but free from want, almost slaves but happy on our
beautiful lowland, on which God has sent a special
blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very good of them, I am sure, my friend, and I
certainly have no intention of getting labourers to work for me
from a neighbouring county. I shall not want as many hands at the
mills, as I did, for, I am thankful to say, my steam-mill is ready,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my lord, if I interrupt. It is that mill
which is causing so much trouble. Remember, we are not all so
clever as your lordship; we do not understand all the means by
which fire and iron can be made to do the work of our hands. It has
raised great fears in the minds of the women, the men themselves,
though they will not admit their terror, curse under their breath
the contrivance which will take the bread out of their mouth for
want of sufficient wage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my good man, I have spent thousands on that mill.
Surely you are not fool enough to suppose that I am going to give
up the work of years, because a lot of superstitious old women have
talked you all into some devilish nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not because of that,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
earnestly, &ldquo;I do not think your lordship will give up all
that work for the sake of some nonsense. But I do firmly believe
that you will do it in order to save all the poor people on your
estate from further sorrow and anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My worthy fellow, I have said before you talk like a
book. But there is much nonsense written in books sometimes. Did
you not hear me say, that my steam-mill, which you all will
presently be grateful for on your knees, has cost me a quarter of a
million?&mdash;do you think I am likely to throw that money
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, your lordship need not do that,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, eagerly; &ldquo;the mill has cost a quarter of a
million? well, I will buy it from you if you will name what money
you like; three, four hundred thousand florins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
sarcastically, &ldquo;you take me for a bigger fool than yourself,
my friend. You want to buy the mill, do you? and work it at your
own profit! Oho! not a bad idea! and this pretty story of anxious
mothers, infuriated peasants, and storms on the puszta, was very
clever no doubt. But remain assured, my friend, the mill is not for
sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship thinks it sport to laugh at a
peasant,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, imperturbably, &ldquo;but your
honour is deceived: I offer to buy the mill, and when you have
agreed to sell it I will destroy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroy the mill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! all my labourers, who now stand about idly letting
the corn fall to earth for want of mowing, will only be too happy
to dig their pickaxes into the hated building, and my quarter of a
million will have been well spent in seeing them all cheerfully at
work again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But man, are you made of money?&rdquo; gasped
Bidesk&uacute;ty, forgetting for a moment the point at issue in his
admiration for the wealth that was unconsciously flaunted before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father saved all his life: he was a clever worker, and
he left me plenty,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, proudly; &ldquo;your
lordship knows that I have enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know? I hear many rumours, and you live in
that tumble-down old farm at Kisfalu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother loves the house, since I was born there, and I
love it, because she dwells in it. I do not have a hundred guests
at my table, but I would spend all the money I have to see the
county of Heves beaming with smiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insolence!&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty, frowning,
&ldquo;are you trying to preach to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, my lord, I have no wish to be presumptuous.
See! I have brought money with me. Plenty of it,&rdquo; he added,
tapping his ponderous leather belt; &ldquo;will your lordship name
the price, and let me bury my pickaxe in the very top of that tall
chimney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, fellow, you are a fool. Ay! and a knave,
trying to trick me to further your own ends; I tell you if any one
is to make money out of that mill, I will. I will not sell it, not
if you were to lay out this floor with your Jewish gold, which you
had better use for other Jewish tricks. For this one I am too sharp
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most noble lord! you do not understand! Oh, God! teach me
how to explain to him. The peasants are enraged. They will do
themselves or you some terrible injury. Your honour! remember for
God&rsquo;s sake your own mother, your wife. The peasants think the
devil drives the machinery, they are in terror now, they will be
furious presently, and great, great harm will come of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What harm comes of it will be of your own making,
impudent peasant!&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty, enraged, rising to
his feet. &ldquo;Come now, I have had enough of this. Get out of my
house, I tell you! I will not sell my mill. Is that
enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had become very pale; he too had risen to his
feet, and he buried his finger-nails in his palms, to force
himself, by sheer physical pain, not to retort with angry words,
but for the sake of his friends and comrades to try, by patient and
moderate talk, to break this man&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord! in God&rsquo;s name listen. The poor fellows are
all standing about in the fields, the women whose sons, fathers,
brothers are employed on the mill are terrified of the evil that
will come to them; they moan and sob fit to break a strong
man&rsquo;s heart. If by any chance&mdash;such things do
happen&mdash;any accident should occur to one of them, oh, then
think! how will you pacify them? Infuriated, they will look upon
you as a murderer. They love me, they listen to me; though I am
rich, I have remained one of them, but even I could not stop them
from turning their wrath against you. Remember you have wife and
child, they might come to harm; you never know where an ignorant
man or woman&rsquo;s revenge will stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I tell you, insolent peasant, that if harm comes to
me or mine, that your own hands will have guided the blow, your
lying tongue incited the deed. I can read through your low, miserly
peasant nature, ready for any lie to gain your own
ends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, your honour,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, still
containing himself; &ldquo;I came here in all deference, with
patience and kindness. For the sake of my comrades I would bear
much, but your lordship is forgetting your own dignity and mine. I
have in all money transactions dealt liberally and squarely with
you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have paid your rents punctually, for I should turn
you out of the farm pretty soon if you did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is not all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean not all? What not all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship seems ready to forget that the insolent
peasant&rsquo;s purse has kept you out of the clutches of the Jews
for the past five years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your purse? Are you in league with that bloodsucking
Rosenstein then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship surely knows that the money you spend so
freely originally came out of my purse&mdash;the
papers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! what do I care about papers! How could I guess that
for once in a lifetime the Jew&rsquo;s tale of some other person
who lends the money happened to be true? Well, what matter? Your
beastly Jewish usury does not give you the right to interfere with
my concerns, I pay you your interest, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty was beside himself with fury. His otherwise
good-looking face was distorted with passion. Andr&aacute;s was
still apparently calm, though very pale, the veins on his forehead
swollen like cords. He tried to remain patient with this raving
lunatic, forcing himself to think that in his hands rested the
hopes of the poor fellows out there in the fields who were still
watching the clouds of black smoke darkening the horizon of their
beloved plains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your honour is trying to misunderstand,&rdquo; he said
quietly; &ldquo;it is not my place, I own, to interfere in your
lordship&rsquo;s affairs. I do not wish to interfere. I came here
with a fair offer, because for the past month I have seen the
dissatisfaction, the terrors of your peasantry grow, as you placed
brick upon brick of that unfortunate structure. I did not expect
your lordship to waste all the money you have spent upon it,
therefore I came with a fair offer to buy the building and
machinery so as to have the right to destroy it. If your lordship
suspects my honesty, I am willing to leave the money here, if you
will give me your word of honour that the mill shall be pulled
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Andr&aacute;s drew from his belt a heavy bag which jingled
with the sound of gold and notes, and placed it on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; roared Bidesk&uacute;ty, losing the last
lingering vestige of self-control, for the attack on his beloved
fad had exasperated him beyond measure, &ldquo;Ay! you want to lend
me more of your accursed money, do you? to enrich yourself more and
more at my expense, to extract more and more blood from me. I
looked down upon you as an impudent, low-born peasant before, son
or grandson of a liberated serf, whose female kind, a generation or
two ago had to pay toll with their bodies to their lord before
their husbands could claim them as their own. But now,
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, you, by your own words have shown
yourself to be but a dirty Jew out of the gutter. I have heard that
you all descend from some bastard born of a Jewish waif. Ay! I see
you in your true light. There! take back your money, I have no need
of it; it would sully my valet&rsquo;s hand if he should happen to
touch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with his eyes aglow with rage, cheeks purple, lips
quivering, the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t picked up the heavy bag of
gold, and threw it violently in Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>The proud peasant, who had stood Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s
insults up to the last moment, with the determination not to yield
an inch, and not to leave the house till he had succeeded in his
mission, turned absolutely livid. The heavy bag had grazed his
forehead, leaving an ugly red mark across it, from which two or
three drops of blood began slowly to trickle. For a moment the blow
had stunned him, but the next he had turned on Bidesk&uacute;ty as
some caged lion suddenly let free, his cheeks were deathly pale,
but his eyes literally blazed with pent-up rage, and his muscular
arm was lifted high, menacing above, ready to chastise his arrogant
lord for every insult uttered, ready to exact his life for the last
deadly blow.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty came from a race that in spite&mdash;perhaps
because&mdash;of its want of education, its semi-barbarousness, its
love of gross material pleasures, had never known fear. He
realised, by the look on Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s face, that he had
gone too far; and at the same moment also saw how completely he,
past the prime of life, was at the mercy of this young son of the
soil, to whom the heaped-up insults would give superhuman strength.
His anger cooled in an instant, his cheek turned pale, but he never
for a moment thought of calling for help. Thus for one second only
they stood face to face, the arrogant noble and the deeply wounded
peasant, Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s hand raised ready to strike what
might have been a death-blow. Suddenly a merry laugh outside seemed
to paralyse his arm. Still holding it aloft, he was now gazing
bewildered, fascinated, at the door, which had been noisily thrown
open, and at a vision all in white, with bows of something soft and
blue, and crowned with an aureole of golden curls, from under which
peeped, half-frightened, a pair of eyes like forget-me-nots. What
was it? A bird escaped from its cage? or one of those fairies who,
according to the tales his mother used to tell him long ago, dwelt
inside the petals of the roses, or within the sweet-scented corolla
of the violet?</p>

<p>But the bird sang, the fairy spoke, simple words: but they
seemed to Andr&aacute;s the sweetest music mortal ears had ever
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, may we have a carriage, to drive down and see the
new fishes in the lake?&mdash;Why, papa dear,&rdquo; added the
snow-white vision, &ldquo;how pale you are! Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s hand had dropped numb by his side. His
entranced gaze followed the flower-like vision, as it passed close
to him, to throw a pair of lovely arms, so childlike, yet so
protecting, round his enemy&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty was not a young man; the strain of the last few
moments was heavy for him to bear, and, exhausted, dazed, he sank
in a chair. Ilonka had knelt by his side, and, with pretty
endearing ways, was stroking the matted hair from his forehead.
Andr&aacute;s gazed on; he could not see her face for her back was
turned towards him, but he could see her soft white neck, peeping
from out the folds of her gown, and there were one or two golden
curls just above that made him think of some earthly paradise. She
had not vouchsafed another look to the peasant, who, she vaguely
guessed, had been tiresome, and had angered &ldquo;papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically he passed his hand across his forehead, from which
two or three drops of blood still trickled slowly down his pale
cheek; he stooped and picked up the bag of gold, and fastened it
inside his belt; then he looked once more at the golden vision,
drank in every line of that graceful, girlish figure, as if he
wished never to part from dreams of her again: it was a long,
lingering look, so ardent, so magnetic, that Ilonka must, somehow,
have felt it, for she turned half shyly round, and her tender,
forget-me-not eyes met Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s burning gaze.</p>

<p>The next moment he had left the room, the castle, had crossed
the shady acacia drive, and, calling to Csillag, he jumped upon her
back, and without looking round again, had galloped away across the
<i>puszta</i>.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13" id=
"Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
Vengeance</b>
</h2>

<p>Andras would not allow himself to think, would not allow his
mind to revert, even for one instant, to the last awful moments he
had just gone through. The sun still shone fiercely, though it was
beginning to sink low down in the west, and the wound on his
forehead burned at times like the newly made brand-mark on the
convict&rsquo;s back, the badge of shame. He avoided the main roads
and the fields, dreading to meet the comrades who must be waiting
anxiously for the fulfilment of his promise to them, not daring to
tell them how he had failed in his trust, how he had allowed his
own pride and then a pair of forget-me-not eyes to force him to
quit the battle-field, to turn his back on the enemy before the
victory was won.</p>

<p>On he spurred Csillag across the desolate plain, and her hoofs,
as she thundered past, roused the rooks from their evening rest,
and the drowsy little lizards from their sleep. As he neared
Kisfalu, from every field shouts hailed him, but he heeded them
not, and never stopped Csillag in her wild career till she reached
her own stable door foaming and panting.</p>

<p>With the same tender care as usual, Andr&aacute;s began grooming
the lovely creature, wiping the foam from her quivering haunches,
stroking her ears, and patting her neck. It seemed as if Csillag
understood the bitter thoughts which swelled her master&rsquo;s
heart to bursting, and felt that a kindly feeling of sympathy would
perhaps ease this overburdened heart. Gently she rubbed her sleek
nose against his hand, asking for a caress, some fondling in
return. Her great eyes looked so affectionately, so sorrowfully at
Andr&aacute;s, that his wounded heart at last eased itself in a
passionate outburst of tears. No one saw him, there was no one who
could ever record having seen this sturdy, powerful man for once in
his life under the spell of an emotion which completely
overmastered him. That one act of weakness seemed to take the
bitterness from out the wound. His head resting against the
mare&rsquo;s sleek neck, he cried as he used to do at his
mother&rsquo;s knee, when the stern father&rsquo;s blows had been
more than the child could bear; great sobs shook his powerful
frame, and one of his hands was placed across the mare&rsquo;s
eyes, lest she should see the stigma of shame that burned unavenged
upon his forehead.</p>

<p>When a quarter of an hour later he went into the house to kiss
his mother, there was no trace of tears in his eyes, not a vestige
of the torrent of emotion which had, for a brief moment, threatened
to crush this passionate native of the Hungarian soil. But
Etelka&rsquo;s keen eyes noted at once the look of dejection on his
face, and she shook her head sadly, for she understood that her son
had failed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, taking a sheet of
paper from his breast pocket, and spreading it out on the table
before him, &ldquo;will you put aside your spinning and listen to
this a moment? I want your advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obediently, Etelka pushed the spindle aside, and, folding her
hands before her, prepared to listen. The rays of the now rapidly
setting sun found their way through the small windows, throwing a
halo of light round the old peasant woman. She was accustomed to
being consulted by her son about all his business. Though she
invariably approved of what he had done, he was not happy until she
had said that she was satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember, mother, all three documents which I hold
from my lord, about the money I have lent him, and about the
interest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my boy, I remember them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to read them over to you, mother, and I want you
to weigh again very carefully in your mind if there is anything
unfair in the dealings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know there was nothing unfair in them, Andr&aacute;s,
and the interest was very low, too low, in fact, I
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but mother, this is important,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s earnestly, &ldquo;it is a matter of life and death to
me. You must listen to every word, as if you had never heard them
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am listening, Andr&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of these papers is now five years old, mother; it is
dated in April, 1855. It says: &lsquo;I owe you 300,000 florins in
gold; for this, until I repay you in full, I will pay you interest
every year, one hundred head of cattle, of which there will be ten
bulls and ninety cows, and five thousand measures of wheat. If in
any year I fail to pay you this interest, and on your then
demanding the repayment of the principal, I am unable to give it to
you, then the farmhouse of Kisfalu and all the fields, vineyards,
and buildings from the N&aacute;dasdy <i>puszta</i> to the town of
B&eacute;la, and from the banks of the Tarna to the high-road
opposite, shall belong to you absolutely and you will then have no
further claim on the 300,000 florins you have lent me.&rsquo; This
is signed Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri, and below is Rosenstein&rsquo;s
name as witness. There is the stamp on it which the government
demands and for which I paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s paused and looked anxiously at his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you wanted to
increase your herd of cows; it is reasonable, my son, quite fair:
for each cow which you sold for money to Rosenstein afterwards you
had from 150 to 200 florins. It is not only fair, my son, it is
generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second paper, mother, is for 300,000 florins, and it
says: &lsquo;I will pay you five thousand measures of wheat, twelve
thousand measures of maize, and one hundred head of sheep, of which
five shall be rams, and if I fail to pay the interest in any one
year, and, on your demanding it, also fail to repay you the
principal, then my fields, vineyards, and dependencies of
Bidesk&uacute;t, and all buildings save the house I live in and the
adjoining stables, shall become yours absolutely.&rsquo; This paper
is dated three years later, and is signed like the
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as generous as you could allow it, Andr&aacute;s.
You know the Jews would exact ten times that amount, and
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third paper, mother,&rdquo; continued Andr&aacute;s,
&ldquo;was signed two days ago: it is for 250,000 florins, for
which my lord has promised me in writing, five thousand measures of
wheat, and forty head of cattle, and for which he has given me
Z&aacute;rda as security, on the same conditions as the
others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a spendthrift, and improvident man,&rdquo; said the
old woman, shaking her head; &ldquo;if he had borrowed all that
money from the Jews, he would by now be a ruined man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do firmly believe, mother,&rdquo; repeated
Andr&aacute;s earnestly, &ldquo;that I am doing no deed of usury,
which would cause you to blush for your son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Andr&aacute;s, I firmly believe that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you swear it, mother, on the crucifix?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He detached a rough wooden image of the Saviour of mankind from
the whitewashed wall, and with trembling hand held it close to his
mother&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it by our Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; she said,
reverently kissing the dumb piece of wood. A deep sigh of relief
escaped Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s oppressed chest; he placed the
crucifix back in its place, then drew a chair close to his
mother&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>The old woman did not quite understand what her son was driving
at, but her motherly heart felt that he was in some trouble, and
she was content to ask nothing, only to try and soothe her boy now,
as she had done ever since he was a wee lad, and had come to her,
after his stern father&rsquo;s buffetings, for comfort. Gently she
stroked the hair away from his forehead.
&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;where did you get
this blow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t dealt it, mother!&rdquo; he
said impetuously, &ldquo;and it has remained unavenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord struck you, Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, and I was coward enough not to return the
blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Andr&aacute;s, I am anxious, I do not
understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Andr&aacute;s tried to tell her from beginning to end his
fruitless interview with the noble lord; he told her how he had
explained at first, begged from that man, who was even then making
merry with a hundred guests, to have some pity for the weak, the
ignorant and unhappy. He told her of the noble lord&rsquo;s
arrogance, his insults, his blows. It was such a relief to tell her
all. The mother&rsquo;s heart, ignorant, uneducated as she was,
understood and sympathised, knew how to soothe and to make him
forget. He told her all, of how a girlish arm had placed itself
protectingly round her father&rsquo;s neck, making numb his own,
which had been raised ready to return blow for blow. But what he
did not tell, not even to the gentle consoler, the fond, indulgent
mother, was that, since that moment, a fairy vision, crowned with
golden curls, always danced before his gaze, making fun of him,
with smiling for-get-me-not eyes; that he had galloped across the
plain to try and leave that vision behind, but that she followed
him, even to this simple farmhouse, which suddenly had begun to
Andr&aacute;s to look so bare, so poor, so unworthy even to hold
the flitting vision of an aristocratic girl. What he did not tell
was that suddenly his peasant clothes seemed rough and dirty, his
hands hard and brown, his step heavy, that he would have longed to
stretch out his arm and grasp the enchanting vision, but felt how
rough he was, how far, very far, away beneath it, and that his arms
then dropped down numb by his side, and great tears of shame and
envy trickled slowly down his cheeks.</p>

<p>The mother, though dimly guessing that something else was
weighing heavily on her son&rsquo;s soul besides the insult and the
blow, yet found in her heart plenty of love with which to make him
forget all save the happiness of home, the joys of sitting at his
mother&rsquo;s knee. The sun had quite sunk down, far out in the
west; great dark shadows collected in the corners of the room.
S&aacute;ri and Kati brought in the candles, and the evening meal.
But it was eaten in silence; mother and son felt weighted with the
presentiment of coming evil.</p>

<p>The meal was cleared away. Andr&aacute;s had asked that the
candles might be taken away; he longed to sit quietly in the dark,
close to his mother, her fond, sympathising hand resting on his
burning forehead, so as to chase away the devils of hatred and
revenge which ran riot in his brain. He longed for peace and
darkness too because he wanted to indulge in the nursing of a
certain fairy vision, which in broad, prosy light, his own
common-sense told him to chase away, but which in the gloom, became
akin to a dream, from which the awaking, perhaps, would not be so
bitter.</p>

<p>How long mother and son sat there, in the dark, they hardly
knew; the flight of evening hours is not counted on this spot of
earth where clocks are rare.</p>

<p>Etelka, who had no flitting visions on which to dwell, had
closed her eyes, and her quiet breathing made a soothing
accompaniment to Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s wakeful dreams. Suddenly it
seemed as if a curious light were discernible through the open
casement, out beyond the desolate plain, on the horizon far away.
Andr&aacute;s had sprung to his feet, and gazed out, not
understanding at first the lurid light which gradually illumined
the sky. A hurried, anxious knock at the outer door had also
aroused Etelka, and the two little maids had run in, looking very
frightened. Every mind, even the simplest, had been on tension the
whole day, and when S&aacute;ri and Kati had first noticed the
curious light which came from neither moon nor sun, they rushed,
terror-stricken, to their master for comfort and explanation.</p>

<p>But Andr&aacute;s had become very pale, and Etelka now was
gazing out, horrified, her cheeks blanched with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; she whispered, awe-struck, under her
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! it is fire, mother, fire, on the Bidesk&uacute;t
estate. The maize fields lie just there,&rdquo; replied
Andr&aacute;s, &ldquo;and there has been no rain for two weeks; the
fields will burn like hay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire seems to come from two or three different
points. It is God&rsquo;s judgment on my lord,&rdquo; said Etelka,
superstitiously crossing herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I am going to see if I can be of any help; let
S&aacute;ri and Kati run out and send any of our fellows they may
meet, as fast as they can. Here are the keys of the stables; they
must choose the fastest horses, and follow at once. And you, mother
dear, while I am gone,&rdquo; he added, solemnly, &ldquo;kneel down
before your crucifix, and pray to God that He may stay His
vengeance from the heads of those who have planned this murderous
deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And hastily kissing his mother, Andr&aacute;s was once more at
the stable and soon had started off to ride towards
Bidesk&uacute;t.</p>

<p>Far out ahead, the deep, red light had spread right across the
horizon. Through the absolute silence of the night, across the vast
immensity of the plain, could be heard weird, terrified cries from
afar: the frightened lowing of cattle, the bleating of frightened
sheep, the cries of the juh&aacute;sz (shepherds) as they
endeavoured to drive their herds for safety on to the bleak and
arid plain.</p>

<p>Faster and faster the red light spread, and, as Andr&aacute;s
galloped on, herds of wild horses thundered past him, terrified,
their manes flying, their tails lashing out furiously.</p>

<p>Already he could see the flames, spreading with terrible
rapidity across the fields, where he knew the corn lay, stacked,
the most helpless prey to the fury of the flames. The plain,
usually so silent and peaceful at night, under the blue vault of
heaven, beneath the glittering stars, was now alive with
terror-stricken cries, which seemed to rise from everywhere. A
slight summer breeze fanned the flames, and spread them eastwards
over rich maize fields, wooden sheds, and even stables.
Andr&aacute;s galloped on, his heart full of dark foreboding,
gazing at the fire kindled by God&rsquo;s hands, his mother had
said, to punish the arrogant lord.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14" id=

Calamity</b>
</h2>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had had a severe shock in his interview with
his wealthy tenant, and it took him some little time to resume his
cordial <i>bonhomie</i>, and to restore his animal spirits to their
usual elasticity. A feeling he could not have explained had
deterred him from relating the particulars of the interview to his
guests, and thus finding solace to his wrath, by listening to their
violent abuse of the meddlesome and insolent peasant.</p>

<p>Somehow Bidesk&uacute;ty was not altogether satisfied with
himself. He felt just a little ashamed of his unwarrantable
hastiness towards this man, whom it would have been decidedly in
his interest to conciliate, and win over to the side of his pet
hobbies. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s prestige among the
peasantry he knew to be boundless, and a little in spite of himself
he was forced to admit that he could well understand the handsome
young peasant&rsquo;s cheering influence. Surely he was a fool not
to have made an ally of this man, instead of, by insults and a
blow, making a bitter and deadly enemy of him. Never for a moment
did he regret not having sold him the mill: he was firmly convinced
that the peasant&rsquo;s motives in wishing to buy it were not as
disinterested as he stated them to be. But now that he knew that
the money of which he always was in need really came from the
peasant&rsquo;s purse, he regretted not having concluded some
amicable treaty, by which he might have persuaded Andr&aacute;s not
to charge such usurious interest on his capital as that
blood-sucking intermediary of his, Rosenstein, demanded. By making
a mortal enemy of his creditor, Bidesk&uacute;ty foresaw every kind
of hostility to which he might in future be subjected, and probably
the finding of the purse strings tightly closed, when next he would
require a loan.</p>

<p>Most of the afternoon Bidesk&uacute;ty had sat silent, and
decidedly sulky, apart from his guests, and seeking consolation for
his ruffled temper in the soothing clouds he drew from his
cherry-wood pipe. As for Ilonka, she was much too childish to
understand the terrible situation which her sudden entrance had
interrupted. She little guessed that it was her own unconscious
beauty which had averted from her father&rsquo;s head what might
have proved a death-blow, and from a mans soul what would have been
lifelong remorse. She had only caught sight of a tall,
broad-shouldered figure of a peasant who, evidently, had much
angered papa, and who had looked at her in a way that she could not
quite understand, and certainly had not the power to analyse. But
all this she had forgotten by the time the evening shadows had
rendered the garden cool; like her mother&rsquo;s curtain lecture
of the night before, she had thrown off every unpleasant sensation
in order to enjoy the present as she found it.</p>

<p>She and all her younger guests had devised, for the
night&rsquo;s entertainment, an absolutely novel form of enjoyment.
Topsy-turvydom was called to assist in making the walls of
Bidesk&uacute;t ring with laughter that shook them to their
foundations, and made stern Attila totter on his pedestal. Truly it
was a motley throng which filed up the great stone staircase and
through the vast halls of the old mansion. Pretty, laughing faces
peeped above male attire, while bearded faces looked irresistibly
comic from beneath feminine headgear. The order was that all the
girls should appear in men&rsquo;s clothes, and all the men in what
articles of feminine attire they could manage to borrow.</p>

<p>The lumber room had been ransacked, where generations of
Bidesk&uacute;tys had stored away apparel which had become too
antiquated to wear, and in great oak chests, dainty, high-waisted
dresses of the beginning of last century, and rich brocades and
hooped skirts of grandmother&rsquo;s days, were found in gorgeous
plenty. Grandfather&rsquo;s brass-buttoned coats, with high stock
collar and sugar-loaf hat, and great-grandfather&rsquo;s gorgeously
embroidered plum-silk coat, with satin knee-breeches, and
red-heeled shoes, were there, laid in strong black tobacco to keep
away the moth.</p>

<p>And, laughingly, the madcap, juvenile throng had arrayed itself
in these relics of past days. Ilonka had borrowed her
father&rsquo;s national costume: the blue watered-silk
&ldquo;attila&rdquo; (a military-shaped frock-coat) with jewelled
clasps, the black velvet cloak with sable collar and jewel buttons,
the grey Hungarian breeches, the great curved sword with heavy
jewelled hilt, belt, and sheath. She looked bewitching, with a cap
set rakishly on one side, its long heron&rsquo;s feather held with
a jewelled clasp. There surely never had been a more fascinating
Hungarian magnate. Against that, her partner, Mad&aacute;ch Feri,
whose sentimental love for the pretty girl never damped his spirit
of fun and merriment, looked irresistibly comic, in Countess
Irma&rsquo;s national &ldquo;p&aacute;rta,&rdquo; a tiara-shaped
head-dress of gold lace tied at the nape of the neck, with a large
bow andlong ends; the tight-fitting corselet with its jewelled
clasps would not close over his manly waist, and showed a sad
breach in front, filled with the billowy softness of the muslin
shift, beneath the puffy sleeves of which his brown arms appeared.
The ample folds of his white satin skirt, and the characteristic
apron of gold lace, hung limp to about a foot from the ground,
displaying a pair of large feet in huzzar top-boots. His heavy,
dark moustache added a generally disreputable air to his very
aristocratic costume.</p>

<p>Then, there was a red-cheeked, bright-eyed Kant&aacute;ssy
Mariska. She had elected to appear as a lowland peasant, and the
full white lawn shirt and ample trousers became her very well; she
had placed her round cap with its sprig of rosemary on one side of
her pretty head, and, burying her hand in the broad leather belt
with huge brass ornaments and clasps, she mimicked the rolling gait
of the peasantry with irresistible charm. Close to her,
Bart&oacute;cz Feri as a Hungarian &ldquo;mennyecske&rdquo;
(maiden), was decidedly not graceful. His
&ldquo;p&aacute;rta&rdquo; would not keep in the middle, and his
row upon row of coloured beads looked sadly out of place round his
hairy neck. He had a number of cotton skirts, one over the other,
each of a different colour, in truly approved style, but he had not
the art of swinging them as he walked, to display the kaleidoscope
of colours, which the pretty Hungarian peasant girls do to
perfection.</p>

<p>There were the daintiest possible powdered gallants of a hundred
years ago, in satin coat and breeches, with lace ruffles and
three-cornered hats; the dainty legs in silk stockings looked
bewitching over the tiny feet encased in scarlet-heeled shoes with
paste buckles; but their ladies, in rich patterned brocades and
hooped skirts, anything but fulfilled the preconceived ideas of the
dainty coquettes of Louis XV.&rsquo;s court. Ungainly shepherdesses
of Watteau&rsquo;s day acted as a foil to the most charming
shepherds that ever stepped out of the artist&rsquo;s canvas, and
heavily bearded gipsies in petticoats, to fascinating
<i>czig&aacute;ny</i> in picturesque rags.</p>

<p>As for G&eacute;za Vecsery, the boisterous Lord-Lieutenant, he
had discovered some white tarlatan skirts which must once have
belonged to a pupil of Taglioni&rsquo;s in the days when dancing
was still one of the fine arts; on his ungainly figure the pink
bodice and airy fleshings and skirts looked supremely comic, and he
created the greatest sensation when, with the action of an elephant
dancing on the tight rope, he tripped shyly into the room.</p>

<p>The supper was more boisterous and merry than any meal which had
ever taken place at Bidesk&uacute;t; the valets and maids had been
pressed into following the topsy-turvy rule of the evening, and
grey-haired Jank&oacute; in a scarlet corselet and pink petticoat
was solemnly pouring out wine, whilst the other valets, each of
whom wore the regulation Hungarian waxed moustache, all entered
into the spirit of the fun by donning the gay-coloured skirts, and
ribbons of national hue, of the maids. The latter formed a charming
bevy of valets, with &ldquo;attilas&rdquo; decidedly too large for
their slim waists, and very shapely-looking legs encased in the
characteristic tight-fitting Hungarian breeches.</p>

<p>Never was there so lively a cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s in the
lowlands as the one that was danced in the great hall of
Bidesk&uacute;t that night after supper. The graceful cavaliers
were a dainty picture to behold, stepping the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s
with their tiny booted feet, clapping their heels together in most
jaunty fashion, as if they never had been encumbered with
petticoats in their lives; but their ladies, unaccustomed to the
embarrassing folds of their brocade and satin skirts, managed to
put an amount of grotesqueness in the graceful dance which was
quite irresistible; and the older folk who had not joined in the
madcap masquerade made themselves dizzy with laughter at the
simpering manners and arch coquetry put on by budding ambassadors
and gallant young huzzars.</p>

<p>The czig&aacute;ny needed no incentive to alternate dreamy lassu
(the slow movement of the dance) with the liveliest
cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, without rest or respite, needed no shouts of
&ldquo;Ujra!&rdquo; (encore) and &ldquo;H&uacute;zd r&aacute;
czig&aacute;ny!&rdquo; (play on tsigane) to put strength into their
lean arms. Sometimes they could hardly play for very laughing, when
one of the arch coquettes, in a graceful evolution, became
hopelessly mixed in the full satin gown, and came, with scanty
grace, tumbling to the ground; or when G&eacute;za Vecsery, the
acknowledged patron of every gipsy band in the land, executed an
approved pirouette, which invariably ended in a catastrophe on the
floor.</p>

<p>No one had noticed in the midst of this boisterous gaiety,
towards the end of the long-drawn-out cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, that
Jank&oacute;, still wearing the grotesque feminine travesty, had
slipped into the room, and had whispered a few words in his
master&rsquo;s ear, his face looking ghastly pale, nor had any of
the lively, thoughtless revellers seen their host rise thereupon
suddenly, his face almost livid, and follow his valet out of the
room.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes later the cs&aacute;r&aacute;ds came to a
crashing end, with a wild twirling and turning like some
Bacchanalian dance of classic times. The men were shouting, the
girls, with flaming cheeks and eyes aglow, made a final effort for
a boisterous finale; then, all hot and panting, the ladies most
ungracefully mopping their foreheads, the cavaliers making most
unmanly use of their fans, dispersed from the immediate vicinity of
the band, to spread themselves, a laughing, boisterous crowd, in
the cooler parts of the house.</p>

<p>A few had strolled into the dining hall, and it was from their
awe-struck cry that all those dressed-up, masquerading merry-makers
had the first intimation of the terrible catastrophe that even at
this moment was spreading sorrow and desolation over the head of
their genial host.</p>

<p>Through the windows of the hall the entire sky appeared
illumined by a lurid light, which was half obscured by clouds of
black smoke driven slanting towards the east; whilst through the
thickly-leaved branches of the acacia trees could be caught
glimpses of flames like some gigantic distant furnace.</p>

<p>The air was filled with sounds of rushing and of shouting,
horses neighed with terror, while the cries of the herdsmen sounded
weird and terrifying as they cracked their whips to drive the
beasts away from the immediate danger of the flames. The melancholy
bleating of the lambs, rushing after one another in blind
helplessness, following the wether&rsquo;s bell as he guided his
troop of affrighted companions right into the very thickest of the
danger, mingled with the curses of the shepherds and the barking of
the sheep dogs trying to keep the terrified flock together.</p>

<p>In the grounds, rushing from every stable, every outhouse,
labourers, servants and peasants, ran excitedly down the acacia
drive, while kitchenmaids and housemaids stood in awed groups,
whispering and gazing, horrified, beyond. Hardly had the crowd of
aristocratic merry-makers realised the terrible catastrophe which
had occurred, than a huge column of flames, not half a league away
to the right, rose with a distant hissing sound into the air, while
to the left and straight ahead, a burning glow seemed to turn the
entire landscape into one gigantic furnace. Terrified, they all
gazed outwards, speechless, for a moment, then the weird whisper of
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; was passed from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>Trembling, the gay revellers in fantastic masquerade clung to
one another, and dainty court gallants and gaily decked-out beaux
stood with blanched cheeks, not daring to speak loudly of the
terrible catastrophe which, even now, had changed this abode of
merrymaking into one of sorrow and terror. Throughout the house
there was a general stampede. The men, forgetting their grotesque
attire, had turned towards the staircase, and were now hurrying
across the great entrance hall and down the acacia alley; others
had raided the stables, and, without pausing to find saddle or
bridle, had jumped on the horses, and galloped across the yard and
down the drive at breakneck speed, as that race of born horsemen
are alone able to do. And in the dismal night, illuminated from
afar by the lurid light of the glowing furnace, this cavalcade
seemed like the midnight ride of some grotesque witches on their
way to the Sabbath. Some of the men had hastily wrenched off the
cumbersome skirts which impeded their movements, but others, in too
great a haste to try and undo the many unaccustomed fastenings, had
gathered up their petticoats, and in their wild ride the white
satin and brocade skirts, looked like witches&rsquo; wings, which
caught sharp lurid lights as they fluttered in the wind. Weirdly
grotesque they looked, with dainty head-dresses fallen to one side,
bows fluttering round their bearded faces, their brown arms
emerging bare from out the puffed muslin or lace sleeves&mdash;a
scene that in a fantastic ballet would have convulsed an audience
with laughter, but which here added a hundred-fold more horror to
the catastrophe which had fallen in the very midst of so much
madcap merry-making.</p>

<p>One by one the ladies, young and old, had snatched up shawl or
wrap, and, in frightened groups of three and four, were finding
their way across the roads towards the burning fields. Countess
Irma and Ilonka, clinging to one another in a mutual desire for
comfort, led the way; the pretty young girl forgetting her male
attire, her thoughts paralysed by the disaster, of which, child as
she was, she could not but foresee the consequences, her mother
mutely upbraiding destiny for having ventured to fall with a heavy
hand upon her aristocratic head.</p>

<p>Out there in the fields the scene was one of awful weirdness and
magnificence. The wheat which was lying in stacks ready for
threshing and grinding, as well as that which was still uncut, the
fields of maize, the hay and straw, all had proved but a too easy
prey to the flames, and the fire had, in a few moments, spread with
astonishing rapidity. When the cavalcade of grotesque mummers
appeared upon the scene, all as far as the eye could reach seemed
to be part of a gigantic, seething, burning furnace, standing out
in lurid red and gold, against the dark canopy of the sky above.
Terrible, mysterious, magnificent, it rose like a living curtain of
flames, hissing and lashing, destroying all things, as it spread to
right and left, untrammelled and merciless. And, dotted here and
there against this fiery background, the black silhouettes of men
and beasts, rushing hither and thither, frightened, like some
pigmies, face to face with an awe-inspiring giant.</p>

<p>The air was full of sounds of anguish and terror: the stampede
of the beasts, as they were driven out of the threatened stables,
towards the distant <i>puszta</i>, which, arid and desolate, was
the only safe shelter, the only barrier, against the fast-spreading
enemy; the melancholy lowing of the oxen, the frightened bleating
of the sheep, the shouts and cries of the men, the wail of anguish
of the women, and through it all, the hissing, roaring of the
flames, as they attacked now a fresh field of nodding wheat, now an
outlying shed, whose dry tinder crackled as it burnt. Relentlessly
the enemy moved forward. There was no terrible crash, no sudden,
loud conflagration or explosion. The ways of a fire on the lowlands
are sure, swift, and silent.</p>

<p>Anon a field of maize was in a blaze, and each plume, as it was
seized upon by the flames, threw out a shower of sparks like golden
dewdrops; then a stack of straw would flare up, smokeless in the
dry air, only burning swiftly down to the ground, helping to spread
the conflagration ever on and on. And the poor frightened beasts,
not understanding why their sheltering stables were closed against
them, or what was the meaning of this strange light, lurid and hot,
rushed about, panting and snorting, in a terrified circle, always
turning blindly towards that stable door which was closed against
them. The shepherds and herdsmen worked with a will. With
relentless energy they tried to keep their herds together, hoping
to get them well out of reach before some straying spark caught the
dry thatch of the first group of stables.</p>

<p>It certainly, at this moment, looked as if it would be
impossible to save the farther buildings. Bidesk&uacute;ty, who,
with the greatest calm, had up to this point given directions to
every one of his outdoor and indoor servants to see to the beasts
first and foremost, began to notice with astonishment, and then
with terror, that there seemed to be no one else there to lend a
hand in at least parrying some of the worst consequences of the
dire catastrophe.</p>

<p>The conflagration must have been seen for leagues around, and
yet, though Bidesk&uacute;ty had sent for assistance in every
direction, neither from &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s nor from
the outlying cottages on the road to Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s did either
messenger return, or aid arrive.</p>

<p>It seemed terrible, the isolation of this man, standing alone,
gazing at the ruin which was fast closing in upon him. And, sombre,
he paced up and down, the awful truth gradually breaking upon him,
that the remorseless devastation of his year&rsquo;s crops, his
probable complete ruin, was not the hand of God, falling with
divine justice on him, as it might have done on any of his
neighbours, but was the deliberate revengeful work of some
incendiary miscreant. And, with deep curses, the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t muttered the name of him whom he believed to be his
deadly enemy, him whom, in his unreasoning arrogance, he had but a
few hours ago so deeply wounded.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty knew nothing of human nature; his careless
disposition, his very arrogance and pride of caste, prevented him
from reading the open book of his neighbours&rsquo; characters and
feelings, which lies before all who are willing to read. To him,
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, rich or poor, educated or ignorant,
would always remain the low-born peasant, descendant of a race of
serfs, once the very property of his own ancestors. To him low
deeds, such as he now attributed to Andr&aacute;s, were the
necessary outcome of low birth. In his mind there was but one
nobility, and that was the one which a long line of ancestry alone
could give. As he stood now isolated, having sent off his bailiffs
in every direction to try and induce the peasantry round to give
him some help, to at least save his beasts, his house, since his
fields were irrevocably doomed, he worked himself up to a very
fever of rage against all the low-born miscreants who had dared to
raise their hand against their lord.</p>

<p>Vainly his wife and daughter tried to pacify him; he was like
some caged wild beast, not heeding his own guests, who stood round
him willing, eager to help, to be directed as to where that help
was most needed. He would not listen save to his own tempestuous
passion, would not speak, save to hurl curses on the head of his
supposed enemy. And the grotesque cavalcade of mummers stood about
in fantastic groups like an army eager to fight, but disorganised
and leaderless; while the ladies, forgetting their masculine
attire, added to the confusion by sobs of terror, anxious
questionings, and loud, wailing prayers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; suddenly said a voice close to
Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s elbow, &ldquo;we shall have to organise,
and very quickly too, a chain of buckets from the nearest well to
those farther stables. Any flying spark may now set them ablaze;
the poor beasts in that quarter are cut off from the plain by the
fire. They must be protected at any cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s on his beautiful thoroughbred
mare, whose quivering neck he was quietly patting as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have been here sooner,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;only the way to Kisfalu is also cut off by the
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty, on hearing that voice, turned, as some
long-caged wild beast, face to face at last with his prey. His lips
moved convulsively as if to speak; his face, livid with rage,
looked almost fiendish in expression in the lurid light that
illuminated it. But the peasant stopped the words in his mouth, by
pointing quietly to the stables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that, we will resume our quarrel,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;now let those who are willing follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the mare, encouraged by a cheering word, once more started
at a swift gallop in the direction where the fire was more rapidly
gaining ground. No one needed twice telling; as Andr&aacute;s rode
away the entire cavalcade of grotesque figures followed with a
lively shout.</p>

<p>Astonished, frowning, Bidesk&uacute;ty looked after them,
watching with a scowl that was half wrathful, wholly puzzled, the
powerful figure on the thoroughbred as he galloped on, his white
shirt-sleeves fluttering behind him, his cheery voice sounding
above the cries of anguish of men and beasts, above the distant
stampede of frightened herds; and, instinctively, Bidesk&uacute;ty
himself felt that quieting influence which was
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s own over every man who knew him. His muttered
curses ceased, a ray of hope seemed to have filtrated through his
heart, he managed to give an encouraging kiss to his wife and
daughter, to listen quietly to the consoling words of those of his
guests who were too old or too slow to render much assistance.</p>

<p>Eagerly he watched the band of workers, headed by Andr&aacute;s,
as, outlined against the sky, he saw them scaling the thatched roof
of the stables, and forming a living chain along the ladders,
propped against the side of the buildings, and as far as the
nearest well; they passed buckets after buckets full of water from
hand to hand, and deluged the dry thatch, making it secure against
the flying sparks. Distinctly he could hear their excited shouts as
they took each building in its turn, running up and down the
ladders, grotesque in the extreme, with their puffed muslin
sleeves, their fluttering bows of ribbon, their semi-masculine,
semi-feminine garb. They were doing their work well, encouraged,
led by one man whom Bidesk&uacute;ty, from the distance, seemed to
see everywhere at one and the same time, the man whom in his heart
and with many curses he believed to be his deadly enemy, whom he
accused boldly of having perpetrated the dastardly deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that man, Gyuri,&rdquo; asked Count
Kant&aacute;ssy, who also had watched the peasant for some time,
with the Hungarian&rsquo;s heartfelt admiration for a perfect rider
on a perfect horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, the rich farmer
from Kisfalu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man of will and energy, Gyuri; he and our young friends
will save the group of stables and all the poor beasts, I am sure,
and, moreover, give an effectual check to the flames in that
direction, in any case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think anybody can save the house?&rdquo; asked the
Countess drearily.</p>

<p>Kant&aacute;ssy looked sadly round. Truly the spectacle was
heart-breaking. The fire had received an effectual check to the
south and east by the arid plain, but towards the north in a
westerly direction, it seemed as if there was nothing that could
prevent the flames from spreading even as far as the house of
Bidesk&uacute;t itself. Already the conflagration formed a gigantic
semicircle which appeared every moment to be closing in on the
entire property of the unfortunate lord.</p>

<p>It was obvious that a willing and really numerous band of
workers was wanted to accomplish the most important salvage: that
of the house and the larger block of stables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; said old Palotay,
&ldquo;where all those beastly, good-for-nothing lazy peasants are
sticking. It looks for all the world,&rdquo; he added in a whisper,
so that Bidesk&uacute;ty might not hear, &ldquo;as if they had
arranged it among themselves not to help in any way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bidesk&uacute;ty had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have arranged it among themselves to ruin me,&rdquo;
he said hopelessly; &ldquo;it is no use fighting; we can do nothing
while we are so short-handed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ride, if you like, across to
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s,&rdquo; said Count
Kant&aacute;ssy, &ldquo;and see if I cannot bring a few idle hands
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty,
&ldquo;nobody will come. I have sent in every direction. It seems
as if the earth had swallowed up every peasant for leagues around.
They do not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes your rich peasant, riding back. Ask him if he
cannot get help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ask him nothing,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
surlily; &ldquo;I would sooner see every stick of mine burnt to
ashes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His two friends had no time to reply, for the next instant
Andr&aacute;s had galloped past them, shouting as he went:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want more hands, my lord. I am going to
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s to get them. In the meanwhile will
your Honour order every scythe, sickle, and spade to be taken to
that group of fields yonder? We shall have to cut some of the maize
down, or the house will be in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment he was again out of sight.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty said nothing, but he turned obediently towards
his threatened house, followed by those of his friends who were
near him, and by his wife and daughter. Poor little Ilonka, she had
been too frightened to do anything save cling pitiably to her
mother&rsquo;s skirts, as some tiny chicken hiding beneath the wing
of the hen. But now she ventured timidly to look up, in order to
follow, with curious questioning gaze, the figure of the man whose
name she had heard so often on this memorable day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a good man, mama,&rdquo; she said with conviction,
while her blue eyes filled with tears of gratitude. &ldquo;I was
angry with him to-day because he had annoyed papa, but I forgive
him now, for he is very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he is trying to make amends, my dear,&rdquo;
said the incorrigibly proud Countess; &ldquo;no doubt he knows that
your papa will pay him well for his services, and he is only doing
his duty. Your papa is his lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty smiled bitterly to himself. He alone understood
the unconscious irony of his wife&rsquo;s words.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15" id=

Reparation</b>
</h2>

<p>Andr&aacute;s, in the meanwhile, had almost reached the village.
He knew, as well as the noble lord, that this night&rsquo;s
devastation was the work of man and not of God, and that it was the
poor superstitious, frightened wretches, yonder in those cottages,
whose hand had done the dastardly deed, and who now refused, surly
and defiant, to try and check the terrible catastrophe they, in
their criminal folly, had brought about.</p>

<p>The village seemed at first strangely deserted; the little
thatched cottages to the right and left of the only street were
dark and desolate-looking; even the inn appeared solitary, not a
sound emerged through its half-opened doors. Andr&aacute;s
dismounted, and led his horse along the road towards the
presbytery; he reckoned on Pater Ambrosius to lend him the weight
of his influence on the obstinate minds of the peasants, and
inwardly wondered how it was that he had not met the kind old
priest on his way to the scene of the fire, with cross and
sacrament, to pray to God to stay His just and wrathful hand.</p>

<p>The next moment, however, he saw the explanation to this, for he
had reached the presbytery, which was literally blockaded by a
crowd of men sitting and standing round, some smoking in surly
silence, others discussing eagerly, all turning towards the glow
which suffused the sky.</p>

<p>It was very dark, street illumination being still unknown in the
Hungarian lowlands, and Andr&aacute;s could do no more than just
distinguish the outlines of these groups of malcontents, and to
guess their object in thus congregating outside Pater
Ambrosius&rsquo; door; for though he could not see the good old
priest himself, he could hear his voice, apparently from some
window of his presbytery, expostulating, preaching, admonishing,
scolding, and entreating alternately to be allowed to go and pray
for my lord, who was in such dire trouble, and threatening a total
suspension of absolution, and excommunication of the entire
village, if he was not permitted to perform his priestly duty.</p>

<p>Surlily they all smoked on, not listening to the kindly voice,
which always brought spiritual comfort to their simple minds.
Obstinately they remained deaf to every appeal, determined to carry
on their crime, their folly, to its utmost dire limit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not speak any more words to them, Pater,&rdquo;
suddenly said a voice in the darkness; &ldquo;they are not worthy
that you should let your kind eyes rest upon their evil forms, even
for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calmly Andr&aacute;s stood among them, his usually so merry eyes
looking with contempt and anger at the men who had all
instinctively turned, as they recognised the voice of their
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s!&rdquo; was the general cry of
astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop that,&rdquo; he said peremptorily; &ldquo;do not
dare to speak to me by my name. It is the name of an honest man,
and can but be polluted by passing through the mouths of
miscreants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence; astonished, the men looked at one
another, thinking their favourite had gone mad. They had never
heard such words from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miscreant is an ugly word, young man,&rdquo; said old Vas
Berczi, with a threatening tone in his voice, as he advanced
towards Andr&aacute;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! an ugly word, man, but not half so ugly as the dark,
murderous deed your cowardly hands have accomplished to-night.
Stand back, there!&rdquo; he added, as one or two of the peasants
in the foremost ranks came close up to him, &ldquo;I forbid you to
speak to me, to come within a foot of me, or to lay a finger on
Csillag, for she surely would die of the pestilence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he gone mad?&rdquo; whispered one voice to another.
&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; suggested another. But all had
retreated; none spoke to him, and one or two, as if in awe, looked
at their brown hands, whose touch, he said, was pestilence and
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; came Pater Ambrosius&rsquo;
pleading voice from the dark, &ldquo;you used to have influence
over them; speak to them, my son, persuade them, at least, since
they are not Christians, and will not assist my lord in his
distress, to let me go and pray for the poor man, who must be sadly
in want of God&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here, Father, to take you to your church, or to the
terrible scene from which I have just come, and where I shall go
back at once; as for speaking to these miscreants, I will not do
it. Their very breath is offensive to me and to Csillag. You and I,
Father, will go back to where a poor old man, with his wife and
daughter, is watching his all fall a prey to ruin; to where poor
frightened beasts rush helplessly about, only to meet with a
terrible death in the fire which these children of hell have
kindled. The pride of our county of Heves, of the entire Hungarian
lowland, is laid to dust, when dastardly hands wreak cowardly
vengeance on innocent beasts of burden. Come, Father, let us go;
you can come back when your work of praying is done; as for me, if
I am not fortunate enough to bury myself and my shame in the flames
that devastate the land of which I was so proud, I will, to-morrow,
collect my household goods and, like the <i>czig&aacute;ny</i>
tramp, wander away across the <i>puszta</i>, in search of a spot
where I can once more speak to an honest man. Let Pater Ambrosius
pass! He is waiting at the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never had they heard such cruel words, the tones of which were
sharp and cutting as a two-edged sickle, and the contempt so
bitter, so absolutely humiliating, that even in the darkness they
felt their bronzed cheeks burn with shame.</p>

<p>What did Andr&aacute;s mean? He who, in all their grievances,
their complaints, had always stood by their side, ready to cheer,
to explain, to alleviate. He who had always, with a bright smile,
thrown down every barrier which his riches and his influence would
otherwise have built between him and them, the humble labourers who
worked for his liberal wage; now he even refused to allow them to
speak his name or to touch his horse; as if their words and their
touch were the most abasing pollution. Was what they had done,
then, so very awful? Was it not just revenge? was it really, as he
said, so very cowardly? A crime and not justice? True, there were
the wife and daughter of my lord; they had had nothing to do with
those cursed inventions of Satan . . . and then there were the poor
beasts . . . the beautiful Hungarian horses . . . the stables of
Bidesk&uacute;t are famed throughout the lowlands . . . and a good
many of the mares were with colt . . . then the oxen who could not
run . . . and who were so timid and easily scared . . .</p>

<p>Silently the groups had parted to make way for Pater Ambrosius
now as he joined Andr&aacute;s and prepared to mount behind him.
Kem&eacute;ny, in the meanwhile, though still retaining the
contemptuous attitude he had adopted, and seemingly taking no
further heed of the men, just as if they were the very dust upon
the plain, was, nevertheless, quietly watching the effect his hard
words had on those whom, in spite of their follies, he loved and
sympathised with tenderly. It was because there had been no time to
waste in persuasion and argument that he had adopted what he firmly
believed was the right mode of getting at those obstinate, foolish,
but not absolutely evil minds. The fate of the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t&rsquo;s home for one moment trembled in the
balance, and, for the space of a minute, perhaps, there was
hesitation; but when Andr&aacute;s had actually mounted Csillag,
and it became absolutely evident that he would not speak or look at
them again, a timid voice ventured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not really leaving Kisfalu for ever,
Andr&aacute;s, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo; he said, looking carelessly over his
shoulder; &ldquo;has any man ever known me to say one thing and
mean another? Come, Father, are you safe? Put your arms round my
waist firmly; Csillag will gallop fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Andr&aacute;s, you are not going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not leave us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see us starve!&rdquo; came from every side, and,
anxious, really frightened at what would undoubtedly prove a
calamity to them, the men crowded round their favourite eagerly,
not quite daring yet to touch the mare, since he had forbidden it,
but preventing her from taking Andr&aacute;s away, if he was never
to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought, Andr&aacute;s, you would understand our
troubles,&rdquo; said old Vas Berczi, still surly, but very much
humbled; &ldquo;you have gone over to the enemy and look down upon
us poor folk, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s heaved a sigh of satisfaction. This was the
beginning of capitulation; he had gained his point; the rest would
be easy work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do always enter into all your troubles, my men. Your
sorrows are my sorrows,&rdquo; he said more kindly, &ldquo;but you
must have known that when you chose the ways of crime, our paths
would lie divided for ever. Now, good-bye; let Csillag
pass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will come back,&rdquo; they shouted, as Csillag
reared, for her master had pressed his knees against her
haunches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, except to press the hands of honest men,
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours, Andr&aacute;s, ours!&rdquo; they shouted again, as
the mare started at a rapid gallop down the village street.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s turned round once more to face them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of those who will help me to stay the fire from reaching
the house of Bidesk&uacute;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine, Andr&aacute;s, mine,&rdquo; came from every one
now; and one and all, young and old, eager, forgetting their
grievances, their superstitions, their terrors, longing only for
that warm, promised handshake, started running after the mare and
her double burden.</p>

<p>But Andr&aacute;s had halted just outside the little church,
whose quaint square tower stood out black against the brilliant,
awful background beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you all, my children&rdquo; said Pater
Ambrosius, as he slid to his feet, &ldquo;but we must wait, and
take our Lord with us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, Father, there is not a moment to lose,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s hurriedly; but he, like all the rest, had reverently
lifted off his cap, and Pater Ambrosius, having fumbled for his
keys, let himself in through the heavy door, leaving it open so
that his erring flock, after their wild outburst of revengeful
passion, should catch sight of the heavenly peace within the house
of God. It was almost entirely in gloom within, save for the
fitful, lurid light which glimmered through the small, deep-set
Gothic windows; but the old priest knew his way well through the
rough carved pews to the steps of the simple altar, from which,
since nearly half a century, he had called forth God&rsquo;s
blessing on his simple flock. With hasty genuflections he rapidly
opened the Sanctum Sanctorum, and took out the golden crucible
which contained the true body of his sovereign Lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, quick, Father!&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s voice outside, and hastily wrapping the
sacred emblem beneath his cassock, Pater Ambrosius once more
mounted behind the young peasant.</p>

<p>The men had stood reverently silent during this brief passage of
God amongst them, then, as once more Csillag set off at a sharp
gallop, they, with a shout, started to run after her: a troupe of
some two or three hundred of them, the entire able-bodied
population of the little village, eager to redeem the past, to
restore to their beloved lowland that pride which they, by their
deed, had humbled; and when they at last reached the grounds of
Bidesk&uacute;t, hot, panting, but as full of vigour as ever, they
formed themselves in a line, ready to obey his orders to whom they
wished to prove that they were still worthy of his regard and of
his sympathy.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty, in the meanwhile, had followed
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s advice; there was no doubt that from the
north now very considerable danger threatened the old ancestral
house. In that direction lay a very extensive field of maize, part
of which was already ablaze and helping to spread the conflagration
in serious proximity to the outhouses and stables. The unfortunate
owner of all the devastated lands had collected round him the few
willing hands that were available, and while his male guests in
fantastic array were busy trying to rescue one corner of his
property, he brought his few indoor servants and one or two of the
more robust maids to attempt the salvage of the other.</p>

<p>With scythes, sickles, and spades they endeavoured to lay as
much of the field low as possible, but though the small band worked
hard and with a will, the enemy worked harder, drawing nearer and
nearer, and after the first half-hour it became evident that unless
help arrived numerous and swift, the clearing would not be
sufficiently wide to effectually check the flames.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty paced up and down the approaches to his fields,
scanning anxiously the horizon from which the help should come. He
would not allow himself to dwell upon his thoughts and his
suspicions; he knew too well now that if, after this terrible
night, he retained the roof above his head and any fragment of his
threatened property, it would be thanks to the man whom that
afternoon he had insulted and struck in the face. That the fire had
been kindled by human hand, of that there could be no doubt; all
that was left to hope for now was that the rich peasant would exert
his influence to bring the criminals to the atonement of their own
deed before it was too late.</p>

<p>The ladies had all retired to within the park gates. They were
far too anxious to go indoors, and, in groups of two and three,
they paced up and down the acacia alleys, all wondering if the
promised help would come, and all watching their fathers, brothers,
husbands, still at work on the roofs of the threatened stables.</p>

<p>From afar, already Bidesk&uacute;ty heard the shouts of the
peasants as they ran, headed by Csillag carrying her master, and
Pater Ambrosius.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s brought his horse to a standstill close to
Bidesk&uacute;ty, and having dismounted, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, the Pater and I have brought you three hundred
willing pairs of hands, who, with God&rsquo;s help, will at least
save your house and stables from this terrible fire. Now, my
men,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the maize fields, &ldquo;start
clearing away that tinder at once. Hack, cut, mow, tear, uproot;
let me see who can best devastate one of the finest fields of maize
in the county. Take what tools you can; lose no time, and may God
bless your work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius also dismounted. With simple faith he brought
out the sacred vessel from under his cassock, and holding it high
above his head, so that all might partake of the divine blessing,
he reverently prayed for God&rsquo;s help in this terrible
emergency.</p>

<p>In a few moments the fresh band of willing workers had dispersed
within the fields, and soon, from afar, could be heard the sound of
the sharp scythes cutting through the tough stems of the maize.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty, from where he stood, could see the row of
backs stooping to their work, tearing and cutting, without rest and
pause. They had pushed their way very near the fire: dangerously
near, Bidesk&uacute;ty thought; it seemed as if they were anxious
even to risk their lives now, to save a few acres of land for him,
to court danger so as better to show their obedience and devotion.
And yet, surely, the guilty were there too, amongst them, wrestling
hard with that merciless fire which their criminal hand had
kindled. Bidesk&uacute;ty looked with a feeling that was akin to
envy at the sturdy peasant by his side who, with a word, had
subdued all those recalcitrant hearts to his will. He would have
wished to speak to him of his gratitude for the incalculable
service rendered, but, somehow, the ruling passion still choked the
words within his throat. The proud aristocrat could not bring
himself, even at a moment like this, to own himself bounden in any
way to the low-born peasant at his side.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that, almost imperceptibly, the area of the
fire was being restricted. Already to the south and east the arid
plain and the wide high-road had proved an insurmountable barrier
to the spreading of the flames in those two directions, whilst to
the north, the group of outlying stables, deluged with water, had
proved an effectual check. Hope began to revive in
Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s heart, as he saw the great bare patches in
his fields of maize, against which every column of flame, which
threatened to spread in the direction of the house, first flickered
and then died. Pater Ambrosius had never ceased his prayers while
the men worked and Bidesk&uacute;ty watched. The proud lord had
allowed Andr&aacute;s, without a word of protest, to take command
in the work of rescue.</p>

<p>The young peasant seemed to Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s feverish
eyes to be in every place at the same time&mdash;now close to the
men to direct their work, now at the park gates to send reassuring
messages to the ladies within. For five hours the struggle went on
between man and the element, and, inch by inch, the element was
made to yield. Everywhere now could be seen black and smoky patches
which looked like desolate islands in a sea of flames. The intense
glow had subsided. Darkness, which seemed doubly dense owing to the
lurid illumination of a few hours ago, had overspread two-thirds of
the horizon. The vanquished foe made one or two attempts at
regaining lost ground; in one or two places the stubble of cut
maize stems caught fire and smouldered for a while, but, after the
work of cutting down, the stamping out of those smouldering
remnants was quick and effectual. As the flames had subsided, the
mummers had joined forces with the peasants, and soon the barrier,
which forced the fire back and back, became closer and closer.
Bidesk&uacute;ty never left the ground while there was a single
spark to be seen; unceasingly he watched, while his terrible enemy
was being driven back and vanquished. He felt no fatigue; he
watched as in a dream; not seeking, in the gathering gloom, to note
the fearful devastation which now stretched before him, where,
yesterday, rich corn and maize fields had nodded gaily in the
summer breeze.</p>

<p>He asked no questions as to the fate of his vineyards, which lay
to the north, his turnip fields, his oats, which stretched for many
leagues away, and of which he could not as yet know how far they
had suffered from the fury of the flames.</p>

<p>In the east beyond the plain, a faint streak of delicate rosy
grey broke the gathering gloom. The air was filled with choking
smoke. Ahead a group of peasants and mummers, rendered doubly
grotesque by begrimed faces and hands and torn finery, were
stamping out the last remaining sparks on his dearly-loved maize
fields which had been the pride of the county. He thanked God that
he could not see the wreck, that he could put off till the morrow
the thought of the hopeless ruin of his rich crops, and to-night
only remember that at least his house had been spared him, some of
his beasts too, perhaps.</p>

<p>From a distance he could hear those now being driven back to
their stables. He would not ask how many had perished, suffocated
by fire and smoke. All that he would hear soon enough . . .
to-morrow . . . To-night he thought he only wanted rest. A great
many of the peasants, he noticed, were wending their way once more
towards &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s. The streak of rosy grey
was getting wider, and brighter; even through the smoke he could
see overhead a few stars, looking pale and shy at the approach of
dawn. Pater Ambrosius said many kind words to him, and each
peasant, as he passed, touched his s&uuml;veg (cap) respectfully
before the ruined lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; said portly Count
Kant&aacute;ssy very gently and very kindly; &ldquo;you must be
worn out with fatigue and anxiety. I have just come from the
ch&acirc;teau, and have persuaded the ladies to go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty looked at his old friend vacantly; he did not
quite grasp his meaning. His mind was numb, as his body was, from
the strain and the fatigue of the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems no more danger for the present, but pickets
of watchers have been placed at different points to give the alarm
in case the fire should break out again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty hardly knew who had spoken. It was a young man,
who looked exceedingly comic in a limp satin skirt, saturated with
water, and a bodice, cut <i>d&eacute;collett&eacute;</i> in front,
with lace frills and bows of ribbons. It made him laugh so much
that he tottered and almost fell but for Kant&aacute;ssy&rsquo;s
arm, which supported him gently, just as if he had been drinking
and could not stand. The portly old Count tried to lead his friend
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Gyuri, there is no occasion for you to
stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, though he was very tired, and it was surely time for bed,
Bidesk&uacute;ty felt that there was something he ought to do
before going in, but he could not recollect what it was.
Obstinately he refused to move, and stared with a vacant smile at
the group of his young guests in limp, wet rags, the remnants of
the merry masquerading which had made him laugh so heartily . . .
oh! ever so long ago.</p>

<p>A servant came running from the park gates. She said that the
Countess begged my lord would come in, as she and Mademoiselle
Ilonka could not rest till they had seen him.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty at last prepared to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Countess asked my lord to bring Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s of Kisfalu in with him,&rdquo; added the maid,
&ldquo;for she wished to speak a few words of thanks to him for his
timely assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was that Bidesk&uacute;ty recollected what it was he
wanted to do before going home to bed. There had been a man who had
not only toiled and slaved for him, helped to rescue his home from
utter devastation, but had also induced others to give able and
willing help, so as to render his ruin only partial instead of
whole. That man was a low-born peasant, descendant of a race of
serfs, moreover a usurious money-lender, with Jewish ancestry; only
that very afternoon he had been insolent and Bidesk&uacute;ty had
been forced to chastise him. Still, quarrels must be forgotten, as
the man had truly made amends, and Bidesk&uacute;ty felt sincerely
grateful.</p>

<p>He turned to seek for Andr&aacute;s among the group which
surrounded him. The peasant was not there. He asked after him, and
called for him by name.</p>

<p>But Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was gone.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16" id=

Easter Morn</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;It is going to leave off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day yet, I think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you not a drop has fallen for the last ten
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look at that break in the clouds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! that won&rsquo;t last; they will soon close up

<p>&ldquo;I have felt a drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are dreaming, Laczi; why, I can see a bit of
blue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right over Kisfalu. I tell you we shall have no more rain
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He who had last spoken was evidently a man of much weight in
matters connected with rain and sunshine, for the young men who
stood round him, anxiously surveying the clouded horizon, ventured
no further direct contradiction, although one voice tremblingly
suggested:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Berczi, last Sunday, you said the rain would
leave off before Pater Ambrosius had said the &lsquo;Ite Missa
est,&rsquo; and, when we came out of church, after the palms had
been blessed, it was still raining; and has never left off till
this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! but it has left off now, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
repeated Vas Berczi obstinately, &ldquo;or are you still getting
wet, Laczi my boy?&rdquo; he added with withering sarcasm.</p>

<p>Truly it seemed as if the weather prophet was speaking words of
wisdom, to-day. Undoubtedly the break in the clouds was getting
wider, and the bit of sky which was visible beyond that break was
unquestionably of the brightest blue, whilst a very timid and pale
ray of sun endeavoured to peep through at the melancholy landscape
below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first bit of sun we have seen for a fortnight, my
children,&rdquo; said old Berczi, lifting his cap with mock
solemnity; &ldquo;hats off to the stranger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughingly the group of young peasants took off their hats, and,
clapping their heels together, made a solemn bow towards the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has brought you!&rdquo; they all said politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord Sun, you are welcome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope your worship has come to stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; added old Berczi with a sigh, &ldquo;it is a
sad sight your Honour has come to see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there ever so much mud on the mainroad as there is
just now?&rdquo; commented one of the peasants with a shake of the
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No cart can get through, and yesterday my oxen were up to
their knees in mud. I could not get them either to turn or to go
on. I thought our last hour had come, for I felt myself sinking
deeper and deeper, and thought I and the oxen would reach hell that
way, through the mud, without a chance of confession or
prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s will
contrive to come to church this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has good horses; he will come on Csillag&rsquo;s back,
and bring Etelka behind him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will never miss Easter Sunday Mass, I know. Etelka is
very pious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Andr&aacute;s won&rsquo;t let her come
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed, my children,&rdquo; said the wise
elderly prophet, &ldquo;that Andr&aacute;s has not been himself
lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does seem so quiet,&rdquo; said Laczi, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know when I have heard him laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend on it,&rdquo; whispered an older peasant among the
crowd, &ldquo;he has not yet forgiven us about that
fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s is not one to bear ill-will,&rdquo;
asserted a younger man hotly; &ldquo;he has never spoken a word
about that fire since it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot deny,&rdquo; said old Berczi, &ldquo;that it
is since the night of the fire that he has seemed so strange and
silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is perhaps anxious about his new crops. We finished
sowing at Kisfalu just before this cursed rain began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His fields are safe enough from the floods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only a few maize fields belonging to Kisfalu
which lie close to the Tarna. He has not suffered much
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The waters are still rising.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The roar was terrific last night, and I went as far as my
lord&rsquo;s stables yesterday; it seemed to me as if all
Bidesk&uacute;t lay under water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord is indeed unfortunate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God punishes him, you see. We need not have set fire to
his wheat last year. God will see Himself that none of it goes to
be ground inside that mill of Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group of peasants were standing outside the village church,
all in their Sunday best, waiting for their mothers, sisters,
sweethearts, who took a long time this morning to put on their
gorgeous finery for Easter morn. The sun had evidently come to
stay; it was shining quite brightly on the scene that since the
last fortnight had been indeed truly desolate. The rain had been
incessant; since fourteen days and fourteen nights the patter of
heavy drops, as they fell, had disturbed the peaceful immensity of
the plain, and changed the entire landscape into a sea of mud. Far
ahead towards the north could be heard the melancholy roar of the
Tarna, as her angry waters, swollen by the continuous rain, dashed
furiously onwards, overflowing their shallow banks, and submerging
in their muddy depths the rich fields of Bidesk&uacute;t, newly
sown with the early spring seed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here come the men from Kisfalu,&rdquo; said Laczi,
pointing towards the road; &ldquo;they are well covered with
mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls have made themselves smart,
nevertheless,&rdquo; said one of the younger men, looking
admiringly towards the group of pretty girls in bright-coloured
petticoats, who were coming up the village street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S&aacute;ri and Kati have each a pair of new red
boots!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s gave them, I know. He drove into
Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, just before the sowing, and bought his mother a
new silk dress, and both his servants a pair of red
boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That man is made of money,&rdquo; sighed old Berczi,
envyingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He makes good use of it, anyhow,&rdquo; said another;
&ldquo;during the whole of this winter he paid my mother her full
wages for picking wheat, though her eyesight now is quite gone, and
she cannot tell cornflower seed from the finest lowland
corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy to do good,&rdquo; said old Berczi,
sententiously, &ldquo;if one has plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so easy, evidently,&rdquo; said one of the younger
men; &ldquo;my lord anyhow finds it more difficult than
Andr&aacute;s. He gave mighty little away this winter, I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord had mighty little to give away. His entire crops
were destroyed in the fire, remember, and a great many of his
beasts perished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would have been no fire if he had not set up that
mill of Satan, which was to deprive us of wage, while the devil did
the work,&rdquo; asserted Laczi hotly.</p>

<p>The group from Kisfalu had in the meanwhile managed to wade
through the muddy streets, and from the distance already shouted
greetings to their friends at the church porch. There was a
remarkable air of well-being and prosperity among the peasantry in
this tiny lowland village; the men looked handsome in their fine
white lawn shirts and trousers, very full, and finely tucked and
hemmed, their short leather jackets handsomely embroidered, and
broad belts with great brass bosses that glittered in the pale sun,
the huge &ldquo;bunda&rdquo; (sheepskin mantles) down their backs
giving dignity to their not very tall figures. They were a sturdy
lot, too; broad-shouldered, and well planted on small arched feet
encased in the shiniest of leather boots, with high heels and
spurs, which jingled as they walked. As for the girls, there surely
could not be found in any other county in Hungary such bright eyes,
such white arms, such pretty little feet; nor could in any other
village be mustered such a number of coloured petticoats round the
waist of any one girl. There were S&aacute;ri and Kati now, not to
speak of scores of others, who could, this Easter morn, not have
had less than thirty petticoats one over the other, which made
their hips look so large and their waist so small that one felt an
irresistible longing to put an arm right round it. Their tiny feet
were covered in mud, for it was a long walk from Kisfalu, but in
their hands they proudly carried the shiny pair of new red leather
boots, the joy and delight of every girl on the lowlands. No girl
who owns red boots would allow them to get bespattered in the mud;
she carries them carefully to church with her prayer-book and best
handkerchief, and only puts them on outside the porch, so as to
walk up the aisle in them, to the envy of her less fortunate
friends who can only afford black boots.</p>

<p>From every cottage door now they come tripping out, this bevy of
pretty girls dressed out in Sunday finery, with great lawn sleeves
puffed and starched, and bows of national colors, red, white, and
green, fluttering in the wind. The graceful p&aacute;rta, tied at
the nape of the neck with a gigantic bow, sets off to perfection
the tiny queen-like head, with sleek hair falling in two heavy
plaits down the back; the shift gaily embroidered in front, and the
corselet laced tightly across the slim waist above the numberless
petticoats, which swing gaily as the girls walk, with a peculiar
rolling gait from the hips; the large gold earrings, the many rows
of beads, the bright clasps of the corselet, all glitter in the
sunshine, no less than the bright eyes and the row of snow-white
teeth. The older women are in more sombre dresses, and taller
p&aacute;rtas, with bright-coloured shawls to hide their shoulders,
and all carry ponderous prayer-books with gigantic clasps of brass
or silver.</p>

<p>At the church porch greetings and blessings are exchanged, while
the women squat down on the flagstones to put on the beautiful
boots over the little muddy feet.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius has not come yet, and already the little bell is
sending forth, in merry peals, invitations to the simple flock to
rejoice and worship on this bright Easter mom. Some of the women
have gone in, to get a good seat in the rough oak pew, from which
they can catch sight of my lord and his family, in their great pew
above; for my lord always comes to Mass in the village church on
Easter Sunday, and brings his lamb and eggs to be blessed by the
reverend Pater.</p>

<p>Outside there is ceaseless chatter. The gossip continues while
from every side the worshippers arrive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will my lord come?&rdquo; asks one of the late
arrivals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came last year, but I don&rsquo;t know if he will come
to-day,&rdquo; said a young herdsman from Bidesk&uacute;t;
&ldquo;the carriage and horses were waiting when I passed the big
house, so I am sure the Countess and the young lady will
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noble Ilonka is very beautiful,&rdquo; suggested a
pretty girl who was putting on her red boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half so pretty in my eyes as you, Panna,&rdquo;
whispered a young swain quickly in her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me up, Rezs&ouml;, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense; I
am sure the noble Ilonka is just like the picture of the holy
Virgin over the altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you are like nothing, and nobody, Panna, for there is
no one with eyes as bright as yours,&rdquo; said the young man as
he helped the idol of his heart to her feet, and in the effort
managed to steal a kiss on her round white shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resz&ouml;, you know I have forbidden you to kiss
me,&rdquo; she said with a frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why I like to do it, my soul; what fun would
there be in kissing the girls, if they would let you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not dance the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s with you
unless you promise not to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you while your mother is
looking,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;but what about
afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said blushing, &ldquo;here comes my
lord&rsquo;s carriage. I must run in, or I shall not get a good
seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here, at last, is Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s!&rdquo;
came from one or two cheerful voices among the men.</p>

<p>The prophecy had proved correct; Andr&aacute;s had relied on
Csillag to bring him through the muddy roads, and Etelka also came,
mounted on one of the sure-footed horses from her son&rsquo;s
stables.</p>

<p>The young peasant was greeted with many shouts of &ldquo;Isten
hozta&rdquo; (God has brought you!), and twenty pairs of willing
hands were ready to help Etelka off her saddle. While Andr&aacute;s
tethered Csillag and her companion to a tree, the carriage from
Bidesk&uacute;t, drawn by four black horses with scarlet harness
and brass bosses, had driven up to the church porch. Respectfully
the peasants stood aside while the Countess stepped out in her
rustling silk gown, followed by Ilonka in a dainty muslin
frock.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma looked very pale and worn; there were a good
many more lines in the still handsome face, and round the proud,
disdainful mouth, than there had been a year ago; she sailed past
the peasants, acknowledging their respectful greetings, like a very
queen amongst her vassals. Ilonka, as bright and merry as ever, was
smiling to all like a gay child. Evidently care had not reached
her; what anxiety her mother and father had had to suffer since the
terrible catastrophe, some eight months ago, they had done it
without allowing her to dream that there was ought but sunshine in
her life.</p>

<p>At the door of the church Andr&aacute;s stood, holding his
mother by the hand; they, too, stepped aside as the Countess
crossed the porch, and Etelka suddenly felt that her son&rsquo;s
hand, which held her own, trembled like an aspen leaf. She looked
up at him and saw that in his eyes, which were fixed on the two
noble ladies before him, there was a look of such wistful
tenderness, and yet of such hopeless longing, that her motherly
heart ached within her for this son whose sorrow she scarcely
understood.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma had also caught sight of Andr&aacute;s, and
had acknowledged his greeting, but when she was quite close to him
she stopped for an instant. It seemed as if she were fighting with
herself some inward battle, the victory of which was hard to gain.
Then, as if with sudden resolution, she turned to the young peasant
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t desired me to say that he
would speak with you, if you will honour him by breaking bread with
him, after Mass to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ilonka had also stopped beside her mother, and her great blue
eyes were looking curiously at the handsome young peasant, who
looked so imposing in his magnificent mantle, all gorgeously
embroidered, with the rich silver clasps in his belt, and jacket,
and the long sweeping heron&rsquo;s feather that adorned the cap
which he had respectfully taken off in reply to the
Countess&rsquo;s commands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will attend upon my lord,&rdquo; he said with a bow.
The next moment the Countess and Ilonka had disappeared inside the
church.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius was also coming, holding his cassock high above
his lean shanks, to protect it from the mud. Every one filed into
the little church, the women to the right, the men to the left.
After the first glance of curiosity at the noble ladies, all heads
were reverently bent down, waiting for the Pater to commence. The
gentle old priest, in simple vestments, worn threadbare with age,
had entered, carrying the sacred vessels, and every one knelt for
the beginning of the Mass, and the recitation of the
&ldquo;Confiteor.&rdquo; The younger folk followed the Latin text
in their prayer-books, but most of the older people, to whom all
kinds of printing were still a mystery, quietly told their beads in
a droning voice, which formed a quaint accompaniment to Pater
Ambrosius&rsquo; half audible prayers.</p>

<p>In respectful silence the pious, simple folk listened to the
words prescribed by the Church, not understanding their meaning,
but content that they must please God, since Pater Ambrosius said
them, who was so good and so learned, and since their fathers and
grandfathers and many generations before them had worshipped in
this church, in this self-same way. Now and then a loudly intoned
&ldquo;Per omnia s&aelig;cula s&aelig;culorum&rdquo; broke the
peaceful stillness of the service, responded to by the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s little droning harmonium, and his
&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; sung in a high-pitched tremolo. Otherwise all
was reverently silent. The pale rays of the sun peeped in now and
then, through the tiny windows, at the simple group of worshippers,
and from afar could be heard the melancholy roaring of the flood,
like distant, subdued thunder, incessant and gloomy.</p>

<p>Then the little bell, rung by the acolyte, announced the real
bodily approach of God within the village church. Reverently all
knelt down, and humble heads were bent to worship the Saviour, who,
at a word from Pater Ambrosius, left His glorious heaven to come
and sit inside that white bit of wafer, which the reverend Pater
held between his fingers. A silence full of religious awe reigned,
and, when the little bell had ceased to tingle, few heads dared as
yet to look towards the altar where God now truly sat
enthroned.</p>

<p>Etelka, during the Mass, often looked across at her son, who
knelt close to one of the stone pillars on the left; and she saw
that, all through divine worship, his eyes, dark and dreamy, were
fixed in one direction, which was not the altar; that he held his
arms tightly crossed over his chest, and that once during the
service, when a pale ray of sun came creeping through one of the
tiny windows, and rested on a head of golden curls, bent reverently
over the prayer-book, a tear found its way in his eyes, and
trickled slowly down his bronzed cheeks. Etelka noticed that he did
not pray, that he only gazed in that one direction, with a look so
wistful and so yearning that she also felt her own eyes fill with
tears.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius had intoned &ldquo;Ite! Missa est!&rdquo; One by
one the little congregation began to file out, in order to assemble
outside the church where, beneath the great overhanging acacias, a
table was spread with a snow-white cloth, and laden with quarters
of newly-killed lamb, eggs, butter, cheese, and fresh-cured ham,
awaiting the blessing of the Church.</p>

<p>One of the shares of the good fruits of this bountiful earth was
for the kind Pater himself, and the few poor and aged whose time
for work had passed. Proudly each thrifty housewife compared her
own eggs with those of her neighbours, noted the whiteness of her
cheese, the creaminess of her butter. In the centre, on a huge
silver dish, was a young lamb, roasted whole, which my lord had
sent to be blessed; and all along, in more humble earthenware
platters, and in baskets plaited of rush, were the coloured eggs,
and smaller products from the more modest cottages.</p>

<p>The small congregation had filed into the churchyard, and, in
spite of mud and damp, all had knelt down to hear the touching
prayer that would bring God&rsquo;s blessing upon the first-fruits
of the earth. A rug had been spread in the centre for the Countess
and Ilonka, and all round, in picturesque groups, knelt the pretty
peasant girls and bronze-faced young men.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius stood behind the table, with hands outspread and
reverent eyes lifted upwards, praying for grace. Near him a small
acolyte swung the censer, throwing the sweet penetrating scent of
myrrh and incense through the air. The sun had come out in its full
glory, and its noonday rays drew a warm steam from the wet earth,
and made each raindrop glitter on the grass mounds like so many
diamonds. Far away the distant roar of the flood made a melancholy
accompaniment to Pater Ambrosius&rsquo; softly whispered
prayer.</p>

<p>Having spread his hands over all the things placed before him,
the reverend Pater asked God to bless these, the first-fruits of
the earth, and, when he had finished, he sprinkled each basket of
eggs, each quarter of lamb, with holy water, and swung the censer
over them. His kind old face was full of reverence; in true
gratitude he thanked the Creator for the plentiful produce of this
happy land. When the last prayer had been said, and all had
repeated &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; the priest addressed his flock once
again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now that we have
thanked God for all the good things He gives us, and asked His
special blessing on the first spring fruits of the earth, I want
you to join me in a fervent prayer to our Heavenly Father that He
may in His mercy stay His wrath from our beloved county of Heves,
and command the waters of the Tarna to return to their banks. We
must pray to God to stay the catastrophe which brings such sorrow
upon the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t, Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda, who
already has had so much grief last year, when a terrible fire
devastated his land. Let us all say from our hearts &lsquo;Our
Father,&rsquo; and three times &lsquo;Hail, Mary&rsquo; and then
the Holy Virgin will truly intercede with her divine Son for the
noble lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The simple prayers were repeated devoutly as Pater Ambrosius
requested, for all felt truly sorry in their hearts to see the
beautiful land devastated by the flood; and the two noble ladies
looked so sad during Mass, it seemed hard they should suffer for
follies which they could not help. The Countess had frowned when
she heard Pater Ambrosius&rsquo; exhortation. Her pride rebelled
against the touching appeal made on her behalf by these simple folk
whom she despised; she did not care to own, even before her God,
that calamity would dare to touch the aristocratic house of
Bidesk&uacute;t.</p>

<p>As for Andr&aacute;s, he joined with all his heart in the simple
prayers; he&mdash;alone of all those present&mdash;guessed more
accurately the magnitude of the disaster which had fallen on the
lord of Bidesk&uacute;t by the terrible flood, and in simple faith
he prayed that this disaster would touch but lightly on that dainty
head, which was only created for merriment.</p>

<p>The last &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; had died away; Pater Ambrosius had
retired within the church to take off his vestments. All had risen
to their feet and stood gossiping about, in whispers, out of
respect for the two noble ladies who were waiting for their
carriage. Etelka had drawn near to her son; vaguely, she felt
anxious about him, for the line of some hidden suffering seemed
more accentuated on his face, and once or twice she had heard like
an involuntary sigh, as if the burden on his heart was more than he
could bear. The Countess had not condescended to speak to him
again. She had stepped into her carriage, followed by Ilonka, and
driven off, leaving Andr&aacute;s to come on as he pleased. Her
husband had desired to speak with the peasant; that was quite
sufficient honour for him, without further words from the noble
Countess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not stay and eat that man&rsquo;s bread, my
son?&rdquo; asked Etelka, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear, mother,&rdquo; replied Andr&aacute;s,
&ldquo;I will see what he wants and be home before S&aacute;ri and
Kati have laid our mid-day meal. You must walk D&aacute;ndar along
the road. It is safer for you when I am not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had passed his hand over his eyes, as if wishing to chase
away some persistent dream. Then he kissed his mother, and placed
her in her saddle. S&aacute;ri and Kati, carrying their red boots,
walked each side of the horse, and Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s
stood watching the three women until they were out of sight.</p>

<p>The people had all left the churchyard. One or two pretty girls
looked wistfully after the rich peasant who was so moody to-day.
Gradually the little church porch and then the village street had
become deserted; all had gone in to eat the meat and eggs which had
been specially blessed by God. In the distance, Pater Ambrosius,
his cassock well tucked up, was hurrying home to his presbytery;
from every half-opened cottage door could be heard loud peals of
laughter, and, lingering in the churchyard, Andr&aacute;s spied two
or three couples exchanging kisses. Overhead he could hear the
melancholy cry of the storks just home from warmer climes, and
seeking for the nest they deserted last year; everything spoke of
merriness, of home, of youth and love, and Andr&aacute;s, with a
sigh, turned towards Csillag and kissed the pretty creature between
her great, gentle eyes.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17" id=
"Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
The Ruined Lord</b>
</h2>

<p>It was with a beating heart that Andr&aacute;s once again
crossed the threshold of that house where his pride had received so
bitter a blow. He had never entered it since the day when a girlish
face had stayed his vengeful hand, ready to return blow for blow.
And now he wondered what the arrogant lord would have to say to
him. That it was something of serious import was, of course,
evident, or the Countess would never have stooped to address him;
Andr&aacute;s guessed that my lord had some request to make to him,
which his pride had probably put off from day to day for some time,
till now it had become imperative.</p>

<p>Jank&oacute; had been waiting for Andr&aacute;s at the gates;
another servant took charge of Csillag, while the old valet led the
young peasant to that same room where the stormy interview had
lately taken place.</p>

<p>The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t was sitting there, smoking, when
Jank&oacute; opened the door to let Andr&aacute;s come in; but the
peasant noticed that as he entered this time the noble lord took
the pipe out of his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Isten hozta!&rdquo;
(God has brought you!) while pointing to a chair.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s saw how very much altered Bidesk&uacute;ty was
since last year. He seemed altogether aged, though his hair was no
greyer nor his stature less upright, but his geniality seemed gone;
there was an air of seriousness, of care, round the eyes, and one
or two deep lines were very apparent between the brows.
Andr&aacute;s felt exceedingly sorry for this man, who seemed to
have suffered so much for his folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is kind of you to come,&rdquo; began Bidesk&uacute;ty
a little nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here at your lordship&rsquo;s command; with what can
I be of service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have guessed by hearing the Tarna roaring out
there, over my fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that your lordship is suffering a heavy loss, as
already you did last year. I do not remember so terrible a flood
since I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The loss to me is greater than you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a farmer, my lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s simply;
I know the value of every acre upon the lowland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty thought that the peasant purposely evaded
giving him an opening for what he wanted to say. Never in all his
life had he felt so absolutely at a loss of how to begin; he had
never asked any one anything, and now he was compelled to do it of
a man whom he despised as utterly beneath him, and yet whom,
somehow, he could not manage to treat in the same way as he did
Rosenstein the Jew.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s waited quietly while Bidesk&uacute;ty mopped his
forehead and drew great clouds of smoke from his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you suffered much, over at Kisfalu?&rdquo; he asked
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As your Honour knows, there are very few fields in that
direction belonging to Kisfalu; some of my maize is under water,
but it won&rsquo;t be a serious loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always lucky!&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
envyingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are other sorrows besides the loss of corn,&rdquo;
replied Andr&aacute;s quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends how much you lose,&rdquo; said
Bidesk&uacute;ty with growing vehemence; &ldquo;if, like me, you
were to see two successive crops entirely destroyed through no
fault of your own, leaving you nothing, not even a handful of corn,
to sow for the following year, what then? If, like me, you saw ruin
staring you in the face, what then? If every league of your land is
mortgaged to beyond its value, with interest to pay far beyond what
it can produce, what then? If your very house, in which for seven
hundred years every one of your ancestors were born and have died,
is about to pass into strangers&rsquo; hands? Then, Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s, are there sorrows that are harder to
bear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, my lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s kindly,
&ldquo;but such a terrible state of things is, thank God, not your
own. True, your land is heavily mortgaged; no one knows that better
than I; but I am not threatening to close upon you, dearly as I
should love to call that part of it on which I was born my own. You
talk of interest,&rdquo; he added very gently, &ldquo;but, however
much you may have suffered in the two disasters, your land, thank
God, still produces enough on which to feed yourself and your
family and all your servants, and yet leave over a small surplus,
which is but the just interest on the money you have had. As for
this house, who threatens it? Surely not I. I hold no mortgage on
it, and have already refused to take it as security, when I lent
the money upon the Bidesk&uacute;t lands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You use many pretty phrases,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
impatiently; &ldquo;just now you said you knew the value of every
acre upon the lowland. Are you telling a lie, then, when you say
that, on the few fields that do not lie under water, I can grow
enough wheat to pay you the hundreds of thousands of measures which
you demand, and yet have enough with which to feed myself, and my
family, and all my servants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid your Honour is but a poor calculator; the
measures of wheat which you pay me annually for the loan of the
850,000 florins I lent you, altogether, do not amount to more than
twenty thousand and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is you who is a poor calculator,&rdquo; rejoined
Bidesk&uacute;ty, &ldquo;for I pay more than ten times that amount,
which with the thousands of beasts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s quietly,&nbsp;
&ldquo;do not let us wander any further into these fantastic lands.
I receive from your lordship in kind as interest for my money what
does not amount to more than three or four florins a year for every
hundred I lent. You yourself signed the paper which I hold in my
pocket; what I asked was more than fair, it was liberal; had I
exacted the usurious interest you speak of, I could long ago have
forced you to part with Kisfalu, to own which is the dream of my
life. But I do not understand usury, and that is why I am still the
&lsquo;b&eacute;rl&ouml;&rsquo; (tenant) and not the owner of the
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not understand usury, man?&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
in a rage; &ldquo;are you drunk or mad? Am I dreaming, or are you
telling lies? Does not that blood-sucking Jew bailiff of yours
exact from me every year what now amounts to nearly two hundred
thousand measures of wheat, some four hundred head of my best
cattle, a thousand sheep and lambs, my fattest geese and poultry,
and, in your name, give me neither rest nor respite? coming down
upon me a little more than a week after that terrible fire,
exacting the few poor beasts that had escaped from the flames,
threatening me with the demand for the capital, unless I parted
with the few stacks of corn left me by the cursed incendiaries, my
only chance of sowing for the following year; and then actually
offering me that self-same corn at an outrageous price, and
offering to lend me the money with which to buy it, at usury worse
than the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exhausted, the unfortunate man had sunk down in his chair,
burying his face in his hands. Forgotten were his pride, his
arrogance, when looking his own folly, his probable ruin, in the
face; it all seemed so hopeless, he felt like some wretched bird
ensnared in a net, fighting against meshes which closed in on every
side. Andr&aacute;s had become deathly pale; at first he had
listened to the ravings of Bidesk&uacute;ty as he would to those of
a lunatic. But gradually he realised in the man&rsquo;s broken
accents, in his voice choked with sobs half of anger and half of
appeal, that he was telling the bitter truth; he dimly felt that
some terrible wrong had been committed, of which this foolish man
had been the victim, a wrong committed in his name&mdash;
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&mdash;he who had worshipped his own
integrity as he would a god.</p>

<p>Trembling, his hand sought the papers which bore
Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s signature; his eyes scanned the writing
anxiously, as if in a vain desire to make them yield part of that
hideous mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said as quietly as possible, after a
long pause, &ldquo;I do not think that we quite understand one
another. That there is here some ugly mystery, of which Rosenstein
has the key, seems to me evident; shall we try to understand each
other first, before we make him tell us his share of the
riddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had succeeded in once more mastering himself.
He saw his creditor&rsquo;s face, looking so kindly, so honestly,
at him that, for once in his life, his heart whispered to him to
put his pride in his pocket, to trust that man whom he affected to
despise, and with a frank gesture he stretched his hand out towards
him.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s placed his own in it; then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will your lordship tell me, as clearly as you can, what
you believe to be your debt towards me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not tell you within a good many measures of
wheat, but I know that you lent me altogether 950,000
florins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my lord, only 850,000 florins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were four loans altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hundred thousand on Kisfalu; 300,000 on the lands
of Bidesk&uacute;t, 250,000 on Z&aacute;rda, and 100,000 on this
house, the gardens and stables, and all its adjoining
buildings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This last loan I never made; it was no money of mine.
When did your Honour borrow it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two days after the fire, last September.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Rosenstein say the money came from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jews, whenever they lend money, always protest their own
poverty, and speak of a friend who is rich and is the real lender.
When I originally borrowed of Rosenstein, I did not believe that
story. Later on . . . you told me that it was your money I was
borrowing . . . I never inquired further after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. Will your Honour continue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know exactly how much money interest I have
agreed to pay. That dirty Jew always made me sign a paper; as if
the word of a Hungarian nobleman was not as good as any
paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These papers I have here,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
&ldquo;is this your lordship&rsquo;s signature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty glanced at the papers which Kem&eacute;ny was
holding towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is my
writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your lordship at all remember the amount of the
interest you agreed to pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly . . . but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it at all like this?&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
beginning to read from the paper, &ldquo;I owe you 300,000 florins
in gold. For this, until I repay it in full, I promise to pay you
interest every year, one hundred head of cattle, of which there
shall be ten bulls and ninety cows, and five thousand hectolitres
of wheat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On that first loan I have paid now every year, since over
five years, fifty thousand measures of wheat, some two hundred head
of cattle and sheep, and I don&rsquo;t know how much
poultry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did your lordship do it, when you only agreed to
pay five thousand measures of wheat, and a hundred head of
cattle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, man, that from the first Rosenstein demanded
usurious interest in the name of his friend, who I supposed was
yourself; that he would not let me have the money without I signed
his cursed papers, promising to pay his outrageous
demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papers? Were there more than one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I always signed two every time I received the
money. I don&rsquo;t quite remember,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty,
with exasperating vagueness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your lordship <i>must</i> have seen what you wrote;
you <i>must</i> have read what you put your name to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the devil get into the cursed things! I never read
them, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never read them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was fairly staggered. In his careful, thrifty,
peasant mind, such negligence was nothing short of criminal.
Clearly the Jew had had an easy game with this careless, shiftless
spendthrift, who seemed utterly ignorant of the value of all he was
so casually signing away with a flourish of his pen, without
deigning even to glance at that to which he had put his name. It
seemed to Andr&aacute;s almost incredible, and just for a moment he
doubted whether Bidesk&uacute;ty was not playing some game too deep
for his peasant mind to fathom. But Bidesk&uacute;ty looked so
puzzled himself, so wretched and hopeless, that Andr&aacute;s felt
truly sorry for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your lordship sent for me to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To ask you if you cannot forego some of that
interest,&rdquo; interrupted Bidesk&uacute;ty again nervously;
&ldquo;I thought you could easily do that without losing very much
by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my lord, had I ever done so dishonourable a thing
as to extort usury like that from you,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s
with a smile, &ldquo;I would well have deserved that blow on the
head eight months ago, the scar of which I still bear. I see
clearly now that that confounded Jew has used my money and my name
to practise the most villainous usury upon you, and that&mdash;
your lordship must pardon me for saying this&mdash;you have allowed
yourself to be robbed in a most careless manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could I do? I wanted the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship knows best what you wanted it for. No good
has come of the money, and your lordship is suffering deeply for
some unfortunate follies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to speak to me like that. I allow no
one to condemn my actions. Certainly not such as
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not let us quarrel again, noble lord,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, who this time was determined not to lose his temper,
&ldquo;but rather let us see which way it will be best for me to
help your Honour. I can, of course, get the other papers out of the
hands of that cursed Jew, those, I mean, which deal with loans I
actually did make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do with them?&rdquo; asked
Bidesk&uacute;ty, still suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destroy them,&rdquo; replied Andr&aacute;s simply.
&ldquo;Unfortunately it is not in my power to force Rosenstein to
give you back all that he has extorted from you. I can thrash him
to within an inch of his life,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but that
would do no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that is not the worst,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty
with a sigh; &ldquo;what is gone is gone. I can pay neither
interest nor principal of that last loan; the day you and
Rosenstein have granted me expires this week; I have not a groat in
the world; my best land is under water, my beasts have not yet
recovered from the fearful shock and terrors of that awful night in
September, and my beautiful house of Bidesk&uacute;t, where I was
born and had hoped to die, will fall into the hands of a
stranger&mdash;yours&mdash;Rosenstein&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; added
the poor man ready again to break down. &ldquo;What difference does
it make to me whether it is Jew or peasant that drives me from my
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lordship does not remember what you signed, in
connection with the loan on this house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, man, I never read what I signed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s with an impatient
sigh, &ldquo;but you must have some sort of an idea as to what
money you are actually owing at this moment upon that one loan and
the interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that the money I had was 100,000 florins, that
there is some outrageous interest due on it, of which I have not
paid one measure of wheat or one head of cattle; and that with my
early crops under water, I see absolutely no chance of ever paying,
neither that, nor anything I owe you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will talk about your debt to me later on, when we have
satisfied Rosenstein, and made your house secure from his clutches.
I have not the money with me to-day, but I will see him to-morrow,
and have a look at all the papers he holds. We can both only pray,
my lord, that I shall be able to buy them at a reasonable figure. I
am not made of money,&rdquo; added Andr&aacute;s, smiling,
&ldquo;as your Honour has often said; thank God, however, I have
enough yet to let you be in my debt, with regard to the house,
instead of in the Jew&rsquo;s, and I can assure your lordship that
I will never be hard upon you in the matter of the
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty seemed hardly to realise the enormous service
which the young peasant was thus quietly offering to render him.
For the last few months his situation had appeared to him so
hopeless, he had brooded so deeply and so darkly over his
inevitable ruin, that the glimmer of hope which this man so
unostentatiously held out to him appeared too faint to penetrate
through the dreary veil of his misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever interest you wanted,&rdquo; he said, dejectedly,
&ldquo;I could not pay you, while fire and water fight alternately
against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told your lordship that I would not be hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to humiliate me by conferring favours upon
me?&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty, fretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to humiliate any one, being only a peasant
myself,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s with a pride which at least
equalled Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s own, as he drew up his tall
figure to the full height, and looked the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t
straight in the face. &ldquo;Your lordship has asked me to help
you. You know best if you can accept the only help I can suggest
without losing your dignity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking you were my creditor, I only asked for time. I
do not see why you should part with your money to help
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a single man, my lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s,
with inexpressible sadness, &ldquo;my dear mother and I have enough
to feed ourselves and all those who ask us to feed them; I have no
desire to save, and we must all try to help one another on this
beautiful lowland of ours, so that it remains fruitful and
prosperous, such as God created it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had rested his elbow on the table, and hidden
his face in his hands, so that the peasant could not see how deeply
he felt his present position, how humbled he really was in his
pride at being so absolutely bounden to one beneath him, to one who
was quietly giving him the most serious lesson he had ever had in
his life. He felt very like a chidden child, still obstinately
shutting his eyes to the fact that nothing but his own folly had
brought him to the verge of ruin, and looking on all his
misfortunes as the relentless hand of fate.</p>

<p>There was a long silence between the two men; Andr&aacute;s
waited till Bidesk&uacute;ty had composed himself, and after a
while he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I your lordship&rsquo;s permission to see Rosenstein
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! . . . Yes!&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty, hurriedly;
&ldquo;I am grateful to you, friend . . . yes, very grateful, . . .
and . . . you need not fear . . . I will repay you all soon . . .
very soon . . . you are placing your money on good security. . . .
Next year my mill will be at work . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can easily talk of that later on,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, gently; &ldquo;if your lordship will allow me, now I
will go; my mother will be waiting for our Easter meal, and the
roads are muddy towards Kisfalu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah! Yes! Yes!&rdquo; added Bidesk&uacute;ty,
nervously, &ldquo;but . . . but . . . will you not . . . break the
bread with us? . . . with me . . . I mean . . . for, of course, the
Countess . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had looked with some amusement at the poor man
struggling through this evidently most uncordial invitation. He was
far too shrewd not to guess how unwelcome a guest he really would
be at the noble lord&rsquo;s table, and far too proud to avail
himself of Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s sense of obligation towards
him. He had risen to his feet, and in his great mantle, with his
tall, broad stature, he seemed to tower in his pride above the
unfortunate nobleman, with his seven centuries of ancestry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank your Honour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, if you
will allow me, I will join my mother at our own mid-day meal. My
two little servants would be sad to see my empty chair on Easter
Sunday, and I would not like to be the cause of the noble Countess
being forced to eat the blessed meats apart from her
lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come to me after you have seen Rosenstein
to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Bidesk&uacute;ty, evidently much
relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will certainly bring you the papers at once. You will
be glad to see them destroyed,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, preparing
to take his leave.</p>

<p>For a moment Bidesk&uacute;ty hesitated. The guest who had come
to the rescue when all seemed lost, and who had staved off the ruin
which had been knocking at the door, was about to depart. Surely,
the laws of hospitality demanded that he should be accompanied to
the gates, that the stirrup-cup should be handed to him by his host
before he rode away.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s readjusted his mantle over his broad shoulders,
tightened his belt, took up his cap, and bowed to the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t. Gyuri again put out his hand, which the peasant
grasped, after an imperceptible moment of hesitation&mdash;then,
the next instant, he was gone, his steps echoing on the flagstones
of the hall, and it was old Jank&oacute; who offered the peasant
the stirrup-cup, which Andr&aacute;s refused; whilst from the room
above, Bidesk&uacute;ty watched his creditor with a puzzled look on
his face.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18" id=

Rosenstein The Jew</b>
</h2>

<p>Nobody knew in the village exactly how Rosenstein the Jew lived,
and no one could really boast of ever having entered the small
cottage in which he had lived for over a quarter of a century. He
kept neither man nor maid, so must have done every kind of work for
himself, from stewing his own &ldquo;guly&aacute;s&rdquo; to
looking after his own chickens, of which he kept a few in the bit
of garden at the back, and his cow, a beautiful milcher, from the
Kisfalu herd, which he had bought from Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s.
Every Saturday, however, old R&oacute;za, Dar&aacute;zs
Laczi&rsquo;s mother, had to go and do his work for him; on that
day, although he could not go to Synagogue, since there was no such
place of worship nearer than the one at Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s, he kept
his Sabbath most strictly, and remained all day indoors, doing
absolutely nothing but take his meals, which Zsuzsi cooked for him,
and to whom he gave ten kreutzer (about twopence) every Saturday
for her trouble.</p>

<p>Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s looked with some doubt through the
half-open door into that cottage on the following afternoon; it
seemed so dark and close within. He knocked several times at the
door before he heard a shuffling footstep across the room, and
Rosenstein&rsquo;s husky voice asking who was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, Rosenstein, let me
in! I wish to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor house is too much honoured,&rdquo; said the Jew,
barring the way across the threshold; &ldquo;if you desired to
speak with me, I would have gone where you had bidden
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me in, man,&rdquo; said Kem&eacute;ny peremptorily,
&ldquo;what I have to say to you cannot be said at a wayside inn,
or on the road, and my time is short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for the Jews reply, Andr&aacute;s pushed him on
one side and went in. He had to stoop as he crossed the threshold,
for the doorway was low and heavy rafters supported the thatched
roof. At first he could see nothing round him, for the tiny window
was masked by an old coat, which was nailed across it, so as to
entirely obstruct the daylight. The heat inside was overpowering,
for there was a huge fire in the great earthenware oven, on which
something, that was strongly flavoured with garlic, was simmering
gently.</p>

<p>As Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the darkness,
he noticed a table in the middle of the room, of dark polished
wood, on which were spread several papers. Before it a chair had
apparently been hastily pushed aside. Otherwise the room appeared
empty; at the farther end, a door led to an inner room, beyond
which was the tiny garden, and a shed for the cow.</p>

<p>Rosenstein had hurriedly endeavoured to collect the papers
scattered on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave those alone,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, putting his
hand over them, &ldquo;I expect those papers are the ones about
which I have come to speak to you. But take that rag from off the
window; I must have some light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The villagers are so inquisitive, your Honour,&rdquo;
protested Rosenstein, whose sallow cheeks had become of a pale
ashen colour, as Andr&aacute;s, sitting on the edge of the table,
had picked up all the papers, and was preparing to look over
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you to let in more light,&rdquo; said the peasant,
peremptorily. The Jew obeyed. For fully five minutes there was
silence, during which time Andr&aacute;s quietly read each paper
through, whilst Rosenstein watched anxiously every varying
expression of his face as he read. When Andr&aacute;s had finished,
he replaced the papers on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he asked quietly, &ldquo;that
some eight months ago I once told you that I would thrash your very
life out of you, if ever I found you out trying to deceive
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honour&mdash;&rdquo; began Rosenstein,
protesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, do you remember?&rdquo; interrupted
Andr&aacute;s, still very quietly.</p>

<p>There was no reply. The Jew looked frightened; once or twice he
passed his tongue over his lips, which seemed parched, and his
knees shook under him visibly, as he dropped into the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought with me,&rdquo; resumed Andr&aacute;s, who
was still sitting on the edge of the table, &ldquo;the riding-whip
with which I thrash my herdsmen if I catch any of them ill-using a
dumb brute unnecessarily. I have only struck a beast once with it,
and that was a pig which had turned savage and bitten a shepherd in
the leg. To-day I shall use it upon you, because you have not only
deceived me, and brought my good name to shame, but because you
have cruelly and unnecessarily ill-used one who had done you no
wrong, and brought him to the verge of ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honour&mdash;&rdquo; protested Rosenstein again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not done yet. When I have finished with the
thrashing I intend to give you, you will hand over to me the papers
relating to the loan of 100,000 florins, which you made upon the
house of Bidesk&uacute;t (which is not here among these papers on
the table), in exchange for the sum of 105,000 florins which I
shall hand over to you, this being at a fair rate of interest, upon
the money you lent six months ago. As for these papers here, they
are valueless, and when you have had your thrashing, we will
destroy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s thereupon calmly took off his mantle, and drew
from out his belt a short-handled whip of twisted leather.</p>

<p>Rosenstein was positively livid. Though he was well used to
sundry thrashings from hot-tempered noble borrowers, there was a
nasty look in Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s eyes, which foretold that the
present experience would be decidedly more unpleasant than any in
the past. But the astute Jew was not a man to be taken unawares; no
doubt, when he first entered upon the hazardous game, which he now
stood a sad chance of losing, he had prepared for an eventuality
like the present one. He knew that he would not always be able to
keep creditor and debtor apart, and that, sooner or later, an
unpleasant encounter with his rich employer would be the inevitable
result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; he said with absolute calm, whilst
Andr&aacute;s cracked his whip through the air, &ldquo;you think I
have deceived you, and perhaps to a certain extent I have done so,
but not quite so much as you think. I cannot save my poor old
shoulders from your riding-whip, seeing that you have the advantage
over me in point of strength and age, but, surely, if I have
deserved a beating, you would not be cowardly enough to thrash me,
who am weak, and let him who is strong, and far guiltier than I, go
free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it to me, if some one else helped you in doing
your lying, cheating trade? I have not had any dealings with other
miscreants save you. But if it will ease your sore shoulders to see
those of your accomplice smart&mdash;well! if you will name him to
me, I promise you he shall not come off second best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein was quietly chuckling to himself, and looking at the
young peasant from under his shaggy eyebrows, with a satirical
smile playing upon his thin lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if that accomplice is the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t,
Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Look here, your
Honour,&rdquo; he added as Andr&aacute;s, puzzled, had paused a
moment, giving the Jew a chance to speak, &ldquo;I do not, of
course, know with what lies the noble lord over at Bidesk&uacute;t
has been stuffing you up; whatever they were, you have evidently
believed them, and have come here thinking that I was the vilest
thing on earth, only fit to be touched with the same whip with
which you thrash your pigs. But when your Honour read books on law,
and studied Latin with Pater Ambrosius, you must have learned also
the good sound saying: that one man&rsquo;s tongue is good, till
the other man&rsquo;s begins to wag. If your Honour desires to be
just, you will hear me, and then decide whose shoulders are more
worthy of your riding-whip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was obvious that Andr&aacute;s would listen, for he had
folded his arms over his chest, and placed the whip on the table by
his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I said before,&rdquo; resumed Rosenstein, whose voice
now was perfectly assured and steady, &ldquo;I do not know what
stories your Honour has heard. I will tell it, such as it all
really happened, the truth of which I swear by our forefather
Abraham, by Isaac, Jacob, and by Moses the lawgiver. The noble lord
wanted some money, a great deal of money; your Honour perhaps has
no idea how much went into that wonderful mill, which has never
ground yet a thousand bushels of wheat. You were willing to lend
his lordship what was more than a reasonable amount of money on the
security of Kisfalu first, then of Bidesk&uacute;t, and finally of
Z&aacute;rda. I am a poor man, and no farmer, but I say it humbly
that the money you lent was quite as much as the land was worth.
But the most noble lord wanted more, a great deal more; his mill,
his machinery, his improvements swallowed up the money you lent,
and like the ogres children are frightened with, when they had
swallowed all, they wanted more. The owner of Bidesk&uacute;t,
Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda had no more land to offer as security; I
could not, as he wanted, ask your Honour to lend any more; I had
some money put by. Is that a sin? . . . Your Honour&rsquo;s father
put a couple of millions into a wine barrel. I sank mine into a
Hungarian nobleman&rsquo;s bottomless pockets. . . . But, mind you,
<i>I</i> had no security . . . only my lord&rsquo;s august name at
the bottom of a piece of paper. . . . You understand these things .
. . the worse the security . . . the heavier the interest . . . I
had no wish to part with my money, in order merely to gratify the
whims of an arrogant, spendthrift lord. I had no cause to love him,
for, whenever I refused to lend him all the money he wanted, he had
me whipped by his lacqueys. . . . Once he forced me to break the
laws of my religion, and stuffed pigs meat down my throat in order
to make his kitchenmaids laugh. . . . No! I did not love him . . .
but I lent him money . . . at interest . . . just interest . . .
you must judge me rightly . . . and consider . . . I had no
security.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein had told this extraordinary tissue of falsehoods with
perfect self-possession. All his nervousness had gone, and as he
proceeded with his narrative, he wore such an air of truth, and the
whole circumstances seemed so absolutely plausible, that
Andr&aacute;s was fairly staggered. More and more puzzled, he tried
to read the Jew&rsquo;s very thoughts beneath the mask of bland
innocence he wore, and his honest mind refused to grasp the obvious
fact that one of the two men&mdash;the lord or the Jew&mdash;was
telling him a complete tissue of lies. Being simple and honest, he
had a great desire to be just, and, in a matter of rectitude, both
Jew and lord seemed to him to have an equal right to be
believed.</p>

<p>Rosenstein, through his very calling in life, was accustomed to
note every change in the human face. The young peasant&rsquo;s keen
frank eyes were the very mirror of his mind within, and the Jew
soon saw that his narrative had had a sufficient air of truth to
have, at any rate, severely shaken Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s conviction
of his guilt</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he resumed after a pause, &ldquo;I do
not expect you to believe my words without proofs. Here are the
papers relating to three loans which I made to my lord. They are
signed &lsquo;Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri&rsquo;; he will not deny his
own signature; he cannot do it. . . . I do not know what lies he
has told your Honour. A man who has no respect for religion can
have no respect for truth . . . but he cannot deny his
signature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does not deny any signature, but he says you made him
sign two papers, which he never read. He owns that he had the
money, that he agreed to pay the usurious interest, set forth on
your papers, but, although he does not deny that the signature at
the bottom of the papers which I hold is his, he says he knows
nothing of their contents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does your Honour, who knows something about business,
really believe that a man would be fool enough to put his name to
papers without knowing what they contain?&rdquo; asked Rosenstein,
with a shrug of the shoulders. .</p>

<p>He had&mdash;perhaps unknown to himself&mdash;played his trump
card here. There was no doubt that, to the peasant, the idea of
Bidesk&uacute;ty professing not to have read the contents of the
papers he had signed was absolutely preposterous; although, until
he had spoken to Rosenstein, he had never actually discredited the
noble lords statement, now that it was jeered at by the Jew, it
struck him again forcibly as shiftless beyond the bounds of
possibility.</p>

<p>Once more he took up the papers that were lying on the table,
and read them through very carefully, with a more and more puzzled
air. They certainly bore out the Jews statements to the full;
although in them Bidesk&uacute;ty acknowledged the debt, and agreed
to pay the usurious interest charged therein, there was no mention
of any security whatsoever. Triumphantly, the Jew watched his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the fire, your Honour, when my lord required more
money, and I began to feel that perhaps my speculation was becoming
hazardous, I exacted the house and grounds of Bidesk&uacute;t as
security for the next loan. I was obliged to do that in my own
interests, as a wholesome weapon over his head. Remember, it is all
I have as security for the vast sums of money I have lent; whilst I
hold that, I can enforce the payment of the interest on the other
loans. I know the noble lord would not part with the house as long
as he had a quarter of wheat left which he could throw to me when I
became pressing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was prepared to take over the loan on the house,&rdquo;
said Andr&aacute;s, &ldquo;and brought the money with me
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can your Honour suggest such a thing?&rdquo; said
Rosenstein with amazement. &ldquo;If I part with that one security
I hold, what chance have I, not only of ever seeing a florin of the
principal, but of being able to enforce the payment of the
interest? You hold Kisfalu, Bidesk&uacute;t, Z&aacute;rda as
security . . . what chance would I have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you seize the house of Bidesk&uacute;t and drive the
noble lord and his family away from their home, you have no better
chance of getting the remainder of your principal and interest,
and, according to your statement, you will then have paid 950,000
florins for a house, a garden, a few stables, and two or three
fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is comfortable,&rdquo; said the Jew placidly.
&ldquo;I can live in it, if I like. I am a poor man, with simple
tastes; the garden and the fields will yield me all I
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man! the house will fall into ruin, if it is
uninhabited. Ten years hence, unless you keep it in proper repair,
your 950,000 florins will not fetch as many pence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose, your Honour,&rdquo; said the Jew with slow
emphasis, &ldquo;that I am content to pay 950,000 florins for the
pleasure of seeing that man a beggar, and without a home, the man
who amused himself by seeing me whipped by his herdsmen, and by
forcing pig&rsquo;s meat down my throat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s looked astonished, even awed, in spite of himself,
by the tone of bitter, deadly hatred, which made the words come out
of the Jews mouth like the hissing of a poisonous snake. Again
there was a long pause. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was quite at a
loss to know what to do. The whole thing nauseated him. So many
lies had been told, there was so much greed, so much cupidity, so
much hatred on one side, such hopeless thriftlessness on the other,
that it seemed absolutely impossible to mediate with equal justice
to both. There is no doubt that but for a fair, girlish vision,
which, with provoking persistency, haunted his dreams, he would
have left the careless, arrogant lord to his fate; but, before him,
his fancy conjured up a pathetic picture of that curly head, bent
down under a weight of sorrow, of those forget-me-not eyes dim with
tears, of that sweet mouth lined with care, and perhaps want. . .
.</p>

<p>Great God! such a vision, haunting him by day and by night, seen
in the fitful light of the moon, or mirrored across the plain by
the fairy Morgana, would drive him mad, and sap his manhood, his
pride, reduce him to an imbecile visionary, the laughing-stock of
the county of Heves. . . .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rosenstein,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I
am pledged to see justice done, in this unfortunate business. My
lords tale is very different from yours. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the papers,&rdquo; repeated the Jew,
obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He denies any knowledge of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he deny his signature? persisted Rosenstein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he does not; but . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no <i>but</i>, your Honour; you must in all
justice admit that. You have seen all the papers. Here,&rdquo; he
added, taking another from his breast-pocket, &ldquo;is the one
relating to the last loan . . . the one on the house of
Bidesk&uacute;t. . . . He promises to pay back the principal and
interest in six months; failing which I have the right to seize his
house. There is no argument possible. I am within my rights; and
your Honour cannot say I have wronged you in any way. Your money is
perfectly secure; what he has agreed to pay you he can pay or not
as he pleases; the land is well worth foreclosing on. . . . I have
nothing but the house . . . the house I mean to have, unless the
noble lord fulfils his engagements to me . . . which by his own
signature he has agreed to do. This is my last word. . . . Your
Honour is just. . . . Read the papers . . . you will see that I am
within my rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of that fact there was absolutely no doubt, and
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s felt how hopeless any question of
temporising would be. It would only stave off the inevitable ruin
by a few months. If the Jew had spoken the truth&mdash;and there
certainly was every material proof that he had&mdash;then,
obviously, it would be the grossest injustice to him to advance the
money to Bidesk&uacute;ty; thus taking over the mortgage of the
house, and for ever depriving Rosenstein of any weapon with which
he might enforce at least the part repayment of all the money he
declared he had lent in the past, and of all the interest in the
future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rosenstein, supposing all you say is correct .
. . now do not interrupt me, I said <i>supposing</i>, as there are
two of you, each with a different tale . . . you have admitted
yourself that three of the loans are unsecured, but that for the
pleasure of seeing a poor old man and his family turned out of the
home which has belonged to their ancestors for hundreds of years,
you are willing to lose the bulk of your principal and interest. .
. . Now, will you tell me, what would induce you to forego that
pleasure entirely? . . . in other words, what money would you take
for every scrap of paper you hold which bears the signature
&lsquo;Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein had been expecting this all the time. In order to
have this question put to him, he had lied and sweated now for over
an hour, but not a line of his thin countenance expressed triumph
or satisfaction, as he said placidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will own to your Honour that I have often thought that
my lord would one day put such a question to me. If the thought
occurred to me, just after a whipping from his servants, I
invariably dismissed it, for I knew that I should refuse to take a
penny less than my due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, suppose, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that it was I
who put that question to you? What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps imperceptibly, certainly unconsciously, a
shade&mdash;oh! it was the <i>merest</i> shade&mdash;of softness
passed over Rosenstein&rsquo;s hard face, and his voice was not so
sharp and hissing, whence replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honour is the only person in the lowlands who speaks
to me as to a man, and not to a dog. You have never borrowed money
of me, and given me a blow as part interest. Once I fainted in the
heat of the sun: you had me taken inside your house and tended me,
till I was able to be on my feet again: when every other peasant or
lord in the county would have kicked the fainting Jew to one side.
. . . If your Honour will make me a fair and just offer for these
papers, I will take it. But your Honour must remember that you are
throwing away your money on an arrogant lord, who will give
contempt in return for kindness, insult for generosity. The lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t can be nothing to a peasant of Heves. Let your
Honour think well before you waste your father&rsquo;s savings on a
spendthrift magnate who looks upon you as the dirt beneath his
feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein had said this very solemnly, and, while he spoke, the
ugly look of deceit and cupidity seemed to have left his face. His
stooping back was erect, his eyes looked straight before him, there
was a certain dignity in his spare form, clad in the long
threadbare garment; the centuries of humiliations, of buffetings,
seemed forgotten, and contempt as absolute, as withering, as that
of the Hungarian nobleman for the despised race, appeared in every
line of the thin, satirical mouth, for the spendthrift, arrogant
lord who had trampled him under foot.</p>

<p>No doubt the young peasant felt the truth of the Jew&rsquo;s
words, the folly of his own hopes, which, at this critical
juncture, were, in spite of himself, surging within his heart. Half
absently, he collected the four papers, which Rosenstein was
handing to him, and the hand which, as if in weariness, he passed
over his eyes, trembled visibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to be just with you, Rosenstein, but I have not
much money left. If&mdash;what seems to me inevitable
&mdash;Kisfalu and Z&aacute;rda pass into my possession, after the
settling up of these affairs, I must keep some of it, to use if any
calamity of flood or fire overtake me. But I will give you 300,000
florins for these pieces of paper, provided my lord gives his
consent to the bargain.</p>

<p>Not with a look did Rosenstein betray his triumph. He closed his
eyes, no doubt in order to thoroughly enjoy the glorious vision
which the young peasant was holding out before him. His deceit, his
astuteness, had profited him beyond the dreams of avarice; never
for a moment did remorse enter his grasping soul, at the hideous
way in which he was deceiving a just and honourable man. The Jew in
Eastern Europe stands at war with the rest of the population;
beaten, buffeted, derided, often injured, his only weapon is his
money; with it, he gets his revenge on peer and peasant, and wields
it mercilessly against all, as a poor vengeance for all he has to
endure. He bears insults, blows, contempt of every kind, but on the
subject of money he is the master, for he has the superior
intellect, and the careful thrift, the lack of which brings his
oppressors, sooner or later, within his clutches. Rosenstein had
himself owned that from Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s he had never
received anything but kindness, and the hideous advantage he was
taking of the young peasant&rsquo;s sense of justice was not aimed
at the individual; it was race against race, and Andr&aacute;s was
paying more than a quarter of a million in expiation of all the Jew
had endured at other hands than his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are hard upon a poor man,&rdquo; said Rosenstein at
last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my last word,&rdquo; replied Andr&aacute;s
decisively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you give me time to think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a week from to-day. I must speak with my lord; he
will also want time to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosenstein noticed how dreamily he spoke, saw the strange,
wistful look in the young man&rsquo;s eyes, and, probably, his
shrewd mind guessed what was passing in that honest brain, for a
curious smile parted his thin lips; he rubbed his bony hands one
against the other, and across his eyes there flashed that look of
deadly hatred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I wait upon your Honour this day week at the inn,
or at Kisfalu?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither. I will come myself, and bring the money . . . if
my lord consents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up his cap and his riding-whip, and, nodding to the Jew,
found himself in the village street again.</p>

<p>All seemed as bright and as gay as ever. Easter Monday had
brought young men and maids without. The former, armed with squirts
and watering-cans, were deluging the pretty girls as they passed,
in true Easter Monday custom; whilst the latter, courting the
watering, proud of their dripping skirts and wet hair, made but
mock pretence at running away from their tormentors; seeing that
the girl whose clothes remain dry on this day can have but few
adorers.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s watched the merrymakers come and go for a few
minutes; a year ago he would have been the first to snatch a kiss
from every pretty girl, after having rendered her helpless under a
deluge of water. Today his heart seemed shut off from all his
friends and companions; it was filled with hopeless longing for a
star as far above him as those in heaven, for a fairy vision as
bright and as elusive as those Fata Morgana draws on the horizon,
beyond the plain.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19" id=

A Son Of The People</b>
</h2>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was nervous and anxious when, having galloped all
the way from &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s, he saw the yellow
walls of Bidesk&uacute;t close before him. For the first time in
his life he was mixed up, through no fault of his own, in a
transaction in which lying on one side or the other&mdash;or
both&mdash;formed a prominent part. He hardly knew how to deal with
it. If he caught some gipsy or herdsman telling him a lie, he found
his riding-whip the most conclusive argument; but what could he do,
if the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t deviated from the paths of truth? or
if the Jew had embroidered, if not actually invented, the
remarkable version of his transactions with the unfortunate
nobleman? Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s thoughts were in a
whirl. In the presence of either of the two parties he had felt
that each was telling him the truth; chiefly because he, himself,
did not understand the process of lying, and perhaps thought that
the act of telling an untruth bore some imprint on the face of the
speaker. My lord&rsquo;s evident anxiety and trouble had distressed
him; it seemed to him an impossibility to act the part of sorrow as
Bidesk&uacute;ty had done; and yet, again, there were the papers,
which Rosenstein swore by all his patriarchs that my lord had
signed, well knowing what they contained.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty had watched anxiously for the peasant through
his window, and had given orders that Kem&eacute;ny was to be
brought to his room immediately. All the morning he had been unable
to sit still, and Countess Irma had in vain begged for an
explanation of his moodiness. Bidesk&uacute;ty, with truly
masculine exclusiveness, would not allow his wife or daughter to
participate in his troubles. The woman in Hungary is seldom the
friend of her lord; though he holds her in high esteem: high enough
to share all joys and honours equally with him, but not high enough
to allow her to join in his sorrows.</p>

<p>There was a perceptible hesitation in Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s
manner when my lord, eager and excited, stretched out a hand
towards him. The young peasant, full of the belief that the
nobleman was playing him false, paused an instant before he placed
his honest hand in my lord&rsquo;s trembling one. But
Bidesk&uacute;ty looked so careworn, so haggard and anxious, that
the kind-hearted young peasant felt again that overwhelming
sympathy for the foolish and sorely stricken man; more especially
as in his softened mood there was a look in my lord&rsquo;s eyes,
which were blue, that melted all Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s anger as the
snow upon the plains at the first kiss of the April sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you bring good news, friend?&rdquo; asked
Bidesk&uacute;ty.</p>

<p>He could not sit; he was pacing up and down the room restlessly,
his anxious eyes every now and then searching his creditor&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The news I bring, my lord may call good or bad, I cannot
tell,&rdquo; replied Andr&aacute;s quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak, man, cannot you see that I am in a fever? Speak!
am I a beggar? . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, my lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s;
&ldquo;first let me assure you that things are not desperate, that
they depend on yourself to be put entirely right. There is no cause
for sorrow . . . as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenstein? . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, my lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s with
some nervousness, but trying to speak very kindly, &ldquo;the Jew
has a very different tale to tell, from the one your lordship has
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a furious bull Bidesk&uacute;ty faced his creditor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man, do you dare to say . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only dare humbly,&rdquo; interrupted Andr&aacute;s with
absolute calm, &ldquo;to try and see justice done, and to help your
lordship in your great difficulty. I am neither noble nor learned;
my education is what a kind and clever priest has given me, in the
intervals of cultivating the soil, and I am not clever enough to
read in the minds of other men. Your lordship has told me one
thing: Rosenstein tells a different tale . . . unfortunately the
Jew holds proofs of his assertion, and you have but your
word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you dare stand there before me, man, and say that
the word of a Hungarian nobleman is not better than a thousand
proofs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know very little about noblemen, my lord, and I am
afraid in the law courts of Gy&ouml;ngy&ouml;s the papers you
signed will weigh heavily against the words you speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I never read those confounded papers,&rdquo;
persisted Bidesk&uacute;ty obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless going over the same ground, your lordship;
and I think it would be best, in your own interests, that you
should hear Rosenstein&rsquo;s story, so that you may decide
whether you will accept what I propose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I listen to his tissue of falsehoods? Why does
he not come here and repeat them, so that I may flog his lying soul
out of his cursed body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because your lordship has unfortunately, and most
recklessly, placed yourself and your good name unreservedly in his
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a court of law, my lord, we all stand alike. Pater
Ambrosius will tell you that before the throne of the Divine Judge,
lord and peasant, Jew and Christian, will have equal justice, and
that the lawmakers and judges in our beautiful country try to be as
just as God Himself has taught them to be. Now will your lordship
listen? . . . I have here in my pocket three separate papers,
mentioning three separate loans I made to you on the security of
Kisfalu, of Z&aacute;rda, and of Bidesk&uacute;t (the latter
without the house and grounds and stables); these loans your
lordship acknowledged and agreed to pay a certain interest upon
them. . . I must ask your lordship not to interrupt me; this is a
very serious affair, not of feelings, but of facts. Your lordship,
in your present circumstances, is absolutely unable to pay the
interest, which is already in arrears, for at least a year to come;
as for the principal, it is entirely out of your lordship&rsquo;s
power now ever to repay that, as you will never have the chance of
putting a single florin by, while you are obliged to satisfy
Rosenstein&rsquo;s demands. . . . Does your lordship understand
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moodily, Bidesk&uacute;ty nodded his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far, therefore, as law and justice are
concerned,&rdquo; resumed Andr&aacute;s emphatically,
&ldquo;Kisfalu, Z&aacute;rda, and the lands of Bidesk&uacute;t
become my property absolutely. I have paid 850,000 florins for
them, which is more money than any other estate of the same size
would fetch in the lowlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s paused a moment, for there was a look of such
hopeless sorrow on the ruined noblemans face that it went straight
to the honest young peasant&rsquo;s heart to have to still further
plunge the knife into the unfortunate man&rsquo;s wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have been only too willing to wait and temporise
till your lordship&rsquo;s circumstances looked a little more
cheerful,&rdquo; he resumed with infinite gentleness, &ldquo;but as
matters now stand I should be doing you no good, and hopelessly
endangering my fortune, which, after all, I cannot very well afford
to do. Rosenstein declares, and I am bound to admit that he has
full proof of what he says, that after your lordship had concluded
the loans with me, you borrowed at intervals another 950,000
florins from him, for the greater part of which he had no security,
and therefore charged the usurious interest you know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had the money. I am ready to swear that, since my
word is not good enough,&rdquo; protested Bidesk&uacute;ty
hopelessly; &ldquo;the man is an outrageous liar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, your lordship signed receipts for the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I never read what I signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenstein swears that you did. And he holds the receipts
for the money. Does your Honour deny in any way that you signed the
papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I must have signed altogether seven papers; I do not
deny that; two when I gave Kisfalu as security; two when I pledged
my lands of Bidesk&uacute;t; two with Z&aacute;rda, and one some
eight months ago, when I mortgaged this house, grounds, and stables
for 100,000 florins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I only hold three of those papers, my lord; and I
know nothing of this last loan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed indeed hopeless; Bidesk&uacute;ty was beginning to
dimly realise how utterly blind and foolish he had been. An
implacable Nemesis had overtaken him in the midst of all his
arrogance and reckless extravagance, and he had fallen a helpless
prey in the hands of the first unscrupulous man who had laid a trap
for him. For some time there was silence, while the wretched man
stared moodily before him, making vain endeavours to realise the
utter ruin which stared him in the face. Andr&aacute;s, full of
deep sympathy, ready with the help he had come to bring, was
seeking for words in which to frame his offer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty at last,
&ldquo;that the news you brought could not very well have been
worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, my lord, I have told you the worst; the evil
as it stands; it is high time I placed before you the remedy, such
as I humbly propose it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A remedy? There is one, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hungarian nature is eminently buoyant and sanguine. In a moment
Bidesk&uacute;ty raised his head, and a flash of hope illumined his
careworn features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why in the world did you sit there, then, and croak like
some raven of evil, man? If you have good news, why did you make
sport of me, by watching my misery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To every evil there is a remedy, my lord, only we are not
always ready to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to speak, instead of preaching, man?&rdquo;
said Bidesk&uacute;ty, boiling over with impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosenstein, my lord, knowing that his money is in peril,
and holding but one real security, namely, that on this house and
grounds, has offered to take one third of the capital lent, in
exchange for every scrap of paper your Honour has ever
signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One third? . . . Why, you said just now that I have
signed receipts amounting to 950,000 florins . . . one third of
that would be . . .?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;300,000 florins, in ready money, my lord,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man! I have said before: you are made of money; 300,0
florins may mean nothing to you. I can no more find that sum than I
can jump out of this window without breaking my neck. I have not a
single foot of land that I can call my own, not a stack of corn
which I can sell. The remedy may sound a good one to you, it is the
last death-blow to all my hopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know perfectly well that your lordship has no money;
and I was not proposing that you should pay that 300,000 florins,
but. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that I should,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s very
quietly.</p>

<p>To all appearances he had never departed from his attitude of
absolute calm; and Bidesk&uacute;ty&mdash;quite unable to
understand the peasant&rsquo;s self-contained nature&mdash; looked
with astonishment at this man who spoke of vast sums of money as if
they were no more to him than a handful of maize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty at
last, &ldquo;or else you do not altogether realise my position.
What use would there be in my owing you 300,000 florins, any more
than 950,000 to Rosenstein? I could no more repay the one than I
can the other; and the lowest possible amount of interest would,
with the present state of the floods, be absolutely beyond my power
to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not proposing to lend your lordship the
money,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s in a voice so low that
Bidesk&uacute;ty could hardly hear it, &ldquo;but . . . to give
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently his self-control was being put to a severe test. His
lips trembled as he spoke, and his voice, hardly above a whisper,
had a curious gasping tone. His breathing came hard and fast, as if
the powerful chest was bursting from within, and his hands were
tightly locked together, whilst on his forehead great veins stood
up like cords. Still, Bidesk&uacute;ty, unconscious, did not
understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me, man?&rdquo; he said with sorrowful
dignity, &ldquo;you are dreaming! I have seen much trouble lately,
it is true; but I have not yet, thank God, stooped so low as to
take alms from a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! not from a stranger, my lord . . .&rdquo; added
Andr&aacute;s with an effort, &ldquo;but . . . from one near . . .
very near to you . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand! . . . What do you mean? . . . I can
accept money from no one . . . you cannot think such a thing
possible! . . . What do you mean?&rdquo; he repeated again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s at last, shaking off
his nervousness, with a violent effort, and rising to his full
height so that he stood before Bidesk&uacute;ty in all the inborn
pride of a Hungarian lowland peasant, &ldquo;in my garden at
Kisfalu there is a beautiful rose-tree which stands alone in
fragrant loveliness. My mother never planted anything close to it,
for both she and I felt that no other flower was worthy to bloom
near that rose, so surpassingly beautiful is it. Alone it stood for
many years, growing every summer more radiant, and filling the air
around with its sweet overpowering odour; a very queen among her
humbler fragrant sisters, which, in her isolation, she seemed to
disdain. . . . This year, my lord, at the foot of that lovely
rose-tree there has sprung&mdash;who knows how?&mdash;a humble bed
of moss. Was it the birds who wantonly carried the vulgar seed to
the court of the queen of flowers? or did that Divine hand which
cares for every blade of grass direct that that humble moss should
be at the feet of the gorgeous rose? . . . Who knows? . . . but
since a year, the tiny green leaves have dared to look very closely
at the magnificence of the garden queen, whilst other fragrant and
beautiful flowers have been kept respectfully away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For one moment the young peasant paused. His voice had become
quite firm; though still low and infinitely tender, it was clear
and without a tremor. The flowery mode of speech&mdash;the
inalienable characteristic of the Hungarian language, when applied
to deep emotion&mdash;sounded peculiarly sweet in the mouth of this
handsome young son of the soil, and, instinctively,
Bidesk&uacute;ty listened, vaguely feeling that beneath that proud,
calm bearing lay hidden a torrent of feeling so overwhelming that
it commanded respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first, your Honour,&rdquo; resumed Andr&aacute;s,
&ldquo;my mother would have punished that moss for its presumption,
and, tearing it up by its root, have flung it out, with other
noisome weeds, on to the plain where it might wither, since it had
dared approach so near the queen. But the tiny, soft bed looked so
green and cool, and the sun above so scorching and hot, that the
moss was allowed to stay for a while to protect the feet of the
queen from the more parching rays. Since then, my lord, there it
has remained, humble and protecting, cool and green in the heat of
the summer, warm and clinging in the winter, sheltering the roots
of the glorious flower from every ill the varying seasons may
bring; adding nothing to the beauty and fragrance of the rose, but
lying at her feet, unperceived and untended, ever growing strong,
fulfilling the mission it has received from tiny birds or from
Almighty hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did the first inkling of the truth dawn upon his hearer&rsquo;s
mind? or was it merely the tender appealing tones of the rugged
voice which still compelled Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s attention
?</p>

<p>&ldquo;As that humble moss has dared to creep at the feet of the
sovereign queen of flowers, I, most noble lord, I . . .
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s . . . the lowly peasant lad, have dared
to raise my eyes to the stars, and among the myriads of glorious
jewels, which render our lowland sky so incomparably lovely, they
have rested upon one who, among her brilliant sisters, is fairer
than them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he paused; in Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s face he could read
that the nobleman had understood. The proud lord had risen suddenly
to his feet; his eyes flashed with anger, and his hand was raised
with a quick, wrathful gesture, as if to chastise the presuming
peasant. Andr&aacute;s did not stir from where he stood; only he
bent his own proud head very low, as if ready to receive the
humiliating blow which his presumption had deserved. But
Bidesk&uacute;ty&rsquo;s hand dropped by his side, the flash of
wrath vanished from his eyes; once more the look of hopeless
dejection and misery overspread his face, and without a word he
buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, after a long pause,
humbly and gently, &ldquo;you cannot throw more contempt on my
folly than I have already done, or despise my arrogance more than I
do myself; but if I am not smitten with blindness by an Almighty
hand, irate at my presumption, if, in your just anger, you do not
strike me dead, where I stand, then will your Honour pause and
remember that, as the moss shelters that rose, so will I guard and
cherish the treasure, if you will entrust it to my care. Never
shall the breath of sorrow dare to disturb one golden curl on that
queenly head; never shall the dust of the plains dare to sully the
hem of her garment. My wealth, my lands&mdash;once all your own
would then become hers, and I will be happy in seeing her tiny
hands dispose of them as she will; then, with the right of keeping
every ill from her path, I will have earned that of helping you now
and always, in every difficulty. Then, in the future,&rdquo; he
added, whilst for the first time his voice trembled, and a sigh of
longing which was almost a sob escaped his broad chest, &ldquo;if
the Almighty hand of God rests with a blessing on the union of the
lowly peasant with the queen, and a tiny voice whispers in your
ears, &lsquo;Grandpapa,&rsquo; then you will feel, living your own
life again in the baby one, that your beautiful lands of Kisfalu,
Bidesk&uacute;t, and Z&aacute;rda are all your own once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After these last words spoken by And&aacute;s, there was dead
silence in the room. The young peasant, worn out by the long,
steady effort at self-control, had walked up to the window, and,
resting his head upon the cool panes of glass, looked out through a
mist of gathering tears at the garden, where the early spring
flowers were opening radiant beneath the first warm rays of the
sun. Far ahead lay the plain, solitary and still, and all around
the land he loved so well, which now at last was his. This, the
dream of his life, the ambition of his manhood, how poor, how
unsatisfying seemed, now that another longing had crept into his
heart, a wistful longing which made him as a child, with heavy
tears blurring his vision, and great aching sobs shaking his
frame.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started; a hand&mdash;heavy, but not unkind
&mdash;was placed upon his shoulder. He turned and saw an old man,
bent with grief, with a look of humbled pride in his sorrowing
eyes, which went straight to the honest young peasant&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend, when I first realised,&rdquo; said
Bidesk&uacute;ty, &ldquo;what your meaning was, an uncontrollable
fit of anger seized me. You must forgive me . . . I am an old man .
. . and have not yet fully learned the lessons of this century. The
idea that I should give my daughter to a peasant seemed to me so
preposterous that for the moment I forgot . . . that you hold my
life practically in your hands . . . for if I and my family are
turned out of our home, I shall never survive the sorrow, and God
only knows what would happen then to my wife and to my
Ilonka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s would have spoken, but Bidesk&uacute;ty resumed
immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you would say: that you have no desire to
force me. Hey! friend, that is as it may be! We are all born free
agents in this world, and yet who can resist his destiny, struggle
how he may? The land which once was mine has passed out of my hands
into yours with a few careless dashes of the pen on some accursed
bits of paper. The next few days will, unless a miracle should
happen&mdash;and there are not many miracles nowadays,&mdash;see me
and my family go forth like a herd of wandering gipsies, homeless
and friendless and those who have fawned most on my hospitality
will be the first to throw stones at me for my folly. In the midst
of this hopeless ruin you come to me, and offer not only to save me
and mine, but by this same offer guarantee that my lands will, in
spite of all, belong to my child, and ultimately to my
grandchildren. What can I do? When a man has a knife at his throat,
it is a small matter to ask him if he will part with his
wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay! do not speak! You have had your say. What you now
would add could not alter things. You urged your strongest plea
when you spoke of my grandchildren; and in holding my lands, you
know well that you hold the key to my consent. What can you say
more? that you love my daughter? Why, man! of course you love her;
she is very beautiful and infinitely above you. We all love God and
the Virgin Mary. That you will be a slave to her? I have no doubt
of that; you come from a race of serfs. That you will make her
happy? There man, I think you will try in vain; my daughter Ilonka
could not be happy in the hut of a peasant. If I and her mother
give our consent to this strange union . . . mind you, I only said
&lsquo;if&rsquo; . . .we shall be sacrificing our child for the
sake of our grandchildren, and their children after them; for the
sake of the land of Bidesk&uacute;t, which will then never pass out
of the family at all, though it will have been tainted by passing
through peasant hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, wearily, &ldquo;when
I came here to speak with you of these things, I tried to think of
you only as the father of the being who to me is almost divine.
Would it not be best both for your own dignity and for mine, that
you did not force or sting me into forgetting this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, friend, I am hasty! Events have crowded in
upon me . . . and have deprived me of my power of thinking. . . . I
have had much trouble . . . you are young . . . you do not
understand the griefs of older men. . . . Perhaps also your pride
has never suffered a humiliation . . . like the one I suffer now. .
. . Will you leave me to myself? . . . I must think . . . I must be
alone . . . and I must speak with the noble Countess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently Andr&aacute;s had taken his cap, and silently,
automatically, he left the room. As in a dream he walked across the
hall, and down the noble staircase. Bidesk&uacute;ty had not bidden
him good-bye. He had said nothing definite. He had hurled a
problematical &ldquo;if&rdquo; at Andr&aacute;s in the midst of
insults calmly spoken, and the young peasant&rsquo;s pride had
writhed beneath the cold, callous, cruel words.</p>

<p>Oh! that love should make such abject fools of us, that for one
sweet sake we should be willing to endure tortures such as the very
demons of hell cannot devise for the punishment of souls at war
with their Creator! How strange it is that at the feet of one being
on earth we should be willing to sacrifice our manhood and our
self-respect, and yet that this very sacrifice, that same
degradation, should ennoble us beyond all glorious deeds, and
render us equal to the angels.</p>

<p>How Andr&aacute;s spent the remainder of that day he could not
say. The roads were muddy, and Csillag could do no more than
carefully pick her way in the mire. Yet she understood her
master&rsquo;s sorrow, for she roamed with him upon the
<i>puszta</i> till long after the shades of evening had wrapped the
lowlands in gloom. Far ahead, the roar of the Tarna lent an
additional note of sorrow and desolation to the land. It was late
when at last Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s reached the quiet
farmhouse where Etelka, at her spinning, was waiting anxiously for
her son. She went to the door when she heard Csillag&rsquo;s hoofs
outside, and through the darkness watched Andr&aacute;s as he
gently groomed his favourite animal and made her comfortable for
the night. He had not seen his mother evidently, for otherwise his
first greeting would have been for her. Etelka&rsquo;s heart felt
inexpressibly sad when she saw how slow and heavy was his tread, as
he walked towards the house. In the garden he stopped close to
where stood a lovely rose-tree covered with tiny buds, the promise
of a glorious June; and Etelka wondered why her son touched each
unopened blossom with his hand, and then stooped as if to kiss
them.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20" id=

The Answer</b>
</h2>

<p>Four days later the answer came. For four weary days had the
suspense lasted, during which time Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s iron
constitution almost gave way under the strain of wearing
uncertainty. No one heard his voice during that time. Silently he
toiled like a very slave upon the beloved land which now, at last,
was his. With almost savage fury he tried to tire out his strong
body by day, for the sake of earning a few hours&rsquo; heavy,
dreamless sleep by night. Of his hopes, his fears, his love, he
would not, dared not allow himself to think; and when the early
evening shadows had closed in upon the land, he would mount on
Csillag&rsquo;s back and roam restlessly with her upon the plain.
There in solitude, silence, and peace, his weary mind found rest,
his aching nerves solace and comfort. The distant roar of the flood
lulled him to forgetfulness, and, musingly, he would watch for
hours the wandering storks overhead, or the swallows in their
flight. He had told everything to Etelka. It would have been
useless to try and deceive her; her fond, anxious, motherly eyes
read deeply within the loved son&rsquo;s soul; long ago she had
guessed his secret, had seen wild joy alternate with mad grief, and
hope arise but to give birth to despair. And, silently, she had
wept and prayed: prayed to God and to the Virgin Mary to avert the
catastrophe which threatened her Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s happiness.
Her shrewd mind, rendered doubly acute by earnest love for her boy,
showed her the hideous image of misery that so preposterous, so
unequal a marriage would inevitably bring beneath the humble
peasant&rsquo;s home. The proud lady, nurtured from her cradle to
look on every peasant with contempt, linked against her will to
save her parents&rsquo; ruin, with one of the despised race! Oh!
the pity of it! the shame! the remorse! Etelka foresaw, with
unerring judgment, the contempt with which the dainty girl would
place her soft white hand into Andres&rsquo;s rough brown palm, the
blush of horror and anger with which she would respond to his
strange masterful passion, the passion of an unlettered,
half-educated son of the soil, born and bred in the free life of
the plain, with warm, breathing, living nature to teach him the
lessons of life, and the years of petty tyranny behind him, during
which every feeling, every emotion was held in constant check;
ready, now that, rich and free, he had reached powerful manhood, to
break through every bond, and cry out for response from one being
who should return ardour for ardour, passion for passion, kiss for
kiss.</p>

<p>Etelka wept and prayed as she thought of that son eating his
heart out for longing to obtain a smile from those aristocratic
lips, and wearing out his manhood to smooth away the curl of
contempt from the corners of the dainty mouth.</p>

<p>Oh! for one great crushing blow! the refusal of that careless,
yet surely loving father, to sacrifice his child to his own folly,
and of that proud mother to allow her daughter to stoop so low, for
the sake of the gold and the land! A blow which would be terrible
when it fell: and Etelka&rsquo;s heart ached, in the very midst of
her prayers, when she thought of the sorrow, the despair of her
boy, seeing all his fairy visions suddenly and irretrievably
dispelled; but, though the blow would be cruel, it would be sharp
and sudden, and Etelka trusted that the all-absorbing care for that
beloved land would soon teach him to forget the other love, the
Fata Morgana-like vision born but to fade away.</p>

<p>How infinitely better than the daily, hourly torture of an
ill-assorted union, the wrecked life, the hourly shame, the mad joy
of a few hours, the grief of lifelong days! And now the answer had
come: a message from the noble lord of Bidesk&uacute;t to
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, bidding him come to the castle to
present his respects to the noble Countess and to her young
ladyship: the peasant was bidden to pay his court to the noble
lady, the stars were descending from heaven in order to walk upon
the plains.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was from home when the message came, brought by
Jank&oacute;, who had ridden over from Bidesk&uacute;t burning with
curiosity as to what my lord&rsquo;s extraordinary condescension
might mean. He would have stayed to ask a hundred questions, for
all tongues were wagging within the kitchen of Bidesk&uacute;t, but
Etelka seemed so sad and looked so silent that Jank&oacute; dared
not speak; he felt as if, unconsciously, he had been the harbinger
of evil tidings, and rode away wondering why Etelka&rsquo;s eyes
were full of tears when she heard of the unwonted honour done to
her son.</p>

<p>Etelka was glad that Andr&aacute;s was away. He had ridden over
to Z&aacute;rda at break of day, and the mother wished to have her
son secure in her arms when she first told him the great
news&mdash;the realisation of his maddest hopes.</p>

<p>She watched at the door till Jank&oacute; was out of sight, then
gazed out across the <i>puszta</i> in the direction of
Z&aacute;rda; and when she saw a tiny speck upon the horizon, which
gradually grew and took the form of a horse and rider, idly picking
their way through the muddy roads, with a heavy sigh she went
within.</p>

<p>She waited till her son, tired out from his ride, had knelt down
beside her spinning-wheel, and, placing his arms round her, had
rested his hot, aching head on her shoulder, then she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s! for good or for evil, your wishes are
fulfilled. My lord desires your presence at the castle, that you
may pay your respects to the lady who is to be your
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, for Andr&aacute;s neither spoke nor
stirred. His arms were still round Etelka&rsquo;s shoulders, and
his head upon her breast. She felt his grip tighten and his whole
frame tremble against hers; she could not see his face, and could
scarcely hear him breathe; but suddenly a great sob, like the
breaking of an overburdened heart, seemed to shake him from head to
foot, and, with a wild cry, that at last betrayed all the pent-up
passions, the love, the hopes and fears so resolutely held in
check, he buried his head in that dear mother&rsquo;s lap, and
sobbed with this joy so great, so wild, that it was almost
pain.</p>

<p>Gently Etelka soothed him, smoothed his matted hair, spoke
quaint endearing words, such as she used to whisper when as a tiny
lad he had sought comfort in her arms against his father&rsquo;s
rough words and knotty stick. Gradually the paroxysm passed away;
but for quite a long while he remained at her knee, holding the
dear one in his arms, his head pillowed against her breast; and
she, poor soul! her eyes swimming over with tears, prayed to God
not to forsake her beloved son in this, his greatest joy.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21" id=

The Noble Lady</b>
</h2>

<p>It was an anxious morning. Most of the night, neither
Bidesk&uacute;ty nor the Countess Irma had slept; each lay awake
thinking of what the coming, eventful day would bring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had told her all,&rdquo; sighed
Bidesk&uacute;ty mentally, as he despatched Jank&oacute; off on the
momentous message, which was to bring the strange suitor to the
noble house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better so!&rdquo; was the self-satisfied conclusion
arrived at by the Countess Irma, as she turned over her
daughter&rsquo;s ribbons and sashes to decide which would be most
suitable to wear on the important occasion.</p>

<p>And now it was close upon mid-day, and the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t was nervously pacing up and down his smoking-room,
unable to sit still, or even to smoke his favourite pipe, awaiting
anxiously, and dreading the first interview: speculating on the
probable attitude of his daughter, the possible scene.</p>

<p>He had had a very hard task in explaining to his wife the cruel
necessity which would force their only child, the last descendant
of those chieftains who had helped to place King
M&aacute;ty&aacute;s on the throne, into the arms of a
peasant&mdash;the grandson of a serf. Countess Irma was a woman of
the world. The horror of so preposterous a misalliance struck her
at first with terrible force; but, when she found herself placed
between the two alternatives, of facing complete penury in a
provincial town, with one maid to cook the daily meal, and a
tax-collector thundering weekly at the door, and that of seeing her
daughter the wife of a man infinitely beneath her in the social
scale, but whose wealth was large enough to restore to
Bidesk&uacute;t all its former splendour, she chose what she
considered the lesser evil.</p>

<p>The idea that any selfishness was mixed up in this choice would
have seemed to Countess Irma utterly preposterous. Marriage, in her
eyes, was as much a business contract as the buying and selling of
land or wheat, and of far too serious a moment to be swayed by any
question of sentiment. That the young peasant&rsquo;s one desire
(now that be had had the temerity to become passing rich) was to
own a noble wife, was too obvious a fact to be much wondered at,
and the idea that Ilonka might have hidden ideals, unbeknown to her
mother, was in itself an impossibility.</p>

<p>Countess Irma had never heard of marriage in connection with any
sentiment. Ruin had, with truly plebeian want of discrimination,
knocked and been admitted within the aristocratic walls of
Bidesk&uacute;t. A certain marriage&mdash;preposterous, monstrous,
true, yet perfectly feasible&mdash;presented itself as a means of
averting a catastrophe which was a hundred-fold more hideous, and
more monstrous; Countess Irma thought &mdash;as her husband had
done&mdash;of future generations, of duty to posterity, of a great
name which for five hundred years had added lustre to the history
of a warlike country, now threatened with extinction and ruin; her
duty appeared clear to her,&mdash;she felt she was making a
sacrifice, nerved herself to the task, and unflinchingly fulfilled
it. Her daughter was asked of her. She gave her daughter, trusting
that she could keep her well under her wing for at least eleven
months out of the twelve, during which Ilonka might fancy herself a
grass-widow, living with her parents. That the peasant husband
would ever dare to assert his rights, to keep his wife under his
lowly roof, never entered Countess Irma&rsquo;s head. She was
convinced that her decision was for her daughter&rsquo;s and her
husband&rsquo;s happiness, fully convinced that she was acting
unselfishly in the matter, doing what was right. Bidesk&uacute;ty,
humiliated, heart-broken, harassed by his wife&rsquo;s reproaches,
had left the child&rsquo;s future in her mother&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her have a free choice,&rdquo; he had begged half
remorsefully.</p>

<p>But Countess Irma called his hesitation &ldquo;sentimental
folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and for
God&rsquo;s sake do not interfere. You have proved yourself utterly
incapable of conducting your own affairs. This one at least I mean
to carry through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What passed between mother and daughter Bidesk&uacute;ty never
knew. The interview lasted over two hours, late one night, and when
at last Countess Irma came to bed, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can send for the peasant to-morrow. The sooner the
marriage ceremony is gone through, the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty longed to ask many questions. In his heart he
had a deep love for and pride in the lovely child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, Gyuri, I have not told Ilonka why this marriage
is necessary. Thank God I have brought her up to obey her parents
without question and without argument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not have her unhappy . . .&rdquo; protested
Bidesk&uacute;ty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Gyuri, what nonsense you talk. Of course she is
not unhappy. Why should she be? She knows nothing of the man; she
cannot dislike him, therefore how can she be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was unanswerable logic, apparently. Bidesk&uacute;ty
sighed, but he trusted to his wife&rsquo;s judgment. He fully
believed that women understood one another, and he had never been
allowed a say in the bringing up of his daughter.</p>

<p>And Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s had been sent for. He was
expected every moment. Bidesk&uacute;ty was hideously nervous;
anxiously he scanned his wife&rsquo;s face; she sat rigid and erect
in the middle of the room, working at some knitting with irritating
persistency. Close by the window, her hands lying idly in her lap,
her face turned away from her parents, sat Ilonka.
Bidesk&uacute;ty, who had expected and dreaded a pathetic feminine
scene, with tears and prayers, felt quite relieved to see his
daughter quiet and serene.</p>

<p>He certainly thought her strangely altered since last night. She
seemed somehow to have grown more stately, and decidedly older. Her
eyes were tearless, but they had a curious look in them, as if they
were looking far, very far away, and all the pink colour had left
her cheeks. But the Countess Irma had said that the child was not
unhappy. She certainly had made no protest, and seemed quite calmly
to be awaiting her future husband. No doubt natural, girlish
coyness, excitement, curiosity, had made her cheeks pale, and given
that far-off strange look to her eyes.</p>

<p>The sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs up the acacia drive, . . .
Bidesk&uacute;ty wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead:
his nervousness was quite painful; even Countess Irma&rsquo;s hands
trembled as she held her knitting; soon the sound of voices, the
opening and shutting of doors, a heavy, firm tread on the
flagstones of the hall and passages, preceded by
Jank&oacute;&rsquo;s lighter step. . . . Ilonka, alone, where she
sat, had not stirred; her hands, which lay idly in her lap, had not
trembled, only her eyes were now fixed, large and glowing, on the
door before her. . . .</p>

<p>Then Jank&oacute; threw it open, and, immediately behind him,
the tall picturesque figure of the peasant suitor, in all the
barbaric splendour of his national attire, stood out against the
massive dark oak frame of the door. His great height, his broad,
powerful shoulders, the dignity of his presence, seemed still
further enhanced by the great mantle of sheepskin, gorgeously
embroidered in many coloured designs by Etelka&rsquo;s loving
hands, which hung from his shoulders to his feet, by his broad belt
covered with massive silver bosses, and by the full white lawn
sleeves and trousers, a very masterpiece of exquisite fineness and
delicate embroidery. His face was very pale, and his eyes&mdash;
dark, burning, magnetic&mdash;had travelled swiftly round the room,
till they had caught sight of the frail figure by the window. . . .
He seemed almost as in a trance; half dazed he walked into the
room, and stooped to kiss the hand which the noble Countess had
deigned to extend towards him.</p>

<p>My lord had said &ldquo;Isten hozta!&rdquo; (God has brought
you) and now was talking in disjointed sentences of lands and
floods, of rain and sunshine. Andr&aacute;s scarcely heard; he
tried to answer intelligibly, forced himself not to look towards
the window, where the Countess stood talking to his fairy vision
who seemed so strangely white and fragile.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the Countess beckoned to him; he hardly had the
strength to walk; he passed his hand across his eyes, for his
vision was getting dim.</p>

<p>The graceful white form had risen. A pair of blue eyes, large,
burning, terrified, were fixed upon him as he advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, my child, this is Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s of
Kisfalu, who has your fathers and my consent to express his love
for you, and ask you to become his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice sounded as if it were far away. A roar like that of
the flooded Tarna filled his ears; all his senses seemed
concentrated in one of gazing at his dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give him your hand, Ilonka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically, obediently, a tiny white hand was stretched
towards him, and Andr&aacute;s stooped very low and tremblingly
took it in his own. A look of infinite yearning and tenderness was
in his eyes, a look of appeal infinitely touching and pathetic in
the powerful, rugged face; that look but begged for a look, a
responsive gaze from those blue eyes which stared so strangely, so
vacantly, as if he, in his humility, his love, his adoration, were
far away from her.</p>

<p>Tenderly he raised the tiny cold hand to his lips, and sought to
warm it into response by one long passionate kiss. . . . A slight
tremor seemed to shake her, and she tried to snatch her hand away
from his. He longed to speak to her, but great sobs choked his
throat; nervously he held the tiny hand imprisoned in his own, and
with longing gaze tried to look into those blue eyes which stared
so vacantly, so strangely afar.</p>

<p>Joy, ah, well, it was a great joy, a joy so infinite, so
complete, that his heart well-nigh broke under it, and the pain of
it seemed more than he could bear.</p>

<p>My lord came up to speak to him; the Countess also said a few
words: both meant to be kind, no doubt, but their voices jarred
upon Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s nerves, forcibly breaking the enchanting
spell, and dragging him back to earth. The tiny hand had escaped;
he was forced to turn towards Bidesk&uacute;ty, who led him to the
farther end of the room to talk of business matters. How long he
stayed, or what he said, Andr&aacute;s did not know. The talk of
business, the formalities, the discussion of the marriage plans
sickened and enervated him. He longed to take that fragile being in
his arms, and on Csillags back ride away with her across the
<i>puszta</i>.</p>

<p>She had not spoken once. The whole thing seemed strangely unreal
to Andr&aacute;s; the voices of my lord, and of the lady his wife,
sounded in a weird confusion in his ears; even his vision had grown
troubled, so long and so earnestly had he gazed in the one
direction. The Countess said something about the month of May, and
the best time for the wedding; Andr&aacute;s replied to that, no
doubt, for my lady rose soon after and said some very condescending
words. But after that it was all darkness, dreary and blank, for
the seat in the window was empty.</p>

<p>The lord of Bidesk&uacute;t had become silent. Andr&aacute;s
thought he might take his leave. He longed to be alone, to ride
across the plain, to feel Csillags hoofs thundering beneath him, to
leave the castle behind, where the air seemed to have grown
stifling, and where strange spectres of evil foreboding seemed to
dance a hideous dance of death before him.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty accompanied him to the door. With his own hands
he handed up to Andr&aacute;s the stirrup-cup of rich Hungarian
wine. Jank&oacute; stood wondering at the gate, and nearly fell
over backwards when he heard my lord say: &ldquo;God be with you,
my son!&rdquo; adding immediately: &ldquo;Your place will be laid
for you at the mid-day meal on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22" id=

A Dream</b>
</h2>

<p>The rest of the day Andr&aacute;s spent upon the plain; not even
to his mother could he have spoken of this interview, of that
fragile vision, of the tiny hand on which, in his temerity, he had
dared to imprint a kiss. He left Csillag to roam about at will,
and, spreading his mantle upon the ground, he allowed his mind to
dwell at leisure on the wonderful thing that had happened.</p>

<p>The feeling of unreality still clung to it; and dreamily he
gazed at his rough brown hands which had held another
imprisoned&mdash;so tiny, and oh! so cold! Now that he was away
from her, Andr&aacute;s cursed himself for his clumsiness, his
silence. There were so many things he might have said to her! if
only those great blue eyes had been once turned to his, if only she
had not been so strange, so distant! . . . and was not that slight
tremble a shudder which went through her young body, when his kiss,
glowing and scorching with his wild passion, had dared to touch her
tiny ice-cold hand?</p>

<p>He might have said to her: &ldquo;I love you, Ilonka! my Ilonka!
mine! mine! mine!&rdquo; but then, how infinitely great was that
love, and how desecrated it would seem if words tried to express
it!</p>

<p>His! His! She really one day would be his!. . . One day soon . .
. the Countess had spoken of one day in May. . . . When the sun was
hot, and the roses would begin to bloom . . . one day . . . she
would come home with him . . . her white figure, tall and lithe,
would fill the lowly farmhouse with a radiance which would be
almost divine. . . . She would stand with the last rays of the
setting sun, which always crept in through the tiny windows,
playing upon her golden curls. . . . There would be silence in the
house, for Etelka will have gone to her own room to pray or to
spin, leaving her son and his bride alone. . . . His bride! . . .
With the sun upon her golden curls . . . and Andr&aacute;s would
watch every hair of that dainty head, and, with the exquisite
self-inflicted torture of suspense, touch with reverent finger
every curl, ere he dared clasp the queenly form wholly in his arms,
drinking with insatiable eyes that loveliness fashioned by God for
him, the lowly peasant, prouder than any king.</p>

<p>Oh! the joy of this dream! the agony of the fairy vision, the
pain that was a happiness to bear, the joy that was inexpressible
torture! Alone upon the vast plain, away from human eyes,
Andr&aacute;s dared to conjure up this vision, and found mad
delight in torturing himself with those Fata Morgana-like dreams of
great blue eyes, large and wondering, growing soft and misty, moist
and tender with responsive passion, of that exquisite tiny mouth,
perfumed and chaste as the petals of a rosebud, of the soft red
lips, parting with a smile, preparing for a kiss, of the warmth of
her breath, the tears in her eyes, the quickly drawn breath through
her delicate nostrils. . . . And she in his arms! his bride! his
wife! Andr&aacute;s closed his eyes&mdash;the vision faded away,
and in its place he saw another, the reality of a few hours ago:
tall and stately, and oh! so cold! with a far-off look in those
blue eyes, large and tearless; and a curious tremble&mdash;was it a
shudder?&mdash; which left the tiny hand colder, icier, still.</p>

<p>But, no! no! this vision should not stay! that coldness, his
ardour would melt! that absent look, his glowing eyes would
imprison! that shudder, his love would soothe. He would strew roses
at her feet; wealth, joys, pleasures, all that could bring a smile
on those lips, a tender look in those eyes; and if all he had and
could do or give her was not enough, he would lay his life in her
tiny hands and let her crush it if she would.</p>

<p>Long after the darkness had covered the plain with gloom,
Andr&aacute;s still lay upon the earth, wrapped in his mantle, his
eyes following the swiftly travelling clouds, dwelling dreamily on
each twinkling star.</p>

<p>Etelka knew that she would not see him that night. And yet she
could not go to rest. Her hands lying idly in her lap, she sat
beside the window looking out anxiously towards the plain. Only
when the first streak of gold broke the darkness of the sky did she
hear the well-known sound of Csillags hoofs. Then she put out all
the lights, content that her son was safe, knowing full well that
he would wish to be alone. She listened for his tread, which was
light and free; she watched him in the yard as he tethered Csillag,
and she saw that he walked erect. Then, as he crossed the garden,
he again paused beside his favourite rose-tree: one small bud
showed a tiny streak of pink between its green sepals. Etelka
remembered how, earlier in the day, she had noticed this first sign
of the opening bloom,&mdash;now, with a quick, triumphant gesture,
Andr&aacute;s plucked the opening blossom and carried it with him
to his home.</p>

How The News Was Received</b>
</h2>

<p>Thank God, news travels very slowly on the lowlands, at all
times, but more especially when the early spring rains have
rendered the roads well-nigh impassable. Countess Irma had reckoned
upon this, when she decided that the unfortunate marriage should be
accomplished before the news of it could reach the ears of her
relatives and friends only as a <i>fait accompli</i>, mixed with a
sauce of reasons, both romantic and plausible, which had induced
the proud Countess to give her only daughter to a peasant.</p>

<p>Ilonka had been tiresome: more tiresome than the Countess Irma
could ever have supposed a daughter of hers to be. Not that there
had been any question of resistance, or actual disobedience. Thank
God! girls in Hungarian aristocratic houses had not yet caught the
hideous English ideas of independence. &ldquo;Honour thy father and
thy mother&rdquo; was still more than a dead letter to them; but
the child had argued and had begged; had talked of foolish
sentiment, of love for that penniless young Mad&aacute;ch, whom the
Countess sincerely wished at the bottom of the Tarna.</p>

<p>There had been one or two very upsetting scenes, and Countess
Irma&rsquo;s ears were very frequently shocked at her
daughter&rsquo;s strange ideas of matrimony and love. Love, before
marriage? Truly preposterous. <i>She</i> had never been in love
with Gyuri till after the wedding Mass, when it became her duty to
love him! and was there ever a more model couple in all the
lowlands of Hungary? Never had any one heard the slightest dispute
or faintest disagreement between the Countess and her lord. The
idea of love in a young girl&rsquo;s mind was positively indecent!
Fortunately the Countess was more than convinced that young
Mad&aacute;ch was about to marry the daughter of Schmidt the
jeweller, whose dowry was said to exceed three millions in solid
gold.</p>

<p>There was no crime in fashioning that conviction into a positive
fact, since it had the desired effect of driving those indecent
thoughts out of Ilonka&rsquo;s head, and brought about that peace
of mind and submission to her parents&rsquo; will which is the only
real happiness for a well-born girl. Certainly, after she had been
told of this fact, the child became quite submissive; she never
even expressed horror at the idea of having a peasant for her
future lord. Her attitude towards him was from the first beyond
reproach. Countess Irma was proud of her daughter&rsquo;s frigid
bearing towards the low-born odious creature who had dared to ask
for her daughter&rsquo;s hand in exchange for his gold.</p>

<p>At heart the Countess rejoiced at the humiliation the peasant
would have to endure in the future at his wife&rsquo;s hands, and
the withering contempt with which Ilonka would one day overwhelm
him would more than counterbalance the bitter humiliation her
mother was now suffering, through forcing her aristocratic lips to
say &ldquo;fiam&rdquo; (my son) to a man who wore a sheepskin
mantle, and had hands as rough and brown as those of the herdsmen.
The Countess&rsquo;s mind dwelt lovingly on all the snubs, the
disdain, he would have to endure anon, when the marriage was
actually accomplished; and these thoughts helped her to get over
the immediate present, when twice a week she had to receive the
odious man with some show of civility.</p>

<p>The arrogance with which he bore himself was simply unendurable;
Countess Irma tried by every means in her power to wound or to snub
him; but her weapons, more often than not, seemed to turn against
herself. He had a way of looking through and beyond her, with a
look which placed him beyond the reach of her most poisonous darts.
At first she had talked a great deal of the honour which was being
done to a man in so lowly a station; but once he had quietly
remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, noble lady, understands better than I do the
honour of touching even the tips of Ilonka&rsquo;s fingers. But
that honour is so great that it cannot be enhanced by any reference
to it by other lips than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that the Countess gave up the topic. She maintained a
coldly haughty attitude, on the perpetual defensive lest the
peasant should presume on his position by undue familiarity. She
never allowed Ilonka to see her <i>fianc&eacute;</i> out of her
sight, nor to exchange any but the merest commonplace words, well
within her hearing. She had noticed with annoyance that Ilonka had
taken to blushing when she heard Csillag&rsquo;s hoofs on the
acacia drive, and this annoyed her immensely. She wished her
daughter to adhere to her attitude of disdainful impassiveness. The
low-bred peasant had got what he wanted. So had the Countess; for
the mortgage on the house had been paid up to Rosenstein; and all
Gyuri&rsquo;s foolish, careless, and compromising papers been
handed back through Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s hands and
destroyed. It was terrible to think that all the lands which had
been in the Bidesk&uacute;ty family for seven hundred years now
belonged to the descendant of those peasants who had been the
veriest slaves to their lords. Thank God! it was but a temporary
alienation into those ugly, rough brown hands. Very soon Ilonka
would have a son, who should be brought up away from his vulgar
kindred, fashioned by his loving grandmother into a true
aristocrat, with every taint of common blood eradicated from his
nature. And then, surely, after a while, Providence, all-just and
merciful, would remove the rich and vulgar father from the noble
son&rsquo;s path altogether; the boy would drop the very name of
Kem&eacute;ny that spoke of peasantry and of low birth, and a
petition, which his Majesty Francis Joseph would not refuse, would
stipulate that the noble name of Bidesk&uacute;t be borne once more
by the owner of the lands.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! there were trying days to get over, but all would be
well in time. Ilonka would no doubt go through some terrible
struggles before she finally succeeded in putting the presumptuous
brute into his proper place; therefore the Countess hurried on all
the preparations for the wedding, sorted out the linen, which from
Ilonka&rsquo;s very birth had been collected in anticipation of her
marriage. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s evidently meant to leave upon
the Countess&rsquo;s shoulders the entire onus of announcing the
news to the servants, and thence to the village. It was strange but
true that, so far, not one of the peasantry seemed to know of the
gigantic honour about to be done to one of their kind; it almost
looked as if Andr&aacute;s did not care to speak about it, to brag
of it, as people of his class surely would always do; only Pater
Ambrosius had evidently been told, for, one Sunday, just before
dinner, he had taken Ilonka&rsquo;s hand in his and, patting it
very gently, he had said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us all thank God, noble lady, for the great happiness
He has vouchsafed to grant you; and pray to Him that you may
worthily love the truly good man who is to become your
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Countess Irma had overheard this. It was a bitter moment. But
for his priestly dignity, she could have turned on the Pater for
his impudent speech. &ldquo;Great happiness!&rdquo; when her
parents were breaking their hearts with shame and remorse!
&ldquo;Worthily love?&rdquo; whilst her mother puzzled her brain as
to the best means of annihilating the &ldquo;truly good man,&rdquo;
with withering contempt.</p>

<p>Ilonka, fortunately, said nothing. She never did now. She
flitted about the house like a ghost, and no one ever heard her
talk or laugh. She carried on her frigidity, even towards her
parents. It was very heartless of the child to add to their sorrow
by seeming so obviously unhappy; and she was looking quite plain,
so thin and pale had she become.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, in the kitchen, the gossip had grown apace.
That the rich farmer of Kisfalu was on terms of the closest
intimacy with my lord was very soon an obvious fact to all. Twice a
week, now, he came to the castle, and my lord had been repeatedly
heard to call him &ldquo;my son.&rdquo; On Sundays he always rode
over after Mass, and stayed to mid-day meal, just like Pater
Ambrosius; and when Bidesk&uacute;ty and the Pater settled down in
the afternoon to their game of &ldquo;Tarok,&rdquo; Andr&aacute;s
would walk round the garden with the noble Countess and the young
lady.</p>

<p>Much had been the gossip, many the conjectures as to this
extraordinary condescension. Gradually, as from the kitchen the
news spread to the village, various theories were set up: the most
generally believed being that my lord hoped, by shaking hands with
the rich peasant, and by treating him as an equal, to win him over
to his own views about the steam-mill, and, with
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s help and influence, to start it once more on
a more prosperous career. At first that idea, originally propounded
by Vas Berczi, the village oracle, was treated with derision.
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, in spite of his silence and his
taciturnity of the past few months, was still the universal
favourite with both sexes, with young and with old; and the idea
that he could, through my lord&rsquo;s flatteries, be bribed over
to the devil&rsquo;s side, was flouted as utterly preposterous.
But, as weeks went on, and Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s visits to the
castle were as frequent as ever, and his silence more pronounced, a
certain feeling of suspicion, not altogether free from ill-will,
gained ground in &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s. There was no
doubt that for some time past a change, gradual but unmistakable,
had taken place in the popular favourite. At one time his merry
laugh could be heard ringing from one end of the village to the
other; now he seldom even smiled. Once he never could look at a
pretty girl without trying to snatch a kiss from her, in spite of
jealous suitor or anxious parent; now the village beauties looked
vainly at him, with provoking or languishing eyes; he scarcely
seemed to heed them beyond a kind &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; and there
was a strange look in his eyes as if they perpetually saw something
that was not there.</p>

<p>He never now joined his friends on Sunday afternoons in the big
barn to listen to <i>czig&aacute;ny</i> music or to twirl the girls
round in the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s, in his wonted madcap way. He
never now was found at the wayside inn, with pretty Lotti on his
knee, making her husband wildly furious with jealousy.</p>

<p>Yes! he was changed! of that there was no doubt! Very sadly
changed. The constant intercourse with my lord and his family had
accomplished what all old Kem&eacute;ny&rsquo;s money-bags had
failed to do: it had made Andr&aacute;s proud. He no longer cared
for the village, its music, its pretty girls, its dancing. He no
longer dropped silver florins into the
<i>czig&aacute;ny</i>&rsquo;s fiddles, or bought bright bits of
ribbon for the girls. Andr&aacute;s was detaching himself from
them. He was now the friend of my lord.</p>

<p>Gradually a barrier seemed to arise between him and them, built
by unseen hands; and now, when he came to the village, the younger
men took to lifting their caps to him, just as they did to my lord.
Even the older ones took to calling him &ldquo;kend&rdquo; (your
Honour), and the girls curtseyed as he passed.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s did not fail to notice the difference. At first he
felt it keenly, for he dearly loved his village and his friends;
Etelka saw it, too. She knew the evil would come, creeping apace.
It was that which she had dreaded: the gradual detachment of her
son from his old life, his helpless striving to live the new.
Andr&aacute;s had at first spoken of it, with tears in his eyes,
then, after a while, he seemed not to heed it. Certainly his manner
changed. The sunny nature had grown strangely sad, and sadness gave
a dignity to the peasant lad, to the tall, broad figure and dreamy
eyes, which all the village folk unconsciously recognised, and
bowed to, as something noble and high. Then, one day, Jank&oacute;
came riding down, all excitement, to the village; the news he had
to tell was so great, so wonderful, he hardly knew how to
begin.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s! Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, the rich peasant,
the young chap who had sung with them, danced with them, been
brought up amongst them, was . . . no! Jank&oacute; could not go
on! the words seemed to choke him . . . was going to marry. . .
.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Whom? Quick, Jank&oacute;! Long live
Andr&aacute;s and his future wife! Oh! the sly dog! so silent! so
taciturn! that was it, then? Quick, Jank&oacute;, who is it? . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And an anxious crowd gathered round Jank&oacute;. He was led in
triumph to the inn, where a litre of the best wine was placed
before him, to help him tell his wonderful news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! won&rsquo;t Zsuzsi cry! and what will Panna say? . .
. as for Erzsi, she will surely break her heart. Speak,
Jank&oacute;! is it Erzsi? . . . No? . . . Margit? . . . No? . . .
Mariska? . . . No? . . . Speak, Jank&oacute;! or may you never
speak again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never had news travelled so quickly as that which Jank&oacute;
came to bring. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was going to get
married! That was the cause of his sorrow, of his silence? Now all
would be well again! He would come back to them as merry as ever!
and give up going to the castle, and listening to my lord&rsquo;s
blandishments! He would have some one to court, some one with whom
to dance! Long live Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jank&oacute;, why the devil don&rsquo;t you speak? and
why the devil don&rsquo;t you drink? drink, man, and tell us of the
lucky girl who will share the Kisfalu money with Andr&aacute;s, and
have the best of husbands into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jank&oacute; would not speak till all were silent again, and
all crowded round him to hear the strange news. Outside the inn,
eager, curious faces were peering through the window. Within a
breathless silence fell on the excited crowd:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s of Kisfalu is about to wed
the most noble lady Ilonka of Bidesk&uacute;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as if a thunderbolt had come down from heaven, and had
fallen crashing in the midst of the village. A dead silence
followed the extraordinary announcement, while Jank&oacute; drank a
deep measure of wine, for his news had made him thirsty.</p>

<p>Then, as the sound of a rising storm, questions, ejaculations,
surmises began to be heard right and left:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jank&oacute;, you are a liar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first of April is long since gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her young ladyship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married to a noble lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in love with her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she in love with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All spoke at once. All crowded round Jank&oacute;. One pulled
his coat tails; the other tugged at his sleeve. Nobody would let
him drink. He must tell something more. He must know more of this
strange history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go outside where you all can hear, and I will tell
you all I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jank&oacute;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live Jank&oacute;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On to a huge, empty cask, Janko was pushed and hoisted. He was
fully alive to his own importance, the wonders of his news. He
viewed, from this height, the number of eager faces turned
expectantly towards him. He wiped his mouth with his sleeve, and
prepared for an interesting, thrilling speech. But, just as he was
about to begin, he spied over the sea of heads Pater Ambrosius
coming towards him. He thought that his position was not dignified
on the top of a cask; the priest might tell my lord of the way in
which his confidential valet announced the news to the village. The
noble lord might be angry. Jank&oacute; thought it prudent to
descend. Pater Ambrosius had pushed his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all seem very excited, my children,&rdquo;he said;
&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, Pater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, is it? Jank&oacute; has already
brought the news? and you want to hear all about it. Well, my
children, there is not much to say. You all know Andr&aacute;s,
whose heart is as strong as his gold, whose generosity is as great
as his riches. Is there one among you here who has not once in the
last ten years been in trouble, and gone to Andr&aacute;s for help?
and, having gone, did not get all the help, and ten times more
kindness and sympathy than he expected?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Long live Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s! Our
Andr&aacute;s! Yes! Yes!&rdquo; came from every side, while the
gentler sex, more sentimentally inclined, lifted an apron to a
moist eye or so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, my children, you will agree with me that
one so good as Andr&aacute;s&mdash;one who follows the dictates of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who has taught us to love and succour one
another&mdash;is surely worthy to wed with the noblest in the land.
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s has wooed the beautiful young lady at
Bidesk&uacute;t, and her parents have decided to give her to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she love him, Father?&rdquo; came from the
sympathetic, tearful, feminine portion of the audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The noble lady will do her duty as a wife should, and
love her husband,&rdquo; replied the old priest, guardedly;
&ldquo;and now will you all go back to your work or to your
homes?&mdash;and when next Andr&aacute;s comes to the village you
can wish him joy at his future marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was useless to talk of work that day. Those who had heard
the great news were longing to impart it to others who were away at
work on Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s land, or that of my lord; whilst
others thought they would like to wander out upon the plain and
meet the young herdsmen at the inn, and see how they would take the
news.</p>

<p>The wise old folk longed for a gossip; the news was great. Every
aspect must be discussed. It was all very well for the young ones
to be so excited; there was surely no cause for rejoicing.
Andr&aacute;s had made friends with my lord; he had been won over
to the enemys camp. He had turned his back for ever on his friends.
His pride had known no bounds. He had used his riches to raise
himself above all his equals. Naturally now he would remain among
those who had thought fit to welcome the peasant lad as one of
themselves because of his great wealth and his lands. Andr&aacute;s
would have a son who, if his mother had been a peasant girl, should
have continued his father&rsquo;s traditions of hard work on the
fields, merrymaking in the inns, love of dancing and of music, but
who now would be reared away from the village, with his heart and
mind turned against those who had been his father&rsquo;s friends
and companions. Pride is an evil thing. Andr&aacute;s was evidently
not beyond it. All the empty-headed young things would soon
recognise that in future they would have to put up with
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s condescension and patronage, which was not
worth a particle of Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s friendship and
gaiety.</p>

<p>He would come to church in a carriage, wearing a frock coat, and
discarding the sheepskin mantle; he would help my lady, his wife,
out of her coach; he would nod kindly to the young men, who would
stand gaping round, with their caps in their hands, and chuck the
girls under the chin, who would blush and curtsey. He would surely
have to be called &ldquo;honoured sir,&rdquo; and would set aside
so many measures of wheat, which Pater Ambrosius would be told to
distribute among the needy. He would not come to cheer the sick and
the old in their cottages, with his lively talk and his silver
florins, but would send alms through Pater Ambrosius&rsquo;
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we will not take it, will we?&rdquo; added Vas
Berczi, bringing his fist crashing down upon the table. &ldquo;We
will show Andr&aacute;s that we care nothing about his money, since
he is too proud to end his days among us, and to find his wife
among our daughters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feeling of the older part of the population was decidedly
antagonistic to the late popular favourite. The whole thing had
struck them as too utterly preposterous and wonderful; they did not
understand it, and they resented this sudden upsetting of all their
ideas on the unattainability of the noble folk. It almost seemed as
if somebody had had the temerity to bring down the Saints from
Heaven, and taken them for a walk down the village street. The lord
of Bidesk&uacute;t and his family were not much loved, for they
were too proud to have found their way to popularity, but, at the
same time they were the owners of the land, until very recently the
very owners of the peasants&rsquo; bodies themselves, the lords of
the country; they dispensed the laws; they were in a sphere above,
as far removed from the village folk as the Saints in their niches
in the old church. The temerity of one of their kind daring to be
at one with them seemed akin to a sacrilege. These older folk
wisely shook their heads, and predicted disaster; such an upheaval
of all their social notions would be sure to carry some calamity in
its train, and Andr&aacute;s would live to see sorrow and
humiliation follow his pride and temerity.</p>

<p>Outside, the young people did not look far ahead; they wondered
when the wedding was to be, and whether Andr&aacute;s would ask
them all to a huge supper at Kisfalu. They saw in the marriage
nothing but the gaieties and festivities of the wedding ceremony,
according to ancient traditions, with plenty of wine and dancing,
and the best <i>czig&aacute;ny</i> music in the county. They half
thought of the noble young lady as wearing thirty or forty
petticoats, and a pair of brilliant red leather boots, to walk to
church with on Sundays, such, in fact, as had never been seen for
miles around. The younger ones did not think or talk of temerity
and sacrilege, of rising to higher social spheres. To them it was
poetry, romance, the willing descent of a great lady to their own
humble but merry circle; the desire of a noble young lady to dance
the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s merrily with them in the big barn, to
enjoy herself, to trip barefoot across the muddy roads, to forsake
grandeur for gaiety.</p>

<p>They were ready to receive her with open arms, since she wished
to come amongst them: to give her such a welcome in the village on
her wedding-day as would make the vast plain resound with their
shouts. As for Andr&aacute;s, he would have, before his marriage,
to make every girl dance till she could not stand, and to make
every suitor jealous and every father furious. After that, he
would, in the natural course of events, become the jealous husband
himself, and the noble wife of the rich farmer would make close
acquaintanceship with a certain knotted stick upon her white
shoulders.</p>

<p>Ah! good days were coming! Plenty of merrymaking, plenty of wine
and music. Never had Andr&aacute;s been so popular among the
younger folk, though many tears were shed by pretty eyes at this
sudden expiration of secretly treasured hopes.</p>

<p>The old ones croaked and shook their heads; the young ones
gossiped, laughed, and cried. There was sorrow at the castle,
silence at the farm of Kisfalu, and on a solitary plain a lonely
horse and rider roamed about beneath the stars, and a great and
good heart was wearing itself out with longing.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24" id=

The Marriage</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Introibo ad altare Dei!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius has handed over his biretta to the tiny
brown-faced ministrant, and is now bending with reverent head
before the high altar, and reciting the opening prayers of the
Mass.</p>

<p>Inside the church, the air is heavy with the scent of flowers:
roses, roses everywhere, red, white, pink, yellow, in many tones of
fragrant loveliness, tied in great posies at the feet of the
Virgins statue, or on the big iron candlesticks, whilst a carpet of
many-coloured petals is strewn all down the nave. Half faded, these
throw an intoxicating, faint perfume in the air, which mingles with
the more penetrating fumes of the incense, as the little
ministrants swing their simple censers to and fro. The tiny village
church, with its rough stone pillars, its highly-coloured quaint
images, its faded altar hangings, is turned into a very bower of
sweet-scented blooms. Outside, the day is warm&mdash;one of those
early May days when the earth gives forth its first promises of
coming vintage and harvest, when the air is filled with many cries
of innumerable bird throats, when the stork calls loudly to its
mate, the swallow is busy in perfecting his nest, the sparrow and
the finch twitter in gladness at the warmth, the radiance of the
sun. It comes peeping in at the tiny leaded windows of the church,
and alights gaily on the holiday attire of the eager, curious
throng of worshippers; on the bevy of pretty girls on the left, in
the smartest of gay-coloured petticoats and embroidered corselets,
with black hair smoothly held back underneath the gorgeous
head-dress, with eyes no less bright than the glittering beads
which encircle their pretty round necks, hang down on plump bosoms,
and glisten in tiny ears. It smiles at the crowd of handsome young
men, in all the barbaric splendour of their holiday attire, with
great bunches of spring flowers fastened to their heavy mantles,
their round hats held respectfully in their hands, and adorned with
streaming ribbons of national tri-colour.</p>

<p>The Latin text of the Mass is all obscure to them; the
prayer-books are only for show, since few of them can read;
moreover, none could pray to-day, for there is such an
extraordinary thing to be seen. All eyes are turned to where, by
the communion rail, on a pair of well-worn crimson cushions, there
kneel a man and a woman. He, tall, erect, his dark head towering
above all others, his great mantle worked in gold and silver
threads, falling from his broad shoulders, like the regal mantle of
some barbaric chieftain; she, slender, fragile, in clinging, white
muslin, with a long, transparent veil, disguising the chaste young
form, and through which a few glints of golden curls can
occasionally be seen. Side by side they kneel, enveloped in the
penetrating smoke of the incense, with roses all round
them&mdash;at their feet, in half-faded masses, on the chancel rail
and steps, in great heavy bunches, thrown everywhere by hands
unaccustomed to fashion decoration, but in grotesque
picturesqueness of untidiness and plenty&mdash;side by side, to
receive the blessing of God and the Church on this union decreed on
them by the high Fate which shapes our destinies. The girl, with
tiny ice-cold hands clutching nervously at the ivory-bound
prayer-book, trying to follow the obscure meaning of the Latin
text, her blue eyes fixed steadfastly down on the pages, with not a
tear falling from beneath the heavy lids; the man, upright and
proud, with strong arms crossed tightly across his broad chest,
forcing his eyes to rest on the sacred vessels, the altar before
him, and not to dwell on that girlish figure by his side, whose
every movement sends the flames of heaven coursing through his
veins. The long folds of her veil disguise her before him, but,
beneath it, he can guess the golden curls, the delicate outline of
nose and chin, the slender, graceful curves of the throat, and his
arms tighten across his breast, till the strong sinews crack, as if
to still the exultant beating of the heart, and force the mind to
reverence and prayer.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius, bending still lower, has begun to recite the
&ldquo;Confiteor&rdquo;; his lean hand strikes his breast:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mea culpa! mea culpa! mea maxima culpa!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately behind them my lord kneels, with figure slightly
bent, as if under some terrible weight too heavy for man to bear;
he looks aristocratic and still young, among all these
heavily-built sons of the soil, in his tight-fitting frock-coat,
buttoned close up to the neck. At the &ldquo;Confiteor&rdquo; a
great sigh, which sounds almost like a sob, breaks through his
tightly compressed lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Indulgentiam, absolutionem et remissionem peccatorum
nostrorum, tribuat nobis omnipotens et misericors
Deus!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hands are convulsively clasped. He, too, prays to God for
pardon for all transgressions, all obstinacies, pride, and
vain-glory, all the follies which have thrust his dainty, high-born
child into the arms of a peasant.</p>

<p>The noble Countess, in antiquated silk which stands in rigid
folds round her, has recited the &ldquo;Confiteor&rdquo; under her
breath, out of her prayer-book, merely as a concession, for she
stands in no need of absolution, or of remission. She has
accomplished her duty, sacrificed her very pride, her own child,
her most treasured traditions, for the sake of her husband&rsquo;s
honour and the future of her race.</p>

<p>Then the worthy old priest mounts the altar steps; his new
vestments, covered with lace and embroideries (a present from
Andr&aacute;s for the great occasion), impede his movements. He
stumbles and almost falls, causing a titter among the giddy young
folk at the back, while old ones shake their heads and make the
sign of the Cross, for the omen forebodes nothing good. The tension
of suspense, of excitement, is so acute that the most trivial
occurrence calls forth nervous merriment, or flood of tears.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Pater is reading the beginning of the
Introit&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Deus Israel conjugat vos</i> . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s listens reverently. Yesterday the kind old priest
had patiently gone through every word of the wedding Mass with him,
so that he might understand what God enjoined him to do, and what
he would swear to fulfil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the God of Israel unite you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday, when he had read these words, they had seemed to him
as words spoken by angels, when opening the gates of paradise.</p>

<p>The band of gipsy players, inseparable from any Hungarian
function, grave or gay, has been stationed at the further end of
the church. They know little of hymn or psalm tune; their music
consists of dreamy Hungarian songs, which they play with soft,
sighing sounds, and which fill the tiny, roughly-built church as
with an appealing whisper.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s closes his eyes. He has promised the Pater to keep
his thoughts in check, to turn them wholly upon the sacred
function, upon Gods blessing, worthily to be received.</p>

<p>The mellow tones of the czimbalom, the sighing accents of the
fiddles, fill the air; the half-audible mutterings of Pater
Ambrosius as he reads the Gospel, recites the Creed and Offertory
prayers, all seem like sounds in dreamland, far removed from
reality.</p>

<p>And still, as in a dream, through the thickening clouds of
incense, Andr&aacute;s watches the priest as he pronounces the
sacred words of the consecration. The tiny bell tingles and all
heads are reverently bent: from Ilonka&rsquo;s eyes a few tears are
slowly falling upon her prayer-book. Before him, there floats a
vision of the home at Kisfalu, rendered radiant with the presence
of his young wife, flitting fairy-like through the low-raftered
rooms, and . . . then . . . of the patter of feet, tinier even than
hers, skipping merrily about the house, and of fresh, shrill
voices, shouting &ldquo;father&rdquo; when he comes home. An
infinite peace is in his heart; forgotten are the torrents of
passion which had well-nigh overwhelmed him in these last weary
weeks; he only thinks of her as he does of the Madonna, serene,
pure, the fountain of happiness&mdash;she sitting on a throne
aloft, dispensing joys to the homestead: he worshipping, devoted,
at her feet.</p>

<p>But now Pater Ambrosius is descending the altar steps; my lord
has also left his seat, and is standing erect and very pale, close
to the communion rails, while one of the ministrants holds a small
plate in his hands on which two gold circlets glisten.</p>

<p>A sound, which is like a long sigh, seems to come from the
hundred throats in the church, a sigh of intense, eager expectancy.
Andr&aacute;s and Ilonka are standing before the priest, about to
finally become man and wife. Neither of them hears what the priest
says. Both feel as in a dream. Behind, all necks are craned to
catch a glimpse of the two figures, one so tall and broad, the
other so fragile; one or two less reverent feet are standing up on
the pews, while a nervous whisper and titter, a frou-frou of
starched skirts, a jingle of beads and bangles, breaks the solemn
silence of the church.</p>

<p>Binecz Mark&oacute; and his band are playing a dreamy song, a
quaint, half-sad melody; they whisper on their instruments; the
music sounds like one long sigh, hardly audible, as if coming from
some distant cloudland, and wafted in on the smoke of the
incense.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius has taken the tiny, cold, white hand, and the
other, strong, brown, and rough, and placed one within the other.
Andr&aacute;s hardly dares to breathe. Surely this cannot be
reality. Pater Ambrosius holds both the hands clasped together, but
through it all Andr&aacute;s feels a flutter, like the wings of a
tiny bird, just stolen from its nest. As her hand touches his, her
white face has become whiter still, and for one swift moment her
blue eyes have sought his own, with a terror-stricken, appealing
look, that makes Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s heart well-nigh break with
pity. Did she not understand, then, that he loved her&mdash;as
saints had loved their God&mdash;and that he would tend and cherish
her, and keep every sorrow from her path? Did they not tell her how
he had begged for leave to lie at her feet, to keep stormy weather
and arid sun from her ways, and then be content to see her smile?
Why did she then look so appealingly at him? It seemed almost as if
she were frightened! Frightened? Great and mighty Lord! when her
hand rested in his! and God Himself was entrusting her to his care,
to shield and to protect!</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius now places the golden circlets, one in the hand
of each. Then he whispers to Andr&aacute;s to slip the one he holds
on the finger of one of those white hands. The Pater says
something, which Andr&aacute;s repeats after him. There is a great
deal about loving and cherishing, sickness and death, evil and
good: Andr&aacute;s repeats it all, as in a dream; only vaguely
does he understand that he is taking an oath before God and before
men. What need has he of oaths, when his very heart-strings are
bound up in the fulfilment of his own happiness?</p>

<p>Then she begins to speak. She also repeats what Pater Ambrosius
says before her. Her voice&mdash;oh! it was the sweetest
music&mdash;sounds hardly above a whisper . . . hardly above the
dying murmur of the czimbalom as it faintly echoes through the
sacred edifice. She also swears, as with icy hands she holds the
ring on his finger, to love, to honour, and to obey.</p>

<p>Firmly, triumphantly, sounds the &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; spoken by
Andr&aacute;s in reply, when God through the mouth of his priest,
the law as represented by the Church, asks if he will have this
woman for wife. His answer is like the triumphant echo, the
expression of all his pent-up passion, of his longing, his deep,
his infinite love. Firmly she, too, answers &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;; her
voice does not tremble, but once again two great tears detach
themselves from her eyes, and fall, like glistening dew-drops, down
her cheek.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>A great sigh of satisfaction broke from the crowd of
worshippers. The irrevocable deed had been done. Kem&eacute;ny
Andr&aacute;s, the peasant lad whom, as a tiny boy, many a homely
mouth had kissed, who older in years had been buffeted and beaten
by a tyrannical father, had toiled on farm and field as any
labourer, who was one of themselves, like them, born and bred on
the good Hungarian lowlands, was now and for ever the rightful lord
and master of a noble high-born lady, the daughter of him who owned
the land, the descendant of those who had owned the very peasants
as their goods and chattels, to sell and barter at will, to
maltreat, or even to kill. How wonderful it was! Like some grand
dream, dreamt by all alike&mdash;the lights, the roses, the
beautiful new vestments; the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t standing
there, giving his daughter away to the peasant lad; the beautiful
lady, all in white, looking like a saint, stepped down from one of
the images; and amidst them all the powerful figure, the handsome
dark head, bronzed by years of hard toil on the land, beneath the
arid sun, the hard, rugged hands ever opened wide to pour
kindnesses, money, gifts, to all who needed it, and who never asked
in vain. It was a glorious day, a great event! so great and
glorious that not one eye remained dry, not one throat unchoked
with sobs; so great and glorious that the czig&aacute;ny poured
forth on the heavy, scented air their most sad, most appealing
melodies! So great and glorious that the chief actors therein, that
powerful man and that fragile girl, were both bowing with bursting
hearts and tearful eyes before the all-kind, merciful throne of
God!</p>

<p>The rest of the Mass was listened to in silence. Dreamy quiet
rested upon all. The simple words of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,
though spoken in Latin, were known and felt by the humblest, the
most unlettered in the flock. Andr&aacute;s had knelt down on the
faded cushion. He had buried his face in his hands; before his
closed eyes there was a haunting vision of that terrified look
which had implored him for pity. That vision seemed to rend his
heart-strings. He held his teeth firmly set together, lest
heart-breaking sobs should escape his throat. She was kneeling so
listlessly, so icily beside him now. Reverently each took the white
wafer, which Pater Ambrosius had placed in their mouth. In simple
faith the young peasant accepted the great mystery which the
Catholic Church commands her children to believe. He did not
understand, but did not question; scarcely a faint doubt crossed
his fevered mind. The faded flowers seemed to make him drowsy;
Binecz Mark&oacute;&rsquo;s plaintive music lulled him to dreamy
insensibility.</p>

<p>Then Pater Ambrosius raised his hands aloft:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>May the God of Abraham, the God of Israel, the God of
Jacob be with you; may He pour forth upon you the continual dew of
His blessings so that ye may see the children of your children even
unto the third and fourth generation, and that ye may be possessed
at the last with eternal life, through the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who liveth and reigneth with God the Father and the Holy
Ghost, world without end Amen!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he added, making the sign of the Cross towards the
assistants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Benedicat vos omnipotentes Deus Pater, et Filius, et
Spiritus Sanctus</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; died away; the last Gospel had been
read; Pater Ambrosius was wiping the sacred vessels.</p>

<p>Among the worshippers, the long, religiously kept silence was at
last threatening to break. Excited whispers were heard among the
young folk, as well as a general noise of closing the clasps of
prayer-books, short, nervous coughing, and an occasional titter.
Respectfully, all remained in their seats, but craned their necks
to catch sight of the bride and bridegroom, and of the noble
people. Eager questions were asked, excited comments made. Pater
Ambrosius came down to the communion rail; with fatherly freedom he
had taken the bride&rsquo;s pale young face between his wrinkled
hands, and looking straight into her innocent eyes was whispering
something to her: a last admonition, a quiet prayer. Then he turned
towards Andr&aacute;s and took his hand in both his own, and all
heard him say: &ldquo;God bless you, my son, you have well deserved
your happiness!&rdquo; After that, he put on his biretta, and was
gone.</p>

<p>The noble Countess had gathered up her shawl and prayer-book,
and had drawn near to Ilonka. Every one strained their necks to
watch the critical moment. In true time-honoured Hungarian
tradition Andr&aacute;s, with a hand which visibly trembled, lifted
the veil from his young bride&rsquo;s face, and, stooping down
towards her, his face as pale as death, he imprinted the first kiss
on the pure forehead of his newly-made wife.</p>

<p>She seemed whiter than the white roses in her hair. Her eyes
closed. She seemed ready to swoon. He had had the first kiss as
every bridegroom on the lowlands: and yet, how hungrily he watched
as her father and mother, each in turn, took her in their arms, and
the noble Countess wiped copious tears from her maternal eyes. It
seemed as if he could not allow any one to approach her now.</p>

<p>The comments flowed freely. Feminine hearts ached at the sad,
white look of the bride. But then, all brides are coy and
frightened on their wedding day: it is their great charm; and
Andr&aacute;s would soon bring a blush to those cheeks, and
brilliancy to those eyes.</p>

<p>How handsome they both looked as they walked down the nave; her
hand hardly touching his arm as he led her towards the door. Softly
murmured &ldquo;God bless you both!&rdquo; accompanied them to the
porch. Then, behind my lord and his lady, the crowd closed in to
see the departure.</p>

<p>For one moment Andr&aacute;s paused, as the brilliance of the
May-day sun half dazzled his eyes. Down the road, my lord&rsquo;s
carriage, with its Hungarian livery, in its scarlet leather
harness, its five milk-white horses that had brought the bride to
the church were eagerly, impatiently pawing the ground. The crowd,
like the overflowing waters of the Tarna, had pressed its way out
of the church, now much too small to contain all the people. All
rushed eagerly forward, looking round for the rich peasant&rsquo;s
carriage, which was sure to be gorgeous beyond description, since
it would convey the noble bride to her new farmhouse home, with
glittering harness, and with its shiny brass bosses and silver
hasps, that would shame that of the lord of Bidesk&uacute;t;
moreover, no stables could rival the horses from Kisfalu. The
Countess, too, was looking inquiringly down the road, and anxiously
at Andr&aacute;s, for no carriage but hers was in sight. What was
Andr&aacute;s waiting for with his young wife on his arm?</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a loud start, a quick pawing of the air and
the road, a whirl and a shout, and before the village folk&rsquo;s
delighted gaze, and the noble Countess&rsquo;s cry of horror,
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, with one quick gesture, had picked his
young bride up in his arms, had jumped on Csillag&rsquo;s back,
and, before the spectators had time to realise what had happened,
or the Countess to recover from the shock, the mare, with her
double burden, was far away, throwing up a cloud of loose earth
with her hoofs, galloping away towards the plain, her mane flying
in the wind.</p>

<p>A gigantic cry of &ldquo;Long live!&rdquo; that shook the very
foundations of the tiny village church, sent its echoes after the
fast-disappearing horse and rider; such a cry as relieved the
tension of the intense excitement of the last two hours, and was
the fitting, barbaric, primitive, intensely human comment on this
novel home-going of a Hungarian bride.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25" id=

Fata Morgana</b>
</h2>

<p>Oh! the delights of that wild ride across the roads, amid the
fields of the beautiful Hungarian lowlands, with Csillag feeling,
as it were, the same magnetic current which filled her
master&rsquo;s veins, and flying along, swift and sure, like the
very clouds driven by the wind.</p>

<p>Oh! how he had looked forward to this ride, with her frightened
arms clinging perforce to him, for she would have to hold on tight
when Csillag flew like the wind.</p>

<p>How pale she looked! Her eyes were closed: perhaps she had
fainted away. He had been forced to be brusque and rough, to mount
Csillag and fly away with her, and give no one time to stop him,
and this, no doubt, had frightened her.</p>

<p>On Csillag flew, the village was far behind! the shouts of
&ldquo;&Eacute;ljen!&rdquo; had died away; the plain, in all its
immensity, in all its loneliness, lay before him, and Csillag who,
like her master, loved its untrammelled freedom, loved the vast
expanse of earth and sky, bounded onwards, as if God&rsquo;s angels
had lent her their wings.</p>

<p>On! On! She lay so still and so pale in his arms; scarcely a
breath escaped the partially closed mouth; her long white veil lay
round her like a shroud, and her tiny head rested upon his breast.
Of such a moment he had dreamt long nights through, upon the plain,
had half broken his heart with mad desire longing for this. And now
he gazed upon her for the first time all alone. No eyes to watch
his emotion; her loveliness lying passive in his arms. Oh! the joy
of seeing her thus, senseless, helpless, against his breast; fondly
his eyes dwelt on every soft curl which escaped from beneath the
veil, on the closed transparent lids, where tiny purple veins spoke
of sorrow and of tears, on the small white nose, with its dainty
tip and delicate nostrils, and, above all, on that scarlet mouth,
with lips half parted, through which Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s ardent
gaze sought the tiny white teeth and the tip of her rosy
tongue.</p>

<p>Oh! it was joy unspeakable, joy beyond compare&mdash; save to
most exquisite torture&mdash;to drink in every line of that fragile
beauty, of which he was now the owner, and which, for very love,
for great desire, he would not, dare not touch.</p>

<p>On, Csillag! On!</p>

<p>She had not stirred; her very breath seemed to have stopped. She
lay as dead in his arms. All around, earth and sky were still. The
noonday sun poured down its radiance on the vast immensity of the
plains. The heat made the air tremble with its waves. All signs of
human life were far, very far away. The tiny wayside inn lay
behind, the cry of the herdsmen was heard no more; only overhead
the storks were calling to one another, and down from beneath the
great leaves of the melons, bright-coloured lizards darted to and
fro, frightened by Csillag&rsquo;s mad gallop. A fragrance of
opening blossoms, of ripening fruit, was in the air. To the right a
herd of wild horses cantered swiftly past. Andr&aacute;s looked up
for a moment, gazed round at the solitary, silent plain which he
loved so well, and his eyes rested with delight on the blue sky,
the ruddy soil, the distant outline of the long-armed well, against
the purple mist beyond.</p>

<p>And lo! as he gazed on the hot, dry, trembling air, far away,
upon the infinite golden distance, with rapid touches, the fitful
fairy Fata Morgana drew her elusive pictures. To
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s excited brain, it seemed like the gold and
white city of paradise glistening in the radiance of the sun; with
cool, rippling streams, marble towers, and green pastures, glorious
and solitary, calling to him to enter, with that snow-white burden
in his arms there, to lay him down, and her, beside the cool
streams, his burning head resting against that soft green
grass.</p>

<p>Long and earnestly he gazed, while it seemed to him as if
Csillag flew thither with outstretched angels&rsquo; wings. Nearer
and nearer the enchanting picture drew, half-veiled in a thin mist,
which was made of tears.</p>

<p>Then he bent his head down, and his ardent lips sought the tiny
half-opened mouth: and the soul of the young, rough, half-barbaric
peasant passed from him to her inanimate form, in one long, burning
kiss.</p>

<p>Far out, on the horizon, the fitful fairy had swiftly erased the
golden image of that paradise city; overhead the storks had ceased
their cry; the little lizards had gone to rest.</p>

<p>Peaceful, immense, solitary, the <i>puszta</i> lay&mdash;and
Csillag galloped on.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26" id=

The Peasant&rsquo;s Wife</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;There! there! there! let her be, my boy. She will be all
right with me. You leave her here. The sheets are warm and soft,
and scented with lavender. You go down to the cellar and get me a
measure of that vinegar I put into casks last November. Put it
outside the door, and bring me from the attic some cloves, and
thyme, and perhaps a little burrage. Now go! I tell you she is only
faint, with that madcap ride of yours. You should have done as
other folks do, and brought her home in a cart, with steady oxen to
pull her along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was long after mid-day when Andr&aacute;s came home on
Csillag&rsquo;s back, carrying a white burden in his arms. Etelka
had been waiting to welcome the bride home, and had cooked such a
meal as was fit to place before the king himself, for she wanted
S&aacute;ri and Kati to have the treat of putting on their best
clothes and seeing their master being wed to the noble young lady.
She could not help feeling anxious, for she knew of her son&rsquo;s
intention of bringing his bride home in his arms, flying on
Csillag&rsquo;s back, and feared lest the noble young lady,
unaccustomed to such summary proceedings, should become faint and
ill. She had made the tiny farmhouse look like a perfect garden of
loveliness. Her roses, fortunately, were in full bloom, and she had
been able to place great bunches of them in every room, more
especially in the one which, newly papered and ornamented with
daintily embroidered curtains, had been destined for the young
wife.</p>

<p>Ah! there, at last, the distant and well-known sound of
Csillag&rsquo;s hoofs on the soft earth outside. Excitedly Etelka
hurried out to the porch, ready to welcome her new daughter home
with a loving kiss. One look in her son&rsquo;s face told her that
something was amiss. Gently, with the pretty trick her master had
taught her, Csillag had dropped on her knees, and Andr&aacute;s,
looking almost as white as the burden he was carrying, dismounted
and went within.</p>

<p>He laid her down on the bed, Etelka helping him to pillow the
golden head softly on the cushions. She looked so white and
inanimate. No wonder Andr&aacute;s was frightened. But Etelka
understood that excitement alone had caused a dead faint, and soon
reassured her son. She tried to remain cheerful, while she was in
the room, but when he had gone, she shook her head sadly. Never had
she seen any one so pale and wan looking, and this strange
home-coming foreboded nothing good to her mind.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had brought the vinegar, and Etelka, having placed
it on the stove to warm, and throwing some aromatic herbs into it,
began bathing Ilonkas temples with it. She took off the poor
child&rsquo;s shoes and stockings, and rubbed her cold feet between
her own rough hands. At last a faint tremulous sigh escaped the
purple lips. The golden head moved restlessly on the pillow, and
soon a pair of frightened blue eyes looked up at the wrinkled, kind
face above them.</p>

<p>Terrified, puzzled, they roamed round, trying&mdash;just home
from the land of dreams,&mdash;to take in the immediate reality:
the quaint, tiny room, with its low-raftered ceiling, from which
hung bunches of dry sweet-scented herbs. The great stove of glazed
earthenware, brilliant and green, with the hot vessel of aromatic
vinegar steaming upon it. The posies of white roses in great rough
pots, and the quaint figure of the kind old woman with the large
dark eyes, which reminded Ilonka of something she had hoped for
ever to forget.</p>

<p>But the face looked good and sympathetic, and Ilonka just now
had sore need of comfort. Her heart felt numb and bruised, and the
old, dark eyes had two great tears in them that spoke of love and
pity. All had been so strange, so bewildering. Ilonka had lived in
such an atmosphere of stern duty and proud bearing for the last few
weeks that the simple peasant clothes, the kind, wrinkled face, the
rough brown hands, the sympathetic tears went straight to that
bruised young heart, and she put out both her arms in an appeal for
comfort and for love.</p>

<p>The old peasant woman&rsquo;s heart, which had already gone out
to the fragile, girlish figure on the bed, quite melted at this
sweet appeal. Her arms closed round the delicate young girl, the
golden head rested on the old motherly breast, and on it there fell
such a shower of kisses and such words of love and sympathy as
Ilonka had never heard from her own mother&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my sweet one, you feel better, do you not? Lie still
for a while, and rest; you are tired and excited. See, I will draw
the curtains across these windows, and shut out the sun, which will
be setting presently, and you will perhaps get a good long sleep. I
will be at my spinning in the room next to this. If you want
anything, you must just tap the wall with your hand. I shall hear.
I have aired all your beautiful linen, and hung your dresses up in
that wardrobe, so when you are rested you can slip off your white
frock, and put on some of your nice new things which my lady your
mother sent down with the cart yesterday. There! is that pillow
just right, under your head? . . . Good-night, my sweet one. . . .
Sleep well! . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave Ilonka a last kiss, drew the curtains across the
windows so that the rays of the sun only came in softened and
subdued; then she slipped quietly out of the room.</p>

<p>Ilonka was alone. At first she was only conscious of an
exquisite sense of bodily well-being. The sheets were so fine, and
smelt so sweetly of lavender and rosemary, the air was deliciously
fragrant with the scent of roses and lilies of the valley. She
closed her eyes; her body lay rigid in an exquisite feeling of
rest. How tired she was of all the turmoil and excitement of the
past few days, of the maids bustling round, sorting the new linen
and the various dresses, of the white gown which had to be tried on
several times, and which always gave her a pain in her heart
whenever she felt its clinging folds round her. But above all, she
was infinitely weary of all the talk about wealth and lands, duties
and posterity. Her cheeks had been in one perpetual flame, hearing
herself spoken of but as the mother of unborn children, who were to
be rich and own all the land and all the money.</p>

<p>She had fought for liberty in an earnest, gentle way, had tried
to appeal to her parents&rsquo; love for her, their pride in her,
their contempt for the husband they had chosen for her. She cared
nothing for great riches, or for broad leagues of land; she was
happy at Bidesk&uacute;t, and would soon get over the shame of
being an old maid. She could not understand why her father always
looked so sad when her future was talked about. If he did not like
his daughter&rsquo;s marriage with the rich peasant, why did he
allow it? Surely he had lands, fields, money enough of his own.
What did he want with a peasant&rsquo;s wealth, be it ever so
great? Ilonka could not understand. Her mother, who was so proud,
seemed to look on the <i>m&eacute;salliance</i> with content, while
scorning the idea of a penniless husband, even if he had a long
line of ancestry. The child had soon told her long-cherished
secret, had candidly admitted the thrills of delight which one
voice among all others had called forth in her young heart. She was
an only child, had been much loved and petted. It seemed terrible
she should have to live in a peasant&rsquo;s cottage, learn to spin
and dig in the garden, become no better than one of the maids, and
cut off from all her friends.</p>

<p>Then one day they told her that <i>he</i> did not care; that he,
being poor, was about to wed a rich manufacturer&rsquo;s daughter,
who was willing to exchange her bags of gold for a Countess&rsquo;s
coronet. After that Ilonka was passive. She did not mind what they
decided for her. Since <i>he</i> had lied to her, had talked of
love, which he said would last till death, and had ended in a year,
if <i>he</i> was false and dishonourable, she did not care what
happened to her. If she could not be happy, she might as well do
what her mother and father wished, and give her hand to the
peasant, who was not more sordid than <i>he</i>, in wishing to have
a noble lady as his wife.</p>

<p>Ilonka, with closed eyes, lying there passively on the
rosemary-scented bed, recalled her first meeting with the tall,
picturesque man: with him who had been described to her as the rich
and vulgar peasant in search of noble blood, to which to ally his
own common nature. She recalled his strange personality, his deep,
musical voice, his eyes which rested so strangely upon her, the
kiss which he always imprinted on her hand, and which used to bring
a hot flush to her cheek, and a feeling that was half faint, half
horrible.</p>

<p>She tried to recall every moment of that solemn hour in church,
the vows she spoke, the prayers she repeated, kneeling beside that
strange man, whom, in spite of his origin, she could not despise,
for he was so tall, and so quiet in his ways, and had such a
curious masterful look in his eyes.</p>

<p>A shudder went through her now as it did then, when she felt the
gold circlet of metal being slipped on her finger, the badge of her
slavery to this man, who, her mother said, was infinitely beneath
her.</p>

<p>And she had sworn to honour, to love, and to obey. Oh! she would
do the latter to the utmost of her capacity, do his every bidding,
work as any serf had worked in days gone by, when bitter blows were
all the wage for a heavy day&rsquo;s toil; and she would bear his
arrogance, his masterfulness, be a willing and cheerful slave to
him. Fulfil this oath&mdash;then perhaps God would remit the other,
for she had sworn that which she could not fulfil: she had sworn
that she would love. Then a last picture floated before her mind, a
picture the reality of which in itself seemed as a dream: a picture
of many faces floating round her, and in front the tiny village,
with its thatched cottages, under the glare of a glorious May-day
sun: the air hot and heavy with the fragrance of early opening
blossoms, and filled with sounds of bees and birds, neighing of
colts, and bleating of lambs. Then, suddenly, she had felt herself
lifted off her feet, and flying through the air as if on cloud
wings. She dimly remembered a long shout, which died away in the
distance as she flew, then something strong and tight seemed to
hold her faster, closer; the acacia trees, the cottages, the throng
of moving faces, appeared a thing of the infinite past, and she
remembered no more.</p>

<p>Oh, why had consciousness come back to her! Why had she ever
wakened? She had been in infinite peace; why had not that peace
lasted on and on, till the cloud wings had carried her to those
regions where rest is eternal?</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27" id=
"Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
The Irreparable</b>
</h2>

<p>The sun was sinking low down in the west, and its golden rays
stole in by the little windows of the living room and adorned each
object in it with a narrow edge of gold, like a halo.</p>

<p>Etelka had laid aside her spinning. The mid-day meal had been
left untasted, and she had thought out some dainty dishes to
prepare for supper, with her own hands, since S&aacute;ri and Kati
were too full of the wedding and all they had seen to be trusted
with the cooking of the first meal the young wife would take in her
new home.</p>

<p>She had seemingly not yet stirred. Etelka had peeped into the
room, and seen her lying peacefully, with a faint colour in her
cheeks, regular breathing coming through her half-opened mouth.
Reassured, she had left Andr&aacute;s to watch in the parlour, and
had hurried to her kitchen.</p>

<p>Dreamily he sat beside the open window gazing out across the
plain towards the setting sun. . . . Thus his mind had always
pictured this day of all days: The house still and solitary. He
alone with her; she with him. They two together, for ever
henceforth, as one; loving and loved; sharing sorrows and joys; all
in all to each other. He remembered his lonely childhood, his early
years, when, tired with hard, slavish toil, his young shoulders
bruised and aching from unjust and heavy blows from his
father&rsquo;s stick, he used to wander out on the lonely plain,
lonelier even than he, and alone betwixt earth and sky, alone with
the moon and stars, he had asked beautiful, loving Nature to tell
him some of her secrets: to teach him why the stork called always
for its mate, why the swallow toiled to build a nest, why even the
little lizards had their homes beneath the great leaves of the
melons, and why he, in spite of all the great love he bore his
mother, felt lonely and homeless. Now he knew. He understood
Nature&rsquo;s great all-pervading lesson, of a dual existence
which is as one, a lesson which neither father nor mother could
teach him, but which he had learnt when first he saw the fairy
vision that had become his dream, and first heard the voice which
had been angel&rsquo;s music in his ear. Like the stork, he, too,
called for his mate; like the swallow, he longed for a home wherein
to love her, to cherish her, of which she would be queen.</p>

<p>A faint noise behind him made him turn his head. It was she, all
in white, dimly outlined in the gathering gloom. She had laid aside
her veil, but was still in her wedding dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently she had not expected to find him here, for she
started, stopped short, and her hand sought the support of the
table near her as if she were afraid to fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo; he said again, and came close to where she
stood.</p>

<p>She drew back a step or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought . . . I . . . I did not know you were
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother was here till just now,&rdquo; he said very
gently; &ldquo;seeing that you were fast asleep, she has gone to
the kitchen and left me here to watch if you stirred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to take her hand and to draw her to him, but she
snatched it away and said hurriedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the kitchen? I will go and find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kitchen is in an outhouse, sweet, over there in the
garden. The house is solitary and still, and we are alone, you and
I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he tried to take her hand, but she evaded him, and turned
nervously to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can find my way; she will want me, I know. She . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But swiftly Andr&aacute;s had placed himself in her way, and
with a sudden, passionate movement, his arms closed round her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not need your help, sweet,&rdquo; he whispered
earnestly, &ldquo;and you cannot go . . . see! you are a prisoner
in my arms. . . . Oh! do not struggle . . . for I hold you tight.
How pale you look and how scared! . . . Are you frightened? . . .
Not now, surely, when you are in my arms! . . . I can protect you,
sweet, from every sorrow and every ill. . . . Bend down and let
your tiny ear touch my mouth . . . for I want to whisper something
into it . . . something, Ilonka, which has so filled my heart for
many weary months that it has well-nigh broken it, for striving to
be told. . . . Ilonka . . . my own . . . my sweet wife . . . I love
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice sounded hoarse and strange. His arms held her as in a
vice. He was drawing her closer, faster to him, till his face was
near to her own. Ilonka fought to free herself. She was surprised
and terrified. She did not understand. Never had she heard a voice
so strange, nor met a look which frightened her so. Her mother
should have warned, told her she would have to listen, would have
to allow this odious peasant to put his arms round her, as he no
doubt did to the village girls at the inn. She felt humiliated,
horrified, her sharp nails were dug into his hands in a frantic
effort to force him to let her go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forbid you . . . I forbid you! . .&rdquo; was all that
she could gasp, for her throat was choked with terror. But he
seemed not to heed. He repeated, in a curious way, &ldquo;Ilonka .
. . I love you! . . .&rdquo; as if the words almost choked him. And
those words, in his mouth, sent a thrill of revolt through her;
they were the selfsame words which, in those happy times, a gentle
voice had murmured with respectful tenderness in her ear, and had
caused her then such divine happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forbid you!&rdquo; she repeated mechanically.</p>

<p>His grasp relaxed slightly, and she could see that he
smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forbid me, sweet! what will you forbid? Do you then not
wish to hear me tell you of the great love I bear you? . . .
Remember, that for all these weeks I hardly dared approach you.
Some one was always there, who seemed to chase away all words of
love from my mouth. . . . For weeks now, I have hardly dared to
look at you. It would be cruel to forbid me to speak . . . now . .
. that, at last, we are alone . . . now . . . that you are . . . my
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a swift and sudden movement, she had succeeded in freeing
herself from his grasp. Erect and defiant, she stood before him,
all the arrogance, the pride of the aristocrat in revolt against
the daring of this presumptuous peasant. He looked so tall and so
powerful in all his bearing; in his look there was such an air of
indomitable will, of almost tyrannical masterfulness, that Ilonka
unconsciously remembered the oath she swore, to honour and to obey;
and also the silent compact with her heart, to give full obedience,
since she could give no love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes, I know,&rdquo; she said slowly, with a certain
defiant humility. &ldquo;I understand, and will try not to forget.
I am your wife; and this morning, at the altar, I swore an oath
that I would obey you. My mother and father commanded and I did as
they desired. I swore that I would obey, and I will keep that oath,
never fear! I will be a dutiful wife. I will work for you as no
peasant woman could ever work. I will spin, and I will dig; walk to
church with you, and distribute to the labourers their measures of
wine and corn. You must teach me my duties; command me, and I will
obey. . . . You need have no fear. . . . I know . . . I am your
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s was gazing at her, half bewildered. He did not
quite understand what she said. She looked very beautiful, save for
the strange look in her eyes. He could not read what that look
meant. It certainly had nothing of terror in it; and her voice,
too, was dear and distinct, and each word she said seemed to strike
at his heart, making it throb with pain. The shades of evening were
closing in. He could not see her very distinctly. Her slim form
looked quite ghost-like in the gathering gloom.</p>

<p>She had paused a moment, while he murmured &ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;
as if in a tender appeal. He would have spoken and tried to draw
near to her again, but with an imperious gesture she put up her
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not speak,&rdquo; she said haughtily. &ldquo;Just now
I could not stop you. You held me tightly. I tried to protest. But
you had your say. It is my turn now. You said there were many
things you wished to tell me. Things which, when you said them,
made my cheeks burn with shame. I did not know&mdash;I am an
ignorant girl&mdash;and my mother did not tell me&mdash;that it was
part of this hideous bargain that you should speak to me of love,
and that I should have to listen to words which, in your mouth,
must be a sacrilege!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One great and mighty cry, heart-rending in its intensity. The
cry of the wounded beast, struck unto death, and sending forth in
the air its last piteous appeal.</p>

<p>Was she in her senses? Did she know what she was saying? Was it
consciously that she had struck this terrible blow, so deadly that,
for a moment, he almost staggered beneath it? He looked at the
outline of her young figure, dimly discernible in the darkness. So
slender, white, and fragile did it look, that, in the midst of his
great pain, an infinite pity for her seized him. No! No! she could
not understand. She was ill and excited. Her brain was in a fever.
Terror, in the midst of the strange surroundings, the lonely
farmhouse, the small low room, had blinded her. He had been
hot-headed and impetuous. Poor, tender little thing, what could she
know of a man&rsquo;s passion? how could she understand the
overmastering intensity of a rough peasant&rsquo;s love? He was
rough! All Pater Ambrosius&rsquo; education had not quite
eradicated the hot, impatient temperament of the son of the soil;
and she, refined, aristocratic, hitherto surrounded by the calm
devotion of her parents, the deference of her servants, the
respectful courtship of high-born suitors, had been frightened by
it all. No wonder she shrank from his sudden, brutal, clumsy
ways.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka,&rdquo; he began very gently, forcing his voice
not to tremble, so as to reassure her, &ldquo;many things have
frightened you to-day. . . . You are still weak and ill, and I do
not think that you are able to realise the cruelty of your last
words to me. . . . Let me take you to your room now. . . . My
mother said that you would require a great deal of rest . . . and
perhaps I was rough and clumsy with you . . . just now. . . . I am
but a peasant, as you know . . . but I can be gentle. . . . And,
oh! I would sooner cut off my right hand than offend or frighten
you in anyway. . . . Will you forgive me? See . . . it is this
great love that overwhelms me . . . that almost obscures my brain .
. . and, perhaps . . . I lose control of my arms, when they close
round you . . . and of my voice, when I speak to you. . . . I am
quite calm now, my sweet; will you let me take your
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Necessary, Ilonka? do you not wish to place your hand in
mine? Will you not try to give me one gentle word? . . . I do not
ask for very much . . . I will wait . . . oh! with infinite
patience, for a word of love from you. . . . You are exquisitely
beautiful. My love for you sprung in my heart the day on which I
first beheld your loveliness. I am a common peasant . . . it will
take time, I know, to win your love for me. . . . But I will win
it, with such infinite gentleness that your heart will open to the
poor peasant who so humbly worships you. But until then, my sweet,
I will not complain. . . . I will be content if you will place your
tiny hand in mine . . . just for one moment, of your own accord . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not do this, Ilonka? Have I then offended you so
deeply that you have devised this terrible punishment for me? If
so, believe me, dear, the punishment has been enough; for the fault
I committed was in the intensity of my love, and that love you have
wounded so deeply that it now lies bruised and sore at your feet. .
. . You will not stretch out your hand towards me? . . . You will
not say that you forgive . . . even if I . . . pray for that
forgiveness on my knees . . .?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had knelt down at her feet; and in the darkness his burning
lips had sought and found the small, ice-cold hand. She snatched it
away as if she had been stung, with a sudden cry of horror and
loathing.</p>

<p>In a moment Andr&aacute;s was on his feet again. That sudden
gesture, that cry of horror, were not the outcome of girlish
coyness, or childish fear. There was something more, hidden within
the heart of the woman before him, something that was not calm and
icy as her words, and as her look; and in the gloom he tried to see
more of her face than its bare outline. But it was too dark; her
head was entirely in shadow, and he could not read what was passing
within. With sudden, fierce masterfulness, he seized both her
wrists. &ldquo;You do not hate me, Ilonka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was dead silence in the room. The moon had just crept
round over the lonely farmhouse, and her slanting rays found their
way through the low casement windows. Outside, the leaves of the
poplar trees trembled in the evening breeze, giving forth a
melancholy sound like a long-drawn-out sigh. She was silent: and
suddenly he remembered how it was thus that he had always pictured
the evening of this glorious day&mdash;the house solitary and
still; his mother gone to her room, leaving him alone with her. He
remembered how he had pictured her: coy, frightened at first, then
listening to his love, her blue eyes getting gradually moist with
pity and responsive passion, her lips parting in a happy smile. Oh,
the bitter irony of it all! the cruelty of this awakening from the
long, beautiful dream!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, will you answer me?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>She did not try to free her wrists, but drew herself to her full
height, and stepped quite close to him, letting each word sound
distinctly in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hate you, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s?&rdquo; she began
slowly and earnestly; &ldquo;hatred is a big word, as great a one
as love; I am a very young girl, and have seen nothing of the world
beyond the walls of my father&rsquo;s castle of Bidesk&uacute;t,
and therefore perhaps I know nothing of either. But this I do know:
that in order to hate, one must be able to love. And I could never
love you. You, with your great wealth, your fields, your lands, and
your gold, had little else in the world to desire. But in your
ambitious heart there remained one arrogant thought: you were not
content to see one of your own kind, low-born and sordid as
yourself, sharing with you that wealth which all peasants hold so
dear. Since your money could not place you above your station, you
longed at least that at the head of your table there should be
seated one whom your labourers would call &lsquo;my lady,&rsquo;
and that in one castle, at least, in the lowlands, you should be
welcomed almost as an equal. With what machinations, what
treachery, what usury, you ensnared my weak father, I shall
probably never know. I do not care to ask. I may be young, but I am
not blind, and one thing was clear to me from the very first day on
which you entered my father&rsquo;s house, as some triumphant
conqueror, and stooped to kiss my hand &mdash;it was clear to me
from the moment when you, the grandson of a serf, first sat at my
mother&rsquo;s table&mdash;and that is, that you have bought me
with your gold, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s. You paid so many
bank-notes, such measures of wheat or wine in order to call me your
wife, to brag of me before your companions at the inn, to boast of
me to the village girls, with whom you used to flirt and dance, to
see me keep your house in order, to give me your commands, to beat
me, as the peasants do their wives. I&mdash;a noble girl&mdash;your
wife! Well, you have bought me! you have paid for me, as you do for
your cattle and your sheep upon the <i>puszta</i>. The bargain is
concluded. The daughter of those who once held your kindred in
bondage is your slave. Be content, Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s!
Command her to obey, if you will, but do not ask her if she hate
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gradually she had spoken more and more quickly; each word, every
insult which she uttered, seemed to strike him in the face, as once
her father&rsquo;s blow had done, which still remained unavenged.
She was quite calm and self-possessed now, and, though her voice
was hardly above a whisper, it was clear and without a tremor.</p>

<p>He had allowed her to speak without making the slightest effort
to stop her. Perhaps he had not the strength to do so. His blood
coursed through his veins like fire, his temples throbbed as if
they would break; and yet he listened, as if longing to endure this
torture to the full, as if he longed to know what an infinity of
hatred there lurked in that young girl&rsquo;s heart, and what
amount of pain his own bruised heart could bear.</p>

<p>What a fool he had been to think of her as a child, coy and
frightened with the newness of the life before her! What a fool to
offer her silent adoration, pity, or patience. He could not see
her, but he could feel her, quivering with all the pent-up passions
of womanhood, with bitter hatred, and with deadly revenge. He could
feel the frail arms writhing in his clutch, and, on his cheek, her
breath warm and panting, hissing out words of insult and of
contempt called from the bitterness of an injured
woman&rsquo;s&mdash;not a girls&mdash;heart. Oh! if there was so
much hatred, so much passion within her, she still was a woman
exquisitely beautiful, and adorable beyond all other women; if her
passions were strong, he would conquer them; if she hated him now,
he would turn that hatred into love. Since she had, with cold and
callous words, with insult and defiance, bruised and trampled on
that great love he bore her, if she would not bend to his deep
affection, accept and cherish his reverence, he would break her to
his will, and there would be pleasure still&mdash; pleasure born of
hell, perhaps, but as great as the tortures he endured&mdash;to
make her suffer as he had suffered.</p>

<p>Forgotten were Pater Ambrosius&rsquo; teachings, his striving
after higher things, the lessons of love and compassion, the
refinement born of a great heart and the accomplishment of noble
deeds. She had said it truly: he was a peasant, born of serfs;
years of education had kept his passions in check, but they were
all there, subject to the influence of this one woman, whom he had
worshipped with all the strength of his self-contained nature. She
had insulted him, derided him, returning loathing for his love;
that love lay maimed and bruised by her hatred and his desire.</p>

<p>He would have beaten her as the herdsmen out on the plains beat
their wives, if they disobey, or make them jealous, for very love,
because that love is uncontrolled. He could see the outline of her
white shoulders in the moonlight, and all that once had been low in
the peasant&rsquo;s nature, which the kind Pater&rsquo;s teachings,
his own kindly heart, had held in check, rose again, masterful,
passionate, to the fore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka,&rdquo; he said, while swiftly his trembling arms
once more closed round her, &ldquo;God knows I have worshipped you
as only good Catholics worship their Lord, that I have honoured
every piece of land, every blade of grass, which your foot has ever
trodden. This you do not choose to believe. In exchange for all
that love, which I was ready to pour forth humbly at your feet, you
have given me cruelty beyond compare, insults more terrible than
blows. You have, with your own hands, dispelled the fairy vision I
had of a sweet and lovely girl, frail and tender, who would nestle
in my arms, and allow me to keep all sorrows and ills from her
path, in exchange for one sweet smile of love. The fairy vision has
flitted away, but instead of this you have shown me the living
reality: an exquisitely beautiful woman, full of passions, of
deadly hatred, which speaks of some love which, if born, will be
well worth the conquering. That reality I cannot worship; it is too
far removed from the pictures of the Saints or of the Virgin, but
perhaps it comes nearer to my own self, my own nature, low, sordid,
vulgar&mdash;a peasant, you know, the grandson of a serf. That
reality, my beautiful wife, is my own; your obedience I can compel;
you are in my arms, and, though my love is changed, it is as great,
as ardent as before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as he lost his self-control, so she gradually regained
hers. She did not struggle. She stood up, listless and passive in
his arms, only turning her head away, so that she might not see
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My obedience is yours. I have said it. You need have no
fear. It will be as absolute as is my contempt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as your love, when I have conquered it,&rdquo; he
said proudly.</p>

<p>If she was afraid, she did not show it. She paused a moment
before she wielded her last, her deadliest weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;that,
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, even if you were different from what
you are, could never become yours, for I have given it to
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it a sob? Was it a cry? So heart-rending a sound was it that
the very wing seemed to pause as if to listen, in pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;may God have
mercy on your soul, for you have gone too far.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His torture had turned to madness; before his eyes the gloom had
suddenly changed to a dark red mist, which was like blood. The
wounded beast was at last at bay. With savage fury he threw the
white figure down on the floor at his feet, while his hand found
the heavy clasp-knife from his belt; and in the moonlight there
glittered, cold and blue, the polished steel, which he held high
over his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s! in the name of the Virgin Mary! what dost
thou with that knife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flood of light came streaming in through the door. Etelka had
heard the fearful cry, even in the kitchen, and she stood there,
with a lamp in her hand, with blanched face, gazing at the terrible
scene before her.</p>

<p>For one moment&mdash;an eternity&mdash;there was silence. Then
Andr&aacute;s slowly dropped his arm: the knife fell with a dull,
metallic sound on the floor. He stood, with head bent, looking down
at the figure at his feet. With superhuman effort he was
endeavouring to collect his scattered senses. She had not stirred,
but half lay, half knelt before him, her head erect, and her eyes,
cold and blue as the metal, meeting his own in a defiant gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s at last very slowly,
his voice shaken and hoarse, &ldquo;for the last hour my reason has
been flying from me, bit by bit: the last shred flew away just now.
The darkness, the moonlight&mdash;I know not&mdash;helped to
scatter it away. But my mother&rsquo;s voice has suddenly brought
it back, and I stand here shamed before you&mdash;worse still,
shamed before myself. Put down the lamp, mother dear,&rdquo; he
said, turning to Etelka, &ldquo;and help this lady to a chair. She
is ill and I have frightened her. But when she is alone with you
she will recover. I, myself, have much business to see to in Zarda,
and Csillag is ready to carry me there to-night. I do not know when
I shall return, but in the meanwhile this lady will stay with you
as your guest, until she wishes to return to her home. I know you
have prepared a good supper, and I hope you will eat it in peace,
for you know Csillag is sure-footed, and I shall be in Z&aacute;rda
before the night birds begin to croak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up his heavy mantle which was lying on the floor, and
fastened it round his shoulders. Ilonka had sunk into a chair, and
her eyes followed the tall, picturesque figure of her husband, as
with absolute calm he stood a moment to give his mother several
directions as to the work to-morrow in the fields. Then he came
close to where she sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before my mother, I would like to say to you, Ilonka,
that whenever you wish it you are free to return to your parents,
who have so well taught you the lessons of truth, of honour, and
obedience. And, as from my childhood she has known all my thoughts,
heard my every prayer, it is my desire that she should hear this my
oath. As I swore this morning before the altar, so do I swear now,
by a most solemn oath, both as a Christian, upon the crucifix, and
as a man, upon that which I hold dearer, more sacred than all, my
love for a girlish vision, young and pure as the angels, vanished
from me for ever. Upon the memory of that dead love I swear to you,
that never while you live will I offend your ears by speaking to
you of that love; never will I, by word or deed, remind you that
the low-born son of serfs is your lord and husband. You may command
the shelter of my roof or seek again that of your parents, as you
will. You are as free as you were before the presumptuous peasant
dared to ask that you should place your hand in his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the last echo of his quivering voice had died away,
before Ilonka had found the strength to look up at the tall figure,
so noble, so dignified in its pathos, he had gone, and the hoofs of
Csillag were heard galloping away towards the <i>puszta</i>.</p>

<p>Then Ilonka buried her head in her hands, and sobbed as if her
heart would break.</p>

Love Lies Bleeding</b>
</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Let me lead D&aacute;ndar part of the way for you, Pater,
and perhaps you will not mind walking as far as the crossroad with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind? I shall enjoy it, my son. I have never seen a
brighter morning. And . . . but for D&aacute;ndar, you know . . . I
should have had to walk all the way to
&Aacute;xoksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was very foolish of you, Pater, not to have told me
three months ago that K&oacute;p&eacute; was dead. You could have
had D&aacute;ndar at once, and then perhaps you would not have been
all this while without coming to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s had slipped the horse&rsquo;s bridle over his arm,
and the two men, leaving the little thatched cottage behind, began
to walk down the main-road.</p>

<p>It was one of those bright, cold, frosty mornings in December,
when a brilliant sun shines down merrily on the crisp sheet of snow
which lies evenly over the vast plain. Hardly an eminence or a
stump to break the monotony of this shroud, that glistens in the
wintry sun like myriads of tiny diamonds. The village of
Z&aacute;rda (hardly a village, since it had no church), with its
few straggling cottages which looked as if thatched with snow,
seemed lonely and desolate. There is nothing to be done in the
fields, and the Hungarian peasant in the winter likes to wrap
himself up in his mantle and stare dreamily into the fire of his
great oven, smoking pipe after pipe, in silence and drowsiness.
Andr&aacute;s and the Pater were soon in the open road. The old
priest&rsquo;s nose was quite red with the nipping frost, though he
was wrapped up to the ears in a huge great-coat of black sheepskin,
from beneath which emerged his thin legs encased in great leather
top-boots to protect them from the snow. Andr&aacute;s walked on
silently by his side for a while. He seemed not to feel the intense
cold, for his great mantle hung down his back, and his arms came
out bare from his full, thin lawn sleeves.</p>

<p>The terrible tragedy which he had gone through had left very
little mark upon him outwardly; his tall figure was just as
upright, his step as firm, his head as erect. Only the face seemed
to have grown older. The mouth drooped more, there were two deep
lines between the brows, and as the sun shone brilliantly on the
dark hair, there were some very obvious streaks of grey among the
black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay you have found this small cottage at
Z&aacute;rda very lonely at times, my son,&rdquo; said the Pater
tentatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Andr&aacute;s somewhat wistfully,
&ldquo;I think I have had about enough of it. . . . I miss my
mother, you see . . . she and I were always together on winter
evenings. . . . Yes! . . . I shall be glad to get home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my son; you have done my old heart
good by that speech. . . . Heigho! I shall have a merry ride home,
thinking of the joyful news I am taking to Etelka, . . . and our
boys and girls, too, at &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s. They will
give you such a welcome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Father, they will not do that. You know better than
to mean what you say. They have too much respect for me, now, to
give me a real hearty welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s, that was an unkind speech. Your name in
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s has become dear to every
household. They would be very devils indeed of ingratitude, if they
forgot all that you have done for them, during the terrible
epidemic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, that is well over now,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, ignoring the first part of the priest&rsquo;s
speech, &ldquo;all round here, at least, we have not had a single
case for six weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we never suffered quite as badly over at
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s as you did here in Z&aacute;rda.
Actually the last fatal case we had was old Rosenstein&mdash;the
Jew. He was very distressed, poor fellow, that he did not see you
before he died. I was with him to the last, and it was quite
painful to see the intense straining expression in his face,
listening for some sound that would not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a great disappointment to me, too, Pater, for now
we shall never know what it was that lay so heavily on the poor
man&rsquo;s conscience. It surely could not have been his numerous
deeds of usury on our poor peasant lads, for I do believe the Jews,
in the lowlands at least, do not regard the demanding of exorbitant
interest as a sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am sure it was not that,&rdquo; said Pater
Ambrosius musingly; &ldquo;it was your name that was constantly on
his lips, and as he lay dying, he pressed my hand in entreaty, and
murmured, &lsquo;Do you think he will forgive?&rsquo; Ah! my son,
it is sad indeed for those who, not being Catholics, have not the
supreme consolation of the Holy Sacrament of Confession, which
brings the only true comfort to the departing soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond that he told me many a lie in his lifetime, I am
not aware that I had anything to forgive the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he ultimately pressed the paper into my hand which
proved to be his will and testament, he still repeated, &lsquo;This
will atone. . . . This will atone. . . . It is
his!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; added Andr&aacute;s, &ldquo;the funny
old scarecrow had no one to whom he could leave his shekels; that
is perhaps the only reason why he made me the heir to his
hoarded-up wealth. God knows I did not want it. I am very sorry
indeed I did not see Rosenstein at the last, if my shaking his hand
could have eased his mind of its imaginary burden. I arrived just
half an hour after his eyes were closed. The roads were in a
shocking condition; even Csillag could not get through in time;
and, you know, there was a great deal to do over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know! there is not one mouth this side of the
Tarna that does not speak in gratitude of your unswerving kindness
and devotion. At &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s, the two doctors
you got down from Budapesth did absolute wonders; and Etelka was a
perfect angel to the women. . . . She . . . and another. . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Pater paused half shyly. Andr&aacute;s was gazing out before
him across the desolate, snow-covered landscape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a good woman, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; added the
Pater, at first with timidity, then gradually more emphatically;
&ldquo;she may have her faults, her pride may amount to a sin, but
she is an angel of pity to those who are sick and in
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about the village folk,&rdquo; interrupted
Andr&aacute;s quietly; &ldquo;remember, I have seen and heard
nothing of them since the day on which I arrived too late to see
poor old Rosenstein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the Pater, with a disappointed sigh,
&ldquo;after that day the cholera certainly seemed to have spent
itself, and God at last had mercy upon us. But the little
churchyard is very full, Andr&aacute;s, and . . . on Sundays I see
many vacant places in the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young ones will soon grow up, Pater,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s, with some of his wonted cheeriness. &ldquo;Why,
S&aacute;ndor the smith&rsquo;s boys must be growing lads, and
F&eacute;nyes Margit had twins this summer; all those mites whom
last I saw in swaddling clothes must be beginning to toddle. Why! I
have a veritable army of godchildren in the villages this side of
the Tarna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are a good many wise mothers, Andr&aacute;s,
in those villages,&rdquo; said the Pater, with a smile; &ldquo;it
is no wonder that &Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s is getting
jealous of Z&aacute;rda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They need not be,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, while a deep
shadow seemed to fall over his face; &ldquo;it has not been an
abode of joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been the home of truly Christian devotion and
generosity, my son, all the greater since no one seems to know yet
its full extent. But the epidemic is over; you have provided for
every misery till God once more brings merry harvesting round; you
need a rest, my son, and will be happier at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently the word was involuntary and had escaped him unawares,
for he closed his lips tightly, as if to check any further sounds,
while the lines on his face became harder, more accentuated. The
priest was wanting to say something more. He looked up once or
twice at his young friend, took out his snuffbox, and toyed with it
nervously. There had been such intense hopelessness, such a depth
of sorrow in that one bitter word, that his kindly nature shrank
from further touching a wound which was still so sore and
bleeding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother must have missed you a great deal,
Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes . . . I know . . .&rdquo; replied the peasant,
&ldquo;we are apt to be selfish in our griefs. The house was
distasteful to me. . . . Without thinking of the dear soul, I fled
from it. Then, when the distress and cholera became so terrible
here, I was forced to stay, for they wanted me. . . . I think it
was selfish . . . for she must have been very lonely. . . . But I
am going back soon. . . . Perhaps to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Etelka has, of course, spent many lonely days,
Andr&aacute;s, . . . but during the terrible time of the cholera
she was not absolutely alone. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>Timidly the priest looked up at the young face, on which sorrow
had written such deep lines. Pater Ambrosius knew next to nothing
of the terrible tragedy that had caused the bridegroom of one day
to flee from his home, which had brought those streaks of grey in
the dark hair, and had given to the kindly eyes that look of
hopeless misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> was with your mother, Andr&aacute;s, so that
Etelka might not be lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, Pater; God will no doubt reward her for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been the good angel of the village,
Andr&aacute;s. Next to you, there is no one who did more to comfort
and cheer the sick, to help the orphan, and console the
widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father,&rdquo; repeated Andr&aacute;s, &ldquo;there
is a heavenly reward for all that charity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the people bless her, and pray for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all have need of prayer, you see, Pater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all pray . . . for her happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God, I think, will soon grant it,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s quietly.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius looked scrutinisingly at him. He did not quite
understand what Andr&aacute;s meant, but it suddenly struck him how
very deeply the lines of suffering were graven on the young face,
and he wondered how long it would be before that iron constitution
succumbed altogether beneath this weight of overwhelming
sorrow.</p>

<p>It was uphill work to pursue the subject. The old priest, who
possessed his young friends confidence, did not care to seem to pry
into the one secret the proud peasant had thought fit to keep from
him.</p>

<p>The village gossip, fortunately, had not reached
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo; ears. He must have guessed, of course, that
they gossiped. He knew life in his own village far too well to
suppose that they would keep respectful silence over the
extraordinary events of that great day in May. But Andr&aacute;s
had never troubled himself about the gossip, and then, after a
while, the dreaded cholera came, with grim hand, stopping the
mouths of all to every talk save that of anguish.</p>

<p>Silently the two men walked on side by side, crunching the crisp
snow beneath their feet. They had left the straggling village of
Z&aacute;rda behind; only a few lonely cottages now broke the
monotony of the low-lying land before them. All was desolate and
still; the snow lying like a glistening pall over the few trees,
the thatched roofs of the huts, and the short stubble of the maize
fields. Overhead a flight of ravens sent a melancholy croaking
through the air, and far, beyond, the tiny steeple of the village
church threw the only note of colour&mdash;a brilliant
red&mdash;upon the dull canvas, whilst to the left, through the
stripped branches of the acacia trees, there glimmered the yellow
and the green of the walls of Bidesk&uacute;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said Pater Ambrosius, suddenly
changing the subject of talk, &ldquo;there is something else which
lies very near to my heart, and which, coward as I am, I hardly
like to speak to you about . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know, Father, that I was so formidable as all
that; I seem to have made a lovely muddle of my life.&rdquo; added
Andr&aacute;s bitterly, &ldquo;since even you have ceased to look
upon me as a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid, Andr&aacute;s, that you should so
misunderstand my meaning. It was stupid of me to talk as I did, and
I am, moreover, an ungrateful wretch not to have told you at once
what it is that lies so near my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not too late, Pater; we are far from the crossroads
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about the school, Andr&aacute;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The peasant frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you do not altogether approve of the
idea,&rdquo; continued the Pater hurriedly, &ldquo;but God has
entrusted me with a sacred mission on this earth, and I must not be
coward enough to shirk it. You and I have often discussed the grand
idea of a school for our little ones in the village. You were as
enthusiastic about it as I was; you have, I know, happy
recollections of the three years you spent under my teaching, and
you told me more than once that the happiest day of your life would
be when every soul in the county of Heves knew how to read and
write; and now . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I have changed,&rdquo; said Andr&aacute;s, with a
certain amount of roughness, &ldquo;and whenever you have broached
the subject before me, I have refused to discuss it with you. Yes!
I have changed a great deal since the days when, after the terrible
fire of Bidesk&uacute;t, you first propounded your great scheme to
me, and did me the infinite honour to ask me to help you in
carrying it through. Since then, Father, I have had such bitter,
such terrible longing after a state of brutish ignorance, with no
aspirations save after daily bread, no ideals save those of plenty
of wine, good czig&aacute;ny music, and buxom village maids, a
longing after the happiness born of content with these aspirations
and ideals, the happiness of the beasts upon the fields, and I have
no longer had a craving to snatch that same happiness from my
fellow-men in the villages of the lowlands. There is so little they
would receive in compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; said the priest very gently,
&ldquo;you have suffered a great deal, and, like all those who have
a terrible malady, you look about you blindly for its cause, so
blindly that, as one who plays at blind man&rsquo;s buff, you go
tumbling very far short of the mark. Education gave you high
aspirations; on their wings you went wandering into the kingdom of
ideals, and suddenly, when you thought to grasp them&mdash;your
hand had, as it were, almost touched them&mdash;something snapped,
and you were precipitated back to earth, very sore and bruised. You
blame the aspirations that bore you upward, the ideals which you
tried to grasp, and do not see that perhaps, after all, they were
overweighted with a burden of human passions that dragged them back
to earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Father, I have not ventured to blame my ideals.
Perhaps, as you say, they were just beyond my reach. When I was a
young boy, they consisted of seeing the ears of corn on my
father&rsquo;s fields fuller and more golden than those of any
other man; later on, I dreamed of a quiet homestead, with my mother
sitting placidly in her big armchair, while I gave her every
comfort she could want, and perhaps, in my old age&mdash;when she
was gone&mdash;with a good-looking wife, whose baking and weaving
should be famed throughout the land; of those ideals, Father, most
of our village lads have dreamed. They are dreams such as are
fitting for the descendants of serfs. Ideals such as those are not
difficult to attain, and even if the peasant mind soars too far
towards these regions, humble though they be, well! the altitude
has not been a high one. The fall is gentle and leaves but easily
healed wounds in its trace. Contentment, a certain quiet
philosophy, helps to make old age pleasant. But I, with the
arrogance born of newly-found riches, began to dream of other
things. Tentatively, I stretched out my coarse, brown hands after
other things than spade or scythe. You led my tottering footsteps
into a new region of learning and culture. A delightful feeling of
wellbeing crept over me. I began to think that this entrancing
realm was really my home, that I had for ever left behind the
sordid ignorance of the peasant, his gross pleasures, his vulgar,
common nature, and that henceforth I could wander on, at will, for
ever unmolested, higher and higher, through many mansions, to a
region of entrancing ideals, which my delighted vision suddenly saw
beyond the cloudland in which I dwelt. Then, astride on my dreams,
I set forth to seek that ideal among the stars. I had reached it,
the clouds had parted, and I saw such a vision of paradise as has
been given to no mortal man to see. But, as I stretched forth my
hand to grasp it, suddenly there rose before me the grim and
inexorable fury &lsquo;Prejudice,&rsquo; guarding the entrance to
my paradise. With scornful finger, the monster pointed at my rough
hands, my heavy gait, my sheepskin mantle, my linen shirt; then,
with loud, mocking laughter, plucked at my heart-strings, and,
wrenching them out of my breast, hurled me back from the giddy
heights down to earth and hell. Ah, Father, it was a terrible fall!
You see I had dared to gaze at the stars! Nay! I do not blame them.
They cannot help their own unattainable loveliness, and the fury
that guards them has placed a solid bandage over their eyes. It
<i>is</i> my own folly which I blame, my own arrogance, my
passions, if you will; but also I blame the invisible Hand that
first pulled away from before me the blissful veil of ignorance,
and showed me glimpses of that paradise, which must for ever, to
one of my caste, remain unattainable. You see, Father, I fell from
a fearful altitude. I am bruised and wounded unto death; but in the
midst of my weakness I still have strength enough to whisper:
&lsquo;Strive not, ye fools! in ignorant content lies the only true
happiness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice had broken down in a sob. The priest did not reply.
His experience of human nature, such as he had usually found it, in
the simple folk who came to tell him their sorrows and their
wrongs, was at a loss how to deal with the complexities of this
strange and passionate creature who had all the sensitiveness of
the cultured man coupled with the unreasoning headstrongness of the
rough Magyar peasant. His kindly nature felt deeply for this great
sorrow, at which he only guessed vaguely, but which he could not
understand, and his hand stole timidly up, as if consolingly, to
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>They had reached the crossroads, and the young peasant had
stopped before saying &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; He had spoken with a
good deal of vehemence, and his face looked paler and more careworn
than ever. He pulled himself together, however, on feeling the
kindly pressure on his shoulder. Gently he took the old
priest&rsquo;s hand in both his own and pressed it warmly.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius looked long and sympathetically into the dark
eyes that had such sombre, hopeless yearning in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Andr&aacute;s,&rdquo; he said very
kindly, &ldquo;that it would do you good if you were to tell me
your trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s grasp relaxed; he dropped his old
friends hand, and the frown appeared, deep and dark, upon his
forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none to tell,&rdquo; he said indifferently.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius sighed. He looked disappointed and hurt, and
busied himself with his horse, preparing to mount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you say good-bye, Pater?&rdquo; asked
Andr&aacute;s.</p>

<p>The priest took the hand which the young peasant held out to
him, but looked reproachfully at him the while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andr&aacute;s, you have ceased to care for your old
friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a wicked speech, Pater,&rdquo; said
Andr&aacute;s earnestly, &ldquo;you will have to write to the
Bishop for special absolution for so monstrous a falsehood. . . .
There! there! . . . you must forgive me . . . I am an ungrateful
wretch . . . and . . . Pater . . . you shall have what money you
want for the schools . . . Let them start building the moment the
frost breaks up. . . . You settle it all . . . it is your idea . .
. you carry it out as you think best. . . . Good-bye! Tell my
mother I will be back to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Andr&aacute;s! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! I think perhaps He may do that later on. . . At
present He is not thinking of me! . . . Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old priest had hoisted himself up on his horse. He seemed
loth to go. Once or twice he looked back as D&aacute;ndar started
off at a slow majestic trot. The tall figure of the peasant stood
for a long time looking after him at the crossroads; Pater
Ambrosius could see him well, outlined against the brilliant sky.
The kind priest fumbled for his large handkerchief and blew his
nose very violently. He had felt an uncomfortable lump in his
throat.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29" id=

Honour Thy Father And Thy Mother</b>
</h2>

<p>Once more the walls of Bidesk&uacute;t rang out with excitement
and laughter. Once more the great kitchens were filled with busy
maids and scullions; oxen were roasted whole on gigantic spits;
sheep and lambs were slaughtered; there was rushing hither and
thither up and down the great staircase and along the stone-paved
walls. It was the Countess&rsquo;s birthday to-morrow, and at last,
after two years, Bidesk&uacute;t would see gaiety, hear
czig&aacute;ny music once more.</p>

<p>The Countess Irma felt more agitated and nervous than she would,
in the ordinary course of events, have thought it good form to be.
So many terrible things had happened since the last time, when a
bevy of guests had filled Bidesk&uacute;t with that atmosphere of
aristocratic gaiety which she loved so well; she knew that the time
had at last come when she would have to face the covert sneers and
satirical sympathy, the astonished questions of her friends over
the preposterous marriage of the loveliest heiress in the county.
As she gave her orders in the kitchen and stables, saw to the
decoration of the tables, the tapping of the wine casks, the airing
of the guest chambers, she hardly realised that there had been any
great change in her life since when, two years ago, after that
terrible and mysterious fire, the guests all left hurriedly,
leaving sorrow and desolation behind. Only when she met Ilonka on
the stairs, and when during meal-time was aggravated by the strange
silent ways of the merry girl of two years ago, and felt the
unaccountable sensation of not being able to order her own daughter
about, or find fault with her curious, independent ways, then only
did she unpleasantly remember the many events that had been crowded
in upon her thick and fast in the past two years.</p>

<p>That Ilonka would very soon leave her vulgar husband&rsquo;s
home had always been a part of her scheme, without which, perhaps,
she never would have given her consent to the terrible marriage;
but she had always, at the same time, reckoned that her child would
come back to her very much as she had been before the awful peasant
suitor had o&rsquo;ershadowed her life; that, in fact, Ilonka, as a
grass widow, would be perhaps a little more fascinating to the men,
a little more free and loud in her manner, but in other ways would
be very much the same, and that she would join in merrily with her
mother in a mutual effort to drive all ideas of the peasant husband
well out of the precincts of Bidesk&uacute;t.</p>

<p>When, the day after the wedding, Ilonka returned to her former
home, the very shadow of her original self, the mother&rsquo;s
heart felt at first a pang of remorse and sorrow. Full of genuine
sympathy, she tried to fold the poor ill-used child on her fond
motherly breast, and prepared to hear with horror and with tears
the confidences of the deeply-wounded, aristocratic girl, thrown
into the arms of the common brute who was her husband.</p>

<p>Instead of this, her daughter, evidently weak and ill from all
she had gone through, refused to speak a word to her mother on the
subject of her brief stay beneath her husband&rsquo;s roof.
Silently she had allowed both father and mother to kiss her;
silently she had resumed her accustomed place at meals, and
silently taken possession, after one night&rsquo;s absence, of her
girl&rsquo;s room, and continued her scarcely interrupted ways.</p>

<p>Ilonka was strangely changed, her mother thought. She seemed to
have forgotten how to smile, spoke very little, and brought
strange, curious notions back with her from her short stay in the
peasant&rsquo;s cottage. Her mother had no authority over her.
Countess Irma felt, herself, how ridiculous it would be to attempt
to dictate to a daughter who, after all, was a married woman and
had the right to do as she pleased. Certainly it was very
irritating that Ilonka insisted on going so often to see the old
peasant woman at Kisfalu whom she persisted in calling
&ldquo;mother.&rdquo; A strange friendship appeared to have sprung
up between the young grass widow and her mother-in-law. The
Countess Irma could not understand it; but she had it, on the most
reliable authority, that Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s had lived
alone at Z&aacute;rda ever since his wedding-day; she was
therefore, to a certain extent, satisfied that her daughter did not
so far demean herself as to keep up any relationship with the
presumptuous peasant who had dared to call himself her husband.</p>

<p>As for that odious Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s, the Countess did
not trouble her head much about him. The day after his marriage he
had sent over to Bidesk&uacute;t a ponderous paper, which turned
out to be a deed of gift to Ilonka of the whole of the
Bidesk&uacute;t property. That was as it should be; of course, he
could not expect his aristocratic wife to be dependent on him or on
her parents. Countess Irma thought it all for the best. The child
had never known that Bidesk&uacute;t had passed out of her
parents&rsquo; hands. She need never know it now. She never asked
questions; seemed altogether not to trouble herself as to whence
her maintenance came, or who was responsible for her food and
clothing. She supposed her father to be still the wealthy nobleman
she had always heard him described, who was well able to look after
his only daughter, if she did not choose to live with her husband;
her parents treated her most generously. She had everything she
wanted; even during that terrible cholera time, Bidesk&uacute;ty
gave her all the money, the wheat, the wine she asked for, for the
poor in the village. The Countess Irma put up her hands in holy
horror when Ilonka announced her intention of staying at Kisfalu
until the epidemic was over. Ilonka had said &ldquo;I am
going,&rdquo; in a tone that brooked of no gainsaying. Moreover,
what could prevent her? She was a married woman. She was no longer
under her mothers tutelage.</p>

<p>She stayed away for four months; Countess Irma could not imagine
what the child could be about. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s was at
Z&aacute;rda, where the cholera was at its worst; the noble lady at
Bidesk&uacute;t fondly hoped that the epidemic would do its full
duty, as far as the odious man was concerned.</p>

<p>The cholera in the village and consequent fear of infection was
sufficient excuse for ceasing to see Pater Ambrosius. The priest
had developed a most unpleasant habit of talking for ever of
Andr&aacute;s, and all the money which he spent in order to
alleviate the horrors of the epidemic. Ilonka was away, so she did
not hear this perpetual chorus of praise, but she seemed to have
caught some of her vulgar husband&rsquo;s fondness for the wretched
peasants in the dirty hovels of
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s.</p>

<p>At last, in the winter, Ilonka came home again. She seemed
brighter and pleasanter than when she left, though she never would
tell her mother how she had spent the last few months. The Countess
Irma began to look forward to the spring and summer. Last year she
had had no guests at the house at all for her birthday. The cholera
was just at its worst in the county. But this year she knew many
would come, and half-forgotten traditions would be revived.
Curiosity would bring many guests to Bidesk&uacute;t. Countess
Kant&aacute;ssy would be tiresome. Mariska had just married
Bart&oacute;cz Zsiga, who had a brilliant appointment at the
embassy in London, while Bidesk&uacute;ty Ilonka, the far-famed
beauty of the county, had married one of her father&rsquo;s
peasantry. However, that annoyance would have to be got over. The
hospitality of Bidesk&uacute;t this year, the wines, the meat, the
fruit, would surpass anything the neighbours could ever do.</p>

<p>There always was plenty of money now, and this year the harvest
had been splendid, and had well compensated for the terrible floods
last year.</p>

<p>Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s certainly seemed to understand the
management of the estate. This was only natural. All peasants
understood the growing of wheat and turnips. He managed everything;
Gyuri merely enjoyed the produce and the revenues, and of that
there was now &ldquo;plenty and to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems quite like old times,&rdquo; said the Countess
Irma to her husband, who sat smoking in his study. &ldquo;Do you
remember, Gyuri, two years ago you and I sat just like this,
discussing the arrangements for my birthday party? Who would have
guessed all the events that have crowded in upon us since that
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri was suffering from the gout; he could not
put his foot to the ground, which made him cross and irritable. He
grunted savagely, as he smoked his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay, now, you see how right I was,&rdquo; added the
Countess, &ldquo;to warn you against those inventions of Satan.
Everybody warned you, Gyuri. You must see how wrong you
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty said nothing. He was armed with infinite
patience. Moreover, he had heard reproaches and recriminations so
often that they had no longer any effect upon his temper. He drew
great clouds of smoke out of his long pipe, giving occasional
grunts of pain, and adding two or three strong words under his
breath. When his wife was silent he said quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure all your menus are not settled yet. And you
said half an hour ago that you were going to cut the verbenas for
your table decorations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That means that you want me to go. Do you expect any
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one on business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business, Gyuri?&rdquo; she asked suspiciously.
&ldquo;Not some Jew money-lender, surely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! What in Heavens name has it got to do with you
whom I am going to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand the word &lsquo;business.&rsquo; That
son-in-law of yours sees to all the business, usually. You say it
is not a Jew money-lender&mdash;surely it is not. . .?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, it is. I have a right to see whom I please in
my own house, I presume?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say that man is coming
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Ilonka in the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! he is not going to eat her, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, you must think of her feelings. She cannot meet
that man here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! He is her husband, is he not? You are
not going to imagine that they will for ever live apart, like this?
And if they do, all I can say is that Ilonka must have aggravated
him beyond measure, just as you aggravate me. He had no gout, so he
ran away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, I do believe that vulgar peasant has bewitched
you, as he has bewitched that stupid old priest. Talk about
aggravation! I endure a perfect martyrdom from hearing his praises
sung by all. A horrid brute I call him, after the way in which he
has behaved to your daughter. She is far too kind and too
considerate to tell you all she has endured at his hands; but she
would not have left him so soon unless he had been a more vulgar
beast than even I took him for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You women have no sense of honour!&rdquo; thundered
Bidesk&uacute;ty; &ldquo;you talk of that man as a brute and a
beast, and you are content to take every generous gift from his
hands. He rescued this very house we live in from the clutches of
that blood-sucking Rosenstein; he handed over to Ilonka the entire
property, which, from beginning to end, must have cost him hundreds
of thousands. Quietly he manages everything for us, in order that
she may live in luxury, and that neither her pride nor ours should
suffer. And you talk of his shameful conduct to our daughter? What
do you say to her conduct then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, remember that the poor child does not know that
Bidesk&uacute;t ever passed out of your hands. She knows nothing of
any money transactions that passed between you and that
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was not my fault that these abominable secrets
were concocted. Ilonka was old enough to be told all. The man did
not stand a fair chance. You did your best to place him in an
odious light before the child&rsquo;s eyes, and then threw her in
his arms, leaving him to fight his own battles. It was not
fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, you are taking leave of your senses! To tell
Ilonka what passed between Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s and yourself
would have shown you in a very humiliating light before your own
child. How could you have expected her, after that, to honour her
father and her mother? You would have destroyed all the respect she
ever had for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know that it would not have been better, Irma,
that she respected us a little less, and her husband a little more.
I tell you I positively groan under the load of gratitude she and
all of us owe to that man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri, these are more of those progressive notions which
you get out of the foreign books you read, notions which have
already caused your ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not harp on that string, Irma, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! it is no use losing your temper, Gyuri; what is
done cannot be undone. We must try to make her as happy as we can,
and get her to forget the past. She is very young; he is close on
middle age, I believe. There is every chance that she will be a
widow, perhaps, before she is thirty. Then she will be very rich;
she can make what marriage she pleases, and she will be the first
one to be thankful to us for the way we arranged her life for her.
In the meanwhile I must try to keep her out of this part of the
house. To-day I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door had been gently opened, and Ilonka came in with a
pretty smile, which gave her a look of her former self. Her mother
darted a suspicious look at her, but the girl appeared unconcerned,
and merrier than she had seemed for many months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must go and see to my flower decorations,&rdquo;
said the Countess with indifference. &ldquo;Ilonka, I think you can
help me. You might get me a large basketful of those pretty
verbenas from the back of the greenhouse. I do not want the maids
to cut them, as they pull the plants up by their roots. I can do
with quite a great many. Panna will give you a basket; when you
have filled it, you might join me in the bakehouse, where I shall
be arranging them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will follow you at once, mama. But,&rdquo; she added
with a coquettish little smile, &ldquo;may I not stay and talk to
papa for a little while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a few moments then; I am waiting for the verbenas,
and your papa is expecting one of his bailiffs on
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five minutes, mama, and I am with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess Irma was reluctant to go. She never liked to leave
her husband alone with Ilonka. However, she threw a warning look at
Bidesk&uacute;ty, and went out.</p>

<p>Ilonka waited till her mothers footsteps were heard no longer
down the passage; then she turned to her father, and said
quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, will you tell me what is the &lsquo;load of
gratitude&rsquo; I and all of us owe to my husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you have been listening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without meaning to, I assure you. I was coming into the
room; that phrase caught my ear, as I was about to open the door. I
confess I tried to hear more, but could not catch what mama said.
You will tell me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I . . . I . . . only spoke in a general way,&rdquo; said
Bidesk&uacute;ty nervously. &ldquo;You cannot have heard
properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, papa,&rdquo; she said coaxingly, &ldquo;I want you
to try and remember, please, that I am no longer quite such a child
as I was. Two years are a long time,&rdquo; she added wistfully,
&ldquo;and I have had a great deal to go through, since then. I . .
. am married . . . and a great deal older . . . I think I have a
right to know in what way we owe a debt of gratitude to the man
whose name I bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must get your mother to tell you all you want to
know, Ilonka,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know quite well, papa, that she will tell me nothing.
It is no use fighting against it, dear; I shall not go out of this
room until I have been told what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What debt of gratitude do I owe my husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You misunderstood me,&rdquo; persisted Bidesk&uacute;ty,
obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, I have asked you, with a childs respect. Do not
force me to demand what I have the right to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you are perverse. What good can you get out of
knowing things which only concern your mother and
myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What money did Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s give you for
allowing me to marry him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you have taken leave of your senses,&rdquo; said
Bidesk&uacute;ty, furiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I have not. You will not tell me the truth, and I
jump at conclusions. If you refuse to tell me everything, it will
be impossible for me to remain under your roof another hour, and .
. .&rdquo; she added, with a catch in her throat, &ldquo;as, of
course, my husband would not have me, I shall have to go away . . .
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, listen! You women are most unreasonable. You say
you are not a child. You must know that a fire one year and a flood
the next are enough to ruin any proprietor. Coupled with that, a
blood-sucking usurer cheated and swindled me, till all my land
passed into alien hands. Your husband had lent me a great deal of
money on the security of my lands. He charged me a fair interest.
That brute Rosenstein, whom, I hear, the devil has at last fetched
away, made me sign a paper agreeing to pay usurious interest. I
paid it year after year, not knowing that it went into the
Jew&rsquo;s pockets, and that Kem&eacute;ny never saw a penny of
it. The fire and the flood completed the usurer&rsquo;s work. I was
a ruined man. Then, there were some papers which I had signed
without reading them&mdash; acknowledgments of money which I had
never received &mdash;that brute Rosenstein threatened me with the
Lord knows what. It appears that he had right on his side, since I
had signed those accursed papers. Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s came
to me. He stopped the Jew&rsquo;s mouth with gold, bought back all
those papers for me, paid the mortgage on this house, from which
Rosenstein was threatening to turn us all out. The land was his
anyway. You, I, your mother, were beggars, like the gipsies without
a home. He told me he loved you. He wanted to marry you. The land,
he said, would thus be secured to you and your children. What could
I do? . . . The knife was at my throat. . . . I
consented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ilonka did not speak. She was very pale and her eyes were fixed,
staring at her father in hopeless bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He paid the mortgage on this house. He took over the
property and managed it, as only he knows how to manage an estate.
It all was his, but no one ever knew it. He consulted me in
everything, and acted as if he were merely my bailiff. At times I
quite forget that I am not really the owner of the land, and give
him my orders, which he always carries out. He once told me that he
was only your administrator. . . . He has more heart, that
man,&rdquo; added Bidesk&uacute;ty, bringing his fist heavily down
on the table, &ldquo;than any one I have ever known;
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, papa,&rdquo; interrupted Ilonka, &ldquo;tell me
only the facts. Do not overwhelm me with shame more than you
need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never told your mother why you left your husband. He
has told me nothing. The day after your marriage he sent me a
paper. I read it through very carefully. It is a document by which
he makes over to you the property of Bidesk&uacute;t, absolutely,
reserving himself the right to look after the management of the
estate. He did not quite trust me, you see,&rdquo; added
Bidesk&uacute;ty with a smile; &ldquo;he does not consider me a
good manager. But he is a splendid one himself, Ilonka,&rdquo; he
exclaimed enthusiastically; &ldquo;you see yourself in what
princely style this house is being kept up, and there is always
plenty of money, in good hard cash, besides; plenty of corn to
sell, and the beasts fatten and prosper like anything: I never had
so many colts and calves to sell, such quantities of corn and
maize. That man knows the value of every foot of land. He looks
after everything. And I sit at home, approve of all he does, pocket
the money when he has done a good sale for me . . . that is to say,
for you, Ilonka, for it is all yours. . . . And you have never
wanted anything, have you, that you did not get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, the money which I had to give to the poor, at
cholera time, came not from you, but from him?&rdquo; asked Ilonka
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! . . . not exactly from him, my child; the property is
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, is he not your husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Ilonka vehemently, while her voice shook
with tears. &ldquo;Yes, he is my husband. He paid dearly enough for
the pleasure of calling the penniless daughter of the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t his wife. Oh, the shame of the whole thing!&rdquo;
she added passionately; &ldquo;how could you? how could
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you talk of shame&mdash;except
that you and he seemed to have had a disagreement, and there is no
shame in that. Your mother and I have had plenty in our day, though
she was never headstrong enough to run away from me; and a
disagreement is soon put right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon put right? Oh, papa! you don&rsquo;t know! you
don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were great sobs in her throat now; she buried her face in
her hands, while she repeated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the shame of it! The shame! How could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see that there is an occasion for making a
scene,&rdquo; said Bidesk&uacute;ty a little irritably. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what is the matter with you women; you always
contrive to be aggravating, whatever you do. You wanted to know;
you forced me to tell you, much against my will, things which your
mother had decided were far better for you not to know. I must say,
I see no occasion for tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; said Ilonka, hastily mopping her eyes,
and coming close up to her father, &ldquo;as you say . . . I wanted
to know . . . and you have told me. . . . I am very . . . very
grateful to you for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell your mother?&rdquo; he suggested
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, smiling through her tears, at his
nervous expression of face, &ldquo;I will not speak on the subject
before her. There is no reason to do that. I will join her now . .
. and cut the verbenas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stooped down to kiss her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Ilonka . . . I think you might try to settle up your
differences with your husband. He is such a good fellow. Your
mother says it is no concern of mine, but . . . Andr&aacute;s . . .
is coming here, presently. . . and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must join my mother,&rdquo; interrupted Ilonka quietly;
&ldquo;she must be waiting for the verbenas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And before Bidesk&uacute;ty could say another word, she had
slipped quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>Good old Gyuri did not understand his daughter. It seemed to him
as if a great deal of fuss was made about nothing. The peasant had
turned out to be a very decent sort of fellow, and Bidesk&uacute;ty
had a certain uncomfortable feeling that Andr&aacute;s had not been
granted fair play; moreover, it was very annoying that there were
no prospects of those grandchildren for the sake of whom the
preposterous marriage was to a certain extent bearable. He still
had notions of winning Andr&aacute;s over to his own idea of his
machinery and steam-mill. The latter stood desolate and solitary:
innumerable spiders had woven their webs among the massive wheels
and pulleys which had well-nigh caused the ruin of a Hungarian
nobleman. The obstinate peasant would hear nothing of it, and
Bidesk&uacute;ty had not the courage to start it again on its
career without the approval and influence of his wealthy
son-in-law. He was glad that he had unburdened his heart to his
daughter about those money affairs. He hated everything to do with
money, and he had a vague feeling that there was something low and
shabby being done by himself to somebody. He would not acknowledge
to himself that he had a strong liking for &ldquo;that confounded
peasant,&rdquo; who was such a splendid manager; that he loved
riding over his fields with him, and had the true Hungarian&rsquo;s
admiration for so perfect a rider as Kem&eacute;ny undoubtedly was.
Moreover, Andr&aacute;s always had pleasant news to tell him, about
some lucky stroke of business; and now, when the lord of
Bidesk&uacute;t met any of his peasantry, he was always greeted
with quite a merry cheer, especially when he had his son-in-law
with him. As for his threshing machines, there was no doubt that
they had been quite popular during this last harvest time.</p>

<p>Ah, well! the world was getting topsy-turvy! Thank goodness!
Bidesk&uacute;ty was getting old, and would not see the day when
peasants would own every bit of land, and nobles would live in
small houses in the provincial towns. For the present, his
son-in-law always called him &ldquo;my lord&rdquo;; but he called
Andr&aacute;s &ldquo;my son,&rdquo; and was always glad when he had
the prospect of seeing him during the day.</p>

<p>Even now, his face quite beamed as he heard a heavy step on the
flagstones of the hall; he tried to raise himself in his chair, but
his foot was very painful. The door was thrown open; the well-known
tall figure appeared in the oak framework; but Bidesk&uacute;ty,
unobservant as he was, could not help noticing how ghastly white
and strange was the peasant&rsquo;s face, how wild the look in his
eyes, and, shaking his head, he held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has brought you, my son,&rdquo; he said cheerily,
&ldquo;but where in the world do you come from? and what wine have
you got into your head? You look as if, at last, you had come face
to face with Satan!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30" id=
"Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
The Grave Of Love</b>
</h2>

<p>Ilonka came away from the interview with her father in a state
which was half one of bewilderment, and half one of acute
suffering.</p>

<p>That pride which is the inalienable characteristic&mdash; virtue
or vice&mdash;of those Magyars who have held the lands of Hungary
in uninterrupted succession of generations, while the empires of
Europe fell and rose again, that pride that rules their every
action, which has prevented their accepting modern progress, and
built a barrier round them which nineteenth-century civilisation
could never pierce, that pride in Ilonka had received a deadly
wound. The descendant of a line of noble warriors who helped to
build up a kingdom had been shamed by the chivalry and generosity
of a peasant.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, Ilonka broke the spirit of the
commandment which bade her honour her father and her mother. She
resented bitterly the part she had, in her ignorance, been made to
play. She felt her conduct to have been odious beyond what words
could say. In ignorance of the real state of the case, she had been
thrown into the arms of one of those men whom, all her life, she
had been taught to despise; and, wilfully, she had been kept in
ignorance of the fact that this man, among all men, was noble and
generous and proud above all.</p>

<p>Yes, proud, with the pride of noble deeds, with the pride that
disdained even to reply to insults so absolutely unmerited.</p>

<p>Oh, how he must have despised her! He, the peasant, the
descendant of serfs, with what contempt he must have looked upon
her, the penniless aristocrat, the noble beggar, who turned on the
hand that fed her and hers.</p>

<p>Oh, it was horrible!&mdash;a burning shame brought the tears
into her eyes. She tortured herself with the recollection of all
the taunts, the insults, she had, in her blind ingratitude, hurled
at this man, who had loaded her and her family with gifts, and in
return asked for such a very little love.</p>

<p>The silence which she took to mean shame and remorse was one of
unutterable scorn for her. He disdained to explain to her how
little he had merited those taunts of cupidity and arrogance.
Ilonka remembered that he bore everything silently, until . . .
until . . . oh, that was a cruel blow she dealt! she wondered now
what demon had suggested it. He had done so much to win her, and
she calmly told him that she loved another. Then only did he say to
her that she had gone too far; then only did the rough
peasant&rsquo;s wrath threaten to avenge the bitter insults, and
silence for ever the ungrateful tongue.</p>

<p>Oh, why had Etelka then intervened? Why was not her life allowed
to pay the penalty of her odious conduct? one blow would then have
ended the bitter conflict between a man&rsquo;s passion and a
woman&rsquo;s pride. Then . . . oh, then . . . the terrible duty
would not have been before her which now her very pride compelled
her to perform.</p>

<p>A peasant could not outdo an aristocrat in chivalry.</p>

<p>She had wounded him and his pride; she would make amends. He had
made every sacrifice to gain her love; she would try and give it.
Humbled before him, she would ask his forgiveness. She would return
to that home from which her cruelty and injustice had driven him
that fatal night. She had done a great wrong, but the reparation
would be equally great. Love she could not give him. Oh, no! she
had loved once . . . long ago . . . in her early youth, a man who
was refined, aristocratic . . . so respectful, when he whispered
gently, &ldquo;Ilonka, I love you,&rdquo; without even daring to
touch her hand. Oh, no! she could never love this man, whose voice
was rough, and whose eyes seemed to look into her very soul; whose
strange, wild words made her shudder with an indefinable feeling
which must be horror. Ilonka remembered his last farewell to her,
when his voice had ceased to tremble, and he swore to her that
never again would he speak of his dead love to her.</p>

<p>Dead love? could love be dead? Hers for the handsome young
hussar was surely still alive in her heart. It seemed so cruel to
talk of love as dead. No wonder that, when he swore his strange
oath, a terrible pain had seized her heart, and had remained there
ever since. It was a curious pain, which she could not understand,
but which, at times, became unbearable, whenever the sighing of the
wind through the poplar trees brought a faint echo of the rugged
voice to her ear. Then at night, when the moon shone cold upon the
plains, she felt sometimes as if her heart would break. And she
always wondered why.</p>

<p>Oh, no! no! no! a thousand times no! She, Ilonka of
Bidesk&uacute;t, the daughter of those who had owned this beautiful
land while ages came and went&mdash;no! she could never love the
peasant. But she could be grateful; she could make amends for her
wrongs, and repay by her submission, her obedience&mdash;if need
be, her deference&mdash; the deep debt her family had contracted in
her name.</p>

<p>She had strolled out into the garden. The mid-day sun was hot
and scorching. Dreamily she wandered down the acacia drive, where
the ground was cool and fragrant, covered with a carpet of
sweet-scented petals. She looked out through the open gates, and
there, far away across the plain, she saw a tiny speck upon the
horizon. Her heart beat fast. She was angry with herself, at her
own cowardice; she had nothing to fear. The humiliation would be
great, but the greater it was, the more contented would be her
pride, for then the greater would be the atonement.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s dismounted at the gate, leaving Csillag to wander
at her sweet will, while he walked up the drive to the castle.
Ilonka heard him saying farewell to his horse, and telling her he
would not be long, just as if the mare was a human creature and his
dearest friend. Then she stepped forward.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s did not start. He looked at her so quietly, almost
as if he had expected to see her there. Ilonka saw, at once, how
very much older he seemed than on the day when he had first kissed
her hand. And as he lifted his cap, she saw how grey his hair had
turned at the temples. Silently he would have passed, but she said
timidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father is waiting to see you; but I came out here, as
there is something I wished to say to you. . . . Will you hear
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped, with his cap in his hand, looking down at her, with
a half-vacant look in his eyes, as if his thoughts were very far
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is necessary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, accidentally . . . to-day . . . for the first time . .
. heard something which should never have been kept from me. . . .
I . . . I did not understand . . . when I married . . . the
terrible position in which my poor father was placed . . . and from
which your . . . your . . . generosity rescued him. . . . I . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noble lady,&rdquo; he said very quietly, &ldquo;I must
ask you not to distress yourself, or waste your valuable time, in
speaking of things that are long past and forgotten. What business
dealings I had with my lord I can assure you that he has
acknowledged in the way he thought fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! but that is not all,&rdquo; she continued more
vehemently, while her cheeks gradually began to glow, &ldquo;I
myself had a great part&mdash;one unknown to me&mdash;in these
dealings. My ignorance blindly led me into what must have seemed to
you the basest ingratitude, when . . . when . . . on that night . .
. I spoke to you as I did. . . . Believe me . . . I did not know .
. . all you had done. . . . Oh, I see it now! how contemptible I
must have appeared . . . the shame of it is more than I can bear .
. . and now I could not rest . . . till I had told you . . . how
infinitely sorry I am. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked exquisitely beautiful as she spoke, with the flush
upon her cheeks, her eyes glowing with excitement and tears,
looking up at him with the gentlest look <i>he</i> had ever
received from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you again, noble lady,&rdquo; he said with an
effort, &ldquo;that you distress yourself unnecessarily. The simple
services which I had the good fortune to render to your father were
such as any man would render another, if he saw him struggling
against a somewhat undeserved fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are trying to shame me worse,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;by depreciating your generosity. It is cruel of you! I have
come to you, full of gratitude . . . tardy, perhaps . . . but,
nevertheless, truly felt. I had been deceived by my parents, who no
doubt thought they acted for the best, but who have caused me to
wound you deeply, whom I should have honoured for your kindness and
chivalry. . . . Hearing that you were coming to the castle to day,
I stole out that I might tell you how . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put up his hand with the quick commanding gesture so habitual
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, noble lady, for interrupting you. There is
absolutely no occasion that you should say the words which, I feel
sure, in a calmer moment you will bitterly regret. The events of
the night to which you refer have faded from my memory. If, as you
say, you have some consideration for the few services I rendered
your family, might I appeal to it in requesting you to allow this
interview to cease, since it must be equally painful to us
both?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed very low, and had turned to go before Ilonka could make
the slightest attempt to stop him.</p>

<p>She stood in the drive, beneath the acacia trees, watching his
tall figure moving quickly towards the castle. He did not turn once
to look behind him, although he must have heard the sob which
involuntarily broke through her throat. She watched him till he had
disappeared within the castle; then, unreasoningly, blindly, she
fled through the gates, down the alley of poplar trees, towards the
plain where, at least, she could be alone with her shame and her
humiliation.</p>

<p>Oh, what a fool she had been! Acting on blind, mad impulse, she
had humbled her pride before that man, offered him her gratitude,
her friendship, and he would have none of it. With absolute scorn
he refused to listen to her explanations and to her sorrow; he
despised her too much even to touch her hand. Fool, fool that she
was!</p>

<p>What did she think? what had she hoped? She knew his love was
dead; he had said so that fatal night. She with her own hand had
killed it, and in its place scornful indifference sat, against
which she had just bruised her pride. Oh, he knew how to take his
revenge! he had returned insult for insult, taunt for taunt; his
cool contempt had struck her in the face, as once her cruel words
must have struck him. She hated him now ten times worse than
before, now that he took a pleasure in humiliating her, and in
making her suffer, now that she was powerless to wound him, since
he did not care. Yes! of course she hated him, and that was the
reason that the pain in her heart seemed more unbearable than it
had ever been. She hated him for that indomitable pride, a pride
akin to her own; he, a peasant, dare to be proud&mdash;a slave born
but to be kicked and despised! The untamed Magyar blood in her
veins boiled with indignation. Her mind tried to conjure up a
picture of that man suddenly thrown into bondage, as his ancestors
had been, and made to obey humiliating orders, with a rough foreman
at his back, who would strike him in the face with a whip if he
dared disobey. She gloated on that vision, the abasement of him who
had dared to look down at her from some high altitude of inches or
of pride, gloated over it till the tears refused to be kept back
any longer by wrath, and she threw herself down, passionately, on
the hot, dry soil, and, burying her face in her hands, she sobbed
her heart out with shame and with longing.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when she at last roused herself
from this passionate weeping. A feeling of utter hopelessness, of
the deepest shame, made her long to fly at once from
Bidesk&uacute;t. But she was inexperienced; she did not know to
whom to turn for help in this terrible emergency. Of course
Bidesk&uacute;t must be returned to <i>him</i> as soon as possible.
Thank God! she yet had the power to return scorn for scorn, and
throw back at the feet of the arrogant peasant the rich gifts with
which he thought to shame her. Then . . . when that was done, she
would go where he could find no trace of her. She would be as dead
to him as that vaunted love which did not live a day.</p>

<p>She hoped that she could make him suffer once again. She knew
she had wounded him once, but this, he said, he had forgotten. She
would try to find the weapon again with which she had struck him
that night, and which, in striking, had wrung from him the cry:
&ldquo;Woman, you have gone too far!&rdquo; She had allowed that
weapon to become rusty from want of usage; it was lying by,
somewhere, half-forgotten, but she would find it to-morrow, when
the walls of Bidesk&uacute;t rung out with gaiety and laughter, and
she, as the young matron, the grass widow of the mysterious
peasant, would be courted, respected, as <i>he</i> now scorned to
do. The echo of her merriment, her laughter would reach his ears,
the leaves of the poplar trees would repeat the soft words
<i>others</i> would whisper on moonlight evenings; then, perhaps,
though love lay buried, it would rise again from the dead, to
suffer bitter agony once more.</p>

<p>She wandered homewards, where she found the house in a whirl of
excitement for the coming festivities. Her mother had been anxious
about her, and looked suspiciously at her eyes, still swollen with
tears. But Ilonka threw herself, with almost feverish energy, into
the plans for picnics, parties, and music; she displayed a keen
interest in the list of probable arrivals, and delighted her mother
with her eagerness over the new frock she would wear on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Bidesk&uacute;ty was in the highest spirits. Andr&aacute;s had
brought him good news and a handful of money. He hoped his daughter
would have the good sense to hold her tongue before her mother.
Ilonka certainly seemed so eager, so merry, so excited, that the
lord of Bidesk&uacute;t quite modified his views as to all women
being aggravating.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31" id=
"Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
Love Triumphant</b>
</h2>

<p>Never had Bidesk&uacute;t been so full: even the riding-school
was converted into a huge dormitory. It was the grandest time the
old walls had ever witnessed. Morning, noon, and night there was no
interruption to the laughter, the czig&aacute;ny music, the
dancing, and merry-making. Last year, the terrible cholera epidemic
had kept every one away from the county of Heves, but now all that
trouble was over. The harvest had been plentiful, the hospitality
at Bidesk&uacute;t would be sure to be regal, and every one was
burning to see the beautiful heiress, whose mysterious marriage to
a rich peasant had consumed every one with curiosity. The mothers
with marriageable sons wanted to know if papal dispensation had not
already been obtained, and the rich maid, wife, or widow, free once
more to contract more congenial ties; the men, young and old, were
ready to flirt with her, now that she had been freed from her
mother&rsquo;s apron strings. It was generally supposed that the
peasant husband would be kept in the background, and well known
that Ilonka had gone to live with her parents the very day after
her wedding.</p>

<p>Countess Irma had feared unpleasant questions. In the lowlands
of Hungary, where all families are more or less closely related to
one another, indiscretion counts for no crime, and Bidesk&uacute;ty
and his wife were well armed against boisterous chaff or covert
satire.</p>

<p>The Countess Kant&aacute;ssy, who had married two of her
daughters to most eligible <i>partis</i>, was inclined to be sadly
sympathetic over Ilonka&rsquo;s extraordinary
<i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what terrible grief for
you! How could you ever give your consent to the horrible
match?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka was fretting herself to death,&rdquo; said the
mother, with tears in her eyes; &ldquo;she fancied herself in love
with the brute, and would neither eat nor sleep till she had her
way about marrying him. We thought, after all, that it was better
to see her nominally the wife of a peasant than lying in her
coffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call it unpardonable weakness,&rdquo; asserted an old
lady, who was a relation, and, therefore, had a right to express
strong views; &ldquo;young girls do not die so easily. You should
have taken her to Budapesth; she would have forgotten such
nonsensical follies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyuri was always so weak, where Ilonka was
concerned,&rdquo; said Countess Irma, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where in Heaven&rsquo;s name can it end? Are you
trying to get papal dispensation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, we shall try to get the marriage broken
off. At present the poor child is very happy with us . . . and he
is very rich. . . . We never mention his name before her, and . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She certainly does not look heart-broken at this
moment,&rdquo; said Countess Kant&aacute;ssy, looking across the
room at Ilonka, who, radiant with youth and beauty, almost
boisterous in her gaiety, laughed and chatted, sorrounded by a
group of men who were, evidently, busy helping the young grass
widow to forget that there existed a mystical husband somewhere in
the background.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young Mad&aacute;ch is as much in love with our
Ilonka as ever, I see,&rdquo; said the old aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, my dear,&rdquo; suggested one of the ladies
placidly, &ldquo;here you have the best possible solution out of
the difficulty. Young Mad&aacute;ch is the best revolver shot in
the army. Invite your son-in-law here to see Feri making love to
Ilonka. . . . Let him provoke his rival to a duel. . . .
Mad&aacute;ch can kill the peasant first . . . and step into his
shoes afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nobleman cannot fight a peasant,&rdquo; said the
Countess dreamily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, there are always exceptional
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had never thought of that. Certainly his money would
all become Ilonka&rsquo;s after he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he, then, so <i>very</i> rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fabulously, I believe. We never really troubled ourselves
as to how much he actually has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mad&aacute;ch has not a silver florin of his
own, but that would not matter, if Ilonka is so rich. Think about
it, my dear. We will all be very kind to the peasant. Take my
advice, and invite him to the castle, or make some arrangements
that he shall see Feri devouring the lovely grass widow with his
eyes. Those peasants are terribly jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was after dinner, and the ladies were sipping coffee
underneath the verandah. The czig&aacute;ny were playing slow,
dreamy Hungarian songs outside in the garden. It was the hottest
time of the day, and the scorching atmosphere would allow, even to
the young people, nothing more active than wandering in the shady
parts of the garden. Ilonka had been among the merriest all day
yesterday. She had danced the cs&aacute;rd&aacute;s half the night
through, and allowed Feri to make violent love to her. She hardly
realised whither she was drifting, and forced her mind to wander
back to the girlish days of two years ago, forgetting the strange
and dark shadow which had since then lain across her path. A bitter
feeling of revenge and hatred made her heart ache, and she made
sacrifice to her pride by forcing herself to flirt, dance, and make
merry, in spite of that numbing pain. She half hoped, as she
allowed the young man to lead her apart from every one else, down
the shady acacia drive, that <i>he</i> would come and see her
there, in the arms of another man, whom she had loved&mdash;as she
told him&mdash;for two years. She wondered what he would do then;
if he would suffer as she had suffered the last time she had stood
in the acacia drive.</p>

<p>She and Feri had reached the great gates; she looked out upon
the alley of poplars, and beyond it, far away upon the plains,
beyond which lay the tiny farmhouse where, with her own hands, she
had crucified Love, and struck him so bitter a blow with her cruel
tongue that he had died, since he could no longer bear the
pain.</p>

<p>Wearily she passed her hand over her eyes. The sighing of the
poplar trees in the hot noonday air, the distant melancholy cry of
the storks, brought back memories of that night in May, and made
her heart ache with sorrow and with longing. Feri&rsquo;s voice, as
he spoke to her, wearied her. She longed to fly down the sandy
road, towards the plains, where the gallop of the wild horses, the
flight of the birds overhead, the very sand and rough soil all
spoke to her of <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started, as the tender, pleading accents of the young man by
her side reminded her that he was there, that she loved him, of
course, and that she meant to forget, in that boy and girl love of
long ago, the rough storm of passion which had swept over her and
left her broken and bruised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go back,&rdquo; she said, with a nervous little
laugh; &ldquo;I believe every one has gone indoors, and we are
alone in the garden. What will mama say? The ladies will be so
shocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo; he said, vehemently, &ldquo;are you trying
to drive me mad? Is this some cruel game you have devised to
torture me? All day you . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, coquettishly, &ldquo;all day, I
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came very close to her, and tried to take her hand, though
she started back a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All day, Ilonka,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;with every
word, with every sigh, you led me to hope that the word which, two
years ago, made me so happy, which dwelt in my memory and made my
life a paradise, that word you would repeat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was two years ago. . . . Do you remember? . . . a hot
summer day like this. . . . We were very young, you and I . . . you
were a lovely child, and I, then, already worshipped you. . . . Do
you remember? . . . You said &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, yes! she remembered . . . remembered the delightful thrill
she had felt, when the softly whispered ardent words had first
reached her ears . . . when first she realised that there was one
being in the world who seemed more perfect than all. . . . And now
. . . of course, . . . she loved him as dearly as ever . . . she
felt the same responsive happiness on hearing his voice whisper
again the fond words she had longed for so long. . . . Oh! why did
the sighing of those poplar leaves bring back the echo of that
other voice, trembling with passion, masterful, yet so exquisitely
tender, which she had silenced for ever?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you do not answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at his eager young face, earnest and pleading, at his
slight, graceful, aristocratic figure, his fine, white hands, and a
strange mist came across her eyes, for she remembered that tall,
picturesque figure which, in this same acacia-scented alley, had
looked down with such scorn upon her. Impatiently, she brushed the
mist away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;God knows that I loved
you, for you were an exquisitely lovely child. If He had given you
to me, then I would have worshipped and cherished you as the most
priceless treasure on earth. But some devils stepped between you
and me, and after living for two years on thoughts of that
&lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo; Fate tried to change that word into
&lsquo;never.&rsquo; I suffered so, Ilonka, I could not have lived
had I not seen you again. You are ten thousand times more beautiful
than you were . . . and I . . . God help me . . . love you ten
thousand times more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half dreamily, she listened to him; through the open windows of
the house, the faint sounds of wild Hungarian melodies were wafted
on the sweet-scented air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;perhaps&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it
was you, and not Fate, who said &lsquo;never&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Ilonka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you! they told me you cared for another, that you
were married, and . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you believed them? Did you not remember, then, that I
loved you?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love soon dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love such as mine never dies, Ilonka!&rdquo; he said
earnestly.</p>

<p>Love never dies? . . . After two years of absence, of weary
waiting, he loved her still? And she? . . . oh! of course, she
loved him. She had meant to forget, in his arms, the scorn, the
contempt, of that other man . . . and yet she felt irritated. The
young earnest face, the pleading voice, grated on her nerves. She
had always . . . ever since that night in May . . . pictured love
like this . . . soft, respectful, and pleading . . . and she
wondered why there remained such a chill at her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, won&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wrapped in her thoughts, she had forgotten him; forgotten that
he was pleading for that very love she had been so ready to
give.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What must I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me that that sweet word &lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo; which
you spoke as a child, you will repeat, now that you are a woman.
That the evil fate which stepped between us is but as a hideous
dream, which our love can soon dispel. See Ilonka! the earth is
vast, there are other beautiful lands besides our own lovely
plains: there we can go, you and I, and take our love with us,
securely hidden from the eyes of the world . . . we can, like the
birds that, in winter, fly away from the plains, build our nest
beneath some other skies . . . Oh, Ilonka . . . if you will say
&lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo; . . . if you will grant me leave to make you
forget the past . . . I will show you such glimpses of heaven as
human beings have never yet dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was covering her hand with kisses, kneeling before her in the
lonely acacia alley; she turned her head away from him towards the
poplar trees which were sighing so strangely in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fate has said &lsquo;never&rsquo;!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can yet say &lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
pleaded. &ldquo;Ilonka, you were a child. You did not know what you
were doing. They forced your will, and dragged you to the foot of
the altar, where they made you swear an oath . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which, now, you would have me break!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You swore it against your will, Ilonka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I swore it at the altar, before God and before man.
You say you love me, and you would make me base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Base only in the eyes of an unjust world. Love makes laws
for itself, apart from mankind. I can protect you, Ilonka. What
matters it what the world says, since I love you, and if you
say&mdash;&lsquo;perhaps&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It all seemed so unreal&mdash;this thing which she had longed
for, which she had pictured to herself as the happiest moment of
her life, when her early love would rise triumphant above the dark
shadows which had overclouded her life. It seemed like a strange
dream, this same acacia alley, the fragrance of the same flowers,
and from afar the dying echoes of Magyar love-songs played by the
gipsy band.</p>

<p>Beneath these same trees, <i>he</i> had turned in contempt from
her and her gratitude, and she, forlorn and lonely, had tried to
blow on the ashes of another love, only to find that each dying
ember, as it flickered, left her more cold and more alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, why did not his voice thrill her? Why did his pleading jar
upon her ear like something out of tune? A wicked desire seized her
to wound him, too; to make him suffer as <i>he</i> suffered, to
goad him into mad, unreasoning passion, which would perhaps revive
the handful of burnt ashes on which she tried to blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feri,&rdquo; she said sadly, &ldquo;I cannot say
&lsquo;perhaps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ilonka?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, that love you spoke of, the childlike admiration
for the first man who thrills a girl&rsquo;s heart, was not strong
enough to battle against Fate. It has sickened during these two
years, and, now that I thought to see it revive, I find that it is
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka, you mistake,&rdquo; he pleaded eagerly;
&ldquo;you are good and sweet, and believe that an oath binds you
to another man, and that it is a sin now to listen to my love. But,
remember . . . he swore an oath, too . . . he swore to love and
honour you . . . but he has broken his vow . . . he has left you .
. . he cares nothing for you . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you have no right to say
this. And I have no right to listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have every right to hear,&rdquo; he pleaded;
&ldquo;your own pride must have told you that he, the peasant, only
cared for an aristocratic wife, that he was too gross to appreciate
the priceless treasure an all too kind Fate had placed in his arms.
He should have guarded and cherished it, as I will guard and
cherish you. But, like a blind and ignorant lout, he threw the
precious gold away, and is no doubt now forgetting, among the base
pleasures of his class, the heavenly happiness which lay for a
moment so near his grasp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to stop him, but he would not hear. He saw the strange
look of agony in her eyes, but he did not understand. His arms
tried to close round her. He would have drawn her to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka! as he has forgotten you, so you must try to
forget him. No power in heaven or hell could bind you to an oath
which you made against your will. That man is not worthy that you
should harbour one thought of duty towards him. Your duty is to
yourself, who are born to taste of happiness, to me who have loved
you so long, and who still worship at your feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had drawn her to him. With the look of a conqueror he looked
down into her eyes. His face was close to hers; she could feel his
warm breath upon her cheek. The leaves of the poplar trees beyond
the gates sent forth a long, melancholy sigh.</p>

<p>A terrible pity for him seized her: pity for his weakness, pity
for his love. Gently she pushed him away from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feri,&rdquo; she said very quietly, &ldquo;I seem to have
sinned very deeply against you; if, as you say, by look or word, I
led you to think that my love for you was not truly dead, then I am
indeed sorry, and, in the name of that past love, I must ask you to
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive, Ilonka. . . . I . .
.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not interrupt me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have one
thing more to say. It is an appeal to your chivalry. You must
promise me . . . that you will forget . . . that I ever listened to
words such as you had no right to speak to me . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care not for right or wrong, Ilonka; I know that I love
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must care,&rdquo; she almost pleaded. &ldquo;We all
have to give up some hopes in life. . . . You must give up all
hopes of me . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot, Ilonka; my love for you is my very
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;to give
up life than to do what is base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will not give you up, Ilonka,&rdquo; he retorted
savagely, &ldquo;for I know that you are unhappy and alone, that I
love you, and that he scorns you, who . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she interrupted quietly, &ldquo;you need not
say it. I know that he scorns me. But, nevertheless, in spite of
that, I shall keep the oath I made at the altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will kill him, Ilonka; and then you will be
free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said dreamily, &ldquo;then, perhaps, I
will be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till then, give me a word of hope, Ilonka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word of hope? Listen, Feri. In my heart there is an
infinite love, and an infinite hatred: when I know which of these
two is the stronger, I will speak of love to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love for me?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hatred for the peasant, the low-born serf, whom Fate has
made your lord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps . . . I cannot say. . . . But now go. . . . Leave
me here a little while. . . . Go&mdash;go! I am tired . . . the
heat has made me dizzy. . . . I will come back . . . but . . . in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was trembling as if with fear, and her hand, which he
tenderly raised to his lips, was icy cold. His heart ached for her;
but he obeyed her and turned to go.</p>

<p>When he had disappeared down the acacia alley, she also turned
and went out at the gates. The road lay parched and arid before
her, the hot mid-day air trembled. The vast immensity of the plain
lay silent and drowsy before her.</p>

<p>Swiftly she walked down the hard, dry road, riddled by great
deep ruts. She felt neither the heat nor the hardness of the road.
On she walked, she knew not whither. Away from that acacia-scented
alley, away from that house, those trees, which would not let her
forget.</p>

<p>When she reached the edge of the plain, she left the main-road
and wandered on upon the soft sand. Far away, from the tumble-down
chimney of the little wayside inn, there rose a thin column of
smoke. The sky was dense and blue, and on ahead, the line of the
horizon, hot and ruddy, was lost in a purple mist. From time to
time the wild cry of the herdsmen, driving their herds before them,
broke the absolute stillness around, or a flight of cranes, with
dismal croaking, would rise, affrighted, at her approach.</p>

<p>On she wandered, hoping, perhaps, that far ahead, where sky and
earth met, behind that purple veil, there would lie forgetfulness,
for which her heart nearly broke with longing.</p>

<p>Then, as she wandered on, suddenly that veil was lifted, and
behind it there arose the glorious picture of
fairyland&mdash;golden towers and castles, delicious silver
streams, trembling as if shaken by fairy breath.</p>

<p>Never had she seen it in such splendour; never had she so longed
that the elusive fairy might lend her wings with which she might
wander down the silent, solitary streets of that mysterious golden
city.</p>

<p>No! Not solitary, for, see! from out one of its golden turreted
castles a horse and rider seem to have emerged, and to be coming
towards her. Ilonka looked, and her very heart seemed to stand
still. Where could she hide, on this vast arid plain, where the
orphan&rsquo;s hair alone, or the rosemary, broke the evenness of
the sand. . . .</p>

<p>She could not move . . . her feet seemed rooted to the ground.
The rider had not seen her yet, for the August sun was in his eyes,
and he held his head down, as if under some heavy load.</p>

<p>Then he dismounted, and, patting the horse gently on the neck,
he let it roam about at its own will, whilst he himself came
straight towards her.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw her, standing there before him, white and
fragile underneath her broad-brimmed hat, the hot mid-day sun
forming a golden aureole round her dainty figure.</p>

<p>Helplessly he, too, looked round him, as if he would have fled.
But the plain is vast, and Csillag far away!</p>

<p>He gazed at her, with that strange, far-off look of his, as if
he were gazing not at her, but at a dream, while his lips
involuntarily parted to breathe her name:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she put up one tiny hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not now . . . not till
the fairy has gone, and taken her lovely picture away. . . . I
could not bear cruel words . . . just now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was gazing out towards the brilliant, trembling Fata Morgana
afar. And he looked at her, for he did not understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said dreamily, &ldquo;there lies,
perhaps, the land I seek. . . . They tell me I was born for love
and happiness. . . . I have vainly sought both. . . . Once they lay
within my grasp . . . with pride and arrogance I pushed them both
away. . . . Since then I have wandered alone upon the plain seeking
for that which I have lost. . . . Perhaps out there in the fairy
palace I shall find the grave of love, and then, the Fairy Morgana,
who guards it, will have pity on my weariness, and let me lie down
in it to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The air was so still that, from afar, the sound of the tiny bell
from the village church sounded silvery and clear, and from the
wayside inn there came the echo of merry laughter.</p>

<p>He did not understand her strange, wild words, but only thought
how beautiful she looked, with her eyes veiled in tears, and he
held his arms tightly crossed over his chest, lest the longing
prove too great to clasp her in his arms.</p>

<p>The heat overhead was intense. Her eyes, now, had a wild, scared
look; she passed her hand once or twice over her forehead, then
looked helplessly at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a dream, I know . . . presently I shall wake . .
. ,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but . . . in the meanwhile we are alone
. . . you and I. . . . Do not look so strangely at me . . . it
<i>is</i> a dream, and we shall soon wake up! . . . But, while it
lasts . . . take me in your arms once again . . . and . . . perhaps
. . . God will be merciful, and the awakening will be only in
heaven. . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had become deathly pale. She staggered for a moment, and
almost fell. The next his arms were round her, he had called to
her, &ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo; But she put up one tiny hand against his
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sweet! my sweet!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;do not
speak. . . . Do you remember . . . you swore a cruel oath that love
was dead. . . . Oh, how I have suffered since then! . . . you do
not know. . . . Your heart would have ached to see my pain. . . .
You must not speak . . . for you might break that oath. . . . But .
. . stoop down . . . you are so tall . . . and I want to whisper. .
. . My husband! . . .&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ay, she had said it truly! it was a dream! so entrancing, so
beautiful, that even the Fairy Morgana&rsquo;s fitful visions
seemed pale and dull beside it. He could not speak, for happiness
was too great. His arms closed round her. She raised her sweet face
up to his, and in her blue, forget-me-not eyes he read at last that
love had risen triumphant from the grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ilonka . . . my love . . . my wife!&rdquo; he murmured in
the midst of half-choked sobs, as his trembling lips sought her
sweet mouth in one long, passionate kiss. How long they stayed
there, alone betwixt earth and sky, neither knew nor cared. He had
fallen on his knees before her, and the strong, rough man, his head
buried in the soft, clinging folds of her gown, was sobbing as a
weak child, for very happiness.</p>

<p>Then, when he was calmer, she had to tell him all! Oh, how sweet
it was to hear her speak of her love! She could not say when it was
born; it had always been there, she said; her cruelty was but an
outcome of that very love which her pride had tried to trample
down.</p>

<p>When the sun sank down towards the west, and Fata Morgana
vanished behind her purple veil, they wandered home towards the
farmhouse beyond the <i>puszta!</i></p>

"Epilogue"></a><b>Epilogue</b>
</h2>

<p>Ah! that loveliest of all the days in the year! that merriest of
all the festivals in June! the feast of our Lord Himself, when,
glad with the beauty, the brilliancy of the Hungarian sky, He
leaves His dwelling, within the village church, and spends
twenty-four hours beneath His own blue vault, safe and snug in a
sweet-scented bower of roses, built for Him by rough yet reverent
hands, outside in the tiny churchyard.</p>

<p>Roses and jessamine, honeysuckle and rosemary, in gorgeous
plenty, form a fragrant altar for this brief dwelling of Our Lord,
right in the very midst of His children upon the lowlands, and
there He sits, in a sweet nest of white roses, surrounded by the
bevy of gaily-decked worshippers, the merry peasants of the tiny
village assembled at His feet to-day, not only to worship, but also
to see the most gladsome sight it has ever been the good fortune of
&Aacute;roksz&aacute;ll&aacute;s to witness.</p>

<p>Pater Ambrosius, having read the open-air Mass, and having
safely housed his Divine Master among the flowers, is filling a
large vessel with holy water. A merry smile plays round the corners
of his kindly old mouth. There is eager expectancy on the faces of
all, when, hark! a tiny cry proceeds from the vestry beyond. This
is answered by a vociferous shout of &ldquo;Long live!&rdquo; as
the door of the church opens, and there appears, beneath the porch,
my lord Bidesk&uacute;ty Gyuri, in all the gorgeousness of his
national attire, carrying in his arms, somewhat nervously, a tiny
bundle, all encased in lace and fine linen. Behind him,
Kem&eacute;ny Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s kindly face, beaming with
happiness and pride, smiles radiantly at the crowd of peasants who
have shouted themselves hoarse with &ldquo;&Eacute;ljen our
Andr&aacute;s! &Eacute;ljen our Ilonka!&rdquo; Close to him the
noble Countess, impassive, slightly contemptuous, tries not to look
towards the tiny bundle, which, in spite of herself, she constantly
does, with an anxious, maternal eye.</p>

<p>Which of the two men is the prouder to-day&mdash;the papa, or
the godpapa? The latter, though decidedly nervous with the unwonted
burden in his arms, looks triumphantly on, as Pater Ambrosius, in
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
pours a deluge of holy water on the lace bundle, which contains the
heir to Bidesk&uacute;t, Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda. Gyuri,
Andr&aacute;s, and a host of other names does the little bundle
get, and, finally, a good kiss from the kind Pater, whose throat is
so choked that he cannot say anything, but grasps
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s hand and that of my lord, and finally takes
out his handkerchief and blows his nose vigorously.</p>

<p>Then, when the ceremony is over, and the heir to all the wealth
and all the lands is richer by the promise of the heavenly
heritage, there is more cheering, more shouting. Every one talks at
once, every one wants to see the son of Andr&aacute;s, their own
Andr&aacute;s, and of the gentle lady who has been their good angel
through sad times, and who has brought the happy laugh to
Andr&aacute;s&rsquo;s throat once more, and caused his cheering
voice to be heard again from one end of the village to the other.
Presently, there is a loud jingle of bells, a sound of wheels, and
the gorgeous turn-out, with its bright-red leather harness and
silver bosses, and drawn by five milk-white thoroughbreds, draws up
before the church porch, to convey the heir of Bidesk&uacute;t,
Kisfalu, and Z&aacute;rda back to his farmhouse home.</p>

<p>Andr&aacute;s, proudly carrying the precious burden, tries to
thank them all for their welcome. He is longing to be home again,
in the small, lonely house by the plain, where the proud descendant
of a hundred chieftains awaits her peasant lord with a smile of
infinite love.</p>

<p>And when he comes home, and places the tiny bundle close to her;
when he kneels beside her and folds her tenderly in his arms; when,
through a mist of happy tears, his eyes tell her, more clearly than
words, &ldquo;I love you, Ilonka!&rdquo; then there is before her
such a golden vision&mdash;which is a reality&mdash;that before it
the Fairy Morganas pictures appear but pale and cold.</p>
