  <p>There is no doubt that Sir Percy Blakeney, &lsquo;The Scarlet Pimpernel&rsquo;,
    is the most outstanding, as he certainly is the most popular character of
    Baroness Orczy&rsquo;s creations. This really is very astonishing because
    Sir Percy, besides being the perfect type of an English gentleman, is nothing
    if not British, whilst the Baroness herself, who created him, is Hungarian.</p>
  <p>She was born at Tarna-E&ouml;rs, in the county of Heves, some fifty miles
    from Budapest. Tarna-E&ouml;rs lies in the centre of the Great Plain of Hungary,
    which is as flat as a tabletop and is almost exclusively devoted to corn-growing.
    The Orczy family have owned considerable property there for many generations,
    and do still, but the Baroness&rsquo; father, Baron Felix Orczy, started
    life in the diplomatic service of his country: he married Emma, daughter
    of Count Wass of Czege in Transylvania  &mdash; the Eastern part of Hungary,
    and our authoress &mdash; Emmuska, which means little Emma  &mdash; is their
    only child.</p>
  <p>All this seems so remote from her subsequent life and work in the world
    of English letters that it requires explanation. After his father&rsquo;s
    death, Baron Felix Orczy came back from abroad and took up the farming of
    his property. But in the course of his diplomatic career he had picked up
    certain modern notions which were not at all suited to the archaic ideas
    prevailing in Hungary, and these he tried to introduce into the management
    of his estates. Into a country in which hitherto every kind of agricultural
    work had been done by hand he introduced the latest type of machinery and
    even set up a steam-mill.</p>
  <p>The peasants &mdash; very much like our own men in Lancanshire when the
    steam-loom was first brought to Manchester &mdash; were terrified at first,
    then enraged. They looked upon all machinery, which they did not understand,
    as the invention of the devil, and when the smoke emerged out of the factory
    chimney, they looked upon it as coming from the fires of hell. The end of
    it all was that when, after harvest time, the entire crop of wheat stood
    in stacks on the fields, the poor people in their ignorance set fire to the
    whole thing &mdash; the mill, the corn, the maize, the machinery &mdash; and
    ruined not only the property but also its unfortunate owner.</p>
  <p>The whole circumstances of this disastrous affair, which occurred when our
    Baroness was three years old, she has incorporated in her novel<i>, A Son
    of the People</i>.</p>
  <p>Baron Orczy, thoroughly discouraged and disappointed with his attempts at
    farming, then settled down in Budapest, where he was able to devote himself
    to music of which he had always been passionately fond. The Abb&eacute; Liszt
    became his friend and dedicated one of the great Hungarian rhapsodies to
    him. The Baron was considered in those days one of the finest amateur musicians
    of his time, and was presently appointed director of the National Opera of
    Budapest &mdash; a position he held for several years. Meanwhile, his little
    daughter&rsquo;s education was in the hands of a governess, and she learned
    to speak French and German. Her father resigned the directorship of the opera
    and took his wife and child to Brussels &mdash; partly to give little Emmuska
    a more modern education and partly because the then Queen of the Belgians
    was a Hungarian Princess, and very musical, so he felt sure of a welcome
    in the Belgian capital. He had met with some financial reverses and was no
    longer very well off, so when he met some English friends who suggested that
    he should settle in London, where his music would be appreciated, he crossed
    the sea and with his wife and daughter  &mdash; now almost sixteen years
    old &mdash; settled down in London. Here he conducted some of his own compositions
    at the Philharmonic Concerts, and sometimes conducted the Royal Amateur Orchestral
    Society &mdash; and his opera<i>, Il Rinnegato</i>, was performed at Her
    Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile his little daughter went to a dame school to learn English, which
    language she picked up wonderfully quickly; then she entered Queen&rsquo;s
    College, and soon passed the Higher Examination for women &mdash; always
    taking prizes for languages. Her artistic temperament urged her to take up
    painting &mdash; to her father&rsquo;s disappointment, she showed no particular
    talent for music &mdash; and she entered Heatherley&rsquo;s studios as an
    art student and worked there for five or six years. She had quite considerable
    success, and exhibited several of her pictures at the Royal Academy, one
    of them,  &lsquo;The Jolly Young Waterman&rsquo;, being hung on the line.
    It was at Heatherley&rsquo;s that I met her. I was working there, and we
    became art student chums. Baron Orczy died very suddenly of heart failure,
    and his widow, the Baroness&rsquo; mother, decided to return to Hungary,
    but his daughter did not want to leave London, her many friends, and her
    Art, so she stayed on in England. Shortly afterwards we got married and set
    up a studio together. I took up &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; work as a readier
    means of making money than picture painting, and it was at this time, when
    I had often to sit up late into the night at my easel to get some work done,
    that my wife fell into the habit of reading aloud to me, mostly French detective
    novels, Gaboriau and others, and I think it was originally from these &mdash; that
    are classics in their way &mdash; that she learnt how to set out and construct
    a story.</p>
  <p>Later on we happened to come across a family consisting of father, mother,
    and two daughters. The latter wrote short stories for the magazines &mdash; we
    did not think very highly of them, but sometimes passed an evening listening
    to one or other of them reading her &lsquo;latest&rsquo; aloud. One night
    after such a reading my wife said to me, &ldquo;I could write better stories
    than those girls,&rdquo; and I said,  &ldquo;Well! why not have a try?&rdquo; No
    sooner said than done; the very next day I found her armed with pen, ink
    and paper scribbling for all she was worth! Soon she had written two stories &mdash; both
    of the thrilling kind, and when she&rsquo;d read them to me I ejaculated, &lsquo;Damned
    good!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I happened to be doing work for <i>Pearson&rsquo;s Magazine</i> at the time,
    and said I&rsquo;d take her stories and show them to the editor. I did so,
    and he promised to read them the next day &mdash; which was Sunday. On Monday
    morning a telegram was handed in &mdash; not for me, but for my wife, from
    the Editor, and it said, &lsquo;Come to the office and lunch with me.&rsquo; Off
    she went, and I stayed in the studio working and wondering what was happening
    at Pearson&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon my wife turned up, fearfully excited. The Editor had not
    only accepted the stories, but commissioned her to write several more to
    make a series. These stories are known now, almost the world over, as <i>The
    Old Man in the Corner</i> series, and are selling in book form to this day!</p>
  <p>Now I come to the <i>Scarlet Pimpernel</i>. It really is almost unbelievable,
    but this is just what happened. A magazine editor &mdash; not Pearson&rsquo;s
    this time, but the Baroness&rsquo; stories had by now found their way into
    other publications as well  &mdash; asked her to call at his office. She
    went off. It was a regular London day, foggy and damp, and I didn&rsquo;t
    like her going off by herself, but she would go. The Editor told her he had
    an opening for a long serial story, but it must be of a very exciting and &lsquo;romantic&rsquo; character.
    My poor wife came away from the interview feeling despondent  &mdash; she
    had done nothing but detective fiction so far and said she hadn&rsquo;t a
    romantic idea in her head. As she paced up and down the platform at the Temple
    underground station &mdash; waiting for a train &mdash; the place wrapped
    in fog and mist, she suddenly looked up and saw The Scarlet Pimpernel! She
    stood rooted to the spot and simply stared &mdash; he came towards her and
    laughed and looked at her through his quizzing glass &mdash; he was dressed
    in his caped coat and wore breeches and hessian boots: he passed her and
    she turned to watch him, but he had disappeared! She came home nearly frantic
    with excitement. All she could say was, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found him &mdash; my
    Hero!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So you see the Scarlet Pimpernel does, in all reality, take a quiz sometimes
    at our world of to-day. Our author has often seen him since, for to her eyes
    he takes visible shape &mdash; in fact, he sometimes &lsquo;barges in&rsquo; when
    she is writing on quite different subjects, nothing to do with him at all.
    She looks up and finds him sitting against the angle of her desk, looking
    at her and smiling and she says to him, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not writing about
    you now, my dear man.&rsquo; And she sees him smile and say, &lsquo;Oh, you
    think not&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not demmed sure of it!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And sometimes when she is dozing in a chair in front of the fire after her
    day&rsquo;s work, she feels he is there and looks up and finds him laughing
    quietly and looking at her through his quizzing-glass &mdash; and he begins
    without any preamble:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, m&rsquo;dear, I must tell you what happened on the 3rd Brumaire
    in 179&mdash; I was in Paris, you know, by the Seine, and it was a demmed
    disagreeable sort of day.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And he just tells her the whole story so that she is compelled to write
    it down &mdash; and that&rsquo;s how it happens.</p>
  <p>You may believe it or not&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a fact!</p>
<p>Good-bye, and God bless you all.<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1<br>
    Sir Percy Blakeney Puts Up His Quizzing-Glass</b> </h2>
  <p>Odd&rsquo;s fish! but I am already beginning to wonder whether my visit
    to your modern world is going to be depressing or exhilarating. Lud love
    you, m&rsquo;dears, think on it! To be compelled to be serious &mdash; really
    serious, mind you &mdash; through the whole length of a book; to say what
    I think of your modern culture; to make you see the romance of an era which
    you yourselves deem unbearably prosaic &mdash; la! the task would be impossible
    were it not for the fact that after taking a preliminary look round I have
    found that these modern times of yours are quite as romantic as were those
    in which I lived: they are just as full of adventure, of love and of laughter
    as when I and Sir Andrew and Lord Tony wore rapiers and ruffles, and Lady
    Blakeney danced the minuet and sang &lsquo;Eldorado&rsquo; to the accompaniment
    of the spinet.</p>
  <p>It would in very truth be an impossible task were it not for the delight
    in store for me of scoring off all those demmed dull Chauvelins, or Chambertins,
    of your twentieth century and of proving to them that with all their Committees
    of Pussyfoots and Boards of Public Morals they cannot manacle a certain little
    blind god we all wot of, nor can they destroy that lure of adventure and
    of danger which beckons to you modern young people with just as much insistence
    as it did to us.</p>
  <p>Therefore am I here now in your midst &mdash; an eighteenth-century dandy,
    seemingly out of place amid your plus-fours and swallow-tailed coats, but
    nevertheless prepared to prove my argument up to the hilt. It is demmed embarassing,
    believe me, to speak to you in the pages of a book and to remain invisible
    and inaudible the while, even though in the days of my friends Robespierre,
    Fouquier-Tinville and their like my capacities in that direction were mightily
    embarassing to them. But even after the first page or two I already have
    scored off your arrant pessimists: one hundred and fifty years ago the League
    of the Scarlet Pimpernel was made up of nineteen gallant English gentlemen,
    but now, by contrast, I can enroll under my banner hundreds of thousands &mdash; nay,
    millions &mdash; of men and women of every nation; all those, in fact, who
    worship beauty, who dream romantic dreams, who love every kind of adventure,
    so be it that adventure is spiced with danger. Every soldier of fortune &mdash; and
    your modern world counts these by the million &mdash; is really a member
    of this new League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t believe me? You smile? You scoff? You shrug your shoulders?
    By gad! if I do not succeed in proving my case within the space allotted
    to me in this book then I will take a ticket &mdash; not a return ticket,
    mind you &mdash; for old Charon&rsquo;s boat and never utter a word of complaint.</p>
  <p>Now let me confess at once that yours is a strange world, even though it
    be not strange to me. I see changes &mdash; a power of changes, from our
    wigs and ruffles and rapiers, our coaches and gigs, our leisurely ways, our
    inconsequent aristocracy and, for the most part, contented, easy-going working-classes.
    You live in a rush in this twentieth century; grim earnestness pervades your
    whole existence; you make and accept great and marvellous wonders &mdash; miracles,
    I would call them &mdash; as a matter of course, simply because in your impatience
    and your restlessness you are always eager to get on &mdash; to get on, on,
    on, inventing and making things greater and more marvellous still.</p>
  <p>But this is where the strangeness comes in: you &mdash; or, rather, the
    pessimistic Chauvelins amongst you &mdash; vow that romance is dead in this
    modern world; they speak regretfully of the good old days when Sir Percy
    and Lady Blakeney were the stars of London society, when a romantic love-affair
    or quixotic adventure met you at every turn. You find your century a dull
    one, and I marvelled at first whether I, too, would find it so, or would
    deem it necessary to tint my quizzing-glass with a roseate hue.</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, what do I find?</p>
  <p>I find an age so racked with boredom, so surfeited with pleasure and novelty,
    that it cannot recognize the incomparable adventure of living in the midst
    of the most marvellous inventions devised by the ingenious brain of man;
    of living at a time when a man can speak to wife or friend across the width
    of the world; when he can put a girdle round the earth by flying through
    space, or listen to voices that speak hundreds of miles away.</p>
  <p>It was the fashion in my day to cultivate an air of boredom that one did
    not feel, but, bless me! your detachment and boredom to-day in the midst
    of all your modern marvels are neither a fad nor a pose. I see that they
    are very real indeed.</p>
  <p>Strange, did I say? La! it is astounding.</p>
  <p>I reckon to have enjoyed a pretty turn now and again in France with those
    demmed dirty fellows of the Committee of Public Safety. But what a record
    of heroic deeds <i>you</i> established in France less than a score of years
    ago when you transformed a matter of blood and mud and hate and horror into
    an epic of nobility and self-sacrifice and splendid comradeship to which
    mere words cannot attempt to do justice! My League and I were ready to take
    our lives in our hands when it came to spiriting an <i>aristo</i> from under
    the guillotine, but there is not a man among us who would hesitate to take
    off his hat in sincere respect and boundless admiration for the greater courage
    of that band of miners who recently, in a pit disaster in Yorkshire, went
    down unhesitatingly into the bowels of the earth to risk flame and poison-gas,
    death by explosion or drowning, in order to try and save their comrades,
    even though these were, perhaps, already beyond the hope of human aid.</p>
  <p>You declare that romance to-day is dead? What, then, but romance is the
    story of the young nurse who a few weeks ago saved the life of her lover
    by drawing with her own breath and through her mouth the diphtheria poison
    from his throat when nothing but this difficult and dangerous method could
    save him from death? What, indeed, is the whole life of the great Italian
    inventor, Signor Marconi, but a living romance?</p>
  <p>Nay, &rsquo;tis not romance you lack in this twentieth century. Had but
    one quarter as much of it come our way in the days when I frequented Richmond
    and Vauxhall, my faith! we should have been staggered by it. We had to seek
    Romance; for you it flaunts its magic before your eyes every day and in a
    hundred different ways. By gad! when the last word of this book is written
    and the last tale told, I shall feel happy in the thought that I had a sight
    of all that is roseate and silver in the midst of the drab existence you
    complain of.</p>
  <p>Cupid, my friends, is not dead. He will never die while eyes are bright
    and cheeks as fair as I see them to-day. Mars is in durance vile for the
    moment  &mdash; thank God for that! &mdash; and I hope soon to see you devoting
    his courage, his audacity and defiance of danger to the service of humanity
    instead of to its destruction. The steep slopes of Parnassus are still there
    for those who dare to climb; the golden apples of the Hesperides still grow
    in the enchanted garden for those who have the spirit to gather them</p>
  <p>Look wide, you moderns! your feet may be plodding in clay, but your eyes
    can be raised to the eternal hills, and let the memory of the Scarlet Pimpernel
    show you the way along the silvery paths of Romance which wind their way
    as deftly through your crowded city streets of to-day as ever they did when
    I followed them to Paris; for I can hear the clarion sound of high adventure
    as clearly now as when it called to me in the rattle of the tumbrils.</p>
  <p>La! I find myself almost serious, and I see myself in this small book becoming
    more serious still; but at least, my friends, give me the credit of throwing
    off my cloak of badinage for the sole purpose of making you see the world
    or romance in which you live. For this I am ready for the time being to sacrifice
    my reputation, which I may modestly assure you is that of a lover of adventure,
    of joy and of laughter  &mdash; the immortal spirit of the gay and gallant
    Scarlet Pimpernel.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    Romantic Britons</b> </h2>
  <p>I have just chanced upon a story &mdash; the story of a mongrel dog &mdash; which
    interested me vastly. This dog was the friend of a group of soldiers in a
    dug-out during the late War, and on one occasion his opportune waking and
    growling warned his company of a heavy German attack which was pending, and
    which otherwise might have broken through a vital part of the British defensive
    lines. In return his name was inscribed on the roll of the company, and he
    was entitled thereafter to draw one man&rsquo;s rations daily.</p>
  <p>A year later, in the heat of a furious enemy attack, this dog&rsquo;s master
    fell seriously wounded in the bottom of a trench, and a German attacking
    force poured along, past the place where he lay. In their haste they would
    certainly have trampled the man to death, but for the fact that Mike, one
    ear torn by a bullet, stood growling over his master&rsquo;s prostrate body;
    so threatening was his attitude that the hurrying Germans made shift to avoid
    him.</p>
  <p>So the two were found an hour later when the trench was recaptured by a
    British unit; and it was all the ambulance men could do to persuade the dog,
    faint from loss of blood as he was, to relinquish his guard. For that episode
    Mike was awarded the privilege of marching on parade in front of the regiment,
    even before its officers and colour-sergeants. And I pray you, my friends,
    in what country save in romantic, sentimental England would that great honour
    be given even to the noblest of animals?</p>
  <p>For England to-day, no less than in my own time or during the centuries
    that preceded me, is incurably romantic. The legend so rife in Europe of
    the stolid, immovable, unfeeling, bacon-and-eggs John Bull Englishman is
    false.</p>
  <p>There is more real romance hidden beneath the formal Anglo-Saxon exterior
    than is possessed by the effervescent Gaul or the polished Roman. The reserve,
    the coolness, the marked difference between casual acquaintance and friendship,
    the adherence to convention, the general old-fashioned quiet which the Briton
    adopts, is an artificial wall which he builds around his inner self.</p>
  <p>The careless observer, seeing this artificial wall, never imagines for one
    moment that there may be something undreamed-of behind it. It is only the
    serious psychologist who realizes that right within those defences which
    guard the average Briton against being stared at more than he likes, he keeps
    his romantic ideals as carefully tended as a gardener does a rare and delicate
    plant. From his infancy he has been taught by parents and teachers how to
    build up his wall of reserve, how to fashion therein the gate of unbreakable
    self-control with the key so hidden that none may chance upon it.</p>
  <p>At school &mdash; and, by my faith, I am happy to see how these magnificent
    public schools have spread and increased in number since my time &mdash; he
    is furthered impressed with the vital necessity of keeping every emotion
    and every ideal strictly concealed behind that artificial wall. And this
    attitude of mind soon becomes a cult &mdash; a kind of fetish. The average
    British schoolboy is taught that feeling and emotions are things to be ashamed
    of, so he keeps them carefully hidden away within himself. Whereupon thoughtless
    people jump to the conclusion that he hasn&rsquo;t any, and should they,
    perchance, find out their mistake, they talk at once and with bitterness
    of the &lsquo;perfidious, hypocritical Islanders&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Actually your ordinary man in the street prefers not to talk about romance
    because he takes it very seriously. I am sure you have often seen, say, a
    Frenchman or a German fall on another&rsquo;s neck and kiss him in public;
    but this is not a sure indication that the two will be on speaking terms
    the next day. Indeed they may not be friends at all, they may not even know
    each other: the act may be a mere spontaneous expression of joy engendered
    by the occasion of some patriotic demonstration or public rejoicing.</p>
  <p>On our side of the Channel, on the other hand, a handshake and a few quiet
    words may be the outward manifestation of a lifelong friendship, or the last
    farewell to a friend whom one may never hope to see again. And there is one
    other fact, m&rsquo;dears, which I must mention here because it goes further
    than any other in refuting the fallacy that our tight little island is an
    old, unromantic Sobersides, and that is that in no other country in the world
    are there so many happy marriages. Now, why is that, I ask you?</p>
  <p>It is because when so vital a matter as matrimony is at stake your average
    Briton brings out the key to that walled garden of his emotions, which he
    has guarded so jealously from prying eyes since his boyhood, and throws open
    wide the gates of his secret soul; because, in short, he is incurably romantic,
    and looks upon marriage as the most romantic event of his life.</p>
  <p>I could quote you instances of British romanticism by the yard, of heroic
    deeds which put to shame the legendary prowess of a Bayard. Think of that
    lion-hearted piper, not so long ago, whose regiment was ambushed by the enemy
    in the Afghan hill country. The men were surrounded by a hostile tribe, their
    ranks were breaking under a deadly fusillade, but the gallant piper just
    marched up and down between the ranks and continued to play one pibroch after
    another encouraging the wearied fighters with the skirl of his pipes; and
    when after a time he fell, shot in both legs, he dragged himself up to a
    sitting posture and continued to rally his comrades by playing steadily on,
    the pibroch which they loved.</p>
  <p>There is an outcry among some of you these days that modern England and
    its people have become more severely practical since my time, more sternly
    materialistic, and that life has become, in consequence, dull and colourless.
    La, my friends, you have only to look at a pair of lovers wandering arm-in-arm
    along a country lane, or through the meadows at eventide, to realize that
    side by side with all that materialism there still remains in the heart of
    your people the old ideal of romantic love.</p>
  <p>And to our more emotional neighbours I would say: &ldquo;See how the romanticism
    of our people rises when occasion demands to a sublimity which, I venture
    to assert, has never been surpassed by any other nation. Think, my friends,
    of Greater Britain, the World Empire on which the sun never sets. Does it
    not in itself prove to you that a handful of romantic, close-tongued Islanders
    can and does accomplish deeds of which any people would be justly proud?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Think of the valour of this nation which you are wont to call unimaginative,
    setting up on arid, sun-baked or ice-bound shores its glorious Flag, the
    precursor and emblem of its equitable laws, ready to face a hundred perils,
    starvation, hostility, sometimes even torture and death, for the sake of
    adding a few square miles to its vast Empire, though the very names of these
    pioneers often remain unrecorded and forgotten.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>That is what I would say to our neighbours, my friends &mdash; even I, your
    very own Scarlet Pimpernel. And it is the same to-day as it has been in the
    past: your true Anglo-Saxon has the love of romance buried deeply and firmly
    within his soul. What, think you, made Drake insist on finishing his game
    of bowls when the Armada was in sight, or caused that officer of Wellington&rsquo;s
    army to say grace after receiving the first French fire at Waterloo? What
    else can account for the thousand and one quixotic, selfless and splendid
    deeds which are accomplished by the average Briton every day all over the
    world &mdash; deeds that have caused the romantically-minded Continental
    peoples to speak of us in tones made up of admiration and awe as &lsquo;those
    mad Englishmen&rsquo;?</p>
  <p>Gadzooks! I have been spoken of as a romanticist myself; but, by my faith,
    in comparison with you moderns of to-day I begin to think that I was nothing
    but a practical, stolid, average Briton, or bacon-and-eggs John bull.</p>
  <p>Ask my friend Chauvelin &mdash; he knows!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    But Romance Does Not Come Unsought</b> </h2>
  <p>Take my own case, m&rsquo;dears! Do you know what used to be my greatest
    trouble in the past, that is, before I embarked on those adventures which
    you like to read about these days? I had wealth, good companions, a lovely
    home, the most charming woman in the world for a wife; nevertheless, I felt
    the lack of a certain savour, the spice of danger and of the unexpected in
    my life.</p>
  <p>It was then that I made a discovery. I found that Romance does not come
    unsought, but like a capricious woman she begins by eluding her seekers and
    gives them no more than a few provocative glances in order to whet their
    appetite for more of her company. If, then, they turn from her with a shrug
    and a sigh and resume with but a faint murmur their daily round and common
    task, she will pass them scornfully by, perhaps never coming their way again.
    But if she encounters courage, eagerness, ambition, the desire to put fate
    to the touch and win or lose everything on the stake, then she will smile,
    beckon more insistently, and even whisper of rewards.</p>
  <p>Now let me humbly admit that having made that discovery, I decided that
    the spice of life which I lacked might perchance be found in the misery,
    the squalor, the hatred and heroism of that great social upheaval we call
    the French Revolution. I went to seek romance for myself, and found her so
    enchanting a mistress that I vow Lady Blakeney herself had often cause to
    complain of my new devotion!</p>
  <p>Why should not you do the same? As I have already said in these pages, romance
    is as omnipresent to-day as she was in the world of my own time. But now,
    as then, she needs a manly wooing. Go out to seek her! Keep your soul for
    ever on the qui vive for adventure and novelty! Live like a knight of old,
    ever ready to rescue beauty in distress or to turn your weapons against the
    Giants Despair, Oppression, Discourtesy, and all the other thousand ogres
    that exist in the midst of your vaunted civilization.</p>
  <p>Do not be content with the tabloid romance provided for you in your cinemas
    and theatres. You can make a better love story than the best the films can
    show you if only you wait till you meet your true mate and then woo her like
    a man. There is no stage adventure which can equal the thrill of a close
    competition either in work or in sport, or that of a bold and fearless move
    towards a longed-for goal.</p>
  <p>Why, m&rsquo;dears, in most things save in real life, whether in books,
    plays, films, or what you will, you can pretty well forecast in the beginning
    what the end of the story will be &mdash; that right will triumph over wrong,
    or else wrong over right; that vice will be punished in some form or other
    through the agency of virtue, or that virtue will find its reward in the
    sublimity of sacrifice. But in real life it is impossible to forecast events.
    If we knew beforehand with any certainty what the end of an adventure would
    be, where would be the zest of embarking on it? All of you who are the workers
    of the world and who desire to succeed have got to wage war against all manner
    of forces that are arraigned against you, and you have got to begin the fight,
    knowing well that in all probability it will be wrong &mdash; not right &mdash; that
    will triumph in the end unless you muster all your energy, your courage and
    your determination, to help you to win through. You are no mere puppets of
    an author&rsquo;s imagination, fenced round against the attacks of trouble,
    care, sorrow, disappointment or fatigue. You&rsquo;ve got to hold your own
    against dozens of such insidious enemies and often have to suffer smaller,
    though vastly more provoking pin-pricks such as no hero of romance has ever
    been called upon to endure. I mean the irritating fads of your neighbours,
    family tempers, bad colds, chilblains, rheumatism, or tumbles off ladders.</p>
  <p>But luckily you are made of sterner stuff than are the fictitious creatures
    whose antics are invented for your entertainment. You can, if you will, make
    the whole of your life one glorious adventure, one ideal romance, by fighting
    bravely against bodily ills, by struggling patiently against adverse fate.
    You, too, may become a hero of romance more wonderful than the knights of
    old who slew fiery dragons and conquered giants by the mere act of doing
    an unselfish action of helping some lame dog over a stile, or merely by winning
    the love and faith of one who is dear to you.</p>
  <p>To much of life&rsquo;s romance we deliberately shut our eyes, even though
    it be spread in lavish abundance all around us. Take, for instance, the romance
    of your breakfast cup of coffee, or of the tea which you sip quite indifferently
    in your parlour or your office. Now I can remember the time when coffee and
    tea were luxuries that were purchased with the blood of our fellow-men. I
    remember when coffee was cultivated by wretched convicts who had been condemned
    to banishment for life, and when tea was brought over to England in fast-sailing
    clippers whose captain and crew would risk their lives and jeopardize their
    chances of a fortune in order to gain a few hours&rsquo; time in the terrible
    journeys they undertook across the ocean. And if you care to look a little
    deeper than the mere surface of things you will soon see that a thousand
    objects of use in everyday life have in their production been the embodiment,
    the very essence of romance.</p>
  <p>As it is with inanimate things, so it is with people. Your fellow-men, m&rsquo;dears,
    are prosaic or romantic, just as you choose to make them. Beneath the most
    arid surface gold may be hidden; round the most unpromising corner romance
    may lie in wait for you. But you must look beneath that surface; you must
    venture fearlessly round the turn ahead. In knightly days adventures did
    not come to the man who stayed at home and mourned in solitude the demise
    of chivalry and the passing of courage; but they did come to him who rode
    forth into the highways of life, stout of heart and ready of hand; and believe
    me, m&rsquo;dears, adventures to-day are not found either by your grumbler,
    or your slacker, by the cynic or the supine; they are found by those who
    have the courage to seek for romance and to recognize it when they see it.
    In this matter, as in many others, it is faith that moveth mountains, and
    if you believe in romance it will surely come your way in the end.</p>

    Let Modern Youth Have Its Head</b> </h2>
  <p>Allow me, my dear friends, to congratulate you on your young bloods of to-day.
    Self-deprecation seems to have become an art with you, for everywhere I hear
    an outcry about modern youth&rsquo;s decadence. Yet when I look round me
    I perceive quite as much courage and as jealous a sense of honour beneath
    your young men&rsquo;s nonchalance now as was wont to hide itself with becoming
    modesty beneath the wigs and laces of my own hair-brained young acquaintances &mdash; Hastings,
    Ffoulkes, Tony, and the rest of that pleasant company. And your women are
    no different, either. They may not altogether despise the privilege of their
    sex to play havoc with our impressionable hearts, nevertheless, when occasion
    demands, they will rise to-day to heights of courage and of efficiency which
    surpass anything that I can remember, demmed ungallant though it be for me
    to say this!</p>
  <p>Never before in the world&rsquo;s history has youth had such opportunities
    for self-expression and the attainment of success and happiness as are present
    to-day. And never before, certainly, has youth made so determined a claim
    to play its rightful part in contemporary affairs and to bring its boldness,
    initiative and enterprise to enliven and aid the caution and stability of
    age.</p>
  <p>And looking at you young things of this twentieth century through my quizzing-glass,
    I make note of several things. You marry young nowadays, you take risks &mdash; as
    indeed you should &mdash; while you are still young enough to make a fresh
    start if perchance your first effort happen to end in failure. If you are
    lucky you win through while you are still young enough to enjoy the thrill
    of success, its power; its happiness and its responsibilities.</p>
  <p>And, mind you, it is that horrible War that made you realize the importance
    of youth in the present-day scheme of life.</p>
  <p>With a shock of surprise you suddenly become aware that the essential sign
    of manliness was neither a beard nor a bald pate, but rather a virile idealism
    and a determination to go through with a job once started, and both of these
    might be the attributes of a child with hardly a bit of down showing on his
    upper-lip! That abysmal catastrophe was so much an affair into which youth
    stepped with a smile and a shrug, that since then you have come to believe
    in youth as a magic power, the existence of which you had not previously
    suspected.</p>
  <p>I am all for giving youth its chance. Youth is the time when ideals are
    not yet dimmed by cynicism and bitterness. Youth dares to longer flights
    of vision than age&rsquo;s doubting sight can follow. Youth gaily takes risks
    which make crabbed age shake a warning head. And the amazing thing is that
    youth, in general, is right!</p>
  <p>What is it that has made the American nation so remarkable? Merely its childish
    readiness to believe in and try out new ideas &mdash; to experiment, in fact.
    It did not laugh at Edison&rsquo;s astonishing theories. It wrinkled its
    brows, puzzled a little, and then decided to back him up with money and influence.
    It believed in him, and thus it can now boast of having counted among its
    sons one of the greatest inventors the world has ever known. That is an example
    the older world to-day might do worse than follow, by ridding itself of its
    prejudices, its doubts and its fears, and having the courage to take every
    step which might lead to the development of the great forces of this world.</p>
  <p>Yes, indeed I agree with those who so constantly assert that youth must
    have its chance. Life in the past might have been compared to a forest wherein
    tall pines reared their stately heads upwards to the light, whilst youth,
    like the stunted undergrowth, was stifled for want of the sunlight of chance.
    It was forced to spend its precious years striving to reach up to the level
    of its elders, and to reap the fruits of success when it was too weary to
    enjoy their savour.</p>
  <p>I know that some of your modern idealists have talked of passing a law which
    would make retirement from business compulsory, say, at sixty years of age;
    they have even suggested that such compulsion should apply also to professional
    labours. That, of course, is carrying the argument to an absurd finish, because
    in a business undertaking experience is the most valuable asset, and in the
    artistic and professional worlds striving genius has no concern with age
    limit. It is true, perhaps, that in a good many instances your great new
    business concerns would, by this suggested law, be cleared of the incubus
    of aged and useless directors but in others they would lose the invaluable
    advice and assistance which experience alone can give.</p>
  <p>Besides, age and experience themselves are necessary to the wise guiding
    of the headstrong spirit of youth. What pitfalls could be avoided, what obstacles
    overcome, what heartbreaks saved if only age would put its hard-gained knowledge
    at the disposal of the next generation! Of course, I know the demmed young
    hotheads do not suffer guidance gladly. They will not always listen to counsels
    of prudence, indeed, they would be spiritless enough if they did; but there
    is such a thing as showing them tactfully the possibilities of trouble ahead,
    and helping them to develop their own experimental ideas, however crude they
    might seem to older and wiser heads. Youth is a force that no power on earth
    can drive, but which a silken thread can often lead &mdash; all the more
    easily when the thread is in the hands of a pretty woman.</p>
  <p>Far too often in this cautious age of yours do I see well-meaning parents
    compelling a lad to take up a career which is not congenial to him, and in
    which therefore he will never succeed. Why not let him take his own risks
    and be content to guide him adroitly so that those risks be not too great?
    And heavens above! why should parents insist on having their say and more
    than their say in their children&rsquo;s choice of husband or wife? Even
    in my day we had come to realize that to cross the temper of a young lover
    is the surest way to drive him (or her) into the very embraces one fears.</p>
  <p>Guide youth by all means, but do not seek to drive it. Give youth its chance,
    but do not stir it to revolt by holding the guiding-reins too tight. As with
    a mettlesome horse so it is with youth. Suggestion and love will in most
    cases call forth the very last effort of its strength, but the use of injudicious
    force will only result in a heartbreaking clash of opposing wills.</p>
  <p>There is in your world of to-day a young and eager spirit of endeavour and
    of ambition; that spirit is a gift from the more general spread of education
    which you have brought about and developed since my time. It is for you to
    guide it, your task to stimulate it when it droops, to revive it should it
    show signs of decline. If you are content to do this the result will repay
    you a hundredfold.</p>
  <p>And, egad! When in the course of the years that lie before you your men
    and women will have acquired not only the right to choose their own path
    in life, but also the strength to march boldly along it, to step over the
    rocks and thorns, to put a brave face after every stumble or fall, striving
    only to reach the summit of their ideal, then I say there will rise from
    out the ashes of the years of our failures the Phoenix of unconquered and
    unconquerable youth, with the torch of real progress in its hand, a torch
    that will lead this tough old world of ours to enduring happiness and peace.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    But Do Not Allow Progress To Become A Steamroller</b> </h2>
  <p>And now, my friends, for a good old grumble. You will not, I hope, deny
    me the privilege, seeing that you have always considered grumbling the prerogative
    of your race.</p>
  <p>I mean to have a doughty passage of arms with your giant machine Progress.
    It has served you well so far. Its very name is stimulating, inspiring &mdash; anything
    you like. But I foresee that soon, very soon, with all its high-sounding
    name and its inspiration, it will become unwieldy like a Titanic steamroller
    over which you will have lost control.</p>
  <p>So long as your wonderful modern inventions, your machinery, your labour-saving
    devices are your obedient servants you will certainly enjoy a delightful
    and lazy existence; but as soon as these things become indispensable to you &mdash; that
    is, so soon as they dominate your life &mdash; they will rob you of your
    strength, of your manliness and your independence. Progress, the steamroller,
    will have become the master and you, his slave.</p>
  <p>Let me, I pray, make my meaning clear. I have looked about me since the
    beginning of my visit to you and it strikes me pretty forcibly that the spirit
    of enterprise and initiative which used in my time to distinguish an Englishman  &mdash; or
    a Scotsman or a Welshman for that matter &mdash; is fast disappearing. Education,
    you tell me, is spreading and brain power increasing. Faith, yes! that may
    well be. But what does it profit a man if he gain all the book-learning in
    the world and lose his power to put that knowledge to such practical use
    as will benefit his country first and the rest of the world as well? And
    what does a woman gain, even though she may know the insides of all the books
    ever printed, if she loses her zest in life, her joy in her home-surroundings,
    above all if she misses the greatest gift in the world &mdash; the gift of
    love.</p>
  <p>Again you will tell me that in no time since the beginning of things has
    there been such systematic cultivation of bodily health. Our young athletes
    of to-day, you say &mdash; both male and female &mdash; would put to shame
    the gladiators, wrestlers and Amazons of the past. And I am quite ready to
    admit that. I admit the importance of physical culture, of the camaraderie
    engendered by games, the better understanding between nations aroused by
    Olympic contests &mdash; but only as a means to an end.</p>
  <p>Tell me now, m&rsquo;dears, what in itself is the use of hard sinews, of
    prowess at tennis or football, if tough muscles and keen eyes are not going
    to benefit anyone else but just yourself? You certainly will feel very well
    in health, you will stretch your scarcely tired limbs out in front of the
    fire and think what a demmed fine fellow you are. Your friends will gather
    round you, chair you after your more signal triumphs, pat you on the back
    and write columns about you in the newspapers. But in what way has humanity,
    the great teeming millions of the world, benefited by your winning that bicycle
    race? What, for a matter of that, did your country gain by it?</p>
  <p>Empires, my friends, are doomed to fall as soon as their people become followers
    and not leaders of men. Initiative and enterprise are the bulwarks of a nation.
    It is they that built up your Empire &mdash; an Empire on which the sun never
    sets. Be proud of it, for God&rsquo;s sake. Be proud of it! Do not allow
    it to rush to its fall while you stand in your thousands watching a football
    match or an automobile race. Watch these by all means, delight in them, get
    as excited over them as you like, join in where you can, train your muscles
    and your bones and your eyes, but with a greater object in view than momentary
    pleasure.</p>
  <p>It was because of this seeking after physical pleasure that the great Roman
    Empire crumbled and was laid in the dust; it was because of this striving
    after pleasure only that Spain sank into insignificance; neither of these
    mighty nations was physically effete; the Roman gladiators were second to
    none, the Spaniards of the day were unequalled at games with foils or ball.
    But life was gradually made easy and smooth for all but a very few. Initiative
    and enterprise were stifled in this scramble after pleasure. It was so much
    easier to loll about and watch a few playing or fighting than to venture
    forth as one&rsquo;s ancestors had done over uncharted seas or unknown lands
    to discover new, enchanted worlds. Nature&rsquo;s mountain heights of success
    and her chasms of failure were gradually levelled to a smooth, safe, unbroken
    plain, and the mirage of equality spread its feeble rays around instead of
    the glorious torch of enterprise.</p>
  <p>Above all, m&rsquo;dears, beware of that false goddess Equality. She is
    so insidious; her voice is so alluring, it sounds so noble, we may even say
    so Christian. But beware!</p>
  <p>There has never been, there is not, and there never can be such a thing
    as equality, and every attempt to establish so false an axiom is doomed to
    tragedy or farce. Nature herself has set her face against it: brains, talent,
    beauty, imagination, every gift physical and mental she has dealt with a
    lavish hand to some and parsimoniously to others. And therefore the attempt
    to equalize these gifts by means of the steamroller of Progress can only
    result in levelling them down to the lowest faculties of man. A steamroller
    cannot build up; it can only crush.</p>
  <p>During the late War would France have wished her Foch and her Clemenceau
    to be no more than the equal in talent and initiative to her Jacques Bonhomme?
    And in Russia shall simple peasant and saintly priest be moulded after the
    pattern of Stalin the murderer? Yet even Revolution, terrible and dangerous
    as it is, will do less permanent harm than this cushioned, soft soporific
    we term Progress. For did not France after her great revolution rise through
    blood and tears to a glorious resurrection, and who shall say that one day &mdash; soon,
    perhaps &mdash; Russia will not do the same, while all of you over here in
    this modern world of yours are letting yourselves go to sleep, lulled into
    false security by that insidious goddess, Equality and that other fetish,
    Progress.</p>
  <p>Modern progress is fast outgrowing its strength. Equal education for a genius
    or a dunce, the taxation of the worker so that the idler may loaf, pleasures
    and entertainments in gaol so that the criminal might have equal opportunities
    for relaxation as the honest man, these and other factors in the so-called
    advance of civilization are like a two-edged sword.</p>
  <p>Education should be the means of spurring the slow-witted and the unfit;
    taxes should never be a handicap great enough to impede success. Nevertheless,
    modern progress sets out to drive her steamroller relentlessly over every
    individual effort to do a little better than one&rsquo;s neighbour, to achieve
    or, at any rate, attempt something in life different from other people. It
    tries to educate the most unfit soldier in life&rsquo;s army into considering
    himself equal to a Field-Marshal; it penalizes thrift to aid the improvident,
    helps to foster the selfish feeling that so long as I&rsquo;m all right the
    rest of the world can go hang!</p>
  <p>By my faith, is not our British Empire strong enough to give a lead to other
    nations in trying to get this steamroller of progress into control again?
    Yet even whilst I go wandering through my beloved country I find that the
    gospel of self and egoism has spread with alarming rapidity since my day.
    You, my friends, have taken the mirage of equality to be a real and shining
    light. In your twentieth century, taxes on hard work and thrift have ruthlessly
    increased, and many of you have resorted to juggling and guile in place of
    our old policy of outspoken truth. It is time that Britain took charge of
    her affairs, internal and external, with a stronger, a more firm hand.</p>
  <p>In the times of your fathers and grandfathers which you are so fond of deriding,
    nearly all the great inventions, the great initiatives in the world had their
    origin in their brains. Great Britain led the way in science, in industry,
    in commerce, in the management of her Colonies. To-day half the time when
    something new, something of world utility in science or in pleasure comes
    to light, it has its origin in America or in Germany, in Czecho-Slovakia,
    or Timbuctoo. Your fathers and grandfathers led the way to progress. Are
    you content to follow meekly in the wake of the steamroller? They worked,
    they slaved, they saved for the glory of their country and your future prosperity.
    Do you mean to tell me that you will go on sitting still, twiddling your
    thumbs and waiting for other nations to feed you with a silver spoon?</p>
  <p>Wake up, John Bull! Look around you. Don&rsquo;t go lolling along the paths
    of life which the workers of the world have made smooth for you. Step out
    boldly as you did in the past on the rough road of high adventure, and keep
    your steamroller of progress to its job of strengthening &mdash; not merely
    of smoothing &mdash; the trails which your gallant pioneers blazed for you
    at cost of their own ease and contentment, often at cost of their lives.</p>
  <p>Do you recollect how the hero of a recent an-Arctic expedition, in order
    not to delay the advance of his comrades when sickness prevented him from
    keeping in step with them, fell out of line voluntarily and was left to perish
    alone in the ice? Faith! if you do not wake up there is danger that you will
    be lost in the drifts of obscurity. But to this falling out there will not
    be attached the glory of self-sacrifice, for your fame as one of the mightiest
    Empires the world has ever known will flicker out and die. But the world
    will roll on just the same.</p>
  <p>Your shoulders are broad, friend John Bull, and you have your burden to
    bear in proportion to your strength. The last few years have seen many changes
    in the world, shifting of power and of responsibilities, and shirking of
    tasks. Because of the great traditions built up by your forebears, the world
    has looked to you more than once to put things right, to take a hand at the
    guiding helm, to direct the destinies of the world rather than stand by and
    see the reins taken out of your nerveless hands. Can you do it? Is the spirit
    of your race dead in you? I say it is <i>not</i>. Your hearts are as brave
    as they were in ages past, and now as then you scorn fear.</p>
  <p>You have a responsibility towards the other weaker nations of the earth,
    a responsibility which tradition has placed upon you. Do not, in Heaven&rsquo;s
    name, allow that burden to slip off your shoulders. Remember, that if you
    do there are other nations ready to pick it up, to take your place in the
    new scheme of this world, your place in the sun, leaving you in the penumbra
    of oblivion.</p>
  <p>Believe me, there&rsquo;s truth in what I say. Your fathers and grandfathers
    spent their brains and their lives freely for your country&rsquo;s sake.
    They were never content to see a rival nation usurp its place as the leader
    of progress and initiative. I&rsquo;ll never believe that you in your generation
    will let her down.</p>

    Where Are You Corinthians To-day?</b> </h2>
  <p>Lord love me! when I think of the chances that a man has in your twentieth
    century, opportunities for amusement, for adventure and romance, I feel that
    the Raleighs, the Hudsons or the Cooks of the past have great cause to envy
    you.</p>
  <p>Just look at your aeroplanes! What delightful surprises I could have devised
    in my time for my amiable friend Monsieur Chauvelin (or was it Chambertin?)
    could I but have equiped my beautiful &lsquo;Day-Dream&rsquo; with a pair
    of silver wings! And what about your radio, your express trains, your motor
    cars and great liners, not to mention your trusty friends, the telephone,
    electricity. Ye gods above, what an array!</p>
  <p>At a casual glance it seems to me that ideas and ideals have changed, and
    that the vast number of people who complain that life to-day is dull and
    that it has none of the savour of romance which made it so joyous a thing
    in the time of rapiers and ruffles, are making it dull for themselves. Surely,
    if they would but look around they could find romance enough and to spare
    in the thousand new wonders of this busy modern world. But the demmed dull
    dogs, the croakers and the kill-joys are having it all their own way, it
    seems to me. They appear to be in the fashion, and Fashion&rsquo;s rule was
    always autocratic. Which&mdash; as things have turned out with you&mdash;is
    a vast pity.</p>
  <p>Why have you no &lsquo;real slap-up Corinthians&rsquo; now that progress
    is offering you new and exciting adventures every day? In my time most young
    men of fashion or spirit could show a neat hand and foot in the boxing-ring
    against the doughtiest opponent; they could ride anything ever foaled and
    drive against the Devil himself; and they were never backward, either, with
    a witty word or a gallant action.</p>
  <p>Nor was this prowess confined to those whom Mammon had blessed. The  &rsquo;prentice
    could sing a song or try a fall with anybody; the shopkeeper could tot up
    faults and virtues as well as ledgers; your tailor had a tongue as sharp
    in trenchant wit as his scissors were in cutting cloth.</p>
  <p>And now, despite the fact that you possess all these new, romantic, exciting,
    delightful gifts from modern inventiveness, those of you who do not keep
    your nose close to the grindstone of money-grubbing adopt a silly air of
    blas&eacute; ignorance on the ground that knowledge is really a bore.</p>
  <p>Now do not taunt me with the fact that I myself in my own time did ape the
    inanities and drolleries which were then the fashion, and no one ever wore
    a more vacant face or yawned more persistently than I did. I admit the soft
    impeachment, while reminding you that I only adopted my inane pose as a cloak
    in order to throw dust in the eyes of my friends at home and my enemies abroad.
    Whereas you young men of to-day seem to make a point of knowing very little
    more than you pretend, and of being bored with the little you do know.</p>
  <p>If I were advising a young man of to-day on the way to make the most of
    his life&mdash;and, after all, it is the beauty of living that counts far
    more than the mere accumulation of riches&mdash;I would tell him to look
    wide, to be always ready and never afraid. The world is wider now than heretofore&mdash;a
    man can go adventuring and fortune-making across the seas. Modern business
    is so inter-related now among all the nations of the world that there is
    not a trade or profession which does not need foreign representatives.</p>
  <p>I would tell him to learn, as far as lies in his power, to speak other languages
    besides his own. There is plenty of romantic thrill to be got out of a cheap
    trip across the Channel or the North Sea, and the thrill becomes greater
    still if you can understand what they say over there, catch their snatches
    of conversation, put in a word or two for yourself. It&rsquo;s no use saying: &lsquo;Oh,
    I&rsquo;m not a linguist. I never could speak a word of French.&rsquo; You
    never know what you can do till you try. Besides, you need not be a linguist
    to exchange a few words with pretty Mamzelle at Ostend or Boulogne, or the
    kind hostess who has made you comfortable in your holiday lodgings.</p>
  <p>And don&rsquo;t forget that in life&rsquo;s adventure the man or woman who
    can speak a language or two besides his own is sure of good money. So put
    up your fists, m&rsquo;dears, not to meet a prize-fighter, but to tackle
    those few words of French or German which you can assimilate quite easily
    if you put your mind to it.</p>
  <p>Take your chance in that as in everything else. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. So
    long as you are doing a clean, honourable, wholesome thing take your chance
    of success and face boldly the possibility of failure. There is a marvellous
    feeling of satisfaction and pride in having striven after something that
    is worth while, ever if that something is only your increased self-respect
    or your joy in having accomplished a task that at first seemed beyond your
    strength.</p>
  <p>I would also advise your modern young man to spend a few moments every day
    in self-communion. Self-examination is so good for one. Let him ask himself
    the question: &lsquo;Am I a man? Can I, if opportunity arises, go out into
    the world? Am I brave enough to take risks? Is my heart stout enough not
    to flinch should danger of failure threaten me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>At first probably your little self-satisfied ego will reply affirmatively
    and complacently to all the questions, and will add with a sigh the usual
    rider:  &lsquo;But, of course, luck never does come my way. Look at So-and-So!
    The luck he had. No wonder he got on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But, believe me, those feeble arguments will gradually give place to more
    searching self-examination. The queries: &lsquo;Am I a man? Am I brave and
    self-reliant?&rsquo;  will be followed by a more insistent: &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; And
    out of a true understanding of self, will come that very self-reliance, that
    grit, that pluck which is the one and only road to success, and which will
    as surely as you live lead you to the romantic heights of content, of joy,
    and above all of love. You will find that you have in your life to-day a
    hundred per cent more romance than ever came my way, even though your romance
    wears a sombre coat and wields a fountain-pen where we wore ruffles and buckled
    shoes, and for the most part were compelled to sit at home, for we had neither
    cars nor aeroplanes to take us about the world, nor means to learn all its
    wonders.</p>

    Success? A Practical Talk To The Ambitious</b> </h2>
  <p>I can&rsquo;t think what it is about your modern world, but something certainly
    makes me more serious than I should have dreamed of being in the days of
    long ago. Maybe it is your air of ardent business activity, your restless
    and faster moving civilization, or the world&rsquo;s spreading financial
    gloom. At least it is making me a demmed earnest critic, full of gravity
    and heavy words.</p>
  <p>I stood a while ago at the exit of one of the great London railway stations,
    watching the faces of those who passed. And do you know, in the space of
    an hour, I saw&mdash;apart from those who were in conversation with friends&mdash;three
    smiling faces! All the rest, and there must have been many thousands, were
    either drawn or tense or worried or frowning. And oh! my friends, so many
    of them looked inconspicuous. Now I cannot bear a man to lack some sort of
    an air, some soup&ccedil;on of dare-devilry, some outward manifestation of
    courage and success.</p>
  <p>And this makes me ask you whether you individually are content to be one
    of the weak, ineffectual, inconspicuous little people who look with envy
    on those others at whose careless feet Fortune has thrown her manifold gifts?
    Are you content to be numbered among those who murmur dejectedly: &lsquo;Some
    people get all the luck! I&rsquo;ve always been an unlucky sort&rsquo;? Do
    you confine your share of success and happiness and efficieny to wondering
    how others achieve it, because if so it is entirely your own fault.</p>
  <p>Get rid of that fallacy that &lsquo;luck&rsquo; accounts for the victories
    won by the more forceful of your competitors. Do not deceive your better
    self with the false argument that all the chances go to other folk.</p>
  <p>Get out in the cold, unflattering light of truth, m&rsquo;dears; a failure
    stripped of comforting illusions may not cut a very pretty figure there.
    But the very act of shedding the cloak of self-deception will be the first
    step along the path which will lead you to the sunlit kingdom of success.</p>
  <p>There is one essential key to success&mdash;sincerity. There are many other
    minor keys; for the gate which guards success from those that seek it may
    be compared to one of your new patent safes, the lock of which will only
    open with the aid of a certain combination of letters. But emphatically,
    without sincerity, no lasting success can be won in any walk of life.</p>
  <p>Very little work that is worth while can be done with your tongue in your
    cheek, nor can it be done supinely or carelessly. We should not expect, say,
    a carpenter, an artist, or an instrument-maker to produce fine work while
    he was busy gossiping with a pal or gazing up at the skies. A consummate
    artist or craftsman must concentrate every energy on his task, or his work
    will not be worth looking at.</p>
  <p>And the same with the rest of us. Those splendid fellows who constituted
    the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel did not, believe me, approach with a
    superior smile the serious tasks which I had the honour to set them, nor
    did they dally contemptuously with them. Faith! M. Chauvelin would assure
    you of that. Nor did any of us try to beat a retreat before our task was
    neatly rounded off. Gadzooks! our heads would have paid the penalty for our
    supineness, and your success will pay the score if you shirk.</p>
  <p>Your splendid modern poet, Rudyard Kipling, said a very true thing when
    he wrote that &lsquo;Half a proper gardener&rsquo;s work is done upon his
    knees.&rsquo; The spirit of that applies to all good work. You must get down
    to it, take off your coat, and not be afraid of hurting your hands. You must
    take a pride in what you do, and put heart and soul into it. The attainment
    of success is the hardest task ever known.</p>
  <p>Keep a smiling face before the world, have a gay laugh always ready to help
    you over the stony paths of life, and a joke at your command wherewith to
    hearten those who feel that their burdens are heavier than they can bear.
    La! my friends&mdash;I fear me I&rsquo;m but a poor example, yet I contrived
    to get through the task of living without ever pulling a long face, even
    though there were at times devilish unpleasant duties to perform. When I
    remember the number of times that those demned unpleasant fellows over in
    France spoiled the set of my cravat or made me exchange my ruffle for a coal-heaver&rsquo;s
    sack&mdash;why! I declare that I feel ready to lead the members of my League
    down to the nether pits for the mere pleasure of another bout with them!</p>
  <p>Courage is the keystone of success, m&rsquo;dears, and so are persistence,
    an intense and unflagging capacity for work, and yet more work, the strength
    of mind to carry on in face of failure and defeat, the gift of learning wisdom
    from mistakes, and lastly the power of extracting every ounce of romance
    and idealism out of life. The demmed fellow who said that success was one-tenth
    inspiration and nine-tenths perspiration was more than a wit&mdash;he was
    a prophet; though I am inclined to hate him for speaking such an unpalatable
    truth!</p>
  <p>It is just as bad to allow reverses to discourage you as it is to allow
    success to go to your head. Success should never make you forget that even
    while you are still indulging in a transport or untimely bragging, you might
    find yourself dislodged from that particular rung of the ladder of fame which
    you happen to have attained. No game or battle is ever wong till it has been
    fought for, nor is it won till the opponent is finally crushed.</p>
  <p>This, at least, I see in your world of to-day; that it grants the guerdon
    of success only to those who by concentration, hard work and perseverance
    deserve to win it. And the surest way to win, m&rsquo;dears, is to act up
    to the motto of one of your modern captains of industry: &lsquo;Always do
    even the commonest thing uncommonly well.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    Your Lives Are As Colourful To-Day As Ever They Were</b> </h2>
  <p>One of the most amazingly romantic things about your twentieth century is
    the way in which the women of to-day have dared to proclaim their independence.
    I don&rsquo;t say that every manifestation of it is altogether good&mdash;faith!
    there will always be hotheads who go too far in any new venture, so long
    as women are the demmed delightful creatures they insist on being&mdash;but
    I do feel that the general trend is in the right direction.</p>
  <p>Well I remember how urgently Lady Blakeney used to plead that what a man
    could do a woman would dare, and how hard I found it to keep her from joining
    my League whether I would or no! And I shall never forget the trouble we
    had in spiriting the <i>grandes dames</i> out of France because their voluminous
    petticoats made it so hard to hide them under a cartload of potatoes. But,
    by my faith! those were happy days.</p>
  <p>To be serious, though, modern dress for women is certainly more fitting
    to this era of feminine courage and enterprise than were the hoops and crinolines
    of old; and it certainly is more suitable for the female adventurers who
    range themselves in comradeship or competition with men. And it contrives
    to be amazingly pretty, too. To my old-fashioned mind perhaps a little more
    softness and femininity would add eighteenth-century charm to twentieth-century
    efficiency, but it isn&rsquo;t for an ardent admirer of the sex to grumble!</p>
  <p>The curious thing to me is that it is women who chiefly complain that this
    new age is unromantic. Gadzooks! they should have sampled French Revolution
    times in England, when a woman dared hardly look at a man lest heads and
    tongues started wagging over her name in all the clubs of London. This age
    unromantic for women? When women can go out into the wide world as freely
    as did the members of my League in the olden days!</p>
  <p>A couple of days ago I ventured&mdash;invisibly, of course&mdash;to take
    a chair in the lounge of a women&rsquo;s club in London, where a number of
    the pretty creatures sat drinking tea and gossiping. You must forgive the
    liberty, but &rsquo;twas mine own name on their lips that first aroused my
    curiosity.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a humdrum world it is nowadays!&rsquo; pouted one of the speakers  &mdash; a
    sleek-headed girl still in her twenties but who had already won for herself
    an important position in the world of business. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no adventure,
    no colour left in this rotten civilization of ours. It&rsquo;s just an age
    of standardization; personal enterprise never has a chance. If a man so much
    as flicks another in the face forty policemen spring up out of the ground;
    if one gets a scratch, it&rsquo;s forty doctors; if one dares to be candid
    one is rushed off to the Law Courts to answer a charge of slander. All civilization
    is in league to rob us of our emotions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quite right, my dear!&rsquo; replied her companion. &lsquo;If the
    Scarlet Pimpernel were alive to-day, poor man, he would probably be clapped
    into lunatic asylum. That&rsquo;s how it is now, if one shows a hunger for
    adventure or a mere <i>wanderlust</i> one is no longer hailed as a pioneer
    or a leader of men. No&mdash;one is just bundled off to the nearest psycho-analyst!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>How mistaken they were, those two very youthful critics! And how bitter
    in their complaints that the world had grown drearier since my time and that
    the modern man and woman aimed at nothing but the commonplace, rejoicing
    in the fact that millions and millions more of them were cut after the same
    pattern as themselves, with no greater ambition than to earn a &lsquo;lived
    respected, died lamented&rsquo; epitaph from the other pigmies around! And,
    la! how blind must their bright eyes have been not to see that the restful,
    picturesque divinity we called &lsquo;Romance&rsquo; yesterday is not dead
    but just transformed into a shingled, matter-of-fact, but rather startling
    young thing, whose claim to be thought prosaic and blas&eacute; has almost
    made us forget her divine unexpectedness!</p>
  <p>Surely even the most sophisticated of all you moderns could not fail to
    be thrilled by Miss Amy Johnson&rsquo;s adventure, when that young woman
    calmly climbed into the cockpit of her aeroplane in England and set out,
    a young girl alone, in a flimsy affair of wood and metal and canvas, to fly
    half-round the world to Australia?</p>
  <p>Were you blind to the tragic romance in the world such as a little while
    ago, when the youth of a dozen nations marched, laughing and singing, towards
    the inferno of the world&rsquo;s greatest battlefield&mdash;yea, and returned
    to it again when its wounds had been patched up, not quite laughing, perhaps,
    after having seen Hell and lived, but still with a smile and a song and an
    unfailing readiness to help a comrade?</p>
  <p>No, m&rsquo;dears, I am not talking nationally now; the same spirit was
    evident in all the belligerent countries&mdash;the spirit of eternal youth
    and romance facing the most terrible Spectre that has ever sought to bring
    disillusionment and hopelessness upon earth. My League was gallant, but that
    immortal league of the adventurers of the War years, with its just as gallant
    sisterhood who carried on at home, makes our brilliance seem no more than
    that of a candle compared to the sun.</p>
  <p>You may not find a Drake or a Columbus nowadays, or a Clive or a Brooke,
    because all the seas are charted and there are no fresh worlds to conquer.
    But I read lately of an unknown postman saving enough in his life-time from
    his weekly wage to found a leper hospital in India. Is that the task of a
    pigmy? And I see rusty tramp-steamers lying in a dozen ports around our coast,
    waiting their turn to venture out across the ocean, ready to sail from continent
    to continent whilst facing storms and gales which seem beyond the bounds
    of possibility for men to live through and conquer.</p>
  <p>More can be done still, no doubt, to foster the spirit of chivalry and adventure,
    for only a day or two ago I read a published extract from the diary of the
    late Tsar of Russia, concerning myself, too. La! how famous one becomes through
    a slight appetite for amusement. &lsquo;I have been reading,&rsquo; so ran
    the extract, &lsquo;an interesting new book&mdash;<i>The Elusive Pimpernel</i>,&rsquo; and
    one became conscious of a wave of pity that there was no young gallant of
    to-day ready to attempt the rescue of that unfortunate man.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, I am still determined to champion the vital romance of
    your twentieth century. The colour of the picturesqueness are there; adventure
    calls insistently to you all; the trouble is that you will not open your
    eyes and see; you will not step aside from the straight and narrow road which
    you have traced for yourselves. But do not count me boastful, I pray, when
    I say that I could find just as much excitement, joy and zest in life in
    1933 as ever I did in the days when I sat on a window-sill in Boulogne and
    scared my friend Chauvelin out of his wits.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    And Romance Still Pays</b> </h2>
  <p>In my own time romance was appreciated and sought after because it was colourful,
    charming, and added savour to the dullness of life. Lud! we could hardly
    be said to have lived at all were it not for the romance with which we filled
    our days. One is apt to think, however, that in this more practical era it
    is a thing of the past, but I&rsquo;ll have you know it for a fact that romance
    is anything but dead. Indeed, it is very much alive, and for the simple reason
    that&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;there&rsquo;s money in it!</p>
  <p>Is not the growth of a gigantic modern business the most romantic thing
    in the world? Lookers-on at the thrilling event are apt to think that it
    is all an affair of ledgers and accountants, and of &lsquo;two-three a yard&rsquo; cheaper
    than the rival establishment opposite. Egad, no! it is an epic of courage,
    an Odyssey of endurance, an all-conquering hope brought to triumphant success.</p>
  <p>Names that are writ large in the book of the world&rsquo;s great captains
    of industry are not those of slow, steady-going, conservative, over-careful
    plodders, but rather those of men who have faced obstacles, defeats and disappointments
    with a stout heart, a gallant smile and easy jest; of men who have known
    how to encourage the timorous and cheer the despondent, and who have kept
    up their own spirit of determination and endurance until the height of their
    ambition has been attained.</p>
  <p>And such men have found that there&rsquo;s money in romance, since without
    it they would have been too deeply engrossed in counting up the risks to
    seize opportunity when it came. Without their own romanticism they would
    in their youth have been far too prosaic and careful ever to dare to step
    forward without once looking back, or to leave security and ease behind and
    take the big risk for the sake of the big risk for the sake of the larger
    gain. They would, in fact, have kept their mind&rsquo;s eye on safety first,
    and would never have dared to carry on boldly and gallantly, ignoring the
    cautious warnings of age, in order to gain the great victories which fate
    holds in store for inspired youth.</p>
  <p>Now that type of man, m&rsquo;dears, once his feet are firmly planted on
    the road to success, will still retain all the romanticism which has brought
    him where he is. You will see him building swimming-baths and laying out
    playing fields for his workers so that they may indulge in the romantic struggle
    for sports supremancy; you will see him holding out golden inducements to
    his employees to work hard for promotion, or to invent something that will
    increase the firm&rsquo;s prosperity; and in your wonderful days of mechanical
    marvels a motor car is as good a prize for a winner in the race for success
    as were laurel wreaths or silken banners in the olden days, besides being
    far more useful.</p>
  <p>And now tell me, do you deem the combine of two great businesses into one
    as anything but romance? Is not each side taking a big risk&mdash;the chance
    that the other concern might impair its own high credit, or involve it in
    some unforeseen financial disaster? Such things have happened. Such risks
    have to be run; and are not risks the very element of romance? And so is
    success in partnership when it comes; when W. S. Gilbert met A. S. Sullivan
    they set their brains to work together, and the result was a series of some
    of the finest operas the world has ever known.</p>
  <p>True! but it is equally true that when Horrock&rsquo;s firm joined up with
    Crewdson&rsquo;s all the bedrooms of the word gained promise of finer sheets,
    and when Mr. Salmon and Mr. Gluckstein got together work was found for thousands
    of men and women and cheaper tobacco for millions. And though I hardly like
    to admit it, sheets and tobacco are quite as romantic as operas&mdash;most
    households could do without music, but not without beds, nor could they spare
    comforting, pleasant, delightful pipes, or good cigarettes which that romantic
    combine placed within reach of all.</p>
  <p>I very much doubt if there is a single business man of any importance to-day
    whose career would not outshine in romance that of a good many fiction heroes.
    The late Sir Thomas Lipton was once an errand boy in Glasgow; Charles Levine,
    who recently flew the Atlantic to advertise his own aeroplanes, was selling
    newspapers at fifteen and was a millionaire before thirty; Mr. Woolworth
    and Mr. Selfridge, working along different lines, built up two of the world&rsquo;s
    biggest businesses from practically nothing; forty years ago the Joel family
    were quite unknown. Between the obscure beginnings of these men and their
    present eminence runs in each case a story of almost incredible initiative,
    hair-raising adventures, and grim, dogged determination such as would win
    our thundering applause if Mr. Fairbanks showed it to us on the screen.</p>
  <p>There is yet another way in which romance still pays in business. Men, women
    and love have not changed one atom in essentials since my day when powdered
    wigs and rapiers were Dame Fashion&rsquo;s decree or, if you like, since
    the days of cavemen. To-day, as in that vague past so often called the Golden
    Age, the man works hardest who can win fond glances of gratitude for his
    pains&mdash;love glances from the woman who is his chosen mate. Love is and
    will ever be the greatest stimulant to a big output, to enterprising salesmanship,
    to brilliant engineering, or to the million unknown deeds of chivalry that
    are scattered throughout men&rsquo;s lives like the stars in the firmament.</p>
  <p>The man of to-day cannot wield sword or lance, or enter the lists in honour
    of his lady&rsquo;s eyebrow; but it is up to him to compete in life&rsquo;s
    list so that he may be able to give her pleasure with the gift of luxuries,
    however simple or small. Therefore romance still pays, and will always pay
    while bright eyes are there to inspire courage. For courage makes for boldness
    and initiative, and these in their turn make for successful business.</p>
  <p>To-day a man cannot do as he did in the days of the Stone Age. His worth
    is no longer counted by the number of skins and tusks and scalps piled up
    outside the door of his beloved&rsquo;s cave. But the man who succeeds now
    has lost nothing in romantic glamour; in your days it is just as thrilling
    to earn money honestly as it used to be to kill reindeer and bears; and furs,
    after all, can be purchased, provided that the cost of them has been earned
    first.</p>
  <p>Romance is still king in the world to-day &mdash; it is only his regal garb
    that is changed. Beauty and bravery, love and courage, are the mainsprings
    that drive great enterprises even now. So do not, I pray you, bemoan the
    glories of the past when romance, like his votaries, wore a somewhat cumbersome
    attire, but adjust your outlook to suit your wonderful modern world and,
    believe me, you will find as much that is romantic in the thudding mill or
    the teeming thoroughfare of to-day as ever strengthened the arm of the great
    knights of old, or inspired the Crusaders to conquer the Holy Land.</p>

    But You Must Live Dangerously</b> </h2>
  <p>I have just come across a vastly intriguing little statement&mdash;no less
    than this: that scientists who know how to estimate these things have stated
    that there are nearly twice as many people living in the world to-day as
    there were a hundred years ago. And that, surely, means that the chances
    of adventure and excitement are nearly twice what they were in my day. For
    every man, woman and child in the world may be the possible centre of romance
    for you. Each may be a good friend or a bitter enemy, or may give you an
    opportunity for a generous action, for the saving of a life or the better
    shaping of a character.</p>
  <p>And meanwhile you grumble because, in this age of mechanical supply, coloured
    portions of thrilling life are not served up to you with your breakfast coffee
    or trundled along in a little barrow and left at your back door while you
    are busy adjusting your tie and choosing a handkerchief to match your shirt.
    Can you wonder that I am filled with amazement?</p>
  <p>For you have the right spirit in you still. Everywhere I wander I see a
    sneaking admiration for the villain in plays, films or books, and even for
    the clever scoundrels of real life. And I know the cause of this sneaking
    admiration. It is because the villain or the cinema vamp, unlike so many
    of the timid productions of modernity, has chosen to break through those
    bonds of convention, which most of you wear so patiently and so persistently
    that they have hardened into massive and unbreakable chains.</p>
  <p>Free of these bonds, those others&mdash;whom we term villains and vamps&mdash;have
    jumped out of life&rsquo;s rut with almost ludicrous ease; they have taken
    their chance, they have filled their lungs with the intoxicating air of adventure
    and when luck turned against them they paid the penalty with a certain glamorous
    courage.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t mean by that, bless you, that it is a fine thing to be a villain
    or a scoundrel. Between ourselves, such rascals are usually demmed unpleasant
    and dirty. But what I do mean is that this twentieth century of yours sadly
    needs waking up from its lethargic sleep, and its people made to breathe
    again, to stretch and to live. Yes, live! not as puppets, but as men and
    women ready to grasp at the opportunities offered to them by fate&mdash;opportunities
    of fame, of fortune and adventure.</p>
  <p>A legend was told me once, my friends, by a Hungarian lady whom I had the
    honour to escort out of France under the very long nose of my friend Chauvelin
    in the roistering days when he and his like were turning that beautiful country
    into shambles. This quaint little legend had its origin among the Hungarian
    gipsies, who vow that Fortune is a bald-headed old dame with but a single
    hair on her head. She flits to and fro, they declare, in and about the atmosphere
    where human beings dwell. But only once or at most twice does she pass close
    enough to any one person to allow him or her to grasp her by her single hair
    and to hold her till success is achieved.</p>
  <p>That legend may seem somewhat unchivalrous, but there&rsquo;s common sense
    in it none the less. For the goddess Fortune, capricious like all her distracting
    sex, chooses to come within our reach at odd, unexpected moments, when perhaps
    we happen to be afraid or uncertain, or merely looking the other way. A stare,
    a doubt, a fumble, and the chance is gone. Others get there first, seize
    in turn that solitary hair and hold on till fame and fortune come to them
    instead of to us, and in an access of self-pity we are left to envy the more
    fortunate!</p>
  <p>The only way, believe me, m&rsquo;dears, to eliminate that chance&mdash;or
    rather loss of chance&mdash;is to live all the time dangerously and fully.
    You must, all of you, young and old, make up your minds to spurn the weak,
    shuffling, apologetic murmur of &lsquo;Safety first&rsquo;. Do you think
    for one moment that your vast Empire could have thrown its boundaries beyond
    the setting sun if your pioneer ancestors had used that slogan as their watchword?</p>
  <p>I see too much anxiety in the world of to-day on the part of parents to
    find sons nice safe places in banks and offices and drapers&rsquo; shops,
    and daughters jobs behind counters and on office stools. There must needs
    be clerks and secretaries, of course, and men who say &lsquo;Modom&rsquo; and
    girls who say nothing at all that&rsquo;s worth recording. But, in the name
    of all that you have held great and dear and noble in the past, do not try
    to mould all your children after that one pattern!</p>
  <p>All over the world to-day fathers and mothers sit anxiously planning careers
    for their offspring. Maybe the youngsters want to be artists or soldiers
    or engineers. But, says mother or father, art is &lsquo;hardly respectable&rsquo; (though
    it is lauded up to the skies if it achieves fame!); soldiers, they argue,
    have to sleep out under nasty wet canvas; and engineering is such a dirty
    job. So the unhappy child, instead of turning dreams into great realities,
    is sent to Mr. Blobb&rsquo;s office stool for a life sentence.</p>
  <p>It is really neither clever nor effective to sneer at the more dangerous
    walks of life. They may be risky or dirty, but hands can get dirtier and
    risk can be greater in many an office than in barracks or engineering shops.
    The safe, dull professions are overcrowded&mdash;filled to overflowing with
    smooth, little, purring people who are content and happy in their guarded
    lives. Meanwhile the world calls aloud for real men and real women who are
    fearless enough to leave the beaten track and to strike out on their own,
    even though their daring venture be made in the heart of a crowded city.
    It is the stout heart, m&rsquo;dears, that matters, not the place where destiny
    has set you or the manner of task to which you have been called.</p>
  <p>England is still the land of Drake, or Raleigh, of Nelson and a hundred
    other heroes and leaders of men. The spirit of progress still lives in her,
    the high endeavour, the love of adventure! Do not, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,
    allow these noble attributes of your glorious nation to be smothered beneath
    the pall of a deadening lethargy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    Romantic Radio</b> </h2>
  <p>Lud, &rsquo;tis marvellous! I vow I never dreamed of such an amazing thing!
    You may say it is all an affair of valves and grids, of coils and earths
    and aerials, of oscillation and interference. But to me it is no mere dull
    prosaic mechanical thing, but the most romantic invention in the world.</p>
  <p>It keeps you at home? Nothing romantic in that, you say? Ah, but you are
    wrong! Home is the most romantic place in existence. Your cinema will show
    you magnificent hotels, glorious flats, garish night-clubs. Interesting,
    yes; but they pale to insignificance beside a cottage kitchen warmly lighted
    by a lamp, the snowy cloth set for tea, a baby sleeping in its cot, and a
    wife welcoming her man home after the day&rsquo;s work. And in the corner
    that wonderful little box which can bring the colour and brightness of the
    great world into this simple, remote workingman&rsquo;s home.</p>
  <p>In times gone by, when there was no wireless, that same man would probably
    have gone out after his meal to a sociable evening at the village inn. No
    harm in that, of course, since the type of Englishman of whom I speak does
    not drink more than is good for him; but not much fun in it for his wife
    and the youngsters at home, was there?</p>
  <p>But since the advent of these romantic days of the wireless, that same man
    takes his glass of beer in his own arm-chair at home. He listens to beautiful
    music, clever drama, or even an interesting lecture. Between whiles he talks
    with his wife, plays with the baby or, perhaps, if he is a handy man, he
    will be able to explain to his son details about the set and how to get more
    perfect reception. Somehow a closer intimacy now exists between that man
    and his family than used to be the case. Probably, too, the money which formerly
    went on various kinds of gambling and betting will now go to the improvement
    of the wireless set and the beautifying of the home. The father of the family
    has become a home bird. Prosaic, you say? Romantic, says his wife and the
    happiness in her eyes shows which of you is right.</p>
  <p>If it is like this in the country how much more romantic is it in the big
    towns! The city clerk cannot afford to take his young wife to expensive musical
    recitals, and only rarely to the theatre or opera. But he can, and does afford
    to purchase a wireless set for her and then adds to it until it becomes a
    decorative and perfect mechanism by whose means she may listen, in the comfort
    of her own little home or flat, to Kreisler or Galli-Curci, or Chaliapin
    or Paderewski. These are gifts, indeed, and she knows it and loves him the
    more for it.</p>
  <p>In these modern times there has been an alarming tendency towards taking
    meals and amusements outisde the home, and it is this unfortunate custom
    which has largely been responsible for the great increase in divorce proceedings
    in recent years, and given ground for the statement that the British nation
    is no longer comfortable, happy and home-loving as it used to be. But since
    the romantic advent of radio, men and women alike, the very young as well
    as those of mature years, have acquired a real incentive to look on their
    homes as the place where they can find all the amusement they require as
    well as that true happiness for which we all crave on this earth.</p>
  <p>Can anyone doubt the very great romance that lies behind Senator Marconi&rsquo;s
    marvellous invention? Surely, no one who has visited one of the modern hospitals
    equipped with the latest receiving sets? Is there, indeed, anything more
    romantic than this new power of giving to the blind visions of the crowded
    stages of life, or artists&rsquo; triumphs, or gentle pastoral scenes? What
    greater romance than the soothing of pain by recalling to the sufferer&rsquo;s
    mind through the dreamy notes of a favourite song happy moments of the past
    and hopes of a brighter future to come? What is there finer than the power
    to banish the weariness from a sick bed through the stirring scenes of a
    gripping radio drama?</p>
  <p>Then think of a vessel in mid-ocean, battling against perdition, making
    a last gallant stand against the angry waves, and sending her appeal for
    help crackling through the storm-ridden air. Then think of her message being
    picked up by one ship after another, each one of which at once turns in her
    course and speeds like a grey wolf to the help of a wounded mate. The unfortunate
    sailors and passengers, slipping on sharply sloping decks, and clinging in
    agonizing despair to life, realize the romance of the radio, for without
    it the greater romance of living would for them soon come to an end.</p>
  <p>One more instance and I have done. Have you never heard of an S.O.S. message
    calling, perhaps to a son who has been out of touch with home for years&mdash;calling
    to him to come to the bedside of a sick mother or father? And having heard
    such a message and hearing subsequently that the son did come home, a still
    loved prodigal, to make a pillow of his strong arms for his dying mother,
    and did receive the kiss of forgiveness before Death closed those loving
    eyes in the last long sleep&mdash;having heard all that, I say you surely
    will not deny that one of the greatest romances of all times is the modern
    wireless.</p>
  <p>There never was such a romantic thing as this, the one and only medium that
    can offer you in your own home, without any exertion on your part, and for
    an expense so trifling as to be negligible, the music, the arts, the knowledge
    of the entire civilized world, together with the voices of the greatest artists
    and scientists to interpret them for you. A waltz from Vienna, a song from
    Coven Garden, an opera from Milan, a recitation from Berlin, or a fox-trot
    from New York&mdash;you can have which you like for a few shillings yearly
    and the turning of a knob. It is more than romantic: it is the greatest of
    all the wonders of the world.</p>

    Away To El Dorado</b> </h2>
  <p>Where are your adventures to-day? Where are your pioneers, your explorers,
    your Hudsons, your Raleighs, your Cooks? Has the love of danger and the spirit
    of daring died away altogether in this twentieth century, like a grand old
    oak dies when choked by ivy, leaving only a gnarled and naked memory of its
    former beauty? Have the clinging tendrils of the money-hunger crushed all
    the dare-devil spirit from men&rsquo;s souls, so that now the most thrilling
    risk they dare to take is a mild flutter on the 3:30 winner at half-a-crown
    each way?</p>
  <p>If it is not so, why is it that at this moment when the Colonies are crying
    out for men, and at home in England you have three million of them out of
    work, the driblet of emigrants to the El Dorado overseas is so shamefully
    meagre?</p>
  <p>I know that on reading this hundreds of statisticians will frantically rush
    to their pens and ink with the purpose of proving me hopelessly wrong. They
    will bombard me with columns of figures, produce a barrage of information
    to the effect that the Colonies just now do now want immigrants, that they
    have no room for their own people, in fact, and generally demolish me with
    final proofs that the thing for young men and women to do who are jobless
    and hopeless in England is to sit down at home, draw the dole comfortably,
    and wait for something to turn up. Which is nonsense!</p>
  <p>The thing these figure-wizards forget is that they are dealing with little
    cyphers in black on white sheets of paper. Whereas, I am arguing about men
    and women, flesh and blood and spirit, courage, high endeavour, fearlessness,
    enterprise and brawn. My emigrants&mdash;the kind the Colonies do want and
    make no secret of wanting&mdash;are what our vivid friends the Americans
    call &lsquo;go-getters&rsquo;. They are prepared to meet difficulties and
    even hardships, they are clear-sighted visionaries with a definite goal ahead,
    and they intend to get to it if human muscle and sinew and human ingenuity
    can get them there. They are the spiritual descendants of the old pioneer
    who blazed the trail in the olden days across Africa, Australia and America.</p>
  <p>Never before has the wider world offered such a variety of opportunities.
    Of course it does not want wastrels, won&rsquo;t-works and failures&mdash;it
    is not just a vast office, warming up comfortable seats for the folk the
    Old Country has no use for. But it does want men&mdash;real men and real
    women&mdash;and for them it holds out the most glittering rewards in money,
    fame and happiness.</p>
  <p>Moreover, jobs to-day are easier than they were even a few years ago. Hewing
    of wood and drawing of water are no longer the beginning and end of a pioneer&rsquo;s
    life. There is room for professional men in their thousands, for traders,
    for business men, for manufacturers, for policemen, for porters, in fact,
    for every possible branch of labour. But these men must be the best of their
    kind and, unless they are still young enough and willing to learn, they must
    be efficient craftsmen or practitioners before they think of going overseas.</p>
  <p>But once out there they can go ahead and achieve all the success they can
    possibly wish for. At home every trade and profession is so overcrowded that
    only men of exceptional ability can make (say) a thousand pounds a year.
    But one man I read of recently went from a little west country town to Australia
    four years ago, at the age of eighteen, took up a small Government concession
    of land on the usual condition that he cleared it in a specified time, cut
    and sold the timber from it, ploughed and sowed the fields, took in more
    land, began employing others, and now after these four years he has built
    himself a homestead and is not only very prosperous, but well on the road
    to becoming a rich man. But then he is a <i>man</i>&mdash;the sort of man
    to whom in the old days my League was always open. Despite the recent Australian
    financial and labour troubles, he made his way surely and steadily and gave
    the lie to the Dismal Jimmies who are always telling modern young people
    to stay at home and do nothing.</p>
  <p>Take that other great country&mdash;Canada. Faith! there must be something
    very stimulating in the air of the great prairies, for I have met young men
    and women out there who came from the Old Country, but who had suddenly shed,
    as if by magic, the cloak of supineness and discontent which some of you
    are so fond of wrapping round you. You go over the great lakes in one of
    the luxurious C.P.R. boats, and I&rsquo;ll vow that you&rsquo;ll be struck
    at once with the smartness and the quiet, elegant manners of the young men
    and women who wait upon you in the dining-hall, the tea-room and your cabin.
    Unless you feel exceptionally morose you will enter into conversation with
    that fair-haired young steward who has such shapely hands and wears such
    nice clean linen. And he will tell you that he is a University student at
    Toronto, that his father is a barrister or doctor or parson in the Old Country
    with not enough money to spend on University education for his sons; so he&mdash;the
    eldest of the bunch&mdash;came out to Canada with a few pounds in his pocket,
    and pays his &rsquo;Varsity fees himself with money which he earns during
    vacation time at any job that comes his way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then when you land from the boat, as likely as not, the porter who carries
    your bag and to whom you give a fifty cents&rsquo; tip, is the son of an
    archdeacon or the grandson of an Earl; and the chambermaid at your hotel
    will turn out to be the daughter of that Lady Alice Something or the Hon.
    Mrs. Something-else whom you met in London society. These young people out
    there do not consider for a moment that by their work they have come down
    in the social world. In the rarefied atmosphere of the Rockies work of any
    sort or kind is just the means of earning money&mdash;money that can be expended
    in education or amusement or lightening the burdens of the old people at
    home.</p>
  <p>I have been vastly amused recently by reading in your newspapers various
    letters of protest on the subject of domestic servants. They themselves&mdash;some
    of them&mdash;call their occupation degrading, and I am sorry to see that
    in this ridiculous attitude they are backed by educated women who should
    know better. Degrading? Heavens above! no work efficiently done for wage
    loyally earned can possibly be degrading. Whether you wear a becoming white
    cap or whether you don&rsquo;t, you are doing the one thing that ennobles
    every character and heightens self-respect&mdash;work. You might as well
    argue that there is degradation in wearing the King&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
  <p>It is the spirit that enters a man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s soul out there
    in the great primitive countries that we who love our tight little Island
    would like to see at home.</p>
  <p>Suppose I&mdash;even I, your old friend the Scarlet Pimpernel&mdash;had
    to carve my fortune to-day. Suppose I was still very young, but without the
    wealth which enabled me to satisfy my craving for adventure by pitting my
    wits against the tigers of the French Revolution, what would I do to save
    myself from dying of <i>ennui</i>? Would I, do you suppose, sit down and
    draw my dole, making no effort to gain more from life than ease and two square
    meals a day? Would I be content never to risk my precious self a yard away
    from the apron-strings of my Mother Country? Faith! I trust not.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll tell you where I&rsquo;d be. I&rsquo;d pack myself off steerage
    on one of those emigrant ships which I have seen gliding so smoothly down
    the Clyde or the Thames; I&rsquo;d crave leave to join that gallant company
    of youth who, when chances look unpromising over here, set their faces boldly
    towards the East, the West, the North or the South, to go out (as bravely
    as ever my friends Tony and Ffoulkes went out to France with me) to meet
    high adventure wherever it may be found, and to carry the pioneer spirit&mdash;the
    old spirit of Mother England&mdash;to the most distant corners of the earth.</p>
  <p>Your ancestors&mdash;those sturdy soldiers of fortune of past centuries&mdash;must
    look with pride on their children&rsquo;s children, I&rsquo;ll warrant, when
    an emigrant ship sets off so gaily from the quayside. Maybe she is only a
    rusty old tramp, but to the ghosts of the trapper and trader of old she is
    as gallant as the <i>Mayflower</i> or the <i>Revenge</i>. Her passengers
    seem to you and to me no more than raw youths and disappointed men, but the
    spirit of Hawkins and Grenville call a welcome to the blood-brothers of their
    long-dead shipmates, to those who sought with them in the days that are gone
    the land of El Dorado that lay beyond the uncharted seas.</p>
  <p>And at least the emigrants are better adventurers than many of their critics,
    who shiver and draw closer to their fireside at home, and shake doleful heads
    wisely over the chances and risks which those emigrants are ready to dare,
    but which the critics themselves are too supine and fearful to face.</p>

    The Romance Of Patriotism</b> </h2>
  <p>This is a critical moment, m&rsquo;dears, in the history of the country
    we all love so well; indeed, it is a time of danger, or doubt and difficulty
    for all the world. And for this evil there is only one cure&mdash;a great
    and ennobling patriotism which will stimulate the citizens of every nation
    into serving their own country bravely and selflessly, and will inspire every
    country throughout the world to encourage and to be of help to its neighbour.</p>
  <p>Above all, it is imperative that England shall stand firm in the midst of
    this world of gloom and of doubt. For three hundred years and more all the
    nations have looked upon England as a small boy does on his big brother&mdash;sometimes
    with anger, sometimes with enmity, even with envy, but always with a certain
    sense of hero-worship. Spain straddled the world like a Colossus till the
    roll of Drake&rsquo;s drum sounded her death-knell; the shadow of Bonaparte
    darkened all Europe till a little one-armed sailor with a copybook maxim
    knocked out the keystone of the bogey-man&rsquo;s edifice of power; Germany&rsquo;s
    irresistable might, marshalled for the destruction of her rivals, was broken
    by the Old Bills of &lsquo;Frenches&rsquo; contemptible little army&rsquo;!</p>
  <p>But England, m&rsquo;dears, has a chink in her armour, an Achilles heel
    into which Fate will plant a poisoned dart one day. It is her strength as
    well as her weakness&mdash;the thing that beat the Kaiser as well as that
    which may presently rend the Union Jack to shreds. England&rsquo;s foreign
    friends are wont to say to her: &lsquo;You English, you must always have
    your grumble. In war it was your plum-and-apple jam; in peace it is your
    Government. And now when the world is staggering, will you just go on grumbling
    and waiting for things to come right in the end? Because that way lies ruin
    for England,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;and ruin for England would be a deadly
    blow for the rest of the world.&rsquo; But remember, my friends, that there
    is still one thing which in this terrible and grave crisis can and will save
    our beloved country from utter collapse. It is the romance of patriotism.
    The sailor may forget the sea, the wooer may forget his love, but is there
    a Frenchman to this day who does not thrill at the sound of the name of Napolean,
    or an American whose eyes do not flash when he listens to the &lsquo;Star-Spangled
    Banner&rsquo;? And, believe me, that there is no Briton worthy of the name
    whose heart fails to beat a little faster while he hears around him, or joins
    in intoning, the lusty strains of &lsquo;God Save our King&rsquo;!</p>
  <p>Other nations are apt to say that there is very little real patriotism in
    England; that her peoples are nothing but a community of huckstering shopkeepers
    whose only thought is for their tills. In answer to this lying statement
    I would ask this question: &lsquo;Who were those who marched singing and
    jesting into the inferno of Flanders mud in 1914?&rsquo; Were they mere money-grubbers?
    And was it the worship of Mammon that caused the glorious names of Ramillies
    or Blenheim, of Corunna, Trafalgar or Rorke&rsquo;s Drift and a score of
    others&mdash;names now almost illegible through the dust of ages&mdash;to
    be recorded on the tattered regimental banners which hang in St. Paul&rsquo;s
    Cathedral or at Windsor?</p>
  <p>Abroad one often hears the remark&mdash;&rsquo;As safe as the Bank of England.&rsquo;  Is
    not that the finest tribute that could be paid to the patriotism of our people
    to the trustworthiness and reliability which characterize our race? Wherever
    you may go you will find that English credit stands high. Even to-day, when
    England is fighting a grim battle to uphold her financial predominance in
    the world, her commercial good name has never once been questioned.</p>
  <p>Facing the greatest crisis in her history&mdash;one which is in many ways
    more strenuous than that of 1914&mdash;Britain astounds the emotional Frenchman
    and the stern German by her <i>sang-froid</i>, by making light of what she
    calls unncessary fuss, and by declaring that everything will come out all
    right in the end. That is her usual attitude. Her patriotism during this
    crisis takes the same form of fearlessness as it did whenever she was called
    to arms, of reluctance to talk heroics, of indulging neither in lamentations
    nor in boastful tirades, only in an occasional grumble before turning resolutely
    to the task of reconstruction.</p>
  <p>So far so good. But in this world of interdependent relationships and interwoven
    commerce, credit, m&rsquo;dears, and international trust are essential to
    the safety of every country. And I am afraid that your apparent indifference
    to the imminence of the peril, your casual grumbles and scornful pooh-poohs
    are shaking foreign confidence in Britain, and engendering the fear that
    such an easy-going nation as you are will never have the energy to pull through
    so serious a crisis as the present one appears to be.</p>
  <p>The time has come, my friends, for your patriotism to take on a new form:
    that of showing a more determined, aye, a graver face to the world, and of
    indicating by word as well as by action that Britain is able to stand firm
    and erect even in her present trouble. Paris, New York, Berlin, are all of
    them watching you anxiously. On their impressions of you much of Britain&rsquo;s
    immediate prosperity depends. World credit is a thing which rests entirely
    on that elusive factor&mdash;confidence. So now I ask you is this not the
    time for John Bull to take off his coat and give the whole world proof of
    his ability to face trouble?</p>
  <p>It is no use just indulging in a drowsy grumble; the citizens of Pompeii
    doubtless grumbled when they were first warned that their city was threatened
    by a volcanic eruption, for excavations have proved that they were taken
    wholly unaware. England to-day is far more seriously threatened than they
    were. Then why should we not give to the rest of the world proof of what
    we know well in our heart of hearts: that our country is well able to take
    care of herself and ready to meet her troubles and to face hard facts? Not
    only is this attitude vital to our own existence, but to the safety and comfort
    of the whole world. For if England falls she would not go down alone, but
    would drag half the world with her in a Titanic collapse. Never truer than
    to-day were the words of the poet:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Who stands if England fall?<br>
Who dies if England live?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And yet, side by side with the sublime romance of true patriotism&mdash;and
    what I have said applies to other countries as well as to England&mdash;there
    is the danger of fanatical enthusiasm. Patriotism in its best and truest
    sense means putting the interests of one&rsquo;s country before one&rsquo;s
    own, doing one&rsquo;s utmost to make its name synonymous with peace, justice,
    courtesy and power, and upholding its dignity before all other nations. It
    is not, and never was, a sort of excuse for trumpet-blowing and sabre-rattling;
    it does not condone that awful and inexcusable thing&mdash;war. But of this
    more anon. Faith! I cannot bear even to breathe the words of <i>romance</i> and <i>patriotism</i> in
    connexion with that hideous blot on your civilization of to-day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The Worst Blot On Your Civilization</b> </h2>
  <p>Can you doubt for a moment what it is? Does not every thoughtful man and
    woman cry out against war, that hydra-headed monster which has dragged on
    its hated existence for centuries after other outrages and brutalities have
    been banished from the earth? War, the suicide of weak nations and the poisoner
    of strong ones; war the useless, costly incubus for the fattening and training
    of which hundred of millions of pounds are wasted annually, while the poor
    and the diseased in every great city in Europe are clamouring, often unavailingly,
    for food or medical care!</p>
  <p>In my day we thought war a romantic thing. Men hastened to don picturesque
    uniforms, to take sword and march in the wake of their country&rsquo;s banner.
    We took up arms in defence of other nations, for war to us meant a game,
    and a game in which there were definite rules to be observed. It was a game
    that had to be played fairly and, like any other game, it was usually enjoyed
    by the players.</p>
  <p>The rival armies fought in the age-old method, hand to hand. The battle
    went to the strong, to those who could best endure the physical strain, or
    who possessed enough cunning to outwit the enemy. Let me recall to your mind
    the history of the capture of Quebec. It was not bloodshed and slaughter
    that won that glorious day. It was sheer recklessness and mother wit. Wolfe&rsquo;s
    men rowed with muffled oars over the wide St. Lawrence, silently they scaled
    the well-nigh inaccessible Heights of Abraham and, taking the French garrison
    wholly by surprise, they forced the citadel to surrender.</p>
  <p>But modern warfare is a demmed unpleasant thing, my friends, and it is one
    of the few things in your twentieth-century civilization that I heartily
    dislike. Private quarrels are no longer settled by poisoned daggers or mailed
    fists. Why, then, do nations&mdash;presumably led by the keenest brains amongst
    them&mdash;rush to blows like quarrelsome navvies whenever their complacency
    is slightly disturbed?</p>
  <p>Wars would cease to be if the man in the street had real control of affairs,
    such as democratic governments fatuously pretend that he has! Ask any man
    you meet whether he wants to get into uniform and go out into the muddy,
    bloody trenches, or patrol the seas, waiting to be blown to pieces by a mine
    or a torpedo! Not he! He is patriot enough to do it without a murmur when
    his country calls, but what he wants is peace. Ask any woman what she thinks
    of war: it is more manifestly cruel to women, perhaps, than it is to men.
    Watch her agony of mind and heart when she thinks of her husband or sons
    in hourly danger of death by shell-fire or poison gas, of her young children
    dying, perhaps, for want of food. Watch the women&rsquo;s agony, and know
    then the hideous blot of your otherwise wonderful civilization.</p>
  <p>It is all so wasteful nowadays! A great battleship is built to-day, champagne
    wets her bows, she slides down the slipway amid thunderous cheers, and the
    crowd who the pageant gives a sigh of appreciation at the grandeur and beauty
    of it all. To-morrow, or in a couple of years, what is she? In peace an out-of-date
    scrap heap, superseded by vessels of newer design and carrying millions of
    the nation&rsquo;s money with her to the breaker&rsquo;s yard; in war a shell-torn,
    twisted, burning Hell, in which wounded and dying cry out in their last agony.</p>
  <p>The guns, the tanks, the cases of rifles, the gay or sober uniforms&mdash;what
    happens to them? Progress, unable to sweep away war, ruthlessly casts them
    from her as she has cast aside the bow and the muzzle-loader and the pike;
    and once again vast fortunes are dribbled away which might have been used
    for furthering the welfare of mankind.</p>
  <p>You call your ministers by such obsolete titles as &lsquo;The Secretary
    of State for War&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Lords of the Admirality&rsquo;, and so
    on. When will a generation arise that has the sense to elect a Government
    which will appoint a &lsquo;Secretary of State for Peace&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Lord
    of the Merchant Service&rsquo;?</p>
  <p>You still speak of war as if it were a glorious thing. It is not! The men
    who saw their friends smashed and poisoned in Flanders mud, diseased in prison
    camps, and freezing in the North Sea&mdash;they saw this so-called noble
    thing at first hand, and somehow the death&rsquo;s head that it really is,
    was, for them, stripped of the bunting in which it wraps itself, and stood
    out in all its horror and bestiality. Civilization has made of the old, clean
    fighting between man and man a horrible struggle in which millions of men
    are sacrificed to the monster of mechanical death and mutilation, and that
    monster is the product of this otherwise wonderful age.</p>
  <p>At all times there have been scoffers, and I make no doubt that they would
    say to-day that a world in which war would never find a place would no doubt
    be ideal, but that there are at least two objections to permanent compulsory
    peace. One is that army men who are trained to fighting would have nothing
    to do; and the second that peace-loving nations would have no protection
    against aggressive or greedy ones if their armed forces were entirely disbanded.
    Now I would contend that neither objection is worth a moment&rsquo;s consideration.
    Could not the same organization now employed for the training of armies and
    the equipment of navies be turned to civil uses as state organizations for
    providing work instead of state weapons for purposes of butchery? Millions
    of money would thus be saved every year which are now spent on battleships,
    fighting equipment, and all the rest of the arms&rsquo; departments which
    would then be no longer needed. As for the insecurity of nations, why not
    further strengthen the hands and increase the power of the League of Nations
    so as to make it really an International clearing court for the settling
    of International disputes? And this could be easily done by organizing an
    international police, or <i>gendarmerie</i>, a combined force whose duty
    would be the same as that of the usual police force in every country, only
    on a grand scale; namely, to see that the dictates of the clearing court
    are acted upon and, if necessary, to enforce obedience to the laws.</p>
  <p>If this could be done peace would be assured for all time. And let it be
    the task of your generation to see that it comes about now that the world
    is so heartily sick of wars. A great statesman said recently that it is a &lsquo;far
    more difficult thing to make peace than to make war&rsquo;! Egad! it is.
    But civilization <i>must</i> have peace if all your modern progress, of which
    you are so justly proud, is not to end in chaos. Emphatically, the greatest
    blot on your marvellous advancement towards perfection is that war is still
    possible. And yet it means blood, tears, hatred, murder, robbery, whole-sale
    destruction and unappeasable sorrow...</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    The Glamour Of Old Things</b> </h2>
  <p>Egad! you will write me down a croaker if I continue in the same strain.
    So, by your leave, we&rsquo;ll turn our backs on the horrors of war now and
    look once more on the beauty, the gentleness, the romance in which your twentieth
    century is so rich.</p>
  <p>So let us begin by talking about old things and old places: pictures, furniture,
    Queen Anne houses, Jacobean mantelpieces and Grinling-Gibbons carvings. What
    is there in them that lends them such glamour and a witchery more alluring
    than diamonds or pearls or a heavy banking account? I forget who wrote the
    lines:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Laces and ivory, silks and gold,<br>
    Need not be new.<br>
    And there is healing in old trees;<br>
Old roads a glamour hold.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>but they are strikingly true. It is just this inexplicable glamour of age
    which turns your quiet and respectable citizen into a fierce collector of
    pictures, first editions, furniture, armour, and all manner of things that
    are of no practical use to him. You will see him in the sale-room with eyes
    flashing wrath when he sees some dusty treasure pass into the hands of a
    rival collector; and this in defiance of the commandment which enjoins him
    not to covet his neighbour&rsquo;s goods.</p>
  <p>His eyes flash, did I say? Faith! but your fanatical collector of antiques
    can look as grim and as bloodthirsty as did those collectors of &lsquo;aristos&rsquo; &rsquo;
    heads in the troubled Paris of my day.</p>
  <p>What is it that gives old things a charm far beyond that of the glittering
    gew-gaws of to-day? You may as well ask why the sunlight surpasses in splendour
    this demmed new flood-lighting of yours. Is it not a fact, m&rsquo;dears,
    that when you stand in an ancient cathedral or look on the canvas of a long-dead
    masterhand you feel a thrill of wonder&mdash;almost of awe&mdash;which is
    absent when, for instance, you gaze on modern London or Paris, on the new
    luxury hotels and palaces and the new dwellings on the river where Hammersmith
    was lovely long ago?</p>
  <p>There are certain qualities which undoubtedly lend enchantment to old things,
    be they works of art, buildings or what you will.</p>
  <p>Firstly, there is the impression of loving care with which those ancient
    works of art were fashioned. The canvases, statuary or buildings which you
    treasure to-day as supreme examples of your predecessor&rsquo;s art are instinct
    with life and feeling because the artists who created them made each one
    of a definite and worthy part of his life&rsquo;s works. They were great
    men, those craftsmen of old, who understood that it is more blessed to give
    than to receive; and so they caught and imprisoned for posterity impressions
    of beauty, of strength and of wonder while the world about them clamoured
    for more material, quicker, more ephemeral things. By gad! I remember in
    the old days how the dandies of my time collected lovely objects. We filled
    our houses with beautiful things, Tudor and Jacobean silver, delicate, fragile
    china from Worcester or from France, and filmy lace from Mechlin. And now
    you collect my snuff-boxes and Tony&rsquo;s wine-glasses. The world has not
    changed over-much since then!</p>
  <p>Partly, this longing to collect beautiful or rare old things is due to hero-worship,
    which causes you moderns to feel that the possession of, say, an authentic
    manuscript of Shakespeare or some other great writer of the past is worth
    striving for, even though this may mean a financial sacrifice, the expenditure
    of money which took years, perhaps, of patient toil to save. But deep down
    in the bottom of your hearts you are ready to admit that these mighty geniuses
    understood not only their own age, but, prophetically, mine also and yours.
    They penned the words, faded now, which you are willing to purchase just
    as we purchased them in our days&mdash;because you know that those words
    were written by them with an inspired pen and that they were written not
    only for their contemporaries but for you who are living now.</p>
  <p>In the same way you are conscious of a desire to own the wares for which
    the artists and potters of their day had perhaps failed to find a market;
    you want to own them because their creators call to you over the gulf of
    centuries, and do so in the immortal and universal language of art&mdash;a
    language which education is helping the world to understand more fully every
    day.</p>
  <p>And then again, old things emphasize the value of leisure and of peace.
    You moderns are far too apt to glory in the fact that you can, by dint of
    turmoil and unease, crowd more action into one day than your fathers could
    into two. It is a passing phase, for you gain nothing by losing your appreciation
    of leisure. Old things, by their very contrast, recall you to the fact that
    while work may be a very good thing, the sense of peace which they bring
    is equally good.</p>
  <p>Lastly, there is your appreciation of the value of detail in the great works
    of art of the past and the influence of minute factors. If you study a picture
    by Vermeer or a book by Chaucer you constantly come upon fresh evidence of
    the loving care with which the artist or the writer conveyed to the insensate
    vehicle of his thought the vivid sensitiveness of his own master-touch. You
    learn to appreciate the thoroughness which brought about the exquisite results.</p>
  <p>And so you love old things because they possess qualities which are not
    of your age, and are therefore but rarely met with. In spite of the modern
    wonders of your era, in spite of the beauty of the world to-day, you love
    the old beauty still, the beauty of Shakespeare and of Keats, of Sir Peter
    Lely and Gainsborough. Accustomed as you may be to the varying contours and
    charms of the ladies of to-day, you still love to feast your eyes on the
    types of feminine beauty which Reynolds used to paint, and the vagaries of
    the naughty Lady Hamilton are forgotten beneath the magic of Romney&rsquo;s
    immortal brush.</p>
  <p>You have your cinema to-day, which shows you on the same evening events
    that happened but a few hours ago and even goes so far as to reproduce the
    sound that accompanied them; but all the same, you are not averse to lingering
    over the beautiful word-pictures which Addison and Swift drew of their slow-moving
    contemporary life.</p>
  <p>All things are welcome by contrast with others, and you hustling, bustling
    people of to-day enjoy the constrast afforded by ancient calm and perfect
    craftsmanship. And in my own time it was just the same; never did I enjoy
    the peace and sweetness of my Richmond gardens so keenly as I did after I
    had been shouting: &lsquo;<i>A la Lanterne!&rsquo; </i>with the worst of
    them, clad in a grimy coal-heaver&rsquo;s rags in the cobbled streets of
    old Paris.</p>
  <p>And yet . . . Oddsfish! &rsquo;tis a curious reflection, my friends, that
    we never appreciate beauty to the full until it is beyond our reach. Looking
    back on the England of my own times, it seems to me a dream of Paradise;
    and yet see how I used to skip across the Channel in search of adventure
    which would whet my appetite for the joys of home.</p>
  <p>To me your modern England is every whit as beautiful as was mine in its
    day. But you, my faith! find it unbeautiful and dull. You prefer to sit in
    a Hepplewhite chair, turn your toes to an Adam mantlepiece and, forgetting
    all the marvels of to-day, peruse the record of my adventures among that
    howling Paris mob.</p>
  <p>Gadzooks, my friends, what fools we mortals be!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    A Word On The Importance Of Universal Goodwill</b> </h2>
  <p>Of course, modern war is intolerable. Had we in mine own time ever visualized
    such a nightmare we should have spent days and weeks in sack-cloth and ashes
    trying to think out a means by which it could be averted; certainly we would
    never have tolerated it. That you moderns, boastful of your progress, should
    do so is almost unbelievable, all the more so when one remembers how interdependent
    you nations are in the world of to-day.</p>
  <p>A century ago it mattered little to England, as far at least as comforts
    were concerned, whether she fought with the Frenchman or the Spaniard or
    the Russian. Cognac, cigars, snuff and caviare were no less plentiful because
    of a battle or two. Faith! we&rsquo;d have thought demmed unkindly of a war
    that robbed us of these pleasant necessities of life. But your modern wars&mdash;gadzooks,
    my friends! ye tighten your belts at the very outset and by the time the
    armistice is sounded you&rsquo;re scarce more than miserable shadows of your
    former comely selves. Hunger, privation, sickness, sorrow, starving children,
    your wives deprived of every comfort that makes life and them charming&mdash;all
    these horrors can be avoided if half the world lived in amity with the other
    half.</p>
  <p>For the interdependence of the world of to-day has become a serious question.
    In my day Great Britain was, if not absolutely self-supporting, at least
    well able to provide for all her children at a pinch without suffering the
    miseries of food shortage or the intolerable discomforts of margarine and
    cotten stockings. But to-day matters are very different. When you get your
    cotten from America, your wood from Norway, your meat from the Argentine,
    your fruit and vegetables from France, your flour from Russia, your butter
    and eggs from Denmark, you are in a demmed awkward fix, my friends, when
    you are fighting. Even if your scattered Empire was able to provide you with
    all the food you need you would scarce be better off when half the seas are
    closed to your ships.</p>
  <p>Therefore the only wise thing to do is to be good friends with your neighbours;
    not only by word of mouth and in the columns of newspapers, but in reality.
    And to attain this happy object you must try and understand one another better.
    In the past mutual understanding was very difficult. There were no such things
    as travelling facilities. Your rich young bloods were the only ones who were
    able to make what was known as the Grand Tour; they would go to France, to
    Italy perhaps, to Spain hardly ever; but as they spoke no language but their
    own and travelled with a retinue of lackeys and horses and carriages so that
    they never were forced to look after themselves, it was but little they ever
    understood of the countries which they visited. As for the rest of the social
    world in England, the average Briton of his day, the man in the street, in
    fact, looked upon himself as the salt of the earth and upon all foreigners
    as its scum, to be despised if England was at peace with their outlandish
    country, or thrashed if they dared to go to war.</p>
  <p>And, mind you, this attitude of mind in your tight little Island persisted
    well into the Victorian, the Edwardian, even the Georgian era. Shall I not
    be stating a truism when I say that but for it you would never have been
    dragged into that abominable war? With sound understanding of all the nations
    who started that abysmal quarrel you would have exerted your diplomacy and
    your tact to better effect, and brought about reconciliation. But I must
    not talk to you about politics which have always been outside my province.
    My propaganda is only for love and peace.</p>
  <p>Now that you have shaken off the more recent nightmare of national bankruptcy
    and once more feel hope for your country&rsquo;s future and determination
    to aid her where you can, do not in Heaven&rsquo;s name fall back into the
    archaic attitude of despising your neighbours. Think yourselves the salt
    of the earth by all means, but remember that there is salt in other countries
    besides your own.</p>
  <p>No nation to-day can exist without purchasing or borrowing something from
    its neighbours; be it articles of food or of commerce, or the product of
    the brains of its great men and great artists. In all the sciences and in
    all the arts you are interdependent and obviously you must be good friends
    with the man from whom you borrow. It has been said more than once that if
    a man is sick he should go to Germany to be diagnosed, to France to be operated
    on, to England to be nursed. For the past three years you, who possess artistic
    souls, have revelled in the masterpieces of Italy, of Holland and of France
    which have been brought over to your country at great risk and expense for
    your delectation. You can enjoy to-day the admirable photo-plays from America,
    from Germany and from France. The cost of travelling has been so reduced
    that you can cross over to Belgium or to France more easily than in my time
    one could go from London to Brighton.</p>
  <p>And, above all, you have lived in comradeship through four terrible years
    and learned all there was to know of the courage, the endurance, the patriotism
    of those by whose side you fought&mdash;aye! I&rsquo;ll even venture to add
    that you have seen all there was to admire in your enemies.</p>
  <p>Hang on to that thread of amity, m&rsquo;dears! Do not allow it to snap
    in the turmoil of politics and the noise of agitators. Polemics, I know,
    assert that the virtues of courage, endurance and self-sacrifice are only
    kept alive by wars; that in time of prosperity and of peace there is no opportunity
    for the exercise of those wonderful qualities; but I say that such an argument
    is arrant nonsense. Need I quote instances? Captain Oates, whose deed of
    selfless valour, I, for one, cannot hear recounted without feeling a lump
    in my throat. And what about all those doctors&mdash;there are many of them&mdash;who
    in the pursuit of science have seen their limbs wither away in disease, and
    even then have carried on until death put an end to their sublime self-sacrifice.
    Go to a pit-head when there has been an explosion, and see the miners go
    down into what must be hell to try and rescue their comrades. Watch the lifeboat
    in a storm.</p>
  <p>And these virtues, m&rsquo;dears, these evidences of courage and self-sacrifice
    you will find in every nation. Men are men all the world over, and women
    of every country have been as heroic as the men. Do not sneer at their faults;
    you have plenty of your own. Try and understand their little ways even if
    they seem strange to you at first. You can admire their virtues because you
    are generous to a fault; then hold out your hand to them in friendship: it
    will redound to your credit throughout the centuries that are to come if
    you are the first in these troublous times to cast aside pique and misunderstandings
    and, eschewing every quarrel, act up to the gospel of universal love.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    To the Ladies&mdash;God Bless &rsquo;Em!</b> </h2>
  <p>Call me impertinent, put me down an ass for daring to broach the subject,
    but listen to me all the same. You see I had a French wife. I lived, as you
    know, for many years in France. I met people of all nations during my adventurous
    life and, in your ear, dear ladies, I made love to your adorable sex whenever
    and wherever any of you deigned to smile on me. So, I entreat you, to give
    me credit for knowing something of the subject about which I wish to speak.</p>
  <p>How often have I heard English girls, Scottish girls&mdash;girls, in fact,
    of Great and Greater Brtain&mdash;laugh, none too kindly sometimes, at the
    peculiarities of their foreign sisters. &lsquo;French women don&rsquo;t wash,&rsquo; or &lsquo;German
    women are dowdy,&rsquo;  or &lsquo;Italians reek of garlic&rsquo; are generalities
    which one hears emitted on every side, mostly, I&rsquo;ll admit, by those
    whose foreign experiences are confined to Boulogne or Ostend.</p>
  <p>Mind you, when I am on the other side of the Channel I hear the same generalities: &lsquo;English
    women can&rsquo;t cook!&rsquo; or &lsquo;They have eight-seven kinds of religion
    and only one kind of sauce&rsquo; and &lsquo;They have no idea how to wear
    their clothes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And it is against these fatuous generalizations that I would like to enter
    a vigorous protest. I am at one with you, m&rsquo;dears, in deeming my own
    countrywomen the cream of the earth, but do you know why that is? Simply
    because I understand them better than I do the beautiful creatures of other
    countries. Though I have travelled far and wide I was born and bred among
    my own people: from childhood I have romped and played with little British
    girls. I know their virtues and their foibles and love them for both&mdash;so
    do you.</p>
  <p>You know, for instance, that not the finest chef abroad can cook fish, or
    game, or fry bacon better than, what is sarcastically termed, &lsquo;a good
    plain cook&rsquo;  over here. You walk down any part of London&mdash;whether
    it be Bond Street, Kensington High Street or Kilburn or Hammersmith, and
    you see just as many smart young girls tripping along as you do in Paris
    or in Vienna. You are conscious of these things, and so when you hear of
    any disparaging remarks made about you by a foreigner you just shrug your
    pretty shoulders and say to yourself: &lsquo;How ignorant those dagoes are!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Well, m&rsquo;dears, that is where I come to the pith of my argument. The
    elaborate bathrooms which are to be found in your homes of to-day, the delicious
    baths in which you revel night and morning are, of course, delightful adjuncts
    to your comfort and love of luxury, and they are hygienic as well as cleanly.
    In provincial France or Italy such a luxury is unknown except in the homes
    of the wealthy. Girls like yourselves have to perform tragedies in five acts
    over a wash-hand basin night and morning instead of revelling in a bath perfumed
    with crystals. But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Victorian axiom: &lsquo;English
    people are clean, foreigners are dirty!&rsquo;  is true. Even the poorest
    Italian <i>contadina</i> in her cottage has every one of her mattresses and
    pillows taken to pieces and recarded every year. In every village in Italy
    or in France you see the men outside the meanest-looking cottage doing that
    work. Now, the Scotch claim to be the cleanest amongst all other British-born
    people, but even they would be deemed very dirty by Italian, German or French
    housewives for omitting this elementary dictate of cleanliness.</p>
  <p>That, m&rsquo;dears, is only one instance of how the whole question of virtue
    or of sin is just a matter of point of view. In a theatre or a cinema we
    all laugh at the antics of a man who has had too much to drink. In France
    or in Italy such antics would not raise a smile. They only create disgust.
    This was very much exemplified in our immortal Charlie&rsquo;s latest film &lsquo;City
    Lights&rsquo;. English people who went to see it in Paris were delighted
    with the scenes were Charlie has had much too much champagne; the French
    audience liked the sentimental part of the film, but did not tolerate the
    rest.</p>
  <p>It is all a question of the point of view, also of education; and if only
    you dear, lovely things would try to see your foreign sisters&rsquo; point
    of view your men-folk, who all take their cue from you, would quickly follow
    suit. The universal goodwill which we all feel is the essence of our future
    prosperity, must begin with the little things of this world, with mutual
    understanding of one another&rsquo;s failings, the little idiosyncrasies
    which after all make up the characteristics of each individual nation, and
    which are therefore objects of keen interest and not of derision.</p>
  <p>Why not acknowledge that though our race is, in our estimation, the chosen
    one of God, men of other nations have just the same love for their own land.
    To most Latins an Englishwoman&rsquo;s beauty is insipid. To most Englishmen
    an Italian or a Frenchwoman is not what he calls wholesome. Nature made us
    all different from one another, and there is a quaint proverb in Roumanian
    which says that: &lsquo;Mr. Frog thinks Mrs. Frog the most beautiful thing
    that God ever made.&rsquo; And that is what you want, m&rsquo;dears: a better
    understanding of &lsquo;Mr. Frog&rsquo;s&rsquo; point of view. You want comradeship
    these days, not isolation. The world has changed since my time. The most
    terrible cataclysm your modern world has known has taught you one thing and
    did it through blood and tears: it is that human nature is at bottom the
    same all the world over: men and women wherever they were born have the same
    ideals, the same appreciation of what is good, virtuous and beautiful. It
    is only a slight variation of temprament that divides one neighbour from
    another.</p>
  <p>It is up to you to bridge that division over.</p>

    Is Love A Dry Business Nowadays?</b> </h2>
  <p>Is it genuine or merely a pose, this attitude adopted by you moderns whenever
    the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; occurs in real life or in fiction? You will have
    it that love, as apart from what you are pleased nowadays to call &lsquo;sex-appeal&rsquo;,
    either never existed save in the imagination of medieval romanticists, or
    if it ever did that it is long since dead, bereft of any savour or thrill.</p>
  <p>Frankly, you would make me laugh, all of you young things of this amazing
    country, if this attitude of yours were not so demmed tragic. Do you mean
    to tell me, m&rsquo;dears, that amongst your charming, sleek-headed, bright-eyed
    girls of to-day there are no Juliets, or Francescas or Helo&iuml;ses, and
    that you have disarmed Don Cupid, broken his golden arrows and tied him down,
    like some dry-as-dust old clerk, to a desk in a City office? Faith! that
    would be a daring thing to do, for there is more power in the little god&rsquo;s
    arrows, even though they be broken, than in your most up-to-date, most deadly
    shrapnel. And, as I told you once before, he will have his revenge.</p>
  <p>Only the other day at one of your smart cock-and-hen clubs I overheard a
    general discussion between a bevy of those same sleek-headed, carefully lip-sticked
    young Dianas on the respective merits of the men who had been foolish enough
    to make love to them. They were appraising the methods these unfortunates
    had used in order to pierce their armour of feminine scepticism, and one
    and all found these methods wanting&mdash;wanting in what? I asked myself,
    and tried to disentangle the truth out of this medley of disappointments
    and discontent, which lent to those bright eyes a look of boredom&mdash;aye!
    and of age. Anyway, they all decided, over clouds of cigarette smoke, that &lsquo;love&rsquo; as
    spoken of by the great writers of the past was only  &lsquo;gammon&rsquo;&mdash;I
    believe they called it &lsquo;rot&rsquo;; and that the roseate thing of fiction
    was only a dry business after all.</p>
  <p>And presently when these lovely young creatures had all fluttered away like
    so many butterflies, in order to alight on the high stools of the nearest
    American Bar, I fell to wondering whether there was not something of truth
    in what they said, and whether they themselves were not allowing something
    of the glamour of love to fade into the smoke of their cigarettes, or lie
    dim and savourless at the bottom of their cocktail-glasses.</p>
  <p>Thus musing I bethought me of the caveman. His manners were somewhat unpolished,
    shall we say, but nevertheless he had that certain dominating quality which
    the terse language of to-day has designated as &lsquo;It&rsquo;. I am sure,
    though we have no records of his home life, that he knew how to make love&mdash;rather
    fiercely I should say&mdash;to his unsophisticated womankind.</p>
  <p>Nor were the sybaritic or athletic Greeks and Romans backward in such words
    and deeds as would flutter any maiden&rsquo;s heart. And so one might go
    on throughout the ages extolling the times of chivalry, when poets wrote
    sonnets to a lady&rsquo;s eyebrow, and gallant knights rode forth in armour
    to break a lance, or lose their life in honour of the woman of their choice.
    Or I might remind you that in my day gentlemen crossed swords or fired at
    one another with pistols to settle some quarrel over a woman&rsquo;s favour.
    It was not an uncommon thing for a man to be shot dead by another&mdash;who
    had perhaps been his intimate friend&mdash;for no other reason than that
    Lady A or Mistress X had smiled equally on both.</p>
  <p>Of course, you gay, shingled, pert young things smile at all that and shrug
    your thin shoulders. You call it &lsquo;tommy-rot&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t you?
    You sneer at your grandmothers and your grandfathers, and ask how on the
    jolly old earth there could have been anything romantic in their bowings
    and scrapings, their slow-moving quadrilles or whirling polkas, with mamma
    or Aunt Priscilla sitting in the offing watchful lest her giddy young charge
    threw too many soft glances on her &lsquo;beau&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Faith! you may sneer at it, but believe me, m&rsquo;dears, stolen fruit
    is passing sweet. There was something peculiarly delicious in those stolen
    moments in the conservatory when Aunt Priscilla wasn&rsquo;t looking, or
    in waylaying the postman for a letter which contained a few impassioned words,
    a discreet homage written in verse, probably.</p>
  <p>And there was rapture in a kiss in those days of long ago, a thrill of which
    you cynical moderns know nothing. What is a kiss to you? You bestow and receive
    so many. Your mouth to-day is more accessible than was your grandmother&rsquo;s
    hand in the past. And that is why, m&rsquo;dears, some of you&mdash;not by
    any means all&mdash;find love a dry business these days. There can be no
    romance in the love-making of an anaemic &lsquo;intellectual&rsquo; to a
    boyish, freakish Amazon. I am talking of extreme cases, but unfortunately
    they are on the increase year after year, while young people in order to
    be in fashion look on the love between man and maid through the muddy, horn-rimmed
    spectacles of modern cynicism. To them it does seem dull and dry, but only
    because they are too much engrossed by this selfish business called self-expression,
    to appreciate the subtle beauty of love. They are the people who call Beethoven&rsquo;s
    Ninth Symphony &lsquo;too horribly old-fashioned&rsquo;, and prefer Mr. Epstein&rsquo;s &lsquo;Genesis&rsquo;  to
    the soulful beauty of the Venus de Milo.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, m&rsquo;dears, you can take it from me that love is no more
    a dry business to-day than it was in the past and thank Heaven, there are
    still a number of you in this go-ahead twentieth century who have experienced
    the thrill of a first kiss and not been ashamed to exchange love-tokens with
    the one destined to be your companion and helpmate throughout life.</p>
  <p>Those of you who are so blessed will see their path strewn with the happy
    memories of those golden moments which alone make for contentment and happiness&mdash;fragrant
    rosemary treasured for remembrance in the pages of your book of life.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    Has Progress Got Ahead Of You?</b> </h2>
  <p>Progress has slipped a cog. It has got ahead of you humans who are supposed
    to regulate its advance. During the Great War, when your backs were turned
    and you were attending for your lives to your own business, it took a demmed
    sharp advantage of you all, so much so that now, egad, you seem hardly to
    know where you are!</p>
  <p>You seem suddenly to have awakened to find yourselves in the midst of an
    age which is not meant for you and is not altogether suited to your mentality.</p>
  <p>This age is one or realism, rationalism, a cold-blooded, hard-headed, calculating
    age, and it has given your sentimental complacency a severe jolt.</p>
  <p>Those of you who wish to be thought up-to-date at any cost have shortened
    your hair, you have readjusted your moral values so as to give your conscience
    more elasticity, you have thrown your religion overboard and assumed an attitude
    of cynicism and unbelief.</p>
  <p>Your extremists, on the other hand&mdash;your early Victorians and &lsquo;dash-it-sir-things-weren&rsquo;t-like-this-when-I-was-a-boy&rsquo;  kind
    of men&mdash;have come to a sort of mental halt on small islands of age-old
    and rapidly disappearing sand and ordering the waves of progress to roll
    away out of their sight.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile between these two extremes there is the rest of humanity&mdash;a
    crowding mass of ordinary, everyday folk, men and women who do their best
    to hide their romantic ideals, their feelings and emotions under a cloak
    of artificiality, whilst waging their humble battle of life in an era which
    they cannot understand and in which they find neither sympathy nor comradeship.</p>
  <p>Faith! the trouble some of you take to conceal what you think is your weakness,
    but which, in point of fact, is the essence of beauty in your nature, the
    hall-mark of a noble soul. But just now you are bewildered, you have been
    swept off your feet; you have lived through those four awful years when you
    saw every ideal, every gentle impulse, every sense of love and charity sacrificed
    to the needs of that terrible War. Your sense of security and of peace was
    suddenly seized upon by forces over which you had no control, and hurled
    into the seething cauldron of a Titanic conflict wherein the demons of hatred,
    of distrust and of terror stirred their witches&rsquo; brew.</p>
  <p>You had suddenly lost your anchorage. The struggle for bare existence, for
    keeping some measure of sanity in the midst of so much horror, compelled
    you to wake from your dreams of tranquility and to plunge into the nightmare
    of reality.</p>
  <p>As a result you have lost the years of transition. The time between 1914
    and 1933, instead of gliding gently along its normal course, was one in which
    everything was artificially speeded up. The pace of living was increased
    an hundredfold.</p>
  <p>In the ordinary course of events your children would have graduated to it
    just as you graduated from penny-farthing bicycles to your cars and your
    aeroplanes. But human beings have only a limited capacity for adapting themselves
    to new modes of life, and you have been asked to live through so many changes
    that you have become like a piece of elastic that has been overstretched.
    And you naturally feel puzzled and not a little uneasy. You are trying to
    be sympathetic and to understand things that shock or astonish you; you are,
    in fact, straining every nerve to appear hard-headed before the world, cold-blooded
    and what is known as modern. You have donned an armour of indifference and
    scepticism because civilization has run ahead of you, and you are afraid
    to show your true self to the world because it might scoff at the romantic
    ideals which you treasure in your heart.</p>
  <p>Your pitiless psycho-analysts, who jeer at human virtue or weaknesses, would
    probably say that you had a superstition-complex, or a sex-complex, or some
    other mental ailment with a high-sounding name; but you, with all your old-fashioned
    beliefs, know well enough that the only complaints you suffer from are idealism,
    romance, love, or some silly prehistoric things like that, and you remark
    with a sigh of longing that the old dresses must have been very charming,
    or how thrilling it would have been to meet a highwayman.</p>
  <p>What you really mean is that coquettish glances from under a coal-scuttle
    bonnet must have been very alluring, and that it must have been very thrilling
    to meet men who clung to the axiom that chivalry and courtesy are a necessary
    part of any gentleman&rsquo;s code of honour.</p>
  <p>I could wish that you had the courage, my friends, to assert boldly with
    me that chivalry and love and laughter are still extant to-day; you know
    that they are; then why not proclaim it to the rest of this disillusioned
    world? You have felt their existence, have you not? Say on a warm summer&rsquo;s
    evening away from the bustle and noise of cities, with the right man or woman
    beside you? You have felt the thrill of romance then, I&rsquo;ll wager, so
    why not own to it? But all your life you have been taught that romanticism
    is a weakness of which you should be ashamed; so lest your neighbours suspect
    you of it you adjourn to the nearest American Bar, swallow an unpleasant-tasting
    cocktail and do your best with a forced jest or cynical remark to dispel
    such an illusion.</p>
  <p>And all the while in your innermost soul you know that you cannot get rid
    of that persistent streak of romance which may not belong to the age in which
    you live, but is nevertheless a characteristic of your face.</p>
  <p>Have you ever watched the faces of guests at one of your fashionable weddings?
    Serious men of business who have stolen an hour from the daily battle of
    life and fortune come to the ceremony in order to bestow a friendly smile
    and a wish for happiness on their friend; women with faces lined by age,
    to whom marriage has perhaps meant disillusionment, look almost beautiful
    when, with moist eyes and quivering lips, they murmur a silent blessing on
    the bride as she goes by and a beautiful prayer that she may find in her
    life the romance and the love which luckless fate had denied to them.</p>
  <p>Or have you modern cynics ever watched a suburban gardener bending his back
    to the task of transforming his tiny plot of ground from what was a builder&rsquo;s
    scrap-heap into a small paradise filled with blossoms and flowering shrubs,
    a nesting-place for birds, an ideal spot where he can sit and smoke his pipe
    and contemplate the work of his hands?</p>
  <p>Have you watched the street-hawker, whose bellowing voice has often grated
    on your sensitive ear, stoop with a smile to a small child who is afraid,
    to cross the road? Have you ever paused in your walk in order to see him
    take the child gently by the arm and guide it safely through the traffic?
    Then have you watched his face&mdash;almost ashamed of the emotion that prompted
    this kind action&mdash;while the child, after the manner of young things,
    heedlessly runs away?</p>
  <p>Now let me advise you to look out for these small incidents which occur
    every day in the crowded streets of your great cities, and I&rsquo;ll warrant
    that you will think as I do, that progress and rationalism have not yet succeeded
    in eradicating from the heart of your nation all traces of romance and of
    kindly, unselfish, foolish friendliness. You of your generation may try to
    deny it, but I know better. I know that in spite of your blas&eacute;, cynical
    attitude, you still treasure deep down in your hearts the true romanticism
    that is so essentially British&mdash;firm friendships, love that is as faithful
    as it is ardent, and with it all a light <i>bon-homie</i>, the laughter that
    will conceal a tear.</p>
  <p>Romance may be foolish and out-of-date, but without it life would be like
    a rose without its fragrance, like an evening sky robbed of its stars. You
    who have it in your hearts be no longer ashamed of it. I don&rsquo;t say
    that you want to wear every emotion on your sleeve, but in Heaven&rsquo;s
    name do not allow modern cynicism to harden your hearts against romance,
    which is the very savour of existence&mdash;the one thing that makes men
    of you instead of unfeeling robots.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    Give Your Children A Chance</b> </h2>
  <p>In the Book of Books there is a commandment in which certain words occur
    with which even those of us who never open that Book these days are quite
    familiar, and which&mdash;did one ever reflect seriously on them&mdash;would
    give one furiously to think:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;. . . and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the
    third and fourth generation . . .&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Now, m&rsquo;dears, in this case, whether you individually believe in God
    or not, is beside the point. Whether you look on those words as a divine
    commandment or as a mere aphorism is a matter of your own personal outlook.
    But you cannot deny their truth, and I will venture to add to them an entirely
    worldly axiom which is this: everything a man or woman does, everything he
    or she thinks or says, is moulding a character which, in its turn, will be
    handed down to another generation and to another yet.</p>
  <p>Yours is an era, my friends, when the cry of &lsquo;Self first&rsquo; and
    of &lsquo;Damn posterity! what has it done for me?&rsquo; is heard on every
    side, chiefly, or course, from those who are adding to the load of weaknesses
    and of failures which the next generations will have to bear, from self-satisfied,
    self-deluded wastrels, who are content to go their slothful way along the
    line of least resistance, indulging in their little sins, scorning to exert
    any one of the gifts with which they happen to be endowed. &lsquo;Oh! what
    can a man do?&rsquo; they are fond of saying. &lsquo;I am only one among
    millions. What can I do?&rsquo; And having used this argument which they
    deem unanswerable they turn over and, figuratively speaking, go to sleep.</p>
  <p>Would these selfish ne&rsquo;er-do-wells not be wiser to remember the old
    fable of the bundle of sticks? Each stick by itself could easily be broken
    by a feeble hand, but it would take the strength of a Titan to break the
    bundle when the sticks were all tied together.</p>
  <p>How many of you, I wonder, stop to think that every action of your life,
    good or bad, adds something of good or of evil to the character which you
    pass on to the next four or five generations? Have you ever realized that
    it is you, individually and collectively, who to-day are writing the history
    of the world a century hence? Great things are prophesied of the future&mdash;untold,
    unbelievable marvels! But you are writing their history <i>now</i>!</p>
  <p>Far be it from me to suggest that it is in your power to affect altogether
    all the ensuing generations. But whether you will it or not you are bound
    to leave a legacy either of heavenly gifts or of hellish curses. If you allow
    your own true and simple character to be perverted out of all recognition
    by a sneering and cynical world you will pass it on in its warped and distorted
    state to your children, and to their children after them.</p>
  <p>It is on you, m&rsquo;dears, that the people of the future will look back
    one day, blessing you for their strength and their happiness, or cursing
    you for their misery or their disease. If you remain clean in heart and mind,
    strong, faithful and loyal, you will be giving them a fair start.</p>
  <p>It is for you to see to it that what is dross in your generation be consumed
    in the furnace of your present life; for you to make the most of the many
    gifts with which your glorious nation is endowed&mdash;your strength of character,
    your patriotism, your loyalty, your love of home; for you to wage deathly
    warfare against all this modern cynicism, this contempt of everything that
    is beautiful in life or in art, this constant grubbing in the gutter in search
    of what is noisome, and this inability to see the glory that is around you.
    If you do all this, m&rsquo;dears, you will ease the coming generations of
    their heaviest burdens.</p>
  <p>Only think for a moment! I will quote you extreme cases first. Children
    of confirmed drunkards&mdash;what do they become? Drinkers themselves very
    often, slaves of drugs, wastrels or prostitutes.</p>
  <p>Is there a doubt in your mind when you see a dirty, slatternly woman, lounging
    about the alleyways of a great city, as to what her parents were? Is it not
    obvious?</p>
  <p>And what about the children of inveterate gamblers? From babyhood they have,
    perhaps, been stinted in their food, deprived of childish pleasures, in order
    to allow their selfish unnatural parents to indulge in their pet vice. Weak
    in health and physique, what chance will they have in life? With that pernicious
    example constantly before them how can their character develop on fine, straight,
    loyal lines?</p>
  <p>Nor is it only those obvious vices that will trail after them a generation
    of diseased or decadent sufferers. The scum of your great cities, the thieves,
    the drunkards, the liars know quite well what heritage of diseases and misery
    they will ultimately bequeath to their children. But what of the ordinary
    average man in the street&mdash;the respectable but unthinking folk, the
    well-to-do, who conceal their petty vices even from themselves? What of the
    people who make no effort against adversity? What of those who groan and
    complain that the world has passed them by? What of those who are content
    to rail against &lsquo;bad luck&rsquo;? It is to these, m&rsquo;dears, that
    you must look for the drifters and the derelicts of to-morrow. It is their
    children, and their children&rsquo;s children who will swell the ranks of
    the useless and the futile of the future.</p>
  <p>You cannot put a heavier handicap on the younger generation than the germ
    of laziness and supineness, for that germ will develop and spread until its
    hideous tentacles have smothered every noble virtue, every attribute of the
    intellect and of the heart.</p>
  <p>Human nature being what it is, is fond of procrastination; it dislikes trouble,
    tries to avoid worry; the easy road is the one it prefers to take. These
    are not grave faults, I&rsquo;ll admit, and with your marvellous mechanical
    progress are not even dangerous. But there is to-morrow to think of! The
    future generation&mdash;your children to whom you are bequeathing a heritage
    which may cause the very downfall of their Empire and the destruction of
    their race.</p>
  <p>What is the use of genius if it has not with it the virtues of energy and
    perseverance? Of what use would such great scientists as Newton and Faraday,
    or in your own time Edison and Marconi, have been to the world had they been
    content to dream of the great wonders of the universe and not applied their
    genius to elucidating its mysteries, and by dint of hard work succeeded in
    enriching the future generations with their great discoveries. I doubt not
    but that Nature still holds concealed many a great marvel in her ample bosom,
    and calmly waits for human hands to draw aside the curtain wherewith she
    veils them. There are, alas, many diseases still waiting for the brain that
    will find a way to conquer them. There are still new places to discover,
    new realms on which the adventurer can set his foot, new mines for the seeker
    after gold and precious stones. The universe is waiting to reveal its wonders
    to those of the next generation who have energy, courage and enterprise.</p>
  <p>And it is in your hands that their future lies!</p>
  <p>The man of genius who is incapable of developing within himself the great
    virtues of energy and perseverance will assuredly live and die nameless and
    unglorified; his genius will have been of no use to the world. You will soon
    see him slip down the social ladder and finally submerged in that low stratum
    where there is neither ambition nor hope of success, and where the joy of
    life is killed by discontent. He is a man to be both pitied and despised.
    He could have done something for humanity, but was too lazy to accomplish
    it. He frittered away those grand gifts which Nature had bestowed upon him;
    handicapped by his own supineness, he did not even try to overcome it; and
    in the end he committed the unpardonable sin of transmitting that same handicap
    to his children &lsquo;unto the third and fourth generation&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>In Heaven&rsquo;s name, m&rsquo;dears, remember that determination, ambition,
    refusal to admit defeat, are the weapons with which your children will in
    their time have to battle with life. Is it then not worth while to keep a
    bright edge on those weapons for their sakes; to keep them clean and burnished
    by constant use? For the sake of the love you bear them do not forget that
    every action in your life, however insignificant it may seem to you, may
    add one day to their happiness or to their sorrow; for children see more
    than you sometimes give them credit for; and it is what they see in you that
    goes to mould their character. Far be it from me to be a square-toes or a
    pussyfoot; in my day every gentleman knew how to empty his glass and thrilled
    at a good game of hazard; I know that you moderns enjoy these things just
    as we did in the past, but it is moderation that will carry you through and
    excess that will destroy you, for every excess means adding another twig
    to the rod of unhappiness with which one day Fate will smite your son or
    your daughter.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis not for me to preach, I know. I was deemed lazy in my time, flippant,
    irresponsible. You perhaps judge me differently, and I, for one, know that
    noble latent virtues lie beneath your outward cloak of futility. All I plead
    for is for courage to allow your virtues to come to the surface so that your
    children may delight in them and their young characters be moulded after
    their patterns.</p>
  <p>It is worth the effort because of the future. It is also worth the effort
    because through it &lsquo;self&rsquo; becomes entirely subservient to the
    rest of humanity&mdash;humanity represented by the young ones that grow up
    around you and, unknown to themselves, cry out even from babyhood for the
    happiness and contentment which a life of courage and of initiative, of love
    of country and of home alone can give.</p>
  <p>Do not let them cry out in vain.</p>

    The Unimportance Of Wealth For Its Own Sake</b> </h2>
  <p>Whenever I read in your newspapers that an engagement between young Society
    people has been broken off I cannot help but admire their courage. Their
    marriage had probably been engineered for them by their parents or their
    friends, their respective wealth and social connections had certainly been
    weighed in the balance on either side, and neither being found wanting it
    was decided that connubial bliss was bound to follow. But the young people
    knew better and stood firm against the conspiracy to build their happiness
    on the insecure foundation of wealth.</p>
  <p>In the past&mdash;which you are, all of you, so fond of calling the good
    old days&mdash;it would have been very difficult for those young people to
    set their faces against the commands of their respective families. Custom
    dictated that parents should &lsquo;arrange&rsquo; the future of their children,
    and as often as not the result was a demmed unhappy mess for the poor young
    things. How lucky youth is nowadays to be allowed to mould its life as it
    will, and I will readily admit that wealth&mdash;in terms of &pound;.s.d.
    hardly ever enters into the ideal realms of a genuine love-match.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately one cannot blind oneself to the fact that the influence of
    money is very largely on the increase these days. Too often I notice that
    the share-pusher or fraudulent financier is accepted in certain strata of
    modern society. Croesus is toadied too because of the benefits which may
    accrue from his goodwill, and an ill-mannered millionaire is often made more
    welcome than a poor gentleman because of the tips he is able to give for
    a flutter on the Stock Exchange.</p>
  <p>Far be it from me to assert that money has not its romantic side! I were
    a demmed ingrate if I did, for it was money that enabled me to indulge my
    passion for adventure, which I could not have done had I been a penniless
    rustic. Money does undoubtedly open for one the portals of a wide, wide world.
    It brings the many delightful luxuries of the earth within one&rsquo;s reach;
    it can satisfy one&rsquo;s wishes and fulfil one&rsquo;s desires. But it
    is not almighty, and somehow the very things that are beyond its reach are
    the most important of all.</p>
  <p>I enjoyed my wealth; I liked the comfort it brought me and the luxuries.
    I loved my white-winged &lsquo;Day-Dream&rsquo;, my lace, my perfumes, my
    horses and my home. I still love the things that wealth can give. I love
    to see beautiful pearls round a beautiful woman&rsquo;s neck. I love to see
    her wear expensive furs, silks and dainty shoes, and all the rest of the
    fripperies that women love. But I do not believe in the influence of wealth
    as wealth, or in the power of pearl necklaces and fur coats. There are influences
    far greater than these.</p>
  <p>To begin with&mdash;and I am deliberately treading here on delicate ground&mdash;there
    is religion. There is no money in the world that could purchase the conviction
    of a devout man or woman, no matter to what form of belief he or she may
    adhere. The pages of the world&rsquo;s history teem with the relations of
    terrible martyrdom endured for its sake in the early days of Christianity,
    or during the great religious persecutions of the Middle Ages. These facts
    are too well known to need reiteration, but they do serve to prove that not
    even life, much less wealth or honours, was thought too high a price to pay
    when religious convictions were at stake.</p>
  <p>A famous statesman did once assert that &lsquo;every man has his price&rsquo;.
    Now that was a demmed foolish assertion on the part of that statesman: it
    goes to prove that he, for one, knew very little of men and of life or he
    would never have made it. Take your own case, m&rsquo;dears; would you, if
    the reward was high enough, commit murder, betray your friend, or rob an
    old woman of her savings? Would a sackful of gold, or all the gold in the
    world, compensate you for the loss of love, honour, or self-respect? Egad!
    I&rsquo;ll not wait for an answer.</p>
  <p>There is nothing in the world that will purchase the love of a woman if
    she be forced into a marriage with the veriest Croesus. Many a rich man has
    learnt that hard lesson to his cost. Diamonds and pearls, fur coats or your
    wonderful motor cars&mdash;every luxury a woman&rsquo;s heart can desire&mdash;will
    not command a single heartfelt caress or the true fervour of a loving kiss.</p>
  <p>Money cannot purchase love, and it cannot purchase health. There is at least
    one millionaire in your world to-day who would give five-sixths of his entire
    fortune to any doctor who could cure him permanently of a troublesome, though
    not deadly, disease. A very well-known lady of Victorian times offered &pound;100,000
    to any physician who could rid her of a disfiguring mark on the face. Beauty-culture
    was not then the highly scientific study that it is to-day and the lady took
    the ugly mark with her to the grave.</p>
  <p>Egad! do not these two instances dispose of the theory that wealth is an
    almighty power? And I could quote you innumerable others. But it is exceedingly
    pleasant, I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;and so is health. Wealth has not the satisfying
    quality of faith, nor the rapture of love, and personally, I am of the opinion
    that great wealth is a source of more trouble than anything else on earth.
    The acquiring of it is a worry, the losing it a greater worry still. In that
    way it is like teeth&mdash;trouble when they come and a demmed trouble when
    they go!</p>
  <p>The possession of money is, in fact, a perpetually unsatisfied ambition.
    The man who owns a bicycle longs to have a car; as soon as he can afford
    a car he wants a large one; having a larger one he wants a more expensive
    one, or a more exclusive make; having this he wants a yacht, and in the striving
    after these things he spends his life in a musty office with his ear glued
    to a telephone, whilst love, happiness, idealism and adventure pass him by.</p>
  <p>And in the end money, that precious thing for the acquisition of which he
    has sacrificed his whole life toiling and slaving and striving, cheats him
    out and out, because it is powerless to obtain for him that which perhaps
    he wants more than anything else in the world.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately the tendency of to-day is to imagine that wealth must be gained
    at all costs, that nothing matters except money and the luxuries it can bring;
    that for its sake it is wise to sacrifice everything that the idealist holds
    most dear&mdash;love, conscience, art, even honour sometimes.</p>
  <p>It is true that you cannot take love and honour to the money-lender or the
    pawnbroker as you can a string of pearls, but when you have them even a visit
    to the pawnbroker is robbed of some of its sting. You may have a hard struggle
    for life; you may even feel the pinch of poverty; you may have to deny yourself
    and those you care for many pleasant luxuries, but if you have a clean record
    and possess the love of one who is dear to you, you will own gems far more
    precious than the rarest pearls that ever came out of the sea. And what is
    more, these gems have a purchasing power which no money in the world ever
    had, or ever will have, for they can, in their turn, purchase love and friendship.
    Honour calls to honour, love to love, both will bring into your life that
    great, priceless, wonderful thing without which no life can be complete&mdash;true
    and loyal friends.</p>

    Who Said That Petticoat Government No Longer Exists?</b> </h2>
  <p>A man, well-known in your world to-day, remarked recently that the world
    no longer bowed to the dictates of its womenkind. He talked of the old days&mdash;my
    days, if you like&mdash;when behind every throne in Europe there lurked the
    shadow of a beautiful woman. He recalled the times when no statesman dared
    lift a finger for fear of that powerful shadow unless he had first assured
    himself that it favoured his project; and he finished his talk by averring
    that nowadays petticoats and petticoat government have vanished together
    into the limbo of forgotten things. He was wrong! I have not been wandering
    about among you without discovering that the ladies&mdash;bless  &rsquo;em&mdash;still
    rule, and are as captivating, bewitching and obstinate as they always were
    and, I trust, always will be. Odd&rsquo;s my life! it makes one&rsquo;s heart
    leap with joy even now to see their bright fearless eyes, coquettish as ever,
    turn a man into an abject slave, though the fan&mdash;lovely necessity to
    every flirtation once upon a time&mdash;has gone now, alas! the same way
    as hoops and flounces and the <i>frou-frou</i> of silk petticoats.</p>
  <p>In the days when sticks and clubs were used alike for international or domestic
    arguments, it is extremely likely that skin-clad men believed that they ruled
    supreme. Probably there was a strident &lsquo;Woman&rsquo;s place is in the
    cave&rsquo; slogan in existence even then. But all the same, even in those
    days, your smiling Stone-Age lady could twist the stalwart tribal chief round
    her finger as easily as she could twist her own glossy plaits of hair; and
    the local witch doctor or head councillor, whose lightest word rolled like
    thunder around the massed silent circle of men, was sent out grumbling by
    his wife from his desirable cavern residence to scrape the dirt off his feet
    with his spear.</p>
  <p>And though all that happened a demmed long time ago something very similar
    goes on to this day! Many of the world&rsquo;s most famous men have confessed
    that all their lives they have been guided by their wife or their sweetheart
    or sometimes their mother. Many wonderful pictures, beautiful books, glorious
    pieces of music, are dedicated to the women who inspired them. Though there
    are many examples or men who, ruled by women, were led to cruel, unjust or
    foolish deeds, there are countless others where that rule has been everything
    that is wise and just.</p>
  <p>But the vindication of petticoat government, m&rsquo;dears, does not rest
    on historic records alone; it would have a poor chance of proving its case
    if it did. Luckily for the world&rsquo;s happiness it rests on more secure
    foundation. You surely must know many cases of ordinary everyday folk&mdash;friends,
    acquaintances, the man in the street&mdash;in whose life the magic of romance
    has turned life&rsquo;s rough stony roads into exquisite, rose-strewn highways,
    and transformed the cottage into a wondrous palace of love and of constant
    joy.</p>
  <p>Even in your ultra-practical days when so many of you affect to despise
    romance, many a young lover would choose to be the slave of his adored rather
    than become the ruler of an Empire, and the rejected swain still finds the
    whole world, its triumphs and its rewards a hollow mockery when love is not.
    That is the way of true love, and it has not changed a tittle since my day
    or any other. It will brook no sharing of its sovereignty either with pride,
    with wisdom or ambition; it cares nothing for opinion of the world, powerful
    as that can sometimes be. Petticoat government is an autocratic form of rule,
    and there is no power on earth that can overthrow it if it is backed by love.</p>
  <p>It would certainly seem that in your year of sense, 1933, you ought to banish
    this tyrannical petticoat rule&mdash;if indeed it chafes you, as you say
    it does&mdash;just as of late so many countries of the world have banished
    their monarchs and upset their government. I am happy to say that our own
    beloved country has been sane enough to set its face against the modern proneness
    of looking upon hereditary monarchy as an impediment to business, or as tending
    to distract the mind from its all-important aim of money-making; but in many
    countries, alas! monarchs are voted to be anachronisms, to be in the way
    of the steady development of reason. Let us depose our crowned kings, say
    the moderns, and by the same token let us hurl our queens of the petticoat
    from their throne. Let us rid ourselves, once and for all, of such false,
    out-of-date, medieval gods.</p>
  <p>Thus do you, m&rsquo;dears, proclaim your independence from the housetops,
    and a good many of you in this post-War world have certainly rid yourselves
    of your ancient monarchies. But strive as you may against the autocratic
    rule of the petticoat, it is still with you. It is not in your power, nor,
    believe me, is it your wish to cast off woman&rsquo;s yoke once she has entwined
    herself around your heart, demanding to be worshipped, to be loved, and to
    rule. It is her province, my friends; she will never give it up, so you had
    better make up your minds to wear her fetters and pretend you like them.</p>
  <p>You may try to abolish the word &lsquo;love&rsquo; like Soviet Russia has
    tried to abolish Christianity, but even the most cynical amongst you may
    find one day that there is, perhaps, one footstep in the world the sound
    of which will cause a flutter in your heart, and that you will find happiness
    and the strength to carry on in the light of one woman&rsquo;s smile. You
    may deflect a river from its course, and in your twentieth century you have
    your wonderful inventions which enable you to talk to a man half a world
    away, to see through solid flesh as if it were transparent, or to erect buildings
    so high that the Tower of Babel would seem puny beside them. Nevertheless
    it is a small white hand that will beckon you to the Heaven of contentment
    and of home, or will point the way to the Hell of loneliness. With all your
    independence, your strength, your power to set up Governments and destroy
    them at your will, you are still under the sway of the most tyrannical autocracy
    the world has ever known.</p>
  <p>This world is still Cupid&rsquo;s plaything, and do believe me when I say
    that you have no wish for it to be otherwise. My faith! I cannot imagine&mdash;nor
    can you, I&rsquo;ll warrant&mdash;what would happen if the merry little god
    gave up trying to play with us and left our hearts to get atrophied in their
    solitude. Life would not be worth the living now, would it, I ask you? Love
    rules most of you, the best of you, the strongest, manliest amongst you,
    and you had best admit it. It may be love of wife, of daughter or mother,
    but there is no man worthy of the name who does not toil and strive for a
    woman he loves. And, mind you, there is not a more jealous god than that
    little Cupid. If you fight him he will have his revenge. If you turn your
    back on him he will contrive to overload you with depression, discontent
    and monotony, and finally he will hand you over to the most cruel of all
    torturers&mdash;loneliness.</p>
  <p>But if you bow to the sovereignty of Love, if you wear its golden fetters,
    it will crown you king of your little world. It will fill your life with
    gladness, spur you on to noble deeds, raise your hopes, stimulate your ambition
    and make you the real master of your fate.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
    Two Heads Are Better Than One</b> </h2>
  <p>&rsquo;Pon my soul, my friends, I must congratulate you at least on this:
    that your generation has discovered and is not afraid to admit that a wife
    makes the truest comrade and the best guide an ambitious or a happy man can
    have. Indeed, it warms the heart to see such tributes paid to women as your
    great men have recently done.</p>
  <p>See how many of your statesmen have said that but for the guidance of a
    woman&rsquo;s hand they would never have attained their high eminence in
    world affairs. Sir Austen Chamberlain, who is an aristocrat after mine own
    heart, has said: &lsquo;For thirty years my wife has been my inspiration.
    She has known every secret of my public life. She has sustained my courage,
    shared my hopes and sympathized with me in my anxieties.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Baldwin has on more than one occasion said much the same thing about
    his own life partner; Lord Reading, when he closed his great years of service
    in troubled India, said that more than once would discouragement have overcome
    him but for &lsquo;the lady who stood by me when times were difficult and
    anxious.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Yet another of your famous statesman who would never have reached to fame
    alone is the Marquess of Aberdeen, who has served his country as Governor-General
    of Canada and as Viceroy of Ireland during the latter&rsquo;s most troublesome
    years. The book most appropriately entitled, <i>We Twa</i>, of which he and
    his wife are joint authors, proclaims in every page the vital truth of the
    ancient saying that,  &lsquo;Whoso findeth a good wife findeth a great thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And in other realms than politics great or famous men have paid tribute
    to the white hands that guided their careers. John Galsworthy dedicated his <i>Forsyte
    Saga</i> to his wife, saying that without her encouragement, sympathy and
    criticism, he would never have won through to success. Even your amazing
    Mr. G. B. Shaw has for once been conventional enough to admit that he <i>might
    perhaps</i> have failed but for the help his wife had given him throughout
    his career.</p>
  <p>My faith! I could go on quoting you instances by the yard of famous men
    who have said as much, but I find it difficult to choose among so many. Cromwell,
    that iron-hearted regicide, was never happy when parted from his wife; and
    she it was who once wrote those beautiful words to him: &lsquo;My life is
    but half a life in thine absence.&rsquo; Lord John Lawrence, who helped to
    build our Empire in India, was once chaffed by his sister, who said that
    he could never rest for five minutes away from his wife&rsquo;s side. &lsquo;That
    was why I married her, madam,&rsquo; he replied quietly.</p>
  <p>But it is not in those great men, either past or present, or in their wonderful
    helpmates that I am most interested. My thoughts now, as always, fly to the
    man in the street, to the average British working or commercial man, to all
    those, in fact, who have found in marriage just the kind of companionship
    that they sought. Laurels of fame are perhaps not for them; they are not
    striving to reach the giddy heights of clangorous success, but in their struggles
    and their strivings they can hold on to a hand which is always ready to guide
    and to help. &lsquo;God must have loved the average woman: He made so many
    of them,&rsquo; was said by a great philanthropist who knew how to appreciate
    the wonderful qualities of the quiet, everyday housewife who sits at home
    and ministers to the creature comforts of the man she loves, and while darning
    his socks weaves into the criss-cross threads thoughts of how best she can
    serve him with encouragement and advice.</p>
  <p>She it is who makes this modern world of yours seem less drab, for she causes
    it to glow with the effulgence of her unselfishness. She is for ever planning
    ways and means to save her man from petty worries and irritating cares; she
    it is who puts heart into him when discouragement overtakes him; she who
    comforts him when sorrow and disappointment seem more than he can bear.</p>
  <p>Then I pray you, charge your glasses, ye men of this Great and Greater Britain,
    and drink a loyal toast to your adorable womankind. You know as well as I
    do that without your loving wife life would indeed make a poor show for you.
    Without the ladies&mdash;God bless &rsquo;em!&mdash;this whole round earth
    of ours would lose all its sweetness, and we, poor male creatures, would
    lose all our self-respect if we had no one to stand by us and tell us what
    demmed fine fellows we really were.</p>
  <p>I hate that stupid old proverb which says that familiarity breeds contempt;
    but all the same, I fear me, that it causes us to take for granted, or cease
    to appreciate at its just value, the constant care, the kindliness, the thoughtfulness
    wherewith our working life is made easier for us. Think back on the days
    of your honeymoon, my friends, and how exquisite seemed to you the thousand
    and one little attentions which your young wife already bestowed on you.
    Every time you found your slippers put to warm by the fire you felt a thrill
    of manly satisfaction and of pride in the choice you had made of a life&rsquo;s
    companion. Do not lose this great hold you have on happiness by ceasing to
    notice those small attentions after the first few years of marital contentment.</p>
  <p>The love that prompts all those small attentions is the same to-day as it
    was in the days of your betrothal. Do not blind yourself to it and take too
    much for granted. She is always ready to share your sorrow and make it thereby
    but half a trouble, and by the same token she will double your joy by sharing
    it with you.</p>
  <p>It is the unfortunate lonely bachelor who &lsquo;has no one to still him
    and therefore must weep out his eyes&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>And to put the matter in a more prosy way, let me assure you that two heads
    are always better than one, especially if that other head matures thoughts
    only of you. The wagon that is drawn in double harness will roll without
    a jolt on life&rsquo;s highway.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    Are Women Really Selfish?</b> </h2>
  <p>This, m&rsquo;dears, is one of the questions everlastingly asked by man,
    and woman&rsquo;s answer to it is a Mona Lisa smile, which may be interpreted
    as acquiescence or scorn&mdash;as you please.</p>
  <p>There have been, of course, many women well known in history who have appeared
    to be taking all and giving nothing in return, who never hesitated to destroy
    ruthlessly whatever stood in the way of their ambition, were it for place,
    for power or for love. In order to remove an obstacle that stood in their
    path women&mdash;demmed ungallant as it seems to say it&mdash;have been known
    to sacrifice the lives or friends or lovers, even the honour of their country,
    without granting so much as a kiss in return. Women have show, in fact, that
    they can be more pitiless, more cruel than men, where their desires, their
    appetites or their ambition were concerned.</p>
  <p>In the nature of things there must also have been millions of women, inconspicuous
    and unknown, who have acted at times with unbelievable selfishness. Women,
    perhaps, who have used all their arts of seduction to keep a lover at their
    side when honour and duty called to him to go; others who, in order to satisfy
    their own ambition, have tied husband or lover to their chariot wheel, and
    dragged him with them to heights of social or political attainments which
    were beyond his power to reach, with the result that a crash was inevitable,
    and the weak or foolish man was hurled down from those giddy heights and
    fell broken in heart and in spirit, unregretted, uncomforted by the very
    one who caused his downfall.</p>
  <p>History has shown us many a Cleopatra in some such roles, and I know that
    everyone of you in your own walk of life, has known of cases less famous
    but equally tragic.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, in fairness to the sex, let it be said that selfishness in
    its true sense is <i>not</i> always the motive power that drives these unhappy
    women on. Cleopatra was not intentionally selfish when she kept Antony by
    her side, whilst the cold ambitious Octavius had time to conquer worlds in
    his stead. Mrs. Warren Harding, in acting as the motive force which drove
    a simple farmer to the helm of one of the greatest powers in the modern world,
    has always appealed to me as being more a tragedy herself than even the tragic
    figure of her husband. And, plain Mrs. Smith, who turns her husband from
    an easy-going, sporting Briton into a white-faced business robot, is herself
    more often than not a stricken statue of self-denial.</p>
  <p>Mark, I do not say that these women are right; merely that they are not,
    in the true meaning of the word, selfish.</p>
  <p>When the pagans would have it that Cupid was blind I think they made a mistake.
    It is not the little god who is blind; he distributes his precious shafts
    judiciously enough as a rule; but his arrow points often seem to have been
    dipped in a virulent poison, which has the power of depriving of their sight
    those who have been pierced by them. And women suffer from these attacks
    of blindness far more frequently and more completely than men.</p>
  <p>Watch the girl who fears or hopes for her lover. Is she selfish? Let Destiny
    ask her to give her life for his and see then! For herself she cares nothing,
    but for him&mdash;for him she will be ready to sacrifice not only her life,
    but the rest of the world in a single blazing funeral pyre if it would but
    profit him. Love&rsquo;s poisoned shaft has blinded her indeed.</p>
  <p>She thinks for him, acts for him, schemes for him, plunges into evil or
    good impersonally for him. She sees a prize&mdash;he must have it; she recognizes
    a goal&mdash;he must attain it. For love of him she dreams dreams, and in
    her love-blindness she is obsessed by the dreams and forces his weak humanity
    to an impossible task.</p>
  <p>But make no mistake. The dreams are all for him. She is willing to stand
    in the background, fall out by the way; she is ready to become a mere stepping-stone
    to his success. It would be the divine height of unselfishness were it not
    the blind height of folly.</p>
  <p>Woman has a longer vision than man, but she lacks his logical faculty for
    estimating obstacles. Woman will try and keep her lover by her side, knowing
    that they would be happy together even though his name be disgraced, or his
    country in sore need of him. But man, whose creed is different from hers,
    puts her second in his thoughts. &lsquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,
    loved I not honour more!&rsquo;  is his rule of life; he is selfish for his
    honour&rsquo;s sake, whilst she would sacrifice both her honour and his regard
    for her in order to keep him safely within the shelter of her arms.</p>
  <p>It has been said that if we only had faith we could say to this mountain:  &lsquo;Go
    hence!&rsquo; and it would actually go. That is the creed of the woman who
    is in love. Her faith in her love is so great that, should she covet a throne
    for her lover and a mountain stood in his way she would try her best to move
    it. I always think that had St. Peter been a woman he would never have found
    himself sinking when he tried to walk so boldly upon the waves.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the man also is of heroic mould and can follow the keenest flights
    of his chosen woman&rsquo;s vision and make them all come true. But such
    a man is rare; he is the real Fairy Prince for whom every woman pines. With
    a true woman as his guide and helpmate he can rise to heights supreme and
    when he has reached them you will find him listening to the plaudits of a
    wondering world, taking them all as his due, for the world, my friends, seldom
    sees or guesses that it was the woman who gave him all that he most needed&mdash;her
    help, her guidance, her sustaining love&mdash;so that he might attain his
    goal.</p>
  <p>Is it not the charming contrariness in woman that makes her&mdash;demmed
    delicious, distracting creature that she is&mdash;dream so many uncomfortable
    dreams? Would woman not a million times rather be left alone in an Eden of
    her own creation, alone with the man she loved, no matter whether he were
    god or common clay, than be a dweller in a Paradise peopled and fashioned
    by the world outside?</p>
  <p>That is the reason probably why most of them are glad when they find that
    their idol has feet of clay after all, and they can love him just as illogically
    and absolutely as their heart desires, with all his failings and his sins.
    It is heroic, this giving all for love, and women are so constituted that
    they actually like doing it; but a happy home, contentment and family life
    are really worth a thousand times more than dreams of ambition, so few of
    which are satisfying even when they are attained.</p>

    Love Is Still Life&rsquo;s Most Romantic Adventure</b> </h2>
  <p>You may believe me or not, m&rsquo;dears, but I can assure you that there
    was never yet a man or woman living who was not in search of love. Of course,
    you moderns, who are so thoroughly versed in psycho-analysis, will at once
    retort that you, for one&mdash;knowing yourself thoroughly&mdash;have never
    even thought of such an antiquated, ludicrous emotion as love. But let me
    tell you this: that even now in your practical world of to-day I see old
    and young, men and women, youths and maidens, rich and poor, married and
    single&mdash;all of you, in fact, hot in pursuit of the little pink god.
    Love, m&rsquo;dears, is as vital to existence as is the sun to flowers, as
    is the pure air of heaven to your lungs, and all of you moderns, cynical
    and unbelieving though you may label yourselves, tend just as eagerly towards
    love as we did in the past; you are all striving&mdash;though you may not
    be aware of it&mdash;to struggle out of the gloom of the commonplace in order
    to reach the splendours of Love&rsquo;s fairyland.</p>
  <p>The whole of your life, my friends, is incidental to this. It is for love&rsquo;s
    sake that a man will work so that he may have a home and comfort to offer
    to the woman of his choice. I doubt not that even the cave-man in his day
    sought the richest furs for his women and the warmest shelters for them against
    cold wintry weather.</p>
  <p>Will you tell me why your shingled, boyish-looking emancipated City typist
    or tea-room waitress trips so gaily every morning to her work? Because she
    likes it? Gadzooks! does any healthy young girl really like work? Because
    it flatters her vanity to do man&rsquo;s work? Never! She does it because
    instinct tells her that in the world outside her home she will have a chance
    of one day finding her mate.</p>
  <p>This mating instinct is passionately strong in every healthy human being,
    though most of you young moderns would deny it, and theorize at length about
    psychic affinities and sex-appeal. Those words, m&rsquo;dears, are just twentieth
    century masks, fashioned to distort the oldest and most valuable heritage
    of the human race&mdash;the will to search for love.</p>
  <p>Of course you are ready to pulverize me with the argument that love does
    not by any means always lead to fairyland. More often than not its sequel
    is tragedy or else a drab mediocrity which is more unendurable than black
    despair. What you are pleased to call happiness only comes through the channel
    of love once in a thousand times. That is your argument, I know, and in a
    measure you are right; but the reason for tragedy or mediocrity is because
    you young people of to-day are so apt to mistake the brass-farthing of sex
    attraction for the pure gold of love.</p>
  <p>Love is so elusive that it is easily mistaken for dross. Perhaps it is because
    we want it so badly that we allow ourselves to be deluded by shams and mockeries.
    But you young post-War girls who are so ready to lure a man on to make love
    or propose marriage to you, take my advice and test your choice of a mate
    as carefully as if you were buying gold; nay! far more carefully, for if,
    after buying gold, you should find it to be base metal, you can always cast
    it aside and retrieve your loss by starting to bargain afresh; but if you
    have been foolish enough to mistake a momentary passion for true and lasting
    love, you will have ruined your life and could no more build it up again
    than you could a broken rainbow.</p>
  <p>I am not talking now of girls who have been victimized by rogues, or of
    men whose affections have been broken on the wheel of some woman&rsquo;s
    caprice. These are but drops in the ocean of tragedies that come in the wake
    of unhappy love. The real tragedy, m&rsquo;dears, of life&rsquo;s most romantic
    adventure is to be found among the millions of people who have been willing
    to take the cast-out shafts from Cupid&rsquo;s quiver and then discovered&mdash;too
    late, alas!&mdash;that those shafts, far from being true gold, were just
    poisoned darts that left incurable wounds in their heart.</p>
  <p>How many of you, I wonder, will during this year utter the solemn vows which
    the churches demand from those who wish to start life together on the basis
    of mutual love and comradeship? And how many of you will presently regret
    those vows and regret them to the end of your days? For whatever may be said
    to the contrary, your modern easy divorce does not erase from the tablets
    of memory those happenings which the <i>decree nisi</i> is called upon to
    obliterate. The divorced man and the divorced woman may seem outwardly the
    same; they may behave in the same manner as before; they may smile as they
    did heretofore, but deep down in their hearts they know that the romance
    they dreamed of has received a wound which can never heal again.</p>
  <p>If only instinct would teach you young people that happiness can only be
    attained by real love, and that charming woman needs to exercise more care
    in choosing a husband than she does in selecting a hat. Only that way, believe
    me, does your happiness lie.</p>
  <p>There is such a thing as falling in love with love. The glamour of it dazzles;
    the object of one&rsquo;s adoration appears in the false light as a kind
    of god, a Titan amongst men. It is only when the eyes become accustomed to
    the surrounding gloom that the Titan shrivels to the size of a pigmy and
    the god is found to have feet of clay. But I well understand the glamour!
    How am I going to preach to you young people who are just on the threshold
    of life that the great adventure of love needs preparation and thought?</p>
  <p>Too hasty enthusiasm has wrecked more exploring expeditions into Loveland
    than ever Arctic bergs wrecked the vessels of Pole-seeking mariners. There
    is a very wise parable which was told by Divine lips, and which has a universal
    meaning. It relates the adventures of ten virgins, five of whom were wise
    and five very foolish. They were waiting for the bridegroom, if you remember,
    and the wise virgins in anticipation of his coming kept their lamps trimmed
    and burning clear and bright. The foolish ones, on the other hand, neglected
    their lamps, allowed them to flicker out and to die for want of trimming
    and of oil, so that when the time came and the bridegroom knocked at the
    door there they were, all in the dark, unable to welcome him. All that is
    fiction, of course, but what a lot of truth there is in it.</p>
  <p>Some of you foolish, charming young people are in far too great a hurry
    to light the lamp of your love, just letting it shed its feeble, uncertain
    rays on the first man or woman that comes along. For the time being it certainly
    does give you a sense of something big and eventful in your life, the illusion
    that you have laid the foundation of some great happiness. Those of you,
    on the other hand, who happen to be a little wiser, do not waste the light
    of your precious lamp. Its searching gleam will reveal pitfalls unseen in
    the dark. The semi-darkness of loneliness may make the path of life rather
    difficult, but you are content, nevertheless, to wander along quietly until
    such time as you see your way to pass through the gloom into the sunshine
    of real love.</p>
  <p>Then, when you have found the one man or woman around whom your universe
    can safely revolve, you will realize how wise you were to travel on life&rsquo;s
    highway hopefully, if alone, and to reach your goal in full possession of
    your vitality and enthusiasm rather than to make a rush for the dazzle-light
    of passion and arrive dishevelled and blind.</p>
  <p>You will no doubt remind me that in a former chapter I have entreated you
    to live dangerously, to take risks for the sake of the ends you have in view.
    I do so still: in all things of life, m&rsquo;dears, be prepared to take
    risks, <i>but not in love</i>. Be very sure where you set your foot before
    you tread that wonderful path. Do not mistake the glamour of a momentary
    thrill for the true light of enduring love. Think twice before you dedicate
    your life to one who is not worthy of the sacrifice. Your gay bachelor and
    smart lavender-lady are happier far than those who wear the fetters of an
    unhappy marriage, and it is better never to have loved at all than to love
    amiss.</p>
  <p>Love still is, and always will be, the most romantic adventure in life.
    Not for the world would I have a single one of you deliberately refuse to
    embark on it. All that the great adventure demands of you is a trimmed lamp,
    clear-sightedness to distinguish what is true gold, the love that makes the
    poor infinitely rich, and which will wipe away your tears; the companionship
    that will ease life&rsquo;s burden for you and ensure for your domestic happiness,
    the only bliss of Paradise that has survived the Fall, the spice of life
    that gives it all its flavour.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    What Is The Price Of Love?</b> </h2>
  <p>I suppose that more has been written on the subject of love than on any
    other subject under the sun. Proverbs, wise saws, verses, romances&mdash;their
    number is legion; the brains of poets and of wits, dry minds of cynics and
    philosophers have, in their turn, been exhausted in finding the true definition
    of that subtle, elusive thing we call &lsquo;love&rsquo; and which only a
    lover understands.</p>
  <p>And in writing about love all those prose writers and versifiers have invariably
    set themselves the task of inquiring as to what exactly is the price to be
    paid for that rarefied commodity, and whether the possession of it is built
    on a secure foundation. And so out of the cudgelling of great brains came
    the wise saws: &lsquo;When poverty comes in at the door Love flies out of
    the window&rsquo;; or &lsquo;Love makes beggars of kings&rsquo;; or again, &lsquo;The
    first sigh of love is the last of wisdom&rsquo;; and I could quote a hundred
    more, but all these quotations m&rsquo;dears, smack more of wit than of truth.</p>
  <p>Are all those cynics and philosophers&mdash;aye! and all those poets&mdash;going
    to assert that this ethereal, unsubstantial thing which brightens every life
    into which it enters and cheers every heart it touches, is yet so poor and
    feeble that it shrivels at the touch of poverty? That it is so akin to madness
    that it warps reason and weakens judgement? That it can have the effect of
    stealing away a man&rsquo;s riches or his strength or his wisdom? I think
    not. And do not be led into believing it, either. I give you my word that
    this modern world of yours is not yet void of great lovers, of men and women
    who know in their heart of hearts that the magic touch of true love is more
    precious even to-day than all the gold of Ophir, or the diamonds of Golconda.</p>
  <p>But they will not proclaim their belief openly.</p>
  <p>Now you know, my friends, that if you were really to search your hearts
    you would be ready enough to admit that love is still the greatest incentive
    that will spur a man to noble deeds and selfless actions, that, far from
    destroying wisdom and sound sense it is the whetstone of enterprise and judgement.
    You do not have to pay a price for love. Love is its own price: it drives
    away fear, it conquers pain, it makes poverty and disappointment endurable,
    it scorns the enmity of the envious and derides the scoffings of the cynic.
    It is you, who love and are loved, who are immeasurably rich and they&mdash;the
    jaundiced modern scoffers&mdash;who are beggars in this world. It is the
    great, the selfless loves of millions of men and women that mount like incense
    to Heaven, and the jeers and gibes of cynics that like evil-smelling smoke
    defile the purity of the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>But, on the other hand, honour and duty do often exact a price which love
    must pay if it is to remain true to itself. When either of those two great
    forces call, love must often hide itself behind a veil of sorrow; I can assure
    you that many a time when I was in full possession of the joys and peace
    of my beautiful garden at Richmond and knew that Lady Blakeney was watching
    me with fear and doubt in the loveliest eyes that love of man ever filled
    with tears, I used to hear the low insistent sigh of suffering women and
    children in revolutionary Paris calling to me, and not even my loved one&rsquo;s
    tender arms nor her exquisite voice could then have kept me to her side.</p>
  <p>And for you also, m&rsquo;dears, suffering and sorrow are often the price
    which your love must pay should honour or duty call you. Most of you experienced
    the sorrow of parting, did you not, during the sad years of the War? You
    paid for the joys of love by many a heartache when you thought of <i>her</i> tears
    and the last kiss of farewell on the platform at Victoria Station.</p>
  <p>And in the same way some of you, alas! must pay for the happiness which
    you enjoyed when things were bright and prosperous at home, by the misery
    of seeing those you care for suffer for want of the small comforts or luxuries
    you would give your heart&rsquo;s blood to provide for them. Where there
    is no love, m&rsquo;dears, there can be no sorrow. Sorrow is the price you
    may have to pay for love; but is it not worth it? Would you not rather shed
    a bucketful of tears than miss the infinite joys that true love, reciprocated
    love alone, can give? Good old Dante, when he went to visit Hell to see how
    the shades were getting on there, would have it that over the gates of Hades
    there was graven the legend: &lsquo;For sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow is
    remembering happier things.&rsquo; And this saying he got from an anciet
    philosopher who averred that  &lsquo;In all adversity the most unhappy sort
    of misfortune is to have been happy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Faith! they may have been great men those two&mdash;they certainly were&mdash;but
    all the same I beg to differ from them. I&rsquo;ll pit my knowledge of the
    human heart against all their theories or their wisdom. There is a sweet
    fragrance in remembrance which no amount of sorrow can dispel; on the contrary,
    sorrow will etherealize all the thousand and one little events on which past
    happiness was built and turn them into a caress that will soothe the troubled
    mind and wipe away the tears.</p>
  <p>And it is in times of stress that true love shines with a clearer and purer
    light. The sharpness of the trial will in itself purge it from the dross
    of complacence and selfishness which life, more often than not, is apt to
    mix it with. So do not rail against love, m&rsquo;dears, if you have to pay
    for it at times with anxiety and a few tears. The joys it gives you will
    more than compensate you for any measure of suffering.</p>
  <p>And if in the end love does exact, as it unfortunately will, the greatest
    price of all the sorrow of life-long parting, do not even then rail against
    him. The Dark Angel does, alas! wield his awful sword sometimes to part young
    lovers, still in the rapture of their first kiss, or to sever the bonds that
    have held trusting comrades together for perhaps half a century.</p>
  <p>Even then, m&rsquo;dears, do not rail against love. &lsquo;It is better
    to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all,&rsquo; so said our
    national poet, and with him I am in complete agreement. Sceptics and cynics
    may say what they like, but I will put down my profession of faith even here
    and now. And it is this: Love is such a mighty power that it can bridge over
    the black chasm which lies between life and death. Perfect love is perfect
    trust, and those of you who have known true love, just as I did, cannot possibly
    believe for a moment that it can end in this material world. Love is <i>not</i> material;
    it is ethereal and sublime, and as such must endure for ever. You cannot
    bury it, you cannot cremate it. It is one of the attributes of eternity.</p>
  <p>The greatest most selfless love that ever burned for man on this earth reached
    its sublimity on Calvary. There it triumphed, once and for all, over the
    terrors of Death. And men to-day&mdash;you, m&rsquo;dears, I, the rest of
    the world&mdash;have learned through the grandeur of that sacrifice that
    human love is powerful enough to break the gates that part us from the loved
    one who has gone before, so that when our own time comes to cross the Great
    Divide we may hear the words: &lsquo;I love you. I am waiting for you&rsquo; come
    down to our ears from the realm of the stars, and our spirit grasp the spirit
    hand that beckons and points the way to the kingdom of undying love.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    Perfect Lover, Perfect Husband?</b> </h2>
  <p>If I were asked to decide whether men or women have more vivid imaginations,
    I vow &rsquo;twould not be so difficult a situation as that in which the
    unfortunate Paris found himself! To the ladies would I award the apple, without
    a doubt!</p>
  <p>I suppose every woman has had, at some time or other in her early life,
    a mental picture of what a perfect lover should be: tall, handsome, strong,
    kind, just the smallest touch of mystery, the epitome of honour and yet adorably
    human. Upon my soul, a difficult dream for us poor men to live up to!</p>
  <p>The girl sits dreaming, and in her happy, idle moments visualizes a first
    meeting with this dream-god she has created. Hand in hand she wanders with
    him in her dream along winding, moonlit paths, waiting, thrilled and breathless
    for those three little words which, when spoken by him, will change this
    prosaic world into Fairyland.</p>
  <p>And then one day she is acutely conscious of a small, glittering band on
    her third finger, and wonders how it has come to pass that the universe does
    not stand still in order to gaze enraptured on the new marvel, the perfect
    lover&mdash;her lover! As a matter of fact, the world has noticed the marvel,
    but to the girl&rsquo;s own friends and relations the man to whom she has
    become engaged is probably no more than barely good-looking, and it is extremely
    likely that he has some peculiarity or characteristic which they violently
    dislike.</p>
  <p>Girl friends make mental resolutions that when they choose a man he shall
    be something quite different; already they compare their own dreams to this
    reality that seems to them so poor, and they smile with a certain complacent
    indulgence when they meet the shining eyes of the girl whose dream-lover
    walks by her side. Married friends are more encouraging unless, perchance,
    their own matrimonial venture has been unlucky, but usually their thoughts
    dwell on their own perfect lover, even though to others he seems but a whimsical
    warning of complete prosiness when seen in his own home, clad in unromantic
    dressing-gown and carpet slippers, grunting from the depths of a capacious
    arm-chair, and with, perhaps, a cold in his head or gout in his big toe.
    Odd&rsquo;s my life! what a dream man&mdash;to you!</p>
  <p>To your thinking, in the halcyon time of your engagement, the world&mdash;your
    world&mdash;does not realize at once that the perfect lover of your dreams
    has come to life, whereas to you he has already taken on the form and shape
    of a hero of romance. What if he is of medium height and inclined to broadness?
    That only makes you realize what an odd mistake you made when you dreamt
    of him as one of those tall, ungainly, shapeless gawks! What if his nose
    be flattish and his eyes blue? Gadzooks! who would worship a hero with a
    bird-like beak and eyes like a savage? In your adolescent imagination you
    may (though you may not admit that you did!) have created a vague, godlike
    individual who looked like the illustration on the jacket of a sensational
    novel. But in the end what you have found is a perfect lover, a man whose
    character answers to your highest ideals of chivalry and manliness.</p>
  <p>Is he less romantic than the gallant armoured knight of old, who rode over
    hill and dale in order to slay dragons, or to do battle against all those
    miscreants who refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of his lady&rsquo;s
    beauty? Of course he is not! See the number of very real dragons he slays
    every day, when poverty and disappointment and threatening ill-health menace
    him. See how shrewdly and yet how fairly he wields his weapons of brain and
    muscle against clever, doughty or wealthy rivals; and yet, withal, see how
    chivalrous he is towards women and how kindly and gay he can be with little
    children.</p>
  <p>He is the hero of your dreams, madame, the perfect lover of your imagination.
    How does he stand in your eyes when, at last, you have trod with him the
    magic way up to the altar, and heard right through the thunder of the Wedding
    March the paean of your victory in winning this <i>beau ideal</i> for yourself
    against all the world? Does the glamour of him wear thin against the hard,
    prosaic things of everyday life? If a man cannot be a hero to his lackey,
    can he possibly pose unruffled and unshaken on his pedestal before his wife&rsquo;s
    clear eyes?</p>
  <p>Do not doubt it for a moment! You need no pedestal for the man you love;
    all you need for him, all he wants above all other things, is a place in
    your heart and to live in intimate and close companionship with you. If you,
    in your turn, have given him love for love, and if you have had the patience
    and the courage to wait till he, the bridegroom of your dreams, came to you,
    then marriage will surely be the portal to a realm of supreme and unchanging
    bliss. Your perfect lover will be the perfect husband, without whom as your
    helpmate and friend you can never know the perfection of life or the sublimity
    of romance.</p>
  <p>In the course of years, when Father Time has laid a finger on the perfect
    lover and he finds increasing difficulty in persuading his hair to cover
    the bald patch on the top of his head, Love the Alchemist, having transmuted
    the evanescent metal of your girlish visions into the solid gold of conjugal
    happiness, will touch your eyes with magic so that you will only see the
    strong brave, kindly soul shining through his loving eyes. If rheumatism
    in the joints makes him a little slower in opening the door for you than
    he was forty years ago, Cupid will bewitch you, while you wait, with the
    understanding of the fine courage and increasing tenderness which has, for
    a lifetime, marked him for your perfect, gentle knight.</p>
  <p>Your world to-day is no less full of magicians, giants, witches, gnomes
    and fairies than it was in the legendary time of King Arthur. Luck is a magician
    able to change your lives from drab to gold; care is a witch who can steal
    your beauty and line your face in a night; despair is a giant who can torture
    you and hold you in his iron grip until your perfect lover and perfect husband
    comes to your rescue as the sublime knight-errant; rebellious, unkind thoughts
    are demmed unpleasant little gnomes to tease you, and friendly, happy ones
    are the fairies that lighten your burden while you wander down the high road
    of life.</p>
  <p>The Chief Magician of them all is love, love the ruler of men, the king
    of all the world, whom no amount of scoffing and of sneering has ever dethroned;
    love the dear tyrant of my time and yours, whose light no modernism can dim;
    love which has brightened the lives of millions of us and whose torch will
    be kept aflame for all the aeons to come. Let the world sneer and laugh,
    but if love gives the fortunate man of your choice the divine accolade and
    dubs him Sir Perfect Lover, or Sir Perfect Husband, then his companionship
    and comradeship will make every dark hour seem bright, every sorrow endurable,
    every joy doubly great, all through your life and in the great unknown that
    is to come.</p>

    Leaving You At The Altar</b> </h2>
  <p>When first I made up my mind to come out into the golden light of your everyday
    life, I vow that I positively shivered at all the misery, the sorrow, the
    drabness of existence, which you yourselves led me to believe made up the
    sum total of your lives in this twentieth century. Much less did I relish
    the thought of compiling a whole book on what I feared would be a most depressing
    task. This work, I said, will fatigue me most atrociously; it will bore me
    most unhappily; I verily feared that my exuberant romanticism would be shipwrecked
    under the strain.</p>
  <p>And now, here I am at the last chapter of this little book and it seems
    to me that the time which I have spent in this fascinating, marvellous new
    world of yours was but the space of a breath. I have only seen a few of its
    hundreds of astonishing facets, and, believe me, I feel that there are thousands
    more of which I have not even caught a glimpse. So I&rsquo;ll console myself
    with the thought of another visit to you all at some future time.</p>
  <p>I know you will forgive me if I make use of this final chapter for the benefit
    of those of you young moderns who will wake one morning soon to the sound
    of your own wedding-bells.</p>
  <p>The latest fashion, it seems, is to treat marriage as nothing more or less
    than a business contract. Had this been any but my last chapter I would have
    resisted so monstrous a suggestion and written twenty more to make out a
    case for love. But things being as they are, let us by all means treat this
    marriage question as strictly business, and let me begin by asking you how
    you individually would approach a business proposition? I know little of
    such things, but I venture to presume that you would expect in a business
    partner an upright, honourable character, a clean bill of health and a full
    measure of discretion, ability, of sense, and of honour. Pessimists, when
    I started this book, might have confounded me with the argument that these
    things are not to be found in modern business men, but now that I know more
    about you all, and know that there are just as many sterling qualities to
    be found in your men of to-day as ever there were in the past, I can, in
    my turn, confound your pessimists.</p>
  <p>You would also doubtless refuse to enter into business partnership with
    a person who looked upon the contract as a sort of slipknot. Odd&rsquo;s
    my life! if business was to be run in the slipshod manner in which some of
    you moderns deal with matrimony, the bankruptcy courts would be kept as busy
    as are the divorce courts, and the finances of the entire world would soon
    be engulfed in chaos.</p>
  <p>You know as well as I do&mdash;better probably&mdash;that for a business
    to be successful it needs to be carried on by men or women who have brains,
    initiative, training and tact. But so does marriage, m&rsquo;dears! All the
    qualities which you expect to find in your successful business men you must
    look for in the partner who is to be life&rsquo;s companion, to whom you
    are going to entrust your happiness, your future and, what&rsquo;s more,
    the future of your children.</p>
  <p>What chances, think you, would a business have if its principals knew nothing
    of its workings? Yet how many of you dear, irresponsible young things trip
    lightly up to the altar and embark on the serious business of matrimony,
    blissfully ignorant of how to cook a dinner, engage a maid, furnish a house
    or earn a regular income? No one would think of designing a public building
    without becoming first a qualified architect, and the law forbids any man
    to practise medicine without due qualifications, the result of years of strenuous
    study; yet one sees numberless men and women entering the serious state of
    marriage without the slightest idea of the duties and responsibilities it
    will presently entail. Can you wonder, then, that so many marriages end in
    recriminations, in heartbreakings and sorrow, and finally in the divorce
    court?</p>
  <p>Is marriage a business? Well, we will not argue over the word. &rsquo;Tis
    you moderns who choose to call it so, and then deride it because, forsooth,
    in your estimation its profit-and-loss account points to bankruptcy. What
    you want to do, m&rsquo;dears, is to look upon marriage as a business if
    you must, but also as a foundation&mdash;the only solid one&mdash;on which
    you can raise the edifice of lifelong happiness. By it alone can you obtain
    comradeship, sympathy and understanding, and that wonderful feeling that
    in the world there is one being whose interests are absolutely identical
    with yours.</p>
  <p>All of you young moderns, I know, are fond of saying that by marriage you
    lose your freedom. So you do. You lose the freedom of wandering uncared for
    on life&rsquo;s highway, the freedom of weeping alone and uncomforted when
    sorrow assails you. You lose the freedom of suffering in loneliness, and
    of being forced to bottle up your joy because there is no one who cares enough
    to share it with you. Well, m&rsquo;dears, if that be freedom, give me all
    the fetters that love can forge: home ties, friendship, not to mention baby
    fingers that cling so tightly to the heart.</p>
  <p>Have I lost something of glamour in your eyes now that I have made you think
    of me, not as the hero of a hundred adventures in the romantic days of revolutionary
    France, but as a romanticist who has learned that in all the adventures of
    life there is none to compare with the one we embark on when we set forth
    to choose our helpmate?</p>
  <p>Once more, I pray you, charge your glasses, you lovely, sleek-headed, slim-legged
    Amazons, and you ambitious, enterprising Britons all! Drink to the master
    of you all&mdash;Love the King! He is all that matters in life, and in this
    great business of living he is the profit&mdash;worth all the gold of the
    Indies and all the laurel wreaths ever woven, on which you can count as a
    set-off against failure or disappointment or sorrow.</p>
  <p>On this let me make my bow to you of this still young century, happy in
    the knowledge that your world of to-day is every whit as romantic as it was
    in the past. Your men are as gallant, your women as charming as ever they
    were. There is as much romance in your civilization, your commerce and your
    marvellous inventions, as there were in medieval jousts, in duelling or poesy.
    Let me express the earnest hope that I have convinced you of this. Rub your
    eyes, m&rsquo;dears, and take another look at your world. Do not allow those
    demmed cynics and pessimists to be for ever pointing to mud-heaps and gutters,
    telling you that they are the realities of life; for I vow that real life
    is full to overflowing of fragrance and of beauty. Look about you, m&rsquo;dears
    and see the loyalties, the friendships, the silent endurances and sacrifice
    that meet you at every turn. And then, I pray you, murmur to yourself:  &lsquo;Well,
    I declare that demmed elusive Pimpernel of ours does know a thing or two!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Gentlemen, your servant!</p>
  <p>Ladies, as ever, your most devoted slave!</p>
