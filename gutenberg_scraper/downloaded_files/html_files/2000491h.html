  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Prologue"></a>Prologue<br>
    Mons: September, 1572</b></h2>
  <p>It lacked two hours before the dawn on this sultry night early in September.
    The crescent moon had long ago sunk behind a bank of clouds in the west,
    and not a sound stirred the low-lying land around the besieged city.</p>
  <p>To the south the bivouac fires of Alva&rsquo;s camp had died out one by
    one, and here the measured tread of the sentinels on their beat alone broke
    the silence of the night. To the north, where valorous Orange with a handful
    of men&mdash;undisciplined, unpaid and rebellious&mdash;vainly tried to provoke
    his powerful foe into a pitched battle, relying on God for the result, there
    was greater silence still. The sentinels&mdash;wearied and indifferent&mdash;had
    dropped to sleep at their post: the troops, already mutinous, only held to
    their duty by the powerful personality of the Prince, slept as soundly as
    total indifference to the cause for which they were paid to fight could possibly
    allow.</p>
  <p>In his tent even Orange&mdash;tired out with ceaseless watching&mdash;had
    gone to rest. His guards were in a profound sleep.</p>
  <p>Then it was that from the south there came a stir, and from Alva&rsquo;s
    entrenchments waves of something alive that breathed in the darkness of the
    night were set in motion, like when the sea rolls inwards to the shore.</p>
  <p>Whispered words set this living mass on its way, and anon it was crawling
    along&mdash;swiftly and silently&mdash;more silently than incoming waves
    on a flat shore&mdash;on and on, always northwards in the direction of the
    Prince of Orange&rsquo;s camp, like some gigantic snake that creeps with
    belly close to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don Ramon,&rdquo; whispered a voice in the darkness, &ldquo;let Captain
    Romero deal with the sentinels and lead the surprise attack, whilst you yourself
    make straight for the Prince&rsquo;s tent; overpower his guard first, then
    seize his person. Two hundred ducats will be your reward, remember, if you
    bring Orange back here&mdash;a prisoner&mdash;and a ducat for each of your
    men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These were the orders and don Ramon de Linea sped forward with six hundred
    arquebusiers&mdash;all picked men&mdash;they wore their shirts over their
    armour, so that in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e which was to come they might recognise
    one another in the gloom.</p>
  <p>Less than a league of flat pasture land lay between Alva&rsquo;s entrenchments
    at St. Florian near the gates of beleaguered Mons, and Orange&rsquo;s camp
    at Hermigny. But at St. Florian men stirred and planned and threatened, whilst
    at Hermigny even the sentinels slept. Noble-hearted Orange had raised the
    standard of revolt against the most execrable oppression of an entire people
    which the world has ever known&mdash;and he could not get more than a handful
    of patriots to fight for their own freedom against the tyranny and the might
    of Spain, whilst mercenary troops were left to guard the precious life of
    the indomitable champion of religious and civil liberties.</p>
  <p>The moving mass of de Linea&rsquo;s arquebusiers had covered half a league
    of the intervening ground; their white shirts only just distinguishable in
    the gloom made them look like ghosts; only another half-league&mdash;less
    perhaps&mdash;separated them from their goal, and still no one stirred in
    Orange&rsquo;s camp. Then it was that something roused the sentinels from
    their sleep. A rough hand shook first one then the others by the shoulder,
    and out of the gloom a peremptory voice whispered hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick! awake! sound the alarm! An <i>encamisada</i> is upon you.
    You will all be murdered in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even before the drowsy sentinels had time to rouse themselves or to
    rub their eyes, the same rough hand had shaken the Prince&rsquo;s guard,
    the same peremptory voice had called: &ldquo;Awake! the Spaniards are upon
    you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the Prince&rsquo;s tent a faint light was glimmering. He himself was
    lying fully dressed and armed upon a couch. At sound of the voice, of his
    guards stirring, of the noise and bustle of a wakening camp, he sat up just
    in time to see a tall figure in the entrance of his tent.</p>
  <p>The feeble light threw but into a dim relief this tall figure of a man,
    clad in dark, shapeless woollen clothes wearing a hood of the same dark stuff
    over his head and a leather mask over his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leatherface!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince as he jumped to his feet. &ldquo;What
    is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A night attack,&rdquo; replied a muffled voice behind the mask. &ldquo;Six
    hundred arquebusiers&mdash;they are but half a league away!&mdash;I would
    have been here sooner only the night is so infernally dark, I caught my foot
    in a rabbit-hole and nearly broke my ankle&mdash;I am as lame as a Jew&rsquo;s
    horse ... but still in time,&rdquo; he added as he hastily helped the Prince
    to adjust his armour and straighten out his clothes.</p>
  <p>The camp was alive now with call to arms and rattle of steel, horses snorting
    and words of command flying to and fro. Don Ramon de Linea, a quarter of
    a league away, heard these signs of troops well on the alert and he knew
    that the surprise attack had failed. Six hundred arquebusiers&mdash;though
    they be picked men&mdash;were not sufficient for a formal attack on the Prince
    of Orange&rsquo;s entire cavalry. Even mercenary and undisciplined troops
    will fight valiantly when their lives depend upon their valour. De Linea
    thought it best to give the order to return to camp.</p>
  <p>And the waves of living men which had been set in motion an hour ago, now
    swiftly and silently went back the way they came. Don Ramon when he came
    once more in the camp at St. Florian and in the presence of Alva&rsquo;s
    captain-in-chief, had to report the failure of the night attack which had
    been so admirably planned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole camp at Hermigny was astir,&rdquo; he said as he chawed
    the ends of his heavy moustache, for he was sorely disappointed. &ldquo;I
    could not risk an attack under those conditions. Our only chance of winning
    was by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who gave the alarm?&rdquo; queried don Frederic de Toledo, who took
    no pains to smother the curses that rose to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The devil, I suppose,&rdquo; growled don Ramon de Linea savagely.</p>
  <p>And out at Hermigny&mdash;in Orange&rsquo;s tent&mdash;the man who was called
    Leatherface was preparing to go as quietly and mysteriously as he had come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be on you, Monseigneur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now
    that they know your troops are astir. But if I were you,&rdquo; he added
    grimly, &ldquo;I would have every one of those sentinels shot at dawn. They
    were all of them fast asleep when I arrived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave the military salute and would have turned to go without another
    word but that the Prince caught him peremptorily by the arm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, Messire, how shall I thank you again?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By guarding your precious life, Monseigneur,&rdquo;  replied the
    man simply. &ldquo;The cause of freedom in the Low Countries would never
    survive your loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; retorted the Prince of Orange with a winning smile, &ldquo;if
    that be so, then the cause of our freedom owes as much to you as it does
    to me. Is it the tenth time&mdash;or the twelfth&mdash;that you have saved
    my life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since you will not let me fight with you...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you do anything you wish, Messire, for you would be
    as fine a soldier as you are a loyal friend. But are you not content with
    the splendid services which you are rendering to us now? Putting aside mine
    own life&mdash;which mayhap is not worthless&mdash;how many times has your
    warning saved mine and my brother&rsquo;s troops from surprise attacks? How
    many times have Noircarmes&rsquo; or don Frederic&rsquo;s urgent appeals
    for reinforcements failed, through your intervention, to reach the Duke of
    Alva until our own troops were able to rally? Ah, Messire, believe me! God
    Himself has chosen you for this work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The work of a spy, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the other not without
    a touch of bitterness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! if you call yourself a spy, Messire, then shall the name of &lsquo;spy&rsquo; be
    henceforth a name of glory to its wearer, synonymous with the loftiest patriotism
    and noblest self-sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held out his hand to the man with the mask, who bent his tall figure
    over it in dutiful respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see how well I keep to my share of the compact, Messire. Never
    once&mdash;even whilst we were alone&mdash;hath your name escaped my lips.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For which act of graciousness, Monseigneur, I do offer you my humble
    thanks. May God guard your Highness through every peril! The cause of justice
    and of liberty rests in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After another deeply respectful bow he finally turned to go. He had reached
    the entrance of the tent when once more the Prince spoke to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When shall I see you again&mdash;Leatherface?&rdquo; he asked cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When your Highness&rsquo; precious life or the safety of your army
    are in danger,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God reward you!&rdquo; murmured Orange fervently as the man with
    the mask disappeared into the night.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1<br>
    The Blood Council</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Less than a month later, and tyranny is once more triumphant. Mons has capitulated,
    Orange has withdrawn his handful of mutinous troops into Holland, Valenciennes
    has been destroyed and Mechlin&mdash;beautiful, gracious, august Mechlin&mdash;with
    her cathedrals and her trade-halls, her ancient monuments of art and civilisation
    has been given over for three days to the lust and rapine of Spanish soldiery!</p>
  <p>Three whole days! E&rsquo;en now we think on those days and shudder&mdash;shudder
    at what we know, at what the chroniclers have told us, the sacking of churches,
    the pillaging of monasteries, the massacre of peaceful, harmless citizens!</p>
  <p>Three whole days during which the worst demons that infest hell itself,
    the worst demons that inspire the hideous passions of men&mdash;greed, revenge
    and cruelty&mdash;were let loose upon the stately city whose sole offence
    had been that she had for twenty-four hours harboured Orange and his troops
    within her gates and closed them against the tyrant&rsquo;s soldiery!</p>
  <p>Less than a month and Orange is a fugitive, and all the bright hopes for
    the cause of religious and civil freedom are once more dashed to the ground.
    It seems as if God Himself hath set His face against the holy cause! Mons
    has fallen and Mechlin is reduced to ashes, and over across the borders the
    King of France has caused ten thousand of his subjects to be massacred&mdash;one
    holy day, the feast of St. Bartholomew&mdash;ten thousand of them!&mdash;just
    because their religious beliefs did not coincide with his own. The appalling
    news drove Orange and his small army to flight&mdash;he had reckoned on help
    from the King of France&mdash;instead of that promised help the news of the
    massacre of ten thousand Protestants! Catholic Europe was horror-stricken
    at the crime committed in the name of religion; but in the Low Countries,
    Spanish tyranny had scored a victory&mdash;the ignoble Duke of Alva triumphed
    and the cause of freedom in Flanders and Hainault and Brabant received a
    blow from which it did not again recover for over three hundred years!</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Outwardly the house where the Duke of Alva lodged in Brussels was not different
    to many of the same size in the city. It was built of red brick with stone
    base and finely-carved cornice, and had a high slate roof with picturesque
    dormer windows therein. The windows on the street level were solidly grilled
    and were ornamented with richly-carved pediments, as was the massive doorway
    too. The door itself was of heavy oak, and above it there was a beautifully
    wrought niche which held a statue of the Virgin.</p>
  <p>On the whole it looked a well-constructed, solid and roomy house, and Mme.
    de Jassy, its owner, had placed it at the disposal of the Lieutenant-Governor
    when first he arrived in Brussels, and he had occupied it ever since. The
    idler as he strolled past the house would hardly pause to look at it, if
    he did not happen to know that behind those brick walls and grilled windows
    a work of oppression more heinous than this world had ever known before,
    was being planned and carried on by a set of cruel and execrable tyrants
    against an independent country and a freedom-loving people.</p>
  <p>Here in the dining-hall the Duke of Alva would preside at the meetings of
    the Grand Council&mdash;the Council of Blood&mdash;sitting in a high-backed
    chair which had the arms of Spain emblazoned upon it. Juan de Vargas and
    Alberic del Rio usually sat to right and left of him. Del Rio&mdash;indolent
    and yielding&mdash;a mere tool for the carrying out of every outrage, every
    infamy which the fiendish brain of those tyrants could devise wherewith to
    crush the indomitable spirit of a proud nation jealous of its honour and
    of its liberties: and de Vargas&mdash;Alva&rsquo;s double and worthy lieutenant&mdash;no
    tool he, but a terrible reality, active and resourceful in the invention
    of new forms of tyranny, new fetters for the curbing of stiff-necked Flemish
    and Dutch burghers, new methods for wringing rivers of gold out of a living
    stream of tears and blood.</p>
  <p>De Vargas!&mdash;the very name stinks in the nostrils of honest men even
    after the lapse of centuries!&mdash;It conjures up the hideous image of a
    human bloodhound&mdash;lean and sallow of visage, with drooping, heavy-lidded
    eyes and flaccid mouth, a mouth that sneered and jested when men, women and
    children were tortured and butchered, eyes that gloated at sight of stake
    and scaffold and gibbet&mdash;and within the inner man, a mind intent on
    the science of murder and rapine and bloodshed.</p>
  <p>Alva the will that commanded! Vargas the brain that devised! Del Rio the
    hand that accomplished!</p>
  <p>Men sent by Philip II. of Spain, the most fanatical tyrant the world has
    ever known, to establish the abhorrent methods of the Spanish Inquisition
    in the Low Countries in order to consolidate Spanish rule there and wrest
    from prosperous Flanders and Brabant and Hainault, from Holland and the Dutch
    provinces enough gold to irrigate the thirsty soil of Spain. &ldquo;The river
    of gold which will flow from the Netherlands to Madrid shall be a yard deep!&rdquo; so
    had Alva boasted when his infamous master sent him to quell the revolt which
    had noble-hearted Orange for its leader&mdash;a revolt born of righteous
    indignation and an unconquerable love of freedom and of justice.</p>
  <p>To mould the Netherlands into abject vassals of Spain, to break their independence
    of spirit by terrorism and by outrage, to force Spanish ideas, Spanish culture,
    Spanish manners, Spanish religion upon these people of the North who loathed
    tyranny and worshipped their ancient charters and privileges, that was the
    task which the Duke of Alva set himself to do&mdash;a task for which he needed
    the help of men as tyrannical and unscrupulous as himself.</p>
  <p>Granvelle had begun the work, Alva was completing it! The stake, the scaffold,
    the gibbet for all who had one thought of justice, one desire for freedom.
    Mons razed to the ground, Valenciennes a heap of ruins and ashes, Mechlin
    a hecatomb. Men, women and children outraged and murdered! Whole families
    put to the torture to wring gold from unwilling givers! churches destroyed!
    monasteries ransacked!</p>
  <p>That was the work of the Grand Council&mdash;the odious Council of Blood,
    the members of which have put to shame the very name of religion, for they
    dared to pretend that they acted in its name.</p>
  <p>Alva! de Vargas! del Rio! A trinity of fiends whose deeds would shame the
    demons in hell! But there were others too, and, O ye gods! were they not
    infinitely more vile, since their hands reeked with the blood of their own
    kith and kin? Alva and his two bloodhounds were strangers in a strange land,
    owing allegiance to Spain alone&mdash;but Councillor Hessels sat on this
    same infamous board, and he was a patrician of Brabant. And there was Pierre
    Arsens, president of Artois, there was de Berlaymont and Viglius and Hopper&mdash;gentlemen
    (save the mark!) and burghers of Flanders or Hainault or the Dutch provinces!&mdash;and
    who can name such creatures without a shudder of loathing?</p>
  <h3>3</h3>
  <p>As for don Ramon de Linea, he was just the usual type of Spanish soldier&mdash;a
    grandee of Spain, direct descendant of the Cid, so he averred, yet disdained
    to prove it. For in him there was no sense of chivalry&mdash;just personal
    bravery and no more&mdash;the same kind of bravery you would meet in a tiger
    or a jaguar. In truth there was much in common between don Ramon and the
    wild feline tribes that devastate the deserts: he had the sinuous movements,
    the languorous gestures of those creatures, and his eyes&mdash;dark and velvety
    at times, at others almost of an orange tint&mdash;had all the cruel glitter
    which comes into the eyes of the leopard when he is out to kill. Otherwise
    don Ramon was a fine-looking man, dark-skinned and dark-eyed, a son of the
    South, with all those cajoling ways about him which please and so often deceive
    the women.</p>
  <p>He it was who had been in command at Mechlin&mdash;entrusted by General
    de Noircarmes with the hideous task of destroying the stately city&mdash;and
    he had done it with a will. Overproud of his achievements he had obtained
    leave to make personal report of them to the Lieutenant-Governor, and thus
    it was that on this 2nd day of October, 1572, he was present at the council
    board, talking with easy grace and no little satisfaction of all that he
    had done: of the churches which he had razed to the ground, the houses which
    he had sacked, of the men, women and children whom he had turned out naked
    and starving into the streets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We laboured hard for three days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the troops
    worked with a will, for there were heavy arrears of pay due to them and we
    told them to make up those arrears in Mechlin, since they wouldn&rsquo;t
    get any money from headquarters. Oh! Mechlin got all that she deserved! Her
    accursed citizens can now repent at leisure of their haste in harbouring
    Orange and his rebel troops!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice was deep and mellow and even the guttural Spanish consonants sounded
    quite soft when he spoke them. Through half-closed lids his glance swept
    from time to time over the eager faces around the board, and his slender
    hands emphasised the hideous narrative with a few graceful gestures. He looked
    just the true type of grand seigneur telling a tale of mild adventure and
    of sport, and now and then he laughed displaying his teeth, sharp and white
    like the fangs of a leopard&rsquo;s cub.</p>
  <p>No one interrupted him, and Councillor Hessels fell gradually&mdash;as was
    his wont&mdash;into a gentle doze from which he roused himself now and again
    in order to murmur drowsily: &ldquo;To the gallows with them all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Viglius and Hopper and de Berlaymont tried hard to repress a shudder. They
    were slaves of Spain, these gentlemen of the Low Countries, but not Spanish
    born, and were not accustomed from earliest childhood to listen&mdash;not
    only unmoved but with a certain measure of delight&mdash;to these tales of
    horror. But there was nothing in what don Ramon said of which they disapproved.
    They were&mdash;all of them&mdash;loyal subjects of the King, and the very
    thought of rebellion was abhorrent to them.</p>
  <p>But it was passing strange that the Duke of Alva made no comment on the
    young captain&rsquo;s report. There he sat, at the head of the table, silent
    and moody, with one bony fist clenched above a letter which lay open beneath
    his hand, and which bore a large red seal with the royal arms of Spain impressed
    upon it. Not a word of praise or blame did he speak. His heavy brows were
    contracted in a sullen frown, and his protruding eyes were veiled beneath
    the drooping lids.</p>
  <p>De Vargas, too, was silent&mdash;de Vargas who loved to gloat over such
    tales as don Ramon had to tell, de Vargas who believed that these rebellious
    Low Countries could only be brought into subjection by such acts of demoniacal
    outrage as the Spanish soldiery had just perpetrated in Mons and in Mechlin.
    He, too, appeared moody to-day, and the story of sick women and young children
    being dragged out of their beds and driven out to perish in the streets while
    their homes were being pillaged and devastated, left him taciturn and unmoved.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon made vain pretence not to notice the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s
    moodiness, nor yet de Vargas&rsquo; silence, but those who knew him best&mdash;and
    de Vargas was among these&mdash;plainly saw that irritation had seized upon
    his nerves. He was talking more volubly, and his voice had lost its smoothness,
    whilst the languor of his gestures had given place to sharp, febrile movements
    of hands and shoulders which he tried vainly to disguise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our soldiers,&rdquo; he was saying loudly, &ldquo;did not leave a
    loaf of bread in the bakeries, or a bushel of wheat in the stores of Mechlin.
    The rich citizens we hanged at the rate of twenty a day, and I drew orders
    for the confiscation of their estates to the benefit of our Most Gracious
    King and suzerain Lord. I tell you we made quick work of all the rebels:
    stone no longer stands on stone in Mechlin to-day: its patricians are beggars,
    its citizens are scattered. We have put to the torture and burned at the
    stake those who refused to give us their all. A month ago Mechlin was a prosperous
    city: she gave of her wealth and of her hospitality to the rebel troops of
    Orange. To-day she and her children have ceased to be. Are you not satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He brought his clenched fist crashing down upon the table: surely a very
    unusual loss of restraint in a grandee of Spain: but obviously he found it
    more and more difficult to keep his temper under control, and those dark
    eyes of his were now fixed with a kind of fierce resentment upon the impassive
    face of the Duke.</p>
  <p>Councillor Hessels, only half awake, reiterated with drowsy emphasis: &ldquo;To
    the gallows with them! Send them all to the gallows!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still the Duke of Alva was silent and de Vargas did not speak. Yet it was
    the Duke himself who had given the order for the destruction of Mechlin: &ldquo;as
    a warning to other cities,&rdquo; he had said. And now he sat at the head
    of the table sullen, moody and frowning, and don Ramon felt an icy pang of
    fear gripping him by the throat: the thought that censure of his conduct
    was brewing in the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s mind caused him to lose the
    last vestige of self-control, for he knew that censure could have but one
    sequel&mdash;quick judgment and the headman&rsquo;s axe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you not satisfied?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;What more
    did you expect? What more ought we to have done? What other proof of zeal
    does King Philip ask of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus directly challenged the Duke raised his head and looked the young man
    sternly in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What you have done, Messire,&rdquo; he said slowly&mdash;and the
    cold glitter in his steely eyes held in it more real and calculating cruelty
    than the feline savagery of the other man, &ldquo;what you have done is good,
    but it is not enough. What use is there in laying low an entire city, when
    the one man whose personality holds the whole of this abominable rebellion
    together still remains unscathed? You hanged twenty noted citizens a day
    in Mechlin, you say,&rdquo; he added with a cynical shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;I
    would gladly see every one of them spared, so long as Orange&rsquo;s head
    fell on the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orange has disbanded his army and has fled almost alone into Holland,&rdquo; said
    don Ramon sullenly. &ldquo;My orders were to punish Mechlin and not to run
    after the Prince of Orange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The order to bring the Prince of Orange alive or dead to Brussels
    and to me takes precedence of every other order, as you well know, Messire,&rdquo; retorted
    Alva roughly. &ldquo;We decided on that unanimously at the meeting of the
    Grand Council on the day that I sent Egmont and Horn to the scaffold and
    Orange refused to walk into the trap which I had set for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He always escapes from the traps which are set for him,&rdquo; now
    broke in de Vargas in his calm, even, expressionless voice. &ldquo;During
    the siege of Mons, according to don Frederic&rsquo;s report, no fewer than
    six surprise night-attacks&mdash;all admirably planned&mdash;failed, because
    Orange appeared to have received timely warning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who should know that better than I, se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;  queried
    don Ramon hotly, &ldquo;seeing that I led most of those attacks myself&mdash;they
    were splendidly planned, our men as silent as ghosts, the night darker than
    hell. Not a word of the plan was breathed until I gave the order to start.
    Yet someone gave the alarm. We found Orange&rsquo;s camp astir&mdash;every
    time we had to retire. Who but the devil could have given the warning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A spy more astute than yourselves,&rdquo; quoth Alva dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; here interposed del Rio blandly, &ldquo;I am of the same
    opinion as don Ramon de Linea; there is a subtle agency at work which appears
    to guard the life of the Prince of Orange. I myself was foiled many a time
    when I was on his track&mdash;with Ribeiras who wields a dagger in the dark
    more deftly than any man I know. I also employed Loronzo, who graduated in
    Venice in the art of poisons, but invariably the Prince slipped through our
    fingers just as if he had been put on his guard by some mysterious emissary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The loyalists in Flanders,&rdquo; quoth President Viglius under his
    breath, &ldquo;declare that the agency which works for the safety of the
    Prince of Orange is a supernatural one. They speak of a tall, manlike figure
    whose face is hidden by a mask, and who invariably appears whenever the Prince
    of Orange&rsquo;s life is in danger. Some people call this mysterious being &lsquo;Leatherface,&rsquo;  but
    no one seems actually to have seen him. It sounds as if he were truly an
    emissary of the devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as the President spoke, a strange silence fell around the council board:
    every cheek had become pale, every lip quivered. De Vargas made a quick sign
    of the Cross over his chest: Alva drew a small medal from the inside of his
    doublet and kissed it devoutly. These men who talked airily of rapine and
    of violence perpetrated against innocent people, who gloated over torture
    and misery which they loved to inflict, were held in the cold grip of superstitious
    fear, and their trembling lips uttered abject prayers for mercy to the God
    whom they outraged by every act of their infamous lives.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>When the Duke of Alva spoke again, his voice was still unsteady: &ldquo;Devil
    or no devil,&rdquo; he said with an attempt at dignified composure, &ldquo;His
    majesty&rsquo;s latest orders are quite peremptory. He desires the death
    of Orange. He will have no more cities destroyed, no more wholesale massacres
    until that great object is attained. Pressure has been brought to bear upon
    him: the Emperor, it seems, has spoken authoritatively, and with no uncertain
    voice. It seems that the destruction of Flemish cities is abhorrent to the
    rest of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rebel cities!&rdquo; ejaculated de Berlaymont hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! we know well enough that they are rebel cities,&rdquo; quoth
    Alva fiercely, &ldquo;but what can we do, when a milk-livered weakling wears
    the Imperial crown? Our gracious King himself dares not disregard the Emperor&rsquo;s
    protests&mdash;and in his last letter to me he commands that we should hold
    our hand and neither massacre a population nor destroy a town unless we have
    proof positive that both are seething with rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seething with rebellion!&rdquo; exclaimed don Ramon, &ldquo;then
    what of Ghent&mdash;which is a very nest of rebels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; retorted Alva, &ldquo;Ghent by the Mass! Seigniors, all
    of you who know that accursed city, bring me proof that she harbours Orange
    or his troops! Bring me proof that she gives him money! Bring me proof that
    plots against our Government are hatched within her walls! I have moral proofs
    that Orange has been in Ghent lately, that he is levying troops within her
    very walls&mdash;I know that he has received promises of support from some
    of her most influential citizens...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, then, let your Highness but give the order,&rdquo;  broke in
    don Ramon once more, &ldquo;my soldiers would spend three fruitful days in
    Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I pointed out to His Highness yesterday,&rdquo;  rejoined de Vargas
    in mellifluous tones, &ldquo;we should reduce Ghent to ashes before she hatches
    further mischief against us. Once a city hath ceased to be, it can no longer
    be a source of danger to the State ... and,&rdquo; he added blandly,  &ldquo;there
    is more money in Ghent than in any other city of Flanders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And more rebellion in one family there than in the whole of the population
    of Brabant,&rdquo; assented Councillor Arsens. &ldquo;I have lived in that
    accursed city all my life,&rdquo; he continued savagely, &ldquo;and I say
    that Ghent ought not to be allowed to exist a day longer than is necessary
    for massing together two or three regiments of unpaid soldiery and turning
    them loose into the town&mdash;just as we did in Mechlin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The others nodded approval</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And by the Mass...&rdquo; resumed don Ramon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough, Messire,&rdquo; broke in the Duke peremptorily,  &ldquo;who
    are you, I pray, who are you all to be thus discussing the orders of His
    Majesty the King? I have transmitted to you His Majesty&rsquo;s orders just
    as I received them from Madrid yesterday. It is for you&mdash;for us all&mdash;to
    show our zeal and devotion at this critical moment in our nation&rsquo;s
    history, by obeying blindly, whole-heartedly, those gracious commands. Do
    we want our King to be further embarrassed by a quarrel with the Emperor?
    And what are those orders, I ask you? Wise and Christianlike as usual. His
    Majesty doth not forbid the punishment of rebel cities&mdash;No!&mdash;all
    that he asks is that we deliver Orange unto him&mdash;Orange, the arch-traitor&mdash;and
    that in future we prove conclusively to Europe and to Maximilian that when
    we punish a Flemish city we do so with unquestioned justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and his prominent, heavy-lidded eyes wandered somewhat contemptuously
    on the sullen faces around the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Proofs, seigniors,&rdquo; he said with a light shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;proofs
    are not difficult to obtain. All you want is a good friend inside a city
    to keep you well informed. The paid spy is not sufficient&mdash;oft-times
    he is clumsy and himself an object of suspicion. Orange has been in Ghent,
    seigniors; he will go again! He has disbanded his army, but at his call another
    will spring up ... in Ghent mayhap ... where he has so many friends ... where
    money is plentiful and rebellion rife.... We must strike at Ghent before
    she becomes an open menace...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never strike at Orange,&rdquo; broke in Councillor Arsens
    obstinately, &ldquo;while that creature Leatherface is at large.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is said to hail from Ghent,&rdquo; added Viglius with conviction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then by the Mass, seigniors,&rdquo; interposed Alva fiercely, &ldquo;the
    matter is even more simple than I had supposed, and all this talk and these
    murmurings savour of treason, meseems. Are you fools and dolts to imagine
    that when His Majesty&rsquo;s orders were known to me, I did not at once
    set to work to fulfil them? We want to strike at Ghent, seigniors, and want
    proofs of her rebellion&mdash;His Majesty wants those proofs and he wants
    the death of Orange. We all desire to raze Ghent to the ground! Then will
    you give me your close attention, and I will e&rsquo;en tell you my plans
    for attaining all these objects and earning the approval of our gracious
    King and recognition from the rest of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then should not don Ramon de Linea retire?&rdquo;  queried President
    Viglius, &ldquo;surely His Highness&rsquo;s decision can only be disclosed
    to members of his council.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let don Ramon stay,&rdquo; interposed de Vargas with unanswerable
    authority, even as the young man was preparing to take his leave. &ldquo;The
    matter is one that in a measure will concern him, seeing that it involves
    the destinies of the city of Ghent and that His Highness is pleased to give
    him the command of our troops stationed in that city.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Don Ramon de Linea glanced up at de Vargas with a look of agreeable surprise.
    The command of the troops in Ghent! Of a truth this was news to him, and
    happy news indeed. Rumour was current that the Duke of Alva&mdash;Lieutenant-Governor
    of the Low Countries and Captain-General of the forces&mdash;was about to
    visit Ghent, and the captain in command there would thus be in a position
    of doing useful work, mayhap of rendering valuable services, and in any case,
    of being well before the eyes of the Captain-General.</p>
  <p>All the young man&rsquo;s elegant, languid manner had come back to him.
    He had had a fright, but nothing more, and commendation&mdash;in the shape
    of this important promotion&mdash;had allayed all his fears: his being allowed
    to be present at a deliberation of the Grand Council was also a signal mark
    of favour granted to him, no doubt in recognition of his zeal and loyalty
    whilst destroying the noble city of Mechlin for the glory of King Philip
    of Spain.</p>
  <p>He now resumed his seat at the board, selecting with becoming modesty a
    place at the bottom of the table and feeling not the least disconcerted by
    the wrathful, envious looks which President Viglius and one or two other
    Netherlanders directed against him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The plan, seigniors, which I have in my mind,&rdquo;  resumed the
    Duke after a slight pause, &ldquo;could never have come to maturity but for
    the loyal co-operation of se&ntilde;or Juan de Vargas and of his equally
    loyal daughter. Let me explain,&rdquo; he continued, seeing the look of astonishment
    which spread over most of the faces around the board. &ldquo;It is necessary,
    in view of all that we said just now, that I should have a means&mdash;a
    tool I might say&mdash;for the working out of a project which has both the
    death of Orange and the punishment of Ghent for its aim. I have told you
    that I am morally certain that Orange is operating in Ghent at the present
    moment. Is it likely that he would leave such a storehouse of wealth and
    rebellion untouched?&mdash;heresy is rampant in Ghent and treachery goes
    hand in hand with it. Our spies unfortunately have been unable to obtain
    very reliable information: the inhabitants are astute and wary&mdash;they
    hatch their plots with devilish cunning and secrecy. Obviously, therefore,
    what we want is a loyal worker, an efficient and devoted servant of the King
    in the very heart of the civic life of the town: if only we can get to know
    what goes on in the intimate family circles of those townsfolk, I feel sure
    that we shall get all the proofs that the King desires of the treachery of
    Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment in order to draw breath; absolute silence&mdash;the silence
    of tense expectation&mdash;hung around the council-board. The Netherlanders
    hung obsequiously on the tyrant&rsquo;s lips, del Rio leaned back in his
    chair&mdash;seemingly indifferent&mdash;and de Vargas was closely watching
    don Ramon de Linea; the young man was trying to appear calmly interested,
    but the restless look in his eyes and a slight tremor of his hand betrayed
    inward agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of you reverend seigniors,&rdquo; continued the Duke of Alva
    after awhile, in powerful, compelling tones, &ldquo;will perhaps have guessed
    by now, what connection there is in my mind between that vast project which
    I have just put before you and the daughter of my loyal coadjutor don Juan
    de Vargas. I have arranged that she shall marry a man of influence and position
    in Ghent, so that she can not only keep me informed of all the intrigues
    which are brewing in that city against the Government of our gracious King,
    but also become the means whereby we can lure Orange to his doom, capture
    that mysterious Leatherface, and then deliver Ghent over to don Ramon&rsquo;s
    soldiery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He struck the table repeatedly with his fist as he spoke: there was no doubting
    the power of the man to accomplish what he wanted, as well as the cruelty
    and vindictiveness wherewith he would pursue anyone who dared to attempt
    to thwart him in his projects. No one thought of interrupting him. Don Ramon
    kept his agitation under control as best he could, for he felt that de Vargas&rsquo;s
    eyes still watched him closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A very admirable idea,&rdquo; now murmured Viglius obsequiously.</p>
  <p>As usual on these occasions, it was obvious that he and the other Netherlanders
    were mere figureheads at the council-board. Alva was directing, planning,
    commanding, de Vargas had been the confidant, and del Rio would always be
    the ready tool when needed: but Viglius, de Berlaymont, Hessels, and the
    others, were mere servile listeners, ready to give the approbation which
    was expected of them and withholding every word of criticism.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;And doth donna Lenora de Vargas enter into all these far-reaching
    schemes?&rdquo; now asked don Ramon coldly. &ldquo;Meseems, they are above
    a woman&rsquo;s comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Vargas&rsquo; persistent glance was irritating his nerves; he threw a
    challenging look&mdash;wholly defiant&mdash;across the table at the older
    man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter, Messire,&rdquo; said the latter loftily, &ldquo;is above
    all a true Spaniard. She has been brought up to obey and not to discuss.
    She is old enough now to forget all past youthful follies,&rdquo; he added,
    answering don Ramon&rsquo;s defiant glance with one that conveyed a threat. &ldquo;Her
    devotion to her Church, her King and her country, and her hatred of Orange
    and all rebels will influence her actions in the way the Lieutenant-Governor
    desires.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don Ramon was silent. He had understood the threat which de Vargas&rsquo; glance
    had expressed, and he knew what the other meant when he spoke of &ldquo;past
    youthful follies&rdquo;&mdash;it meant the breaking off of a pleasing romance,
    a farewell to many an ambitious dream. Don Ramon suppressed a sigh of anger
    and of disappointment: donna Lenora de Vargas was beautiful and wealthy,
    but it were not wise to let her father see how hard he&mdash;Ramon&mdash;had
    been hit. He took no further part in the discussion, and after awhile he
    succeeded in appearing wholly indifferent to its sentimental side; but he
    listened attentively to all that was said, and when he met de Vargas&rsquo; glance,
    which now and then was fixed mockingly upon him, he answered it with a careless
    shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; now rejoined Pierre Arsens, who was president of Artois
    and a patrician of Hainault, &ldquo;may we ask if His Highness has already
    chosen the happy man who is to become the husband of such a pattern of womanhood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My choice has naturally fallen on the son of Mynheer Charles van
    Rycke, the High-Bailiff of Ghent,&rdquo; replied Alva curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A family of traitors if ever there was one,&rdquo;  growled Alberic
    del Rio savagely. &ldquo;I know them. The father is all right, so is the
    younger son Mark&mdash;younger, I believe, by only a couple of hours&mdash;a
    wastrel and something of a drunkard, so I understand; but the mother and
    the other son are impudent adherents of Orange: they have more than once
    drawn the attention of the Chief Inquisitor on themselves, and if I had my
    way with such cattle, I would have had the men hanged and the woman burned
    long before this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Rycke,&rdquo; said Alva coldly, &ldquo;is High-Bailiff of Ghent.
    He is a good Catholic and so is his wife: he is a man of great consideration
    in the city and his sons are popular. It has not been thought expedient to
    interfere with them up to now. But&mdash;bearing my schemes in mind&mdash;I
    have caused the man to be severely warned once or twice. These warnings have
    reduced him to a state of panic, and lately when my scheme had matured I
    told him that my desire was that one of his sons should wed don Juan de Vargas&rsquo;  daughter.
    He had no thought of refusal. In fact his acceptance was positively abject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on what grounds was the marriage suggested to him?&rdquo; questioned
    President Arsens.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grounds, Messire?&rdquo; retorted the Duke; &ldquo;we give no grounds
    or reasons for our commands to our Flemish subjects. We give an order and
    they obey. I told Mynheer van Rycke that I desired the marriage and that
    was enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; interposed President Viglius with an attempt at jocularity, &ldquo;we
    shall soon be able to congratulate two young people on a happy event!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will be able to do that to-morrow, Messire,&rdquo;  quoth the
    Duke. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or de Vargas goes to Ghent for the purpose of affiancing
    the two young people together; the marriage ceremony will take place within
    the week. His Majesty hath approved of my scheme: he desires that we should
    expedite the marriage. Se&ntilde;or de Vargas is willing, Messire van Rycke
    would not think of objecting, donna Lenora is heart free. Why should we delay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; murmured don Ramon under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Donna Lenora,&rdquo; resumed Alva sententiously, &ldquo;is indeed
    lucky in that&mdash;unlike most women&mdash;she will be able to work personally
    for the glory of her King and country. If through her instrumentality we
    can bring Orange to the block and Ghent to her knees, there is no favour
    which her father could not ask of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As he said this, he turned to de Vargas and stretched out his hand to him.
    De Vargas took the hand respectfully and bent over it in dutiful obedience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, seigniors,&rdquo; resumed the Duke more gaily, and once more
    addressing the full council-board, &ldquo;you know the full reason of my
    projected journey to Ghent. I go ostensibly in order to inaugurate the statue
    of our Sovereign King erected by my orders in the market place, but also
    in order to ascertain how our loyal worker will have progressed in the time.
    Donna Lenora de Vargas will have been the wife of Messire van Rycke for over
    a sennight by then: she will&mdash;and I mistake not&mdash;have much to tell
    us. In the meanwhile se&ntilde;or de Vargas will take up his residence in
    the city as <i>vicarius criminalis</i>: he will begin his functions to-morrow
    by presiding over the engagement of his daughter to the son of the High-Bailiff:
    there will be much public rejoicing and many entertainments during the week
    and on the day of the wedding ceremony: to these, seigniors, ye are graciously
    bidden. I pray you go and mingle as far as you can with that crowd of uncouth
    and vulgar burghers whose treachery seems to pierce even through their ill-fitting
    doublets. I pray you also to keep your eyes and ears open ... an my conjectures
    are correct, much goes on in Ghent of which the Holy Inquisition should have
    cognisance. We are out on a special campaign against cunning traitors, and
    Ghent is our first objective. When we turn our soldiery loose into the city,
    yours, seigniors, will be the first spoils.... Ghent is rich in treasure
    and money ... those first spoils will be worth the winning. Until that happy
    day, I bid you <i>au revoir</i>, gentle Sirs, and let your toast be at every
    banquet: &lsquo;To the destruction of Ghent, and to the death of Orange!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>After which long peroration the Lieutenant-Governor intimated with a casual
    wave of his be-ringed hand that the sitting of the Grand Council was at an
    end. The illustrious councillors rose with alacrity: they were now in rare
    good humour. The parting speech of His Highness tickled their cupidity. The
    first spoils at the sacking of Ghent should mean a fortune for every member
    of the board. General de Noircarmes had made a huge one at the sacking of
    Mons, and even younger officers like don Ramon de Linea had vastly enriched
    themselves when Mechlin was given over to the soldiers.</p>
  <p>One by one now the grave seigniors withdrew, having taken respectful leave
    of His Highness. To the salute of the Netherlanders&mdash;of Viglius and
    Hessels, of Berlaymont and the others, the Duke responded with a curt bow&mdash;to
    de Vargas and del Rio, and also to don Ramon, he nodded with easy familiarity.
    However obsequious the Netherlanders might be&mdash;however proven their
    zeal, their Spanish masters never allowed them to forget that there was a
    world of social distinction between a grandee of Spain and the uncouth burghers
    and even patricians of this semi-civilised land.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>Having made his last obeisance before the Duke of Alva and taken leave of
    the grave seigniors of the Grand Council, don Ramon de Linea bowed himself
    out of the room with all the ceremony which Spanish etiquette prescribed.
    As he did so he noticed that at a significant sign from Alva, de Vargas and
    Alberic del Rio remained behind in the council-chamber, even while all the
    Netherlanders were being dismissed. He watched these latter gentlemen as
    one by one they filed quickly out of the house&mdash;loath even to exchange
    a few friendly words with one another on the doorstep in this place where
    every wall had ears and every nook and cranny concealed a spy. He watched
    them with an air of supercilious contempt, oblivious of the fact that he
    himself had been not a little scared by the black looks cast on him by the
    all-powerful tyrant and merciless autocrat.</p>
  <p>The scare had been unpleasant, but it was all over now: Fate&mdash;that
    ever fickle jade&mdash;seemed inclined to smile on him. The penniless scion
    of a noble race, he seemed at last on the high road to fortune&mdash;the
    command of the troops in Ghent was an unexpected gift of the goddess, whilst
    the sacking and looting of Mechlin had amply filled his pockets.</p>
  <p>But it was a pity about donna Lenora!</p>
  <p>Don Ramon paused in the vast panelled hall and instinctively his eyes wandered
    to the mirror, framed in rich Flemish carved wood, which hung upon the wall.
    By our Lady! he had well-nigh lost his self-control just now under de Vargas&rsquo; mocking
    gaze, and also that air of high-breeding and sang-froid which became him
    so well: the thought of donna Lenora even in connection with her approaching
    marriage caused him to readjust the set of his doublet and the stiff folds
    of his ruffle, and his well-shaped hand wandered lovingly up to his silky
    moustache.</p>
  <p>A sound immediately behind him caused him to start and to turn. An elderly
    woman wrapped in a dark shawl and wearing a black veil right over her face
    and head was standing close to his elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inez?&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hist! I beg of you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; whispered the woman, &ldquo;I
    am well-nigh dead with terror at thought that I might be seen. The se&ntilde;orita
    knew that you would be here to-day: she saw you from the gallery above, and
    sent me down to ask you to come to her at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; broke in don Ramon impatiently, and with
    a puzzled frown, &ldquo;is she here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or de Vargas won&rsquo;t let her out of his sight now.
    When he hath audience of the Lieutenant-Governor or business with the council
    he makes the se&ntilde;orita come with him. The Duke of Alva hath given her
    a room in this house, where she can sit while her father is at the Council.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Heavens above, why all this mystery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The se&ntilde;orita will tell your Graciousness,&rdquo; said the
    woman, &ldquo;I beg of you to come at once. If I stay longer down here I
    shall die of fright.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And like a scared hen, old Inez trotted across the hall, without waiting
    to see if don Ramon followed her. The young man seemed to hesitate for a
    moment: the call was a peremptory one, coming as it did from a beautiful
    woman whom he loved: at the same time all that he had heard in the council-chamber
    was a warning to him to keep out of de Vargas&rsquo; way; the latter&mdash;if
    Inez spoke the truth&mdash;was keeping his daughter almost a prisoner, and
    it was never good at any time to run counter to se&ntilde;or de Vargas.</p>
  <p>The house was very still. The Netherlanders had all gone: two serving men
    appeared to be asleep in the porch, otherwise there came no sign of life
    from any part of the building: the heavy oak doors which gave on the anteroom
    of the council-chamber effectually deadened every sound which might have
    come from there.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon smiled to himself and shrugged his shoulders. After all he was
    a fool to be so easily scared: a beautiful woman beckoned, and he had not
    been forbidden to see her&mdash;so&mdash;after that one brief moment of hesitation
    he turned to follow Inez up the stairs.</p>
  <p>The woman led the way round the gallery, then up another flight of stairs
    and along a narrow corridor, till she came to a low door, beside which she
    stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go in, I pray you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the se&ntilde;orita
    expects you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man walked unannounced into the small room beyond.</p>
  <p>There came a little cry of happy surprise out of the recess of a wide dormer
    window, and the next moment don Ramon held Lenora de Vargas in his arms.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>8</b></h3>
  <p>Lenora with the golden hair and the dark velvety eyes! Thus do the chroniclers
    of the time speak of her (notably the Sieur de Vaernewyck who knew her intimately),
    thus too did Velasquez paint her, a few years after these notable events&mdash;all
    in white, for she seldom wore coloured gowns&mdash;very stately, with the
    small head slightly thrown back, the fringe of dark lashes veiling the lustre
    of her luminous eyes.</p>
  <p>But just at this moment there was no stateliness about donna Lenora: she
    clung to don Ramon, just like a loving child that has been rather scared
    and knows where to find protection; and he accepted her caress with an easy,
    somewhat supercilious air of condescension&mdash;the child was so pretty
    and so very much in love! He patted her hair with gentle, soothing gesture
    and thanked kind Fate for this pleasing gift of a beautiful woman&rsquo;s
    love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not know that you were in Brussels,&rdquo; he said after awhile,
    and when he had led her to a seat in the window, and sat down beside her. &ldquo;All
    this while I thought you still in Segovia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His glance was searching hers and his vanity was pleasantly stirred by the
    fact that she was pale and thin, and that those wonderful, luminous eyes
    of hers looked as if they had shed many tears of late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ramon,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Alva,&rdquo; he replied dryly, &ldquo;gave me official
    information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then seeing that she remained silent and dejected he added peremptorily: &ldquo;Lenora!
    how long is it since you have known of this proposed marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only three days,&rdquo; she replied tonelessly. &ldquo;My father
    sent for me about a month ago. The Duchess of Medina Coeli was coming over
    to the Netherlands on a visit to her lord, and I was told that I must accompany
    her. We started from Laredo in the <i>Esperansa</i> on the 10th of last month
    and we landed at Flushing a week ago. Oh! at first I was so happy to come
    ... it is nine months and more since you left Spain and my heart was aching
    for a sight of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then ... when did you first hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three days since, when we arrived in Brussels. The Duchess herself
    took me to my father&rsquo;s house, and then he told me ... that he had bade
    me come because the Lieutenant-Governor had arranged a marriage for me ...
    with a Netherlander.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don Ramon muttered an angry oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he&mdash;your father I mean&mdash;never hint at it before?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never. A month ago he still spoke of you in his letters to me. Had
    you no suspicions, Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was he of course who obtained for you that command under don Frederic,
    which took you out of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a fine position and I accepted it gladly ... and unsuspectingly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It must have been the beginning: he wanted you out of my way already
    then, though he went on pretending all this while that he favoured your attentions
    to me. He thought that I would soon forget you. How little he knows me! And
    now he has forbidden me to think of you again. Since I am in Brussels he
    hardly lets me out of his sight. He only leaves the house in order to attend
    on the Duke, and when he does, he brings me here with him. Inez and I are
    sent up to this room and I am virtually a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It all seems like an ugly dream, Lenora,&rdquo; he murmured sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! an ugly dream,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Ofttimes, since my
    father told me this awful thing, I have thought that it could not be true.
    God could not allow anything so monstrous and so wicked. I thought that I
    must be dreaming and must presently wake up and find myself in the dear old
    convent at Segovia with your farewell letter to me under my pillow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was gazing straight out before her&mdash;not at him, for she felt that
    if she looked on him, all her fortitude would give way and she would cry
    like a child. This she would not do, for her woman&rsquo;s instinct had already
    told her that all the courage in this terrible emergency must come from her.</p>
  <p>He sat there, moody and taciturn, all the while that she longed for him
    to take her in his arms and to swear to her that never would he give her
    up, never would he allow reasons of State to come between him and his love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are political reasons it seems,&rdquo; she continued, and the
    utter wretchedness and hopelessness with which she spoke were a pathetic
    contrast to his own mere sullen resentment. &ldquo;My father has not condescended
    to say much. He sent for me and I came. As soon as I arrived in Brussels
    he told me that I must no longer think of you: that childish folly, he said,
    must now come to an end. Then he advised me that the Lieutenant-Governor
    had arranged a marriage for me with the son of Messire van Rycke, High-Bailiff
    of Ghent ... that we are to be affianced to-morrow and married within the
    week. I cried&mdash;I implored&mdash;I knelt to my father and begged him
    not to break my heart, my life.... I told him that to part me from you was
    to condemn me to worse than death....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? and&mdash;?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know my father, Ramon,&rdquo; she said with a slight shudder, &ldquo;almost
    as well as I do. Do you believe that any tears would move him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made no reply. Indeed, what could he say? He did know Juan de Vargas,
    knew that such a man would sacrifice without pity or remorse everything that
    stood in the way of his schemes or of his ambition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not even told that you would be in Brussels to-day&mdash;Inez
    only heard of it through the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s serving man&mdash;then
    she and I watched for you, because I felt that I must at least be the first
    to tell you the awful&mdash;awful news! Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed with sudden
    vehemence, &ldquo;the misery of it all! ... Ramon, cannot you think of something?&mdash;cannot
    you think? Are we going to be parted like this? as if our love had never
    been, as if our love were not sweet and sacred and holy, the blessing of
    God which no man should have the power to take away from us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was on the point of breaking down, and don Ramon with one ear alert
    to every sound outside had much ado to soothe and calm her. This he tried
    to do, for selfish as he was, he loved this beautiful woman with that passionate
    if shallow ardour which is characteristic in men of his temperament.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said after awhile, &ldquo;it is impossible for
    me to say anything for the moment. Fate and your father&rsquo;s cruelty have
    dealt me a blow which has half-stunned me. As you say, I must think&mdash;I
    am not going to give up hope quite as readily as your father seems to think.
    By our Lady! I am not just an old glove that can so lightly be cast aside.
    I must think ... I must devise.... But in the meanwhile....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and something of that same look of fear came into his eyes which
    had been there when in the Council Chamber he had dreaded the Duke of Alva&rsquo;a
    censure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, my sweet,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;you must
    pretend to obey. You cannot openly defy your father! ... nor yet the Duke
    of Alva. You know them both! They are men who know neither pity nor mercy!
    Your father would punish you if you disobeyed him ... he has the means of
    compelling you to obey. But the Duke&rsquo;s wrath would fall with deathly
    violence upon me. You know as well as I do that he would sacrifice me ruthlessly
    if he felt that I was likely to interfere with any of his projects: and your
    marriage with the Netherlander is part of one of his vast schemes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The look of terror became more marked upon his face, his dark skin had become
    almost livid in hue: and Lenora clung to him, trembling, for she knew that
    everything he said was true. They were like two birds caught in the net of
    a remorseless fowler: to struggle for freedom were worse than useless. De
    Vargas was a man who had attained supreme power beside the most absolute
    tyrant the world had ever known. Every human being around him&mdash;even
    his only child&mdash;was a mere pawn in his hands for the great political
    game in which the Duke of Alva was the chief player&mdash;a mere tool for
    the fashioning of that monstrous chain which was destined to bind the Low
    Countries to the chariot-wheels of Spain. A useless tool, a superfluous pawn
    he would throw away without a pang of remorse: this don Ramon knew and so
    did Lenora&mdash;but in Ramon that knowledge reigned supreme and went hand
    in hand with terror, whilst in the young girl there was all the desire to
    defy that knowledge and to make a supreme fight for love and happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must not stay any longer now, my sweet,&rdquo; he said after awhile, &ldquo;if
    your father has so absolutely forbidden you to see me, then I have tarried
    here too long already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose and gently disengaged himself from the tender hands which clung
    so pathetically to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you go, Ramon,&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;it seems
    as if you were going right out of my life&mdash;and that my life would go
    with you if you went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he said a little impatiently, &ldquo;it is dangerous
    for me to stay a moment longer. Try and be brave&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say
    farewell&mdash;We&rsquo;ll meet again....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let Inez be at the corner of the Broodhuis this evening. I&rsquo;ll
    give her a letter for you. In the meanwhile I shall have seen your father.
    Who knows his decision may not be irrevocable&mdash;after all you are the
    one being in the world he has to love and to care for; he cannot wilfully
    break your heart and destroy your happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head dejectedly. But the next moment she looked up trying
    to seem hopeful. She believed that he suffered just as acutely as she did,
    and, womanlike, did not want to add to his sorrow by letting him guess too
    much of her own. She contrived to keep back her tears; she had shed so many
    of late that their well-spring had mayhap run dry: he folded her in his arms,
    for she was exquisitely beautiful and he really loved her. Marriage with
    her would have been both blissful and advantageous, and his pride was sorely
    wounded at the casual treatment meted out to him by de Vargas: at the same
    time the thought of defiance never once entered his head&mdash;for defiance
    could only end in death, and don Ramon felt quite sure that even if he lost
    his beautiful fianc&eacute;e, life still held many compensations for him
    in the future.</p>
  <p>Therefore he was able to part from Lenora with a light heart, whilst hers
    was overweighted with sorrow. He kissed her eyes, her hair, her lips, and
    murmured protestations of deathless love which only enhanced her grief and
    enflamed all that selfless ardour of which her passionate nature was capable.
    Never had she loved don Ramon de Linea as she loved him at this hour of parting&mdash;never
    perhaps would she love as fondly again.</p>
  <p>And he with a last, tender kiss, airily bade her to be brave and trustful,
    and finally waved her a cheery farewell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    The Subject Race</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do it, mother, I cannot! The very shame of it would kill
    me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurence van Rycke sat on a low chair in front of the fire, his elbow propped
    on his knee, his chin buried in his hand. His mother gave a little shiver,
    and drew her woollen shawl closer round her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot go against your father&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; she said tonelessly,
    like one who has even lost the power to suffer acutely. &ldquo;God alone
    knows what would become of us all if you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can only kill me,&rdquo; retorted Laurence, with fierce, passionate
    resentment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how should I survive if he did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you not rather see me dead, mother dear, than wedded to a woman
    whose every thought, every aspiration must tend toward the further destruction
    of our country&mdash;she the daughter of the most hideous tyrant that has
    ever defamed this earth&mdash;more hideous even than that execrable Alva
    himself...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused abruptly in the midst of this passionate outburst, for the old
    house&mdash;which had been so solemn and silent awhile ago, suddenly echoed
    from end to end with loud and hilarious sounds, laughter and shouts, heavy
    footsteps, jingle of spurs and snatches of song, immediately followed by
    one or two piteous cries uttered in a woman&rsquo;s piercing voice. Laurence
    van Rycke jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; he cried, and made a dash for the door. His
    mother&rsquo;s imploring cry called him back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Laurence! don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;It is
    only the soldiers! They tease Jeanne, and she gets very cross! ... We have
    six men and a sergeant quartered here now, besides the commandant...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight Spanish soldiers in the house of the High-Bailiff of Ghent!&rdquo; exclaimed
    Laurence, and a prolonged laugh of intense bitterness came from his overburdened
    heart. &ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; he added, as he stretched out his arms with
    a gesture of miserable longing and impotence, &ldquo;to endure all this outrage
    and all this infamy!&mdash;to know as we do, what has happened in Mons and
    Mechlin and to be powerless to do anything&mdash;anything against such hideous,
    appalling, detestable tyranny&mdash;to feel every wrong and every injustice
    against the country one loves, against one&rsquo;s own kith and kin, eating
    like the plague into one&rsquo;s very bones and to remain powerless, inert,
    an insentient log in the face of it all. And all the while to be fawning&mdash;always
    fawning and cringing, kissing the master&rsquo;s hand that wields the flail....
    Ugh! And now this new tyranny, this abominable marriage.... Ye Heavens above
    me! but mine own cowardice in accepting it would fill me with unspeakable
    loathing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; implored the mother.</p>
  <p>At her call he ran to her and knelt at her feet: then burying his head in
    his hands he sobbed like a child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot do it, mother!&rdquo; he reiterated piteously,  &ldquo;I
    cannot do it. I would far rather die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With gentle, mechanical touch she stroked his unruly fair hair, and heavy
    tears rolled down her wan cheeks upon her thin, white hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just think of it, mother dear,&rdquo; resumed Laurence a little more
    calmly after a while, &ldquo;would it not be introducing a spy into our very
    home? ... and just now ... at the time when we all have so much at stake
    ... the Prince...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Laurence!&rdquo; implored the mother; and this time she placed
    an authoritative hand upon his arm and gave it a warning pressure; but her
    wan cheeks had become a shade paler than before, and the look of terror became
    more marked in her sunken eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even these walls have ears these days,&rdquo; she added feebly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no danger here, mother darling ... nobody can hear,&rdquo; he
    said reassuringly. But nevertheless he, too, cast a quick look of terror
    into the remote corners of the room and dropped his voice to a whisper when
    he spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Juan de Vargas&rsquo; daughter,&rdquo; he said with passionate earnestness, &ldquo;what
    hath she in common with us? She hates every Netherlander; she despises us
    all, as every Spaniard does: she would wish to see our beautiful country
    devastated, our cities destroyed, our liberties and ancient privileges wrested
    from us, and every one of us made into an abject vassal of her beloved Spain.
    Every moment of my life I should feel that she was watching me, spying on
    me, making plans for the undoing of our cause, and betraying our secrets
    to her abominable father. Mother dear, such a life would be hell upon earth.
    I could not do it. I would far rather die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what can you do, Laurence?&rdquo; asked Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke,
    with a sigh of infinite misery.</p>
  <p>Laurence rose and dried his tears. He felt that they had been unmanly, and
    was half ashamed of them. Fortunately it was only his mother who had seen
    them, and ... how well she understood!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must think it all over, mother dear,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;It
    is early yet. Father will not want me to be at the Town-house before eight
    o&rsquo;clock. Oh! how could he ever have been so mean, so obsequious as
    to agree to this selling of his son in such a shameful market.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could he help it?&rdquo; retorted the mother with a fretful little
    sigh. &ldquo;The Duke of Alva commanded in the name of the King, and threatened
    us all with the Inquisition if we disobeyed. You know what that means,&rdquo; she
    added, whilst that pitiable look of horror and fear once more crept into
    her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think,&rdquo; said Laurence sombrely&mdash;he was standing
    in front of the fire and staring into the crackling logs with a deep frown
    right across his brow&mdash;&ldquo;sometimes I think that the worst tortures
    which those devils could inflict on us would be more endurable than this
    life of constant misery and humiliation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mother made no reply. Her wan cheeks had become the colour of ashes,
    her thin hands which were resting in her lap were seized with a nervous tremour.
    From below came still the sound of loud laughter intermixed now with a bibulous
    song. A smothered cry of rage escaped Laurence&rsquo;s lips: it seemed as
    if he could not stay still, as if he must run and stop this insult in his
    mother&rsquo;s house, silence those brawling soldiers, force their own obscene
    songs down their throats, regardless of the terrible reprisals which might
    ensue. Only his mother&rsquo;s thin, trembling hand upon his arm forced him
    to remain, and to swallow his resentment as best he could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is no use, Laurence,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I would be
    the first to suffer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This argument had the effect of forcing Laurence van Rycke to control his
    raging temper. Common sense came momentarily to the rescue and told him that
    his mother was right. He started pacing up and down the narrow room with
    a view to calming his nerves.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mark this morning?&rdquo; asked Cl&eacute;mence van
    Rycke suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What had he to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you know Mark&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; she replied evasively. &ldquo;It
    seems that he caught sight of donna Lenora de Vargas when she passed through
    the Waalpoort yesterday. He made a flippant joke or two about your good luck
    and the girl&rsquo;s beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurence suppressed an angry oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Mark,&rdquo; interposed Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke
    gently, &ldquo;he is as God made him&mdash;shallow, careless...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not careless where his own pleasures are concerned,&rdquo; said Laurence,
    with a laugh of bitter contempt. &ldquo;Last night at the &lsquo;Three Weavers&rsquo; a
    lot of Spanish officers held carouse. Mark was with them till far into the
    night. There was heavy drinking and high play, and Mark...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; broke in the mother fretfully, &ldquo;do not
    let us speak of Mark. He is his father&rsquo;s son ... and you are mine,&rdquo; she
    added, as with a wistful little gesture she stretched out her arms to the
    son whom she loved. Once more he was at her feet kissing her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not fret, mother dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think
    things out quietly, and then do what I think is right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing rash, Laurence,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;nothing
    without consulting me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must consult my conscience first, dear,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;and
    then I must speak with the Prince.... Yes! yes! I know,&rdquo; he added somewhat
    impatiently, as once again he felt that warning pressure on his arm. &ldquo;Next
    to God my every thought is for him; nor did he think of himself when he refused
    to acknowledge the autocracy of Alva. Our time is at hand, mother dear, I
    feel it in my bones. The last response has been splendid: we have promises
    of close on two thousand ducats already, and two hundred men are ready to
    take up arms in the city at any moment. Yes! yes! I know! and I am careful&mdash;I
    am as wary as the fox! But how can I at such a moment think of matrimony?
    How can I think of bending the knee to such abominable tyranny? I bend the
    knee only to the Prince of Orange, and by him I swear that I will not wed
    the daughter of Juan de Vargas! I will not bring to this hearth and to my
    home one of that gang of execrable tyrants who have ravaged our country and
    crushed the spirit of our people. I have work to do for Orange and for my
    country. I will not be hindered by bonds which are abhorrent to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave his mother a final kiss and then hurried out of the room. She would
    have detained him if she could, for she was terrified of what he might do;
    but she called after him in vain, and when presently she went to his room
    to look for him, he was not there. But on his desk there was a letter addressed
    to his father; Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke took it up: it was not sealed, only
    rolled, and tied with ribbon: this she undid and read the letter. There were
    only a few words, and when the unfortunate woman had grasped their full meaning
    she uttered a moan of pain and sank half-fainting on her knees. Here Jeanne
    found her half an hour later, sobbing and praying. The faithful creature
    comforted her mistress as best she could, then she half carried, half led
    her back to her room. The letter written to his father by Laurence van Rycke
    contained the following brief communication:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Find fomeone elfe, My Father, to help you lick our Spanifh tyrants&rsquo; boots.
    I cannot do it. I refufe to wed the Daughter of that Bloodhound de Vargas,
    but as I cannot live under Your roof and difobey You, I will not return until
    You bid Me come.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>This had occurred early this morning; it was now late in the afternoon,
    and Laurence had not returned. The levie at the Town Hall was timed for eight
    o&rsquo;clock, and the High-Bailiff had just come home in order to don his
    robes for the solemn occasion.</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke had made an excuse not to see him yet: like all
    weak, indecisive natures she was hoping against hope that something would
    occur even now to break Laurence&rsquo;s obstinacy and induce him to bow
    to that will against which it was so useless to rebel.</p>
  <p>But the minutes sped on, and Laurence did not return, and from a room close
    by came the sound of Messire van Rycke&rsquo;s heavy footstep and his gruff
    voice giving orders to the serving man who was helping him with his clothes.
    Another hour, or perhaps two at most, and she would have to tell her husband
    what had happened&mdash;and the awful catastrophe would have to be faced.
    As she sat in the high-backed chair, Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke felt as if
    an icy chill had crept into her bones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put another log on the fire, Jeanne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this
    autumn weather hath chilled me to the marrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jeanne, capable, buxom and busy, did as she was bid. She did more. She ran
    nimbly out of the room and in a trice had returned with Madame&rsquo;s chaufferette&mdash;well
    filled with glowing charcoal&mdash;and had put it to her mistress&rsquo; feet:
    then she lit the candles in the tall candelabra which stood on a heavy sideboard
    at the further end of the room, and drew the heavy curtains across the window.
    The room certainly looked more cosy now: Madame only gave one slight, final
    shiver, and drew her shawl closer round her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is Messire Mark dressed yet, Jeanne?&rdquo; she asked wistfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messire came in about ten minutes ago,&rdquo; replied the woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him know that I wish to speak with him as soon as he can come
    to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have seen to the soldiers&rsquo; supper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They have had one supper, Madame. They are on duty at the Town Hall
    till eleven o&rsquo;clock; then they are coming home for a second supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will don Ramon de Linea sup with us, think you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In any case lay his place ready in case he wants to sup. He&rsquo;ll
    be on duty quite late too, and it will anger him if his supper is not to
    his taste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever I do will never be to the commandant&rsquo;s taste: he didn&rsquo;t
    like his room and he didn&rsquo;t like the dinner I had cooked for him. When
    he heard in whose house he was he swore and blasphemed, as I never heard
    any one blaspheme before. I worked my fingers to the bone last night and
    this morning to mend his linen and starch his ruff, but even then he was
    not satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a tone of bitter wrath in Jeanne&rsquo;s voice as she spoke. Madame
    drew a fretful little sigh, but she made no comment. What was the use? The
    Spanish soldiers and officers quartered in the houses of Flemish burghers
    had an unpleasant way of enforcing their wishes with regard to food and drink
    which it was not wise to combat these days. So Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke
    dismissed Jeanne, and remained brooding alone, staring into the fire, repeating
    in her mind all that Laurence had said, looking into the future with that
    same shiver of horror which was habitual to her, and into all the awful possibilities
    which must inevitably follow Laurence&rsquo;s hot-headed act of rebellion.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>And as she sat there huddled up in the high-backed chair it would be difficult
    to realise that Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke was still on the right side of
    fifty.</p>
  <p>She had married when she had only just emerged out of childhood, and had
    been in her day one of the brightest, prettiest, gayest of all the maidens
    in the city of Ghent. But now her eyes had lost their sparkle, and her mouth
    its smile. Her shoulders were bent as if under a perpetual load of care and
    anxiety, and in her once so comely face there was a settled look of anxiety
    and of fear. Even now, when a firm footstep resounded along the tiled corridor,
    she lost nothing of that attitude of dejection which seemed to have become
    habitual to her.</p>
  <p>In answer to a timid knock at the door, she called a fretful &ldquo;Enter!&rdquo; but
    she did not turn her head, as Mark&mdash;her younger son&mdash;came close
    up to her chair. He stooped to kiss the smooth white forehead which was not
    even lifted for his caress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; were the first words which Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke
    uttered, and this time she looked up more eagerly and a swift glimmer of
    hope shot through her tear-dimmed eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing definite,&rdquo; replied Mark van Rycke. &ldquo;He had food
    and drink at the hostelry of St. John just before midday, and at the tavern
    of &lsquo;The Silver Bell&rsquo; later in the afternoon. Apparently he has
    not left the city as no one saw him pass through any of the gates&mdash;but
    if Laurence does not mean to be found, mother dear,&rdquo; he added with
    a light shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;I might as well look for a needle
    in a haystack as to seek him in the streets of Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mother sighed dejectedly, and Mark threw himself into a chair and stretched
    his long legs out to the blaze: he felt his mother&rsquo;s eyes scanning
    his face and gradually a faint smile, half ironical, half impatient, played
    round the corners of his mouth.</p>
  <p>To a superficial observer there was a great likeness between the two brothers,
    although Mark was the taller and more robust of the two. Most close observers
    would, however, assert that Laurence was the better-looking; Mark had not
    the same unruly fair hair, nor look of boyish enthusiasm; his face was more
    dour and furrowed, despite the merry twinkle which now and then lit up his
    grey eyes, and there were lines around his brow and mouth which in an older
    man would have suggested the cares and anxieties of an arduous life, but
    which to the mother&rsquo;s searching gaze at this moment only seemed to
    indicate traces of dissipation, of nights spent in taverns, and days frittered
    away in the pursuit of pleasure.</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke sighed as she read these signs and a bitter word
    of reproach hovered on her lips; but this she checked and merely sighed&mdash;sighing
    and weeping were so habitual to her, poor soul!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen your father?&rdquo; she asked after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to tell him, Mark. I couldn&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t
    the courage. He has always loved you better than Laurence or me&mdash;the
    blow would come best from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you told him nothing, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and he has to meet se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas within the next two hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to tell him, Mark!&rdquo; she moaned
    piteously, &ldquo;I was always hoping that Laurence would think better of
    it all. I so dread even to think what he will say ... what he will do....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence should have thought of that,&rdquo; rejoined Mark dryly, &ldquo;before
    he embarked on this mad escapade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Escapade!&rdquo; she exclaimed with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;You
    can talk of escapade, when...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Easy, easy, mother dear,&rdquo; broke in Mark good-humouredly, &ldquo;I
    know I deserve all your reproaches for taking this adventure so lightly.
    But you must confess, dear, that there is a comic side to the tragedy&mdash;there
    always is. Laurence, the happy bridegroom-elect, takes to his heels without
    even a glimpse at the bride offered to him, whilst her beauty, according
    to rumour, sets every masculine heart ablaze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mother gave a little sigh of weariness and resignation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never will understand your brother, Mark,&rdquo;  she said with
    deep earnestness, &ldquo;not as long as you live. You never will understand
    your mother either. You are your father&rsquo;s son&mdash;Laurence is more
    wholly mine. You can look on with indifference&mdash;God help you! even with
    levity&mdash;on the awful tyranny which has well-nigh annihilated our beautiful
    land of Flanders. On you the weight of Spanish oppression sits over lightly....
    Sometimes I think I ought to thank God that He has given you a shallow nature,
    and that I am not doomed to see both my sons suffer as Laurence&mdash;my
    eldest&mdash;does. To him, Mark, his country and her downtrodden liberties
    are almost a religion: every act of tyranny perpetrated by that odious Alva
    is a wrong which he swears to avenge. What he suffers in the innermost fibre
    of his being every time that your father lends a hand in the abominable work
    of persecution nobody but I&mdash;his mother&mdash;will ever know. Your father&rsquo;s
    abject submission to Alva has eaten into his very soul. From a gay, light-hearted
    lad he has become a stern and silent man. What schemes for the overthrow
    of tyrants go on within his mind, I dare not even think. That awful bloodhound
    de Vargas&mdash;murderer, desecrator, thief&mdash;he loathes with deadly
    abomination. When the order came forth from your father that he should forthwith
    prepare for his early marriage to the daughter of that execrable man, he
    even thought of death as preferable to a union against which his innermost
    soul rose in revolt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had spoken thus lengthily, very slowly but with calm and dignified firmness.
    Mark was silent. There was a grandeur about the mother&rsquo;s defence of
    her beloved son which checked the word of levity upon his lips. Now Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke sank back in her chair exhausted by her sustained effort. She closed
    her eyes for a while, and Mark could not help but note how much his mother
    had aged in the past two years, how wearied she looked and how pathetic and
    above all how timid, like one on whom fear is a constant attendant. When
    he spoke again, it was more seriously and with great gentleness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had no thought, mother dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of belittling
    Laurence&rsquo;s earnestness, nor yet his devotion. I&rsquo;ll even admit,
    an you wish, that the present situation is tragic. It is now past six o&rsquo;clock.
    Father must be at the Town Hall within the next two hours.... He must be
    told, and at once.... The question is, what can we tell him to ... to...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To soften the blow and to appease his fury,&rdquo;  broke in Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke, and once more the look of terror crept into her eyes&mdash;a look
    which made her stooping figure look still more wizened and forlorn.  &ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; she
    added under her breath, &ldquo;your father is frightened to death of the
    Duke of Alva. I believe that he would sacrifice Laurence and even me to save
    himself from the vengeance of those people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, mother dear! now you are talking wildly. Father is perhaps
    a little weak. Most of us, I fear me, now are weak. We have been cowed and
    brow-beaten and threatened till we have lost all sense of our own manhood
    and our own dignity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You perhaps,&rdquo; protested the mother almost roughly, &ldquo;but
    not Laurence. You and your father are ready to lick the dust before all these
    Spaniards&mdash;but I tell you that what you choose to call loyalty they
    call servility; they despise you for your fawning&mdash;men like Orange and
    Laurence they hate, but they give them grudging respect...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And hang them to the nearest gibbet when they get a chance,&rdquo; broke
    in Mark with a dry laugh.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Before Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke could say another word, the heavy footstep
    of the High-Bailiff was heard in the hall below. The poor woman felt as if
    her heart stood still with apprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father has finished dressing: go down to him, Mark,&rdquo; she
    implored. &ldquo;I cannot bear to meet him with the news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Mark without another word went down to meet his father.</p>
  <p>Charles van Rycke&mdash;a fine man of dignified presence and somewhat pompous
    of manner&mdash;was standing in the hall, arrayed ready for the reception,
    in the magnificent robes of his office. His first word on seeing Mark was
    to ask for Laurence, the bridegroom-elect and hero of the coming feast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a fine-looking lad,&rdquo; said the father complacently, &ldquo;he
    cannot fail to find favour in donna Lenora&rsquo;s sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The news had to be told: Mark drew his father into the dining-hall and served
    him with wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This marriage will mean a splendid future for us all, Mark,&rdquo; continued
    the High-Bailiff, as he pledged his son in a tankard of wine: &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
    to the happy young people and to the coming prosperity of our house. No more
    humiliations, Mark; no more fears of that awful Inquisition. We shall belong
    to the ruling class now, tyranny can touch us no longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the news had to be told. Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke had said nothing
    to her husband about Laurence&rsquo;s letter&mdash;so it all had to be told,
    quietly and without preambles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence has gone out of the house, father, vowing that he would
    never marry donna Lenora de Vargas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took some time before the High-Bailiff realised that Mark was not jesting;
    the fact had to be dwelt upon, repeated over and over again, explained and
    insisted on before the father was made to understand that his son had played
    him false and had placed the family fortunes and the lives of its members
    in deadly jeopardy thereby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has gone!&rdquo; reiterated Mark for the tenth time,  &ldquo;gone
    with the intention not to return. At the reception to-night the bride will
    be waiting, and the bridegroom will not be there. The Duke of Alva will ask
    where is the bride-groom whom he hath chosen for the great honour, and echo
    will only answer &lsquo;Where?&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>Charles van Rycke was silent. He pushed away from him the tankard and bottle
    of wine. His face was the colour of lead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This means ruin for us all, Mark,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;black,
    hideous ruin; Alva will never forgive; de Vargas will hate us with the hatred
    born of humiliation.... A public affront to his daughter! ... O Holy Virgin
    protect us!&rdquo; he continued half-incoherently, &ldquo;it will mean the
    scaffold for me, the stake for your mother...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose and said curtly, &ldquo;I must speak with your mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went to the door but his step was unsteady. Mark forestalled him and
    placed himself against the door with his hand on the latch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means black ruin for us all, Mark,&rdquo; reiterated the High-Bailiff
    with sombre despair, &ldquo;I must go and speak of it with your mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mother is sick and anxious,&rdquo; said Mark quietly, &ldquo;she
    cannot help what Laurence has done&mdash;you and I, father, can talk things
    over quietly without her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing that you can say, Mark ... there is nothing we can
    do ... save, perhaps, pack up a few belongings and clear out of the country
    as quickly as we can ... that is, if there is time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your imagination does not carry you very far, meseems,&rdquo; quoth
    Mark dryly. &ldquo;Laurence&rsquo;s default is not irreparable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not here to put it right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By your leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, Mark!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>The transition from black despair to this sudden ray of hope was too much
    for the old man: he tottered and nearly measured his length on the floor.
    Mark had barely the time to save him from the fall. Now he passed his trembling
    hand across his eyes and forehead: his knees were shaking under him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, Mark,&rdquo; he murmured again.</p>
  <p>He managed to pour himself out a fresh mug of wine and drank it greedily:
    then he sat down, for his knees still refused him service.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be salvation indeed,&rdquo; he said, somewhat more steadily.</p>
  <p>Mark shrugged his shoulders with an air of complete indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! frankly, father dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think that there
    is not much salvation for us in introducing a Spaniard into our home. Mother&mdash;and
    Laurence when he comes back&mdash;will have to be very careful in their talk.
    But you seem to think the present danger imminent....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Imminent, ye gods!&rdquo; exclaimed the High-Bailiff, unable to repress
    a shudder of terror at the thought. &ldquo;I tell you, Mark, that de Vargas
    would never forgive what he would call a public insult&mdash;nor would Alva
    forgive what he would call open disobedience. Those two men&mdash;who are
    all-powerful and as cruel and cunning as fiends&mdash;would track us and
    hunt us down till they had brought you and me to the scaffold and your mother
    to the stake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, father,&rdquo; interposed Mark with some impatience, &ldquo;else
    I would not dream of standing in Laurence&rsquo;s shoes: the bride is very
    beautiful, but I have no liking for matrimony. The question is, will de Vargas
    guess the truth; he hath eyes like a lynx.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! he will not guess. He only saw Laurence twice&mdash;a fortnight
    ago when I took him up to Brussels and presented him to se&ntilde;or de Vargas
    and to the Duke: and then again the next evening: both times the lights were
    dim. No! no! I have no fear of that! de Vargas will not guess! You and your
    brother are at times so much alike, and donna Lenora hath not seen Laurence
    yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you did not speak of Laurence by name? I shouldn&rsquo;t care
    to change mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I presented my son to the Duke and to
    se&ntilde;or de Vargas. It was at His Highness&rsquo; lodgings: the room
    was small and dark; and se&ntilde;or de Vargas paid but little heed to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We Netherlanders are of so little account in the sight of these grandees
    of Spain,&rdquo; quoth Mark with a light laugh, &ldquo;and in any case, father,
    we must take some risk. So will you go and see my mother and calm her fears,
    whilst I go and don my best doublet and hose. Poor little mother! she hath
    put one foot into her grave through terror and anxiety on Laurence&rsquo;s
    account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As for Laurence...&rdquo; exclaimed the High-Bailiff wrathfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Laurence, father,&rdquo; broke in Mark quietly. &ldquo;His
    marriage with a Spaniard would have been disastrous. He would have fallen
    violently in love with his beautiful wife, and she would have dragged sufficient
    information out of him to denounce us all to the Inquisition. Perhaps,&rdquo; he
    added with good-humoured indifference, &ldquo;it is all for the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The High-Bailiff rose and placed a hand upon his son&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a true son to me, Mark,&rdquo; he said earnestly,  &ldquo;never
    shall I forget it. I am a wealthy man&mdash;more wealthy than many suppose.
    In virtue of your marriage with that Spanish wench you will be more free
    from taxation than we Netherlanders are: I&rsquo;ll make over the bulk of
    my fortune to you. You shall not regret what you have done for me and for
    your mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is time I went up to dress,&rdquo; was Mark&rsquo;s only comment
    on his father&rsquo;s kindly speech, and he quietly removed the paternal
    hand from off his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry on,&rdquo; said the High-Bailiff cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    wait until you are ready. I must just run up to your mother and tell her
    the good news. Nay! but I do believe if that hot-headed young rascal were
    to turn up now, I would forgive him his senseless escapade. As you say, my
    dear son, it is all for the best!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Ruling Caste</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Donna Lenora de Vargas stood beside her father whilst he&mdash;as representing
    the Lieutenant-Governor&mdash;was receiving the homage of the burghers and
    patricians of Ghent. This was a great honour for so young a girl, but every
    one&mdash;even the women&mdash;declared that donna Lenora was worthy of the
    honour, and many a man&mdash;both young and old&mdash;after he had made obeisance
    before se&ntilde;or de Vargas paused awhile before moving away, in order
    to gaze on the perfect picture which she presented.</p>
  <p>She was dressed all in white and with extreme simplicity, but the formal
    mode of the time, the stiff corslet and stomacher, the rigid folds of the
    brocade and high starched collar set off to perfection the stateliness of
    her finely proportioned figure, whilst the masses of her soft fair hair crowned
    her as with a casque of gold.</p>
  <p>When the brilliant throng of Flemish notabilities and their wives had all
    filed past the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s representative and had all had the honour&mdash;men
    and women alike&mdash;proud patricians of this ancient city, of kissing his
    hand, the High-Bailiff respectfully asked for leave to formally present his
    son to the high officers of state.</p>
  <p>All necks were immediately craned to see this presentation, for already
    the rumour had spread abroad of the coming interesting engagement, and there
    were many whispers of astonishment when Mark&rsquo;s tall figure&mdash;dressed
    in sombre purple silk with fine, starched ruff of priceless Mechlin lace&mdash;came
    forward out of the crowd. Every one had expected to see Laurence van Rycke
    as the happy bridegroom-elect, and it seemed passing strange that it should
    be Mark&mdash;happy-go-lucky, easy-going Mark, the wastrel of the family,
    the ne&rsquo;er-do-well&mdash;who had been selected for the honour of this
    alliance with the daughter of all-powerful de Vargas.</p>
  <p>Well! perhaps Laurence never would have stooped before a Spaniard as Mark
    had done quite naturally; perhaps Laurence was too avowedly a partisan of
    the Prince of Orange to have found favour in beautiful donna Lenora&rsquo;s
    sight. She certainly looked on Mark van Rycke with cool indifference; those
    who stood close by vowed that she flashed a glance of contempt upon him,
    as he bowed low before se&ntilde;or de Vargas and the other officers of state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your eldest son, Messire?&rdquo; asked one of these seigniors graciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My sons are twins,&rdquo; replied the High-Bailiff, &ldquo;and this
    is my son Mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or del Rio,&rdquo; said de Vargas turning to his colleague, &ldquo;I
    have the honour to present to you Messire Mark van Rycke, son of a loyal
    subject of our King, the High-Bailiff of Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which he turned to speak again with the High-Bailiff, and don Alberic
    del Rio drew Mark into a brief conversation. Excitement in the gaily-dressed
    throng was then at its height: the vague feeling that something unusual and
    even mysterious was occurring caused every one&rsquo;s nerves to be on tenterhooks.
    All this while donna Lenora had been quite silent, which was vastly becoming
    in a young girl, and now her father came up to her and he was closely followed
    by Mark van Rycke.</p>
  <p>The momentous presentation was about to take place: a man and a woman&mdash;of
    different race, of different upbringing, of the same religion but of widely
    different train of thought&mdash;were on the point of taking a solemn engagement
    to live their future life together.</p>
  <p>Those who stood near declared that at that moment donna Lenora looked up
    at her father with those large, dark eyes of hers that had been veiled by
    the soft, sweeping lashes up to now, and that they looked wonderfully beautiful,
    and were shining with unshed tears and with unspoken passion. They also say
    that she was on the point of speaking, that her lips were parted, and that
    the word &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; came from them as an appealing murmur.</p>
  <p>But the next moment she had encountered Vargas&rsquo;  stern glance which
    swiftly and suddenly shot out on her from beneath his drooping lids&mdash;that
    cruel, evil glance of his which dying men and women were wont to encounter
    when their bodies were racked by torture and which gave them a last shudder
    of horror ere they closed their eyes in death. Donna Lenora too shivered
    as she turned her head away. Her cheeks were whiter than her gown, neither
    had her lips any colour in them, and the kindly Flemish women who stood by
    felt that their motherly heart ached for this beautiful young girl who seemed
    so forlorn in the midst of all this pomp.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The curious formalities demanded by ancient Flemish custom had now to be
    complied with, before Messire van Rycke and donna Lenora de Vargas could
    be publicly announced as affianced to one another.</p>
  <p>Mark having his father on his right and Messire Jean van Migrode, chief-sheriff
    of the Keure, on his left, advanced toward his future bride. Young Count
    Mansfeld and Philip de Lannoy seigneur de Beauvoir walked immediately behind
    him, and with them were a number of gentlemen and ladies&mdash;relatives
    and friends of the High-Bailiff of Ghent.</p>
  <p>In like manner a cort&egrave;ge had been formed round the bride-elect: she
    was supported on either side by her father and by don Alberic del Rio, his
    most intimate friend, and around her were many Spanish seigniors of high
    rank, amongst whom the Archbishop of Sorrento, who was on a visit to Brussels,
    and don Gonzalo de Bracamonte, commanding the Governor&rsquo;s bodyguard,
    were the most noteworthy.</p>
  <p>A tense silence hung over the large and brilliant assembly, only the frou-frou
    of brocaded gowns, the flutter of fans, and up above in the vaulted roof
    the waving of banners in the breeze broke that impressive hush which invariably
    precedes the accomplishment of something momentous and irrevocable.</p>
  <p>And now the High Bailiff began to speak in accordance with the time-honoured
    tradition of his people&mdash;wilfully oblivious of the sneers, the sarcastic
    smiles, the supercilious glances which were so conspicuous in the swarthy
    faces of the Spanish grandees opposite to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my purpose, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he began solemnly, and speaking
    directly to don Juan de Vargas, &ldquo;to ask that you do give your daughter
    in wedlock to my son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And don Juan de Vargas gave answer with equal solemnity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before acceding to your request, Messire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
    demand to know whether your son is an honourable man and possessed of goods
    sufficient to ensure that my daughter continue to live as she hath done hitherto,
    in a manner befitting her rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son Mark, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; thereupon rejoined the High-Bailiff, &ldquo;is
    possessed of ten thousand ducats in gold, of twelve horses and of one half-share
    in the fleet of trading vessels belonging to me, which carry the produce
    of Flemish farms and of Flemish silk-looms to the ports of France, of Italy
    and of England. Moreover, six months after my son&rsquo;s marriage I will
    buy him a house in the St. Bavon quarter of this city, and some furniture
    to put into it so that he may live independently therein and in a manner
    befitting his rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter, Messire,&rdquo; resumed de Vargas still with the same
    grave solemnity, &ldquo;is possessed of five thousand ducats and of the prestige
    attached to her name, which next to that of the Lieutenant-Governor himself
    hath more power than any other name in this land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chief sheriff now spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on the day of the marriage of Messire van Rycke,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with
    the bride whom he hath chosen, I will give him sixteen goblets of silver
    and four silver tankards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And on the day of the marriage of donna Lenora de Vargas with the
    bridegroom chosen for her by her father,&rdquo; said don Alberic del Rio, &ldquo;I
    will give her a girdle of gold, a necklace of pearls and three rings set
    with diamonds and rubies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will give the bridegroom two silver dishes and four gold salt cellars,&rdquo; came
    in solemn fashion from young Count Mansfeld.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the bride I will give two gold bracelets and a rosary specially
    blessed by His Holiness,&rdquo; announced the Archbishop of Sorrento.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the bridegroom I will give two gold dishes and four silver spoons,&rdquo; said
    the seigneur de Beauvoir.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the bride I will give a statue of Our Lady wrought in ivory, and
    two silken carpets from Persia,&rdquo; said don Gonzalo de Bracamonte.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the High-Bailiff spoke once more:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My son Mark hath two hundred and twenty friends and kindred each
    of whom will present him with a suitable wedding gift.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter will have a gift from our Sovereign Lord the King, from
    the Governor of the Provinces and from the Lieutenant-Governor, and from
    fifteen Spanish grandees, three of whom are Knights of the Golden Fleece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherefore, O noble seignior,&rdquo; continued the High-Bailiff, &ldquo;I
    do ask you to give your daughter to my son for wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which request I do grant you, Messire,&rdquo; said de Vargas, &ldquo;and
    herewith make acceptance on my daughter&rsquo;s behalf, of your son Mark
    to be her husband and guardian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don Gonzalo de Bracamonte now handed him a drawn sword, a hat, a ring and
    a mantle: de Vargas holding the sword upright, placed the hat on the tip
    of the blade and hung the ring upon a projecting ornament of the hilt. This
    together with the mantle and a piece of silver he then handed over to Mark,
    saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With these emblems I hereby hand over to you the custody of my daughter,
    and as I have been her faithful custodian in the past, so do I desire you
    to become her guardian and protector henceforth, taking charge of her worldly
    possessions and duly administering them honourably and loyally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile the chief sheriff had in similar manner given Mark seven
    gloves: these the young man now handed to se&ntilde;or de Vargas in exchange
    for the emblems of his own marital authority, and saying the while:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I accept the trust and guardianship of your daughter Lenora which
    you have imposed upon me, and herewith I plight you my troth that I will
    henceforth administer her worldly possessions both honourably and loyally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With this the quaint ceremonial came to an end. The Spanish seigniors very
    obviously drew deep sighs of relief. The Archbishop and don Gonzalo as well
    as de Vargas himself had studied their parts carefully, for the Lieutenant-Governor
    had expressly desired that the betrothal should be done with all the formalities
    and ceremonies which the custom of the Netherlands demanded. All three seigniors
    had chafed at this irksome task&mdash;they found torrents of ridicule to
    pour upon the loutish Netherlanders and their vulgar and unseemly habits;
    but the Duke was firm, and obedience was obligatory. Lenora had, of course,
    not been consulted on the subject; she was just the sad little bundle of
    goods which was being bargained for, for the furtherance of political intrigues,
    together with her five thousand ducats, her golden girdle and rosary specially
    blessed by the Pope. She stood by while the solemn bargaining was going on,
    the centre of the group&mdash;a pathetic young figure in her white gown,
    a curious flush&mdash;maybe of shame&mdash;upon her cheeks. But at last it
    was over and de Vargas now turned to his daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Mark, the son of the High-Bailiff
    of Ghent; the alliance which you are about to contract with him is a source
    of great satisfaction to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mark in the meanwhile had stood by&mdash;quite impassive and seemingly indifferent&mdash;while
    the ceremony of betrothal was taking place. There was nothing new to him
    in the solemn speeches delivered by his father and his friends, nor in those
    which the Spanish seigniors had learned so glibly by heart; he had more than
    once been present at the betrothal of one or other of his friends, and these
    customs and ceremonials were as familiar, as sacred to him, perhaps, as the
    divine service of his Church. Now at de Vargas&rsquo; last words he advanced,
    with back bent, nearer to his beautiful fianc&eacute;e. He had refrained
    from looking on her while his worldly goods and hers were being thus proclaimed
    in loud tones by their respective friends, because he felt that she&mdash;being
    a total stranger&mdash;must find his country&rsquo;s custom either ridiculous
    or irksome.</p>
  <p>But now when he straightened out his tall figure, he suddenly sought her
    eyes, and seemed to compel her glance by the very intentness of his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give Messire van Rycke your hand, Lenora,&rdquo;  commanded de Vargas.</p>
  <p>And the girl&mdash;obediently and mechanically&mdash;stretched out her small,
    white hand and Mark van Rycke touched her finger tips with his lips.</p>
  <p>Every one noticed how closely se&ntilde;or de Vargas had watched his daughter
    all the while that the formal ceremony of betrothal was taking place, and
    that, as soon as donna Lenora had extended her hand to Messire van Rycke
    a smile of intense satisfaction became apparent round the corners of his
    mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now, Messire,&rdquo; he said solemnly, and turning once more
    to the bridegroom-elect, &ldquo;it is my pleasant duty to apprise you that
    our Sovereign Lord and King hath himself desired that I should be his mouthpiece
    in wishing you lasting happiness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, Messire,&rdquo; said Mark van Rycke quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you know,&rdquo; continued de Vargas speaking with paternal benevolence, &ldquo;it
    is the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s earnest wish that we should hasten the
    wedding. He himself hath graciously fixed this day sennight for the religious
    ceremony&mdash;the festival day of Our Lady of Victory&mdash;a great and
    solemn occasion, Messire,&rdquo; he continued unctuously, &ldquo;which will
    sanctify your union with my daughter and confer on it an additional blessing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As His Highness commands,&rdquo; rejoined Mark somewhat impatiently.</p>
  <p>He had made several efforts to meet his beautiful bride&rsquo;s glance again,
    but she kept her eyes steadily averted from his now.</p>
  <p>Truly so cold and unemotional a bride was enough to put any bridegroom out
    of patience. No doubt had Laurence van Rycke stood there instead of Mark
    there might have been enacted a little scene of ill-temper which would have
    disturbed don Juan de Vargas&rsquo; unctuous manner. But Mark took it all
    as a matter of course: he looked supremely indifferent and more than a little
    bored whilst his prospective father-in-law delivered himself of all these
    urbane speeches. He had obviously been deeply struck at first by donna Lenora&rsquo;s
    exquisite beauty, but now the effect of this pleasing surprise had worn off,
    he looked down on her with cool indifference, whilst a little smile of irony
    became more and more accentuated round his lips. But the High-Bailiff appeared
    overjoyed; his flat, Flemish face gradually broadened into a huge, complacent
    smile, he leaned on the arm of his son with easy familiarity and every one
    felt that&mdash;had se&ntilde;or de Vargas demanded such a token of gratitude
    and loyalty&mdash;Mynheer Charles van Rycke would have laid down on the floor
    and licked the dust from Monseigneur&rsquo;s slashed shoes.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>At last the interminable ceremony of betrothal was over and donna Lenora
    was given a little breathing time from the formal etiquette which surrounded
    her father whenever he represented the Lieutenant-Governor, and which oppressed
    this poor young girl physically like the stiff corslet which she wore.</p>
  <p>She looked around her a little wistfully: her father was busy conversing
    with the High-Bailiff, no doubt on matters connected with the respective
    marriage-jointures: all around in the magnificent hall, under the high roof
    emblazoned and decorated with the arms of the city and the banners of the
    city guilds, a noisy throng, gaily dressed, pressed, jostled and chattered.
    The ladies of Ghent&mdash;somewhat unwieldy of figure and with none of the
    highly-trained &aelig;sthetic taste of Spanish civilisation&mdash;had decked
    themselves out in finery which was more remarkable for its gorgeousness than
    for harmony of colour.</p>
  <p>The lateness of the season had proved an excuse for wearing the rich velvets
    and brocades imported from Italy, cloth of gold heavily embroidered, stomachers
    wrought in tinsel threads and pearls, hooped petticoats and monster farthingales
    moved before donna Lenora&rsquo;s pensive eyes like a kaleidoscope of many
    colours, brilliant and dazzling. The deep window embrasures each held a living
    picture grouped against the rich background of heavy velvet curtains or exquisite
    carved panelling; men and women in bright crimson, or yellow or green, the
    gorgeous liveries of one or other of the civic corporations, the uniforms
    of the guild-militia, the robes of the sheriffs and the wardmasters, all
    looked like a crowd of gaily plumaged birds, with here and there the rich
    trenchant note of a black velvet tunic worn by a member of one of the learned
    bodies, or the purple satin doublet of a Spanish grandee. The Flemish bourgeoisie
    and patriciate kept very much to itself&mdash;the women eyeing with some
    disfavour the stiff demeanour and sombre clothes of the Spaniards who remained
    grouped around the person of don Juan de Vargas. There was also the element
    of fear, never far distant when the Spanish officers of State were present.
    They personified to all these people the tyranny of Spain&mdash;the yoke
    of slavery which would never again be lifted from the land. The Netherlanders
    feared their masters, and many cringed and fawned before them, but they never
    mixed with them; they held themselves entirely aloof.</p>
  <p>There were no Spanish ladies here. The Duchess of Alva was not in Flanders,
    the grandees and officers of Alva&rsquo;s army had left their wives and daughters
    at home in Arragon or Castile; the stay in these dour and unsympathetic Low
    Countries was always something of a punishment to these sons and daughters
    of the South, who hated the grey skies, the north-easterly winds and perpetual
    rains.</p>
  <p>Thus donna Lenora found herself strangely isolated. The Flemish ladies banded
    themselves in groups, they chatted together, whispered and made merry, but
    the Spanish girl who had stood in high honour beside the Lieutenant-Governor&rsquo;s
    representative was not one of themselves. She was slim and tall and graceful,
    she was dressed in simple white; above all, she belonged to the ruling caste,
    and though many a kind-hearted Flemish vrouw pitied her in her loneliness,
    not one of them thought of going to speak to her.</p>
  <p>Donna Lenora sighed and her eyes filled with tears&mdash;with tears not
    altogether of sorrow, but also of self-pity mingled with bitter resentment.
    Even the company of her future husband might have been acceptable at this
    moment, when she felt so very lonely.</p>
  <p>But Mark van Rycke was no longer nigh.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Then suddenly her face lit up with joy, the colour rushed to her cheeks,
    and her lips parted in a smile.</p>
  <p>She had just espied in the brilliant throng, one no less brilliant figure
    which was slowly pushing its way through the crowd in her direction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ramon,&rdquo; she whispered, as soon as the young man was quite close
    to her, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Highness,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;has given me command of the
    garrison here; I arrived last night with my regiment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where are your lodgings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the house of those thrice accursed van Ryckes,&rdquo;  he muttered
    with an oath. &ldquo;The billeting was arranged without my knowledge, and
    of course I and my men leave those quarters to-morrow. Every morsel I eat
    in that house seems to choke me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Ramon!&rdquo; she whispered with tender pity. &ldquo;I too have
    been unutterably wretched since I saw you in Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t communicate with you again, sweetheart&mdash;and
    this to my great grief&mdash;but I was bundled out of Brussels like a bale
    of goods, and here I am! Imagine my joy when I realised that I should see
    you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she murmured quickly, for with a quick impulse he had
    seized her hand and was pressing it to his lips. &ldquo;My father can see
    us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What matter if he do,&rdquo; retorted don Ramon. &ldquo;He has taken
    you from me, but he cannot kill my love ... our love, Lenora,&rdquo; he added
    with passionate ardour&mdash;an ardour in which he himself believed for the
    moment, since he loved Lenora and she was so exquisite, in her stateliness,
    her white gown and that casque of golden hair upon her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not say that, Ramon,&rdquo; she said with earnestness that
    was far more real than his, &ldquo;you must try and help me ... and not make
    my sacrifice altogether unbearable. It has been terrible,&rdquo; she added,
    and a curious, haunted look came into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been the most damnable thing that has ever been done on this
    earth, Lenora. When I arrived in this accursed city last night and quartered
    myself and some of my men in the house of the High-Bailiff, I would gladly
    have put the whole accursed family to the sword. There is no limit to my
    hatred of them&mdash;and of all those who stand between me and your love.
    I have hated your father, Lenora, ever since he parted us.... I have hated
    Alva! God help me! I have hated even the King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ramon spoke in a low, hoarse murmur, inaudible to every one save to the
    shell-like ear for which it was intended. With irresistible force he had
    drawn Lenora&rsquo;s arm through his own, and had led her&mdash;much against
    her will&mdash;into one of the deep window embrasures, where heavy curtains
    of Utrecht velvet masked them both from view. He pressed her to sit on one
    of the low window seats, and through the soft-toned stained glass the dim
    light of the moon came peeping in and threw ghostlike glimmers upon the tendrils
    of her hair, even whilst the ruddy lights of the candles played upon her
    face and her white gown. For the first time to-night the young man realised
    all that he had lost and how infinitely desirable was the woman whom he had
    so airily given up without a fight. He cursed himself for his cowardice,
    even though he knew that he never would have the courage to dare defiance
    for her sake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said, with passionate intensity, &ldquo;ever since
    your father and the Duke of Alva made me understand that they were taking
    you away from me, I have been wondering if it was humanly possible for any
    man who has known you as I have done, who has loved you as I love you still,
    to give you up to another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has to be, Ramon,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Oh! you must
    not think that I have not thought and fought&mdash;thought of what was my
    duty&mdash;fought for my happiness. Now,&rdquo; she added with a little sigh
    of weariness, &ldquo;I cannot fight any more. My father, the Duke of Alva,
    the King himself in a personal letter to me, have told me where my duty lies.
    My confessor would withhold absolution from me if I refused to obey. My King
    and country and the Church have need of me it seems: what is my happiness
    worth if weighed in the balance of my country&rsquo;s service?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are so unfitted for that sort of work,&rdquo; he murmured sullenly, &ldquo;they
    will make of you something a little better than a spy in the house of the
    High-Bailiff of Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is the only thing which troubles me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
    feel as if I were doing something mean and underhand. I shall marry a man
    whom I can never love, who belongs to a race that has always been inimical
    to Spain. My husband will hate all those whom I love. He will hate everything
    that I have always honoured and cherished&mdash;my King, my country, the
    glory and grandeur of Spain. He will rebel against her laws which I know
    to be beneficent even though they seem harsh and even cruel at times. A Netherlander
    can never have anything in common with a Spaniard....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;d murder us if they could,&rdquo; the young man rejoined
    with a careless shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;but only in the dark streets
    or from behind a hedge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King is very angry with them, I know; he declared that he would
    not come to the Netherlands until there is not a single rebel or heretic
    within its shores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The terms are synonymous,&rdquo; he retorted lightly, &ldquo;and
    I fear that His Majesty will never grace this abominable country with his
    presence, if his resolution holds good. They are a stiff-necked crowd, these
    Netherlanders&mdash;Catholics and heretics, they are all rebels&mdash;but
    the heretics are the worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as she said nothing, but stared straight out before her at this crowd
    of people amongst whom she was doomed to live in the future, he continued
    with a tone of sullen wrath:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have burnt a goodly number of these rebels, but still they swarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl with a shudder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Horrible, my dear love?&rdquo; he said with a cynical laugh, &ldquo;it
    is the only way to deal with these people. Their arrogance passes belief;
    their treachery knows no bounds. The King&rsquo;s sacred person would not
    be safe here among them; the Duke&rsquo;s life has often been threatened;
    the heretics have pillaged and ransacked the churches! No! you must not waste
    your sympathy on the people here. They are rebellious and treacherous to
    the core. As for me, I hate them tenfold, for it is one of them who will
    take you from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He cannot take my heart from you, Ramon, for that will be yours always.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lenora!&rdquo; he whispered once more with that fierce earnestness
    which he seemed unable to control, &ldquo;you know what is in my mind?&mdash;what
    I have thought and planned ever since I realised that you were being taken
    from me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Alva&mdash;the King himself&mdash;want you to work for
    them&mdash;to be their tool. Well! so be it! You have not the strength to
    resist&mdash;I have not the power to rebel! If we did we should both be crushed
    like miserable worms by the powers which know how to force obedience. Often
    have I thought in the past two miserable days that I would kill you, Lenora,
    and myself afterwards, but...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The words died on his lips, his olive skin became almost livid in hue. Hastily
    he drew a tiny image from inside his doublet: with it in his hand he made
    the sign of the Cross, then kissed it reverently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would die unabsolved, my Lenora,&rdquo; he whispered, and the
    girl&rsquo;s cheeks became very white, too, as he spoke, &ldquo;and I should
    be committing a crime for which there is no pardon ... and I could not do
    that,&rdquo; he added more firmly, &ldquo;I would sooner face the fires of
    the Inquisition than those of hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Superstitious fear held them both in its grip, and that fanatical enthusiasm
    which in these times saw in the horrible excesses of that execrable Inquisition&mdash;in
    its torture-chambers and scaffolds and stakes&mdash;merely the means of killing
    bodies that were worthless and saving immortal souls from everlasting torture
    and fire. Lenora was trembling from head to foot, and tears of horror and
    of dread gathered in her eyes. Don Ramon made a violent effort to regain
    his composure and at the same time to comfort her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not be afraid, Lenora,&rdquo; he said quietly,  &ldquo;those
    demons of blind fury, of homicide and of suicide have been laid low. I fought
    with them and conquered them. Their cruel temptations no longer assail me,
    and the Holy Saints themselves have shown me the way to be patient&mdash;to
    wait in silence until you have fulfilled your destiny&mdash;until you have
    accomplished the work which the King and the Church will demand of you. After
    that, I know that the man who now will claim what I would give my life to
    possess&mdash;you, Lenora&mdash;will be removed from your path. How it will
    be done, I do not know ... but he will die, Lenora, of that I am sure. He
    will die before a year has gone by, and I will then come back to you and
    claim you for my wife. You will be free then, and will no longer owe obedience
    to your father. I will claim you, Lenora! and even now, here and at this
    hour, I do solemnly plight you my troth, in the very teeth of the man whose
    wife you are about to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And of a truth,&rdquo; here broke in a pleasant and good-humoured
    voice with a short laugh, &ldquo;it is lucky that I happened to be present
    here and now and at this hour to register this exceedingly amiable vow.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Don Ramon de Linea had jumped to his feet; his hand was upon his sword-hilt;
    instinctively he had placed himself in front of donna Lenora and facing the
    intruder who was standing beside the velvet curtain, with one hand holding
    back its heavy folds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messire van Rycke?&rdquo; he exclaimed, whilst he strove to put into
    his attitude all the haughtiness and dignity of which the present situation
    had undoubtedly robbed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Mark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were spying on donna Lenora and on me, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed not, se&ntilde;or. I only happened upon the scene&mdash;quite
    accidentally, I assure you&mdash;at the moment when you were prophesying
    my early demise and arranging to be present at my funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you trying to be insolent, sirrah?&rdquo; quoth don Ramon roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; rejoined Mark, good-humouredly, &ldquo;I
    should succeed so ill. My intention was when I saw se&ntilde;or de Vargas&rsquo; angry
    glance persistently directed against my future wife to save her from the
    consequences of his wrath, and incidentally to bear her company for awhile:
    a proceeding for which&mdash;I think you will admit, se&ntilde;or&mdash;I
    have the fullest right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have no rights over this gracious lady, fellow,&rdquo; retorted
    the Spaniard with characteristic arrogance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None, I own, save those which she deigns to confer upon me. And if
    she bid me begone, I will go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begone then, you impudent varlet!&rdquo; cried don Ramon, whose temper
    was not proof against the other&rsquo;s calm insolence, &ldquo;ere I run
    my sword through your miserable body....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Ramon,&rdquo; here interposed donna Lenora with cool authority, &ldquo;you
    forget your own dignity and mine in this unseemly quarrel. Messire van Rycke
    is in the right. An he desires to speak with me I am at his disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not before he has arranged to meet me at the back of his father&rsquo;s
    house at daybreak to-morrow. Bring your witnesses, sirrah! I&rsquo;ll condescend
    to fight you fairly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could not do that, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; replied Mark van Rycke
    with perfect equanimity, &ldquo;I am such a poor swordsman and you so cunning
    a fighter. I am good with my fists, but it would be beneath the dignity of
    a grandee of Spain to measure fists with a Flemish burgher. Still&mdash;if
    it is your pleasure...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Although this altercation had been carried on within the depth of a vast
    window embrasure and with heavy curtains to right and left to deaden the
    sound of angry voices, the fact that two men were quarrelling in the presence
    of donna Lenora de Vargas had become apparent to not a few.</p>
  <p>De Vargas himself, who for the past quarter of an hour had viewed with growing
    wrath his daughter&rsquo;s intimate conversation with don Ramon de Linea,
    saw what was happening, and realised that within the next few moments an
    exceedingly unpleasant scandal would occur which would place don Ramon de
    Linea&mdash;a Spanish officer of high rank, commanding the garrison in Ghent&mdash;in
    a false and humiliating position.</p>
  <p>In these days, however, and with the perfect organisation of which de Vargas
    himself was a most conspicuous member, such matters were very easily put
    right. A scandal under the present circumstances would be prejudicial to
    Spanish prestige, therefore no scandal must occur: a fight between a Spanish
    officer and the future husband of donna Lenora de Vargas might have unpleasant
    consequences for the latter, therefore even a provocation must be avoided.</p>
  <p>And it was done quite simply: don Juan de Vargas whispered to a man who
    stood not far from him and who was dressed very quietly in a kind of livery
    of sombre purple and black&mdash;the livery worn by servants of the Inquisition.
    The man, without a word, left de Vargas&rsquo; side and edged his way along
    the panelled walls of the great hall till he reached the window embrasure
    where the little scene was taking place. He had shoes with soles of felt
    and made no noise as he glided unobtrusively along the polished floor. Neither
    Mark van Rycke nor don Ramon de Linea saw him approach, but just as the latter,
    now wholly beside himself with rage, was fingering his glove with a view
    to flinging it in the other&rsquo;s face, the man in the purple and black
    livery touched him lightly on the shoulder and whispered something in his
    ear. Then he walked away as silently, as unobtrusively as he had come.</p>
  <p>But don Ramon de Linea&rsquo;s rage fell away from him like a mantle; the
    glove fell from his nerveless hand to the floor. He bit his lip till a tiny
    drop of blood appeared upon it; then he hastily turned on his heel, and after
    a deep bow to donna Lenora but without another word to Mark van Rycke he
    walked away, and soon disappeared among the crowd.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>Donna Lenora was leaning back against the cushioned window-sill, her hands
    lay in her lap, slightly quivering and twisting a tiny lace handkerchief
    between the fingers: in her eyes, which obviously followed for some time
    the movements of don Ramon&rsquo;s retreating figure, there was a pathetic
    look as that of a frightened child. She seemed quite unaware of Mark&rsquo;s
    presence, and he remained leaning back against the angle of the embrasure,
    watching the girl for awhile, then, as she remained quite silent and apparently
    desirous of ignoring him altogether, he turned to look with indifferent gaze
    on the ever-changing and moving picture before him.</p>
  <p>One or two of the high officers of State had retired, and the departure
    of these pompous Spanish officials was the signal for greater freedom and
    merriment among the guests of the High-Bailiff and of the Sheriffs of the
    city of Ghent. The orchestra in the gallery up above had struck up the measure
    of a lively galliarde the centre of the hall had been cleared, and the young
    people were dancing whilst the graver folk made circle around them, in order
    to watch the dance.</p>
  <p>As was usual, the moment that dancing began and hilarity held sway, most
    of the guests slipped on a velvet mask, which partly hid the face and was
    supposed&mdash;owing to the certain air of mystery which it conveyed&mdash;to
    confer greater freedom of speech upon the wearer and greater ease of manner.
    There were but few of the rich Spanish doublets to be seen now: the more
    garish colours beloved of the worthy burghers of Flanders held undisputed
    sway. But here and there a dark figure or two&mdash;clad in purple and black
    of a severe cut&mdash;were seen gliding in and out among the crowd, and wherever
    they appeared they seemed to leave a trail of silence behind them.</p>
  <p>Mark was just about to make a serious effort at conversing with his fianc&eacute;e,
    and racking his brain as to what subject of gossip would interest her most,
    when a man in sombre attire, and wearing a mask, came close up to his elbow.
    Mark looked him quietly up and down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence!&rdquo; he said without the slightest show of surprise,
    and turning well away from donna Lenora so that she should not hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want father to
    know that I am here ... but I couldn&rsquo;t keep away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you get through?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I disclosed myself to the men-at-arms. No one seemed astonished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should they be? Your escapade is not known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has everything gone off well?&rdquo; queried Laurence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admirably,&rdquo; replied the other dryly. &ldquo;I was just about
    to make myself agreeable to my fianc&eacute;e when you interrupted me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hinder you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you been home at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. My heart ached for our dear mother, and though my resolution
    was just as firm, I wanted to comfort her. I slipped into the house, just
    after you had left. I saw our mother, and she told me what you had done.
    I am very grateful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you speak to father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for a moment. He came up to say &lsquo;good-night&rsquo;  to
    mother when I was leaving her room. She had told me the news, so I no longer
    tried to avoid him. Of course he is full of wrath against me for the fright
    I gave him, but, on the whole, meseemed as if his anger was mostly pretence
    and he right glad that things turned out as they have done. I am truly grateful
    to you, Mark,&rdquo; reiterated Laurence earnestly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that all is for the best?&rdquo;  rejoined Mark dryly. &ldquo;Now
    stand aside, man, and let me speak to my bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is very beautiful, Mark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! it is too late to think of that, man!&rdquo; quoth Mark with
    his habitual good-humour; &ldquo;we cannot play shuttlecock with the lovely
    Lenora, and she is no longer for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not interfere, never fear. It was only curiosity that
    got the better of me and the longing to get a glimpse of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>This rapid colloquy between the two brothers had been carried on in whispers,
    and both had drawn well away from the window embrasure, leaving the velvet
    curtain between them and donna Lenora so as to deaden the sound of their
    voices and screen them from her view.</p>
  <p>But now Mark turned back to his fianc&eacute;e, ready for that <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
    her which he felt would be expected of him; he found her still sitting solitary
    and silent on the low window seat, with the cold glint of moonlight on her
    hair and the red glow of the candles in the ballroom throwing weird patches
    of vivid light and blue shadows upon her white silk gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do I intrude upon your meditations, se&ntilde;orita?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do
    you wish me to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am entirely at your service, Messire,&rdquo; she replied coldly, &ldquo;as
    you so justly remarked to don Ramon de Linea, you have every right to my
    company an you so desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I expressed myself clumsily, I own,&rdquo; he retorted a little impatiently, &ldquo;nothing
    was further from my thoughts than to force my company upon you. But,&rdquo; he
    added whimsically, &ldquo;meseems that&mdash;since we are destined to spend
    so much of our future together&mdash;we might make an early start at mutual
    understanding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you thought that conversation in a ballroom would be a good start
    for the desirable purpose?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say: why not?&rdquo; she replied lightly, &ldquo;there is
    so little that we can say to one another that it can just as well be said
    in a ballroom. We know so little of one another at present&mdash;and so long
    as my looks have not displeased you...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your beauty, se&ntilde;orita, has no doubt been vaunted by more able
    lips than mine: I acknowledge it gratefully and without stint as an additional
    gift of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Additional?&rdquo; she asked with a slight raising of her brows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! additional!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because my first glance
    of you told me plainly that you are endowed with all the most perfect attributes
    of womanhood. Good women,&rdquo; he added quaintly, &ldquo;are so often plain
    and beautiful women so often unpleasant, that to find in one&rsquo;s future
    wife goodness allied to beauty is proof that one of singularly blessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which compliment, Messire, would be more acceptable if I felt that
    it was sincere. Your praise of my looks is flattering; as to my goodness,
    you have no proof of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! there you wrong yourself, se&ntilde;orita. Are you not marrying
    me entirely against your will, and because you desire to be obedient to your
    father and to the Duke of Alva? Are you not marrying me out of loyalty to
    your King, to your country, and to your church? A woman who is as loyal and
    submissive as that, will be loyal to her husband too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This will I strive to be, Messire,&rdquo; rejoined Lenora, who either
    did not or would not perceive the slight tone of good-humoured mockery which
    lurked in Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s amiable speech. &ldquo;I will strive to
    be loyal to you, since my father and the King himself, it seems, have desired
    that I should be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, by the Mass,&rdquo; he retorted gaily, &ldquo;I shall expect
    something more than loyalty and submission from so beautiful a wife, you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next to the King and to my faith,&rdquo; she replied coldly, &ldquo;you
    will always be first in my thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in your heart, I trust, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are not masters of our heart, Messire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, so long as that precious guerdon is not bestowed on another
    man,&rdquo; said Mark with a sigh, &ldquo;I suppose that I shall have to
    be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, satisfied,&rdquo; broke in the girl with sudden vehemence. &ldquo;Satisfied,
    did you say, Messire? You are satisfied to take a wife whom till to-day you
    had not even seen&mdash;who was bargained for on your behalf by your father
    because it suited some political scheme of which you have not even cognizance.
    Satisfied!&rdquo; she reiterated bitterly; &ldquo;more satisfied apparently
    with this bargaining than if you were buying a horse, for there, at least,
    you would have wished to see the animal ere you closed with the deal, and
    know something of its temper.... But a wife! ... What matters what she thinks
    and feels? if she be cold or loving, gentle or shrewish, sensitive to a kind
    word or callous to cruelty? A wife! ... Well! so long as no other man hath
    ever kissed her lips&mdash;for that would hurt masculine vanity and wound
    the pride of possession! I am only a woman, made to obey my father first,
    and my husband afterwards.... But you, a man! ... Who forced you to obey?
    ... No one! And you did not care.... This marriage was spoken of a month
    ago, and Segovia is not at the end of the world&mdash;did you even take the
    trouble to go a-courting me there? Did you even care to see me, though I
    have been close on a week in this country? ... You spoke of my heart just
    now ... how do you hope to win it? ... Well! let me tell you this, Messire,
    that though I must abide by the bargain which my father and yours have entered
    into for my body, my heart and my soul belong to my cousin, Ramon de Linea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had thus poured forth the torrent of bitterness and resentment which
    had oppressed her heart all this while: she spoke with intense vehemence,
    but with it all retained just a sufficiency of presence of mind not to raise
    her voice&mdash;it came like a hoarse murmur choked at times with sobs, but
    never loud enough to be heard above the mingled sound of music and gaiety
    which echoed from wall to wall of the magnificent room. So, too, was she
    careful of gesture; she kept her hands pressed close against her heart, save
    when from time to time she brushed away impatiently an obtrusive tear, or
    pushed back the tendrils of her fair hair from her moist forehead.</p>
  <p>Mark had listened quite quietly to her impassioned tirade: there was no
    suspicion now in his grave face of that good-humoured irony and indifference
    which sat there so habitually. Of course he could say nothing to justify
    himself: he could not explain to this beautiful, eminently desirable and
    sensitive woman, whose self-respect had already been gravely wounded, that
    he was not to blame for not going to woo her before; that she had originally
    been intended for his brother, and that all the reproaches which she was
    pouring upon his innocent head were really well deserved by Laurence but
    not by him. He felt that he was cutting a sorry figure at this moment, and
    the sensation that was uppermost in him was a strong desire to give his elder
    brother a kick.</p>
  <p>He did his best with the help of the curtain and his own tall figure, to
    screen donna Lenora from the gaze of the crowd. He knew that se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas was still somewhere in the room, and on no account did he want
    a father&rsquo;s interference at this moment. Whether he was really very
    sorry for the girl he could not say; she certainly had given him a moral
    slap on the face when she avowed her love for don Ramon, and he did not feel
    altogether inclined at this precise moment to soothe and comfort her, or
    even to speak perfunctory words of love, which he was far from feeling, and
    which, no doubt, she would reject with scorn.</p>
  <p>Thus now, when she appeared more calm, tired, no doubt, by the great emotional
    effort, he only spoke quite quietly, but with as much gentleness as he could:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For both our sakes, donna Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I could
    wish that you had not named Ramon de Linea. It grieves me sorely that the
    bonds which your father&rsquo;s will are imposing upon you, should prove
    to be so irksome; but I should be doing you an ill-turn if I were to offer
    you at this moment that freedom for which you so obviously crave. Not only
    your father&rsquo;s wrath, but that of the Duke of Alva would fall on you
    with far greater weight than it would on me, and your own country hath instituted
    methods for dealing with disobedience which I would not like to see used
    against you. That being the case, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; he continued, with
    a return to his usual good-tempered carelessness, &ldquo;would it not be
    wiser, think you, to make the best of this bad bargain, and to try and live,
    if not in amity, at least not in open enmity one toward the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no enmity in my heart against you, Messire,&rdquo; she rejoined
    calmly, &ldquo;and I crave your pardon that I did so far forget myself as
    to speak of don Ramon to you. I&rsquo;ll not transgress in that way in future,
    that I promise you. You have no love for me&mdash;you never can have any,
    meseems: you are a Netherlander, I a Spaniard: our every thoughts lie as
    asunder as the poles. You obey your father, and I mine; our hands will be
    clasped, but our hearts can never meet. Had you not been so callous, it might
    have been different: I might have looked upon you as a friend, and not a
    mere tool for the accomplishment of my country&rsquo;s destiny.... And now
    may I beg of you not to prolong this interview.... Would we had not tried
    to understand one another, for meseems we have fallen into graver misunderstandings
    than before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When may I see you again?&rdquo; asked Mark van Rycke, with coolness
    now quite equal to hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every day until our wedding, Messire, in the presence of my aunt,
    donna Inez de Salgado, as the custom of my country allows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall look forward to the wild excitement of these daily meetings,&rdquo; he
    said, quite unable to suppress the laughter which danced in his grey eyes.</p>
  <p>She took no notice of the gentle raillery, but dismissed him with a gracious
    nod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I tell se&ntilde;or de Vargas,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that
    you are alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she replied hastily. &ldquo;I prefer to be alone for
    a little while. I pray you to leave me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bowed before her with all the stiffness and formality which Spanish etiquette
    demanded, then he turned away from her, and soon she lost sight of his broad
    shoulders in the midst of the gayest groups in the crowd.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>8</b></h3>
  <p>The interview with her future husband had not left donna Lenora any happier
    or more contented with her lot. The callousness which he had shown in accepting
    a fianc&eacute;e like a bale of valueless goods was equally apparent in his
    attitude after this first introduction to her. The poor girl&rsquo;s heart
    was heavy. She had had so little experience of the world, and none at all
    of men. Already at an early age she had become motherless; all the care and
    the tenderness which she had ever known was from the father whose pride in
    her beauty was far greater than his love for his child. A rigid convent education
    had restrained the development of her ideals and of her aspirations; at nineteen
    years of age the dominating thought in her was service to her King and country,
    loyalty and obedience to her father and to the Church.</p>
  <p>In the crowded ballroom she saw young girls moving freely and gaily, talking
    and laughing without apparently a care or sorrow; yet they belonged to a
    subject and rebel race; the laws of a powerful alien government dominated
    their lives; fear of the Inquisition restrained the very freedom of their
    thoughts. They were all of them rebels in the eyes of their King: the comprehensive
    death-warrant issued by the Duke of Alva against every Netherlander&mdash;man,
    woman, and child, irrespective of rank, irrespective of creed, irrespective
    of political convictions&mdash;hung over every life here present like the
    real sword of Damocles: even this day all these people were dancing in the
    very presence of death. The thought of the torture-chamber, the gibbet, or
    the stake could never be wholly absent from their minds. And yet they seemed
    happy, whilst she, donna Lenora de Vargas, who should have been envied of
    them all, was sitting solitary and sad; her lace handkerchief was soaked
    through with her tears.</p>
  <p>A sudden movement of the curtain on her left roused her from her gloomy
    meditations. The next moment, a young man&mdash;with fair unruly hair, eyes
    glowing through the holes of the velvet mask which he wore, and sensitive
    mouth quivering with emotion&mdash;was kneeling beside her: he had captured
    one of her hands, and was kissing it with passionate fervour. Not a little
    frightened, she could hardly speak, but she did not feel indignant for she
    had been very lonely, and this mute adoration of her on the part of this
    unknown man acted like soothing balm on her wounded pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, sir,&rdquo; she murmured timorously, &ldquo;I pray you
    to leave me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked up into her face, and, through the holes of the mask, she could
    see that his eyes were&mdash;like hers&mdash;full of tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not,&rdquo; he whispered with soulful earnestness, &ldquo;till I
    have told you that your sorrow and your beauty have made an indelible impression
    on my heart, and that I desire to be your humble servitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One who anon will stand very near to you&mdash;as a brother....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A brother? Then you are...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence van Rycke,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;henceforth your faithful
    servant until death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she looked very perplexed and puzzled, he continued more quietly: &ldquo;I
    stood there&mdash;behind the curtain&mdash;quite close&mdash;whilst my brother
    spoke with you. I heard every word that you said, and my heart became filled
    with admiration and pity for you. I came here to-night only because I wished
    to see you. I looked upon you&mdash;without knowing you&mdash;as an enemy,
    perhaps a spy; now that I have seen you I feel as if my whole life must atone
    for the immense wrong which I had done you in my thoughts. You cannot guess&mdash;you
    will never know how infinite that wrong has been. But there is one thing
    I would wish you to know: and that is that I am a man to whom happiness in
    her most fulsome beauty stretched out her hands, and who in his blindness
    turned his back on her; if you can find it in your heart to pity and to trust
    me you will always find beside you a champion to defend you, a friend to
    protect you, a man prepared to atone with his life for the desperate wrong
    which he hath unwittingly done to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and she&mdash;still a little bewildered&mdash;rejoined gently: &ldquo;Sir,
    I thank you for those kind words; the kindest I have heard since I landed
    in the Low Countries. I hope that I shall not need a champion, for surely
    my husband&mdash;your brother, Messire&mdash;will know how to protect me
    when necessary. But who is there who hath no need of a friend? and it is
    a great joy to me in the midst of many disappointments, that in my husband&rsquo;s
    brother I shall have a true friend. Still, methinks, that you speak somewhat
    wildly. I am not conscious of any wrong that you or your family have done
    to me, and if your mother is as kind as you are, why, Messire, mine own happiness
    in her house is assured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven reward you for those gentle words, Se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; said
    Laurence van Rycke fervently, as he once more took her hand and kissed it;
    she withdrew it quietly, and he had perforce to let it go. It might have
    been his for always&mdash;her tiny hand and her exquisite person: but for
    his hot-headed action he might have stood now boldly beside her&mdash;the
    happy bridegroom beside this lovely bride. The feeling of gratitude which
    he had felt for Mark when the latter chose to unravel the skein of their
    family&rsquo;s destiny, which he&mdash;Laurence&mdash;had hopelessly embroiled,
    was now changed to unreasoning bitterness. What Mark had accepted with a
    careless shrug of the shoulders he&mdash;Laurence&mdash;would now give his
    life to possess. Fate had indeed made of her threads a tangle, and in this
    tangle he knew that his own happiness had become inextricably involved.</p>
  <p>He could not even remain beside donna Lenora now: he was here unbeknown
    to his father, a looker-on at the feast, whereat he might have presided.
    Even at this moment, se&ntilde;or de Vargas, having espied his daughter in
    conversation with an unknown man, was making his way toward the window embrasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; whispered Laurence hurriedly, &ldquo;that
    ring upon your middle finger ... if at any time you require help or protection
    will you send it to me? Wherever I may be I would come at once ... whatever
    you told me to do I hereby swear that I would accomplish ... will you promise
    that if you need me, you will send me that ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she, who was lonely, and had no one to love her devotedly, gave the
    promise which he asked.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>

  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Don Ramon de Linea was one of the last to leave the Town House. He was on
    duty until all the Spanish officers of State had left the building, and it
    was long past midnight before he wended his way through the narrow streets
    of the city till he reached the house of the High-Bailiff in the Nieuwstraate
    not far from the new bridge.</p>
  <p>The outward appearance of the house suggested that most of its occupants
    were abed, although there was a light in one of the windows on the ground
    floor, and through the uncurtained casement don Ramon caught sight of the
    High-Bailiff and his two sons sitting together over a final cup of wine.</p>
  <p>All the pent-up wrath against Mark van Rycke, which Ramon had been forced
    to keep in check under the eye of se&ntilde;or de Vargas, gave itself vent
    now in a comprehensive curse, and forgetting every code of decency toward
    his host and hostess he went up to the front door and gave the heavy oak
    panels a series of violent kicks with his boot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo; he shouted roughly, &ldquo;open, you confounded
    louts! What manners are these to close your doors against the soldiers of
    the King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had not finished swearing when the serving man&rsquo;s shuffling footsteps
    were heard crossing the tiled hall. The next moment there was a great rattle
    of bolts being drawn and chains being unhung, whereupon don Ramon&mdash;still
    impatient and wrathful&mdash;gave a final kick to the door, and since Pierre
    had already lifted the latch, it flew open and nearly knocked the poor man
    down with its weight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse you all for a set of lazy louts,&rdquo; shouted don Ramon at
    the top of his voice. &ldquo;Here, fellow,&rdquo; he added flinging himself
    into a chair, &ldquo;take off my boots and cloak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held out his leg, and Pierre, dutiful and obedient, took off the long
    boots of untanned leather which protected the slashed shoes and silk trunk-hose
    beneath, against the mud of the streets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is your master?&rdquo; queried the Spaniard roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the dining hall, so please you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;  replied
    the man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They went to the tavern over the way about an hour ago, after they
    had their supper&mdash;and they have not yet returned. They are making merry
    there, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; added old Pierre somewhat wistfully.</p>
  <p>And&mdash;as if in direct confirmation of the man&rsquo;s words&mdash;there
    came from the tavern on the opposite side of the street a deafening noise
    of wild hilarity. The peace of the night was broken and made hideous by hoarse
    shouts and laughter, a deafening crash as of broken glass, all intermixed
    with a bibulous song, sung out of tune in a chorus of male voices, and the
    clapping of empty mugs against wooden tables.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon cursed again, but this time under his breath. The order had gone
    forth recently from the Lieutenant-Governor himself that the Spanish troops
    quartered in Flemish cities were to behave themselves in a sober and becoming
    manner. The tavern of the &ldquo;Three Weavers&rdquo; being situated just
    opposite the house of the High-Bailiff, it was more than likely that the
    latter would take it upon himself to complain of the ribaldry and uproar
    which was disturbing his rest, and as the High-Bailiff was in high favour
    just now a severe reprimand for don Ramon might ensue, which prospect did
    not appeal to him in the least.</p>
  <p>For a moment he hesitated whether he would not go back across the road and
    order the men to be silent; but as luck or fate would have it, at that very
    moment the High-Bailiff opened the door of the dining-room and stepped out
    into the hall. Seeing the young Spaniard standing there, sullen and irresolute,
    he bade him courteously to come and join him and his two sons in a tankard
    of wine.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon accepted the invitation. The spirit of quarrelsome fury still
    brooded within him, and it was that spirit which made him wish to meet Mark
    van Rycke again and either provoke him into that quarrel which se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas&rsquo; timely intervention had prevented before, or, at any rate,
    to annoy and humiliate him with those airs of masterfulness and superiority
    which the Spaniards knew so well how to wield.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Mark and Laurence greeted their father&rsquo;s guest with utmost politeness.
    The former offered him a tankard of wine which don Ramon pushed away so roughly
    that the wine was spilled over the floor and over Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s
    clothes, whereupon the Spaniard swore as was his wont and murmured something
    about &ldquo;a clumsy lout!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurence sitting at the opposite side of the table clenched his fists till
    the knuckles shone like ivory and the skin was so taut that it threatened
    to crack; the blood rushed up to his cheeks and his eyes glowed with the
    fire of bitter resentment and of indignation not easily kept under control.
    But Mark ignored the insult, his face expressed nothing but good-humoured
    indifference, and a careless indulgence for the vagaries of a guest, like
    one would feel for those of an irresponsible child. As for the High-Bailiff,
    he still beamed with amiability and the determination to please his Spanish
    masters in every way that lay in his power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We would ask you, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Laurence after a slight
    pause during which he had made almost superhuman efforts to regain his self-control, &ldquo;kindly
    to admonish the soldiery in the tavern yonder. My mother is an invalid, the
    noise that the men make is robbing her of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The men will not stay at the tavern much longer,&rdquo;  said don
    Ramon haughtily, &ldquo;they are entitled to a little amusement after their
    arduous watch at the Town Hall. An Madame van Rycke will exercise a little
    patience, she will get to sleep within the hour and can lie abed a little
    longer to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not so much the lateness of the hour, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; here
    interposed the High-Bailiff urbanely, noting with horror that his son was
    about to lose his temper, &ldquo;neither I nor my sons would wish to interfere
    with the innocent pleasures of these brave men, but...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what is the pother about, sirrah?&rdquo; queried the Spaniard
    with well-studied insolence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only that...&rdquo; murmured the unfortunate High-Bailiff diffidently, &ldquo;only
    that...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are only two women in charge of the tavern at this hour,&rdquo; broke
    in Mark quietly, &ldquo;two young girls, whose father was arrested this morning
    for attending a camp-meeting outside the city. The girls are timid and unprotected,
    therefore we entreat that you, se&ntilde;or, do put a stop to the soldiers&rsquo; brawling
    and allow the tavern to be closed at this late hour of the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Don Ramon threw back his head and burst into loud and affected laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Mass, Messire!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I find you vastly amusing
    to be thus pleading for a pair of heretics. Did you perchance not know that
    to attend camp meetings is punishable by death? If people want to hear a
    sermon they should go to church where the true doctrine is preached. Nothing
    but rebellion and high-treason are preached at those meetings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were pleading for two defenceless girls,&rdquo;  rejoined Laurence,
    whose voice shook with suppressed passion. Even he dared not say anything
    more on the dangerous subject of religious controversy which Don Ramon had
    obviously brought forward with the wish to provoke a discussion&mdash;lest
    an unguarded word brought disaster upon his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; retorted don Ramon roughly, &ldquo;surely you would
    not begrudge those fine soldiers a little sport? Two pretty girls&mdash;did
    you not say they were pretty?&mdash;are not to be found in every street of
    this confounded city: and by the Mass! I feel the desire to go and have a
    look at the wenches myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose, yawned and stretched. Laurence was white with passion: there was
    a glow of deadly hate in his eyes&mdash;of fury that was almost maniacal:
    with a mechanical gesture he tore at the ruff at his throat. Don Ramon looked
    on him with contempt in his eyes and a malicious smile round his full lips.
    He shrugged his shoulders and laughed softly&mdash;ironically to himself.
    The next moment Laurence, unable to control himself, had sprung to his feet:
    he would have been at the other&rsquo;s throat, but that Mark who had been
    quietly watching him was just in time to seize him round the shoulders and
    thus to prevent murder from being done.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon had not failed to notice Laurence&rsquo;s unreasoning rage, nor
    the gesture which for one instant had threatened his own life, but he showed
    not the slightest sign of fear. The sarcastic laugh did not wholly die down
    on his lips, nor did the look of contempt fade out of his eyes. He looked
    on&mdash;quite unmoved&mdash;whilst Mark succeeded, if not in pacifying his
    brother, at least in forcing him back to his seat and regaining some semblance
    of control over himself. The High-Bailiff, white as a sheet, was holding
    out his hands in a pathetic and futile appeal to his son and to the Spaniard.
    Then as Laurence overcome with the shame of his own impotence threw himself
    half across the table and buried his face in his hands, don Ramon said coldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your senseless rage has done you no good, my friend. After half a
    century, you Netherlanders have, it seems, yet to learn that it is not wise
    to threaten a Spanish gentleman either by word or gesture. Perhaps I would
    have protected the two females in the tavern yonder from the brutality of
    my soldiery&mdash;perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know! But
    now, since you chose to raise an insolent hand against me I certainly will
    not raise a finger to save them from any outrage&mdash;I&rsquo;ll even countenance
    my men&rsquo;s behaviour by my presence in the tavern. Understand? That is
    what you have gained by your impudence&mdash;both you and your brother&mdash;for
    with him too I have a score to settle for impudence that literally passes
    belief. If your father were not so well-accredited as a good Catholic and
    a loyal subject of the King, I would ... But enough of this. Let the lesson
    be a fruitful one: and you Messire High-Bailiff&mdash;an you are wise&mdash;will
    inculcate into your sons a clearer notion of respect, duty and obedience
    toward their superiors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded curtly to the High-Bailiff, took no further notice of Mark and
    Laurence, but turned on his heel and went out of the room slamming the door
    behind him.</p>
  <p>After he had gone, the three men remained silent for a while: the High-Bailiff
    feeling deeply resentful against his son, would not trust himself to speak.
    Mark was leaning against the window sill and staring moodily out into the
    darkness. Laurence still held his head buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>The Spaniard&rsquo;s loud voice was heard giving orders to Pierre, then
    there came the sound of bolts being pushed back, of the heavy oaken door
    groaning on its hinges, then the reclosing of the door and Pierre&rsquo;s
    shuffling footsteps crossing the hall.</p>
  <p>Laurence rose and passed the back of his hand once or twice across his eyes: &ldquo;And
    to think,&rdquo; he murmured dully, &ldquo;that brutes such as that are allowed
    to live. Has God turned the light of His countenance quite away from us?&rdquo; He
    remained standing for a while gazing out blankly before him, and with trembling
    fingers he traced intricate patterns upon the table-top. Then with a heavy
    sigh he bade father and brother &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; and quietly went
    out of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark!&rdquo; said the High-Bailiff quickly, &ldquo;keep an eye on
    that hot-headed young ruffian. In his present state of mind there&rsquo;s
    no knowing what he might do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon Mark, in his usual good-tempered, indolent way also bade his father
    good-night, and followed his brother out of the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The scene which met don Ramon&rsquo;s eyes when he entered the tavern of
    the &ldquo;Three Weavers&rdquo;&mdash;which was situate, be it remembered,
    almost opposite the house of the High-Bailiff of Ghent&mdash;was, alas! not
    an unusual one these days.</p>
  <p>For five years now&mdash;ever since the arrival of the Duke of Alva in the
    Low Countries as Lieutenant-Governor and Captain-General of the Forces&mdash;the
    Netherlander had protested with all the strength and the insistence at their
    command against the quartering of Spanish troops upon the inhabitants of
    their free cities. The practice was a flagrant violation of all the promises
    made to them by the King himself, and an outrage against their charters and
    liberties which the King had sworn to respect. But it also was a form of
    petty tyranny which commended itself specially to Alva, and to the Spanish
    ministers and councillors of State who liked above all to humiliate these
    Dutch and Flemish free men and cow them into complete submission and silent
    acquiescence by every means which their cruel and tortuous minds could invent.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon knew quite well that he could offer no greater insult to the High-Bailiff
    of Ghent and to his sons&mdash;or, for the matter of that, to the whole city&mdash;than
    to allow his soldiery to behave in a scandalous and ribald manner in one
    of the well-accredited and well-conducted taverns of the town. And to him
    this knowledge gave but additional zest to what otherwise would have been
    a tame adventure&mdash;two women to bully and eight men to do it was not
    nearly as exciting as he could wish. But that fool Laurence van Rycke had
    to be punished&mdash;and incidentally don Ramon hoped that Mark would feel
    that the punishment was meted out to him more than to his brother.</p>
  <p>On the whole don Ramon de Linea felt, as he entered the tap-room of the &ldquo;Three
    Weavers,&rdquo; that the presence of the two van Ryckes was all that he needed
    to make his enjoyment complete.</p>
  <p>That the Spanish provost and the six men under his command were already
    drunk there was no doubt: some of them were sitting at a long trestle table,
    sprawling across it, lolling up against one another, some singing scraps
    of bibulous songs, others throwing coarse, obscene jests across the table.
    Two men seemed to be on guard at the door, whilst one and all were clamouring
    for more wine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse you, you...&rdquo; the provost was shouting at the top of his
    voice when don Ramon entered the tap-room, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you bring
    another bottle of wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two women were standing at the further end of the long low room, close to
    the hearth: they stood hand in hand as if in an endeavour to inculcate moral
    strength to one another. The eldest of the two women might have been twenty-five
    years of age, the other some few years younger: their white faces and round,
    dilated eyes showed the deathly fear which held them both in its grip. Obviously
    the girls would have fled out of the tap-room long before this, and equally
    obviously the two men had been posted at the door in order to cut off their
    retreat.</p>
  <p>At sight of their captain, the men staggered to their feet; the provost
    passed the word of command, fearful lest the ribald attitude of his men brought
    severe censure&mdash;and worse&mdash;upon himself. He stood up, as steadily,
    as uprightly as he could; but don Ramon took little notice of him; he called
    peremptorily to the two girls&mdash;who more frightened than ever now, still
    clung desperately to one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, wench!&rdquo; he said roughly, &ldquo;I want wine, the best
    you have, and a private room in which to sit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; murmured the elder of the two
    girls almost inaudibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Katrine, so please your Magnificence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete, at your service, Magnificence,&rdquo; whispered the girls
    one after the other, clinging one to the other, like two miserable atoms
    of humanity tossed about by the hard hand of Fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At my service then, and quickly too,&rdquo; retorted don Ramon curtly, &ldquo;go
    down into the cellar, Katrine, and get me a fresh bottle of Rhine wine&mdash;the
    best your heretical father hath left behind. And you, Grete, show me to another
    room, and when presently I order you to kiss me, see that you do not do it
    with such a sour mouth, or by Our Lady I&rsquo;ll remember that your father
    must hang on the morrow, and that you are nothing better than a pair of heretics
    too. Now then,&rdquo; he added harshly, &ldquo;must I repeat the order?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had undone the buckle of his sword-belt, and was carrying his sheathed
    sword in his hand: he found it a splendid weapon for striking further terror
    into the hearts of the two girls, whose shrieks of pain and fear caused great
    hilarity amongst the soldiers. Don Ramon felt that if only Mark van Rycke
    could have been there, all the wounds which that young malapert had dared
    to inflict upon the pride of a Spanish grandee would forthwith be healed.
    Indeed, don Ramon enjoyed every incident of this exhilarating spectacle;
    for instance, when buxom Katrine had at last toddled down the steps into
    the cellar, the soldiers closed the trap-door upon her; whereupon the provost,
    who had become very hilarious, shouted lustily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What ho! what are you louts doing there? His Magnificence will be
    wanting the wine which he has ordered. If you lock the cellarer into her
    cellar, she&rsquo;ll come out presently as drunk as a Spanish lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, provost,&rdquo; retorted one of the men, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
    let her out presently. His Magnificence won&rsquo;t have to wait for long.
    But we can levy a toll on her&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;whenever the
    wench is ready to come out of prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I understand!&rdquo; quoth the provost with a laugh.</p>
  <p>And don Ramon laughed too. He was enjoying himself even more than he had
    hoped. He saw the other girl&mdash;Grete&mdash;turn almost grey with terror,
    and he felt that he was punishing Mark van Rycke for every insolent word
    which he had uttered at the Town Hall and Laurence for every threatening
    gesture. He gave Grete a sharp prodding with the hilt of his sword:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, you Flemish slut,&rdquo; he said harshly, &ldquo;show me
    to your best parlour, and don&rsquo;t stand there gaping.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perforce she had to show him the way out of the public <i>tapperij</i> to
    the private room reserved for noble guests.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send one of your men to fetch the wench away in about half an hour,
    provost,&rdquo; called don Ramon loudly over his shoulder, &ldquo;I shall
    have got tired of her by then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Loud laughter greeted this sally and a general clapping of mugs against
    the table. Grete more dead than alive nearly fell over the threshold.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The private room was on the opposite side of the narrow tiled hall and was
    dimly lighted by a small iron lamp that hung from a beam of the ceiling above.
    The door was half open and Grete pushed it open still further and then stood
    aside to allow the se&ntilde;or captain to pass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will your Magnificence be pleased to walk in,&rdquo;  she whispered.</p>
  <p>Great tears were in her eyes; don Ramon paused under the lintel of the door,
    and with a rough gesture pinched her cheek and ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not ugly for a Flemish heifer,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;Come
    along, girl! Let&rsquo;s see if your heretical father hath taught you how
    to pay due respect to your superiors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My humblest respect I do offer your Magnificence,&rdquo;  said Grete,
    who was bravely trying to suppress her tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come! that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he retorted, as he pushed the girl
    into the room and swaggered in behind her, closing the door after him.  &ldquo;Now,
    Grete,&rdquo; he added, as he threw himself into a chair and stretched his
    legs out before him, &ldquo;come and sit on my knee, and if I like the way
    you kiss me, why, my girl, there&rsquo;s no knowing what I might not do to
    please you. Come here, Grete!&rdquo; he reiterated more peremptorily, for
    the girl had retreated to a dark corner of the room and was cowering there
    just like a frightened dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come here, Grete,&rdquo; he called loudly for the third time. But
    Grete was much too frightened to move.</p>
  <p>With a savage oath don Ramon jumped to his feet, and kicked the chair on
    which he had been sitting so that it flew with a loud clatter half way across
    the room. Grete fell on her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord deliver me!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon seized her by her two hands that were clasped together in prayer,
    he dragged her up from her knees, and toward the table which stood in the
    centre of the small, square room. Then he let her fall backwards against
    the table, and laughed because she continued to pray to God to help her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As if God would take any notice of heretics and rebels and Netherlanders
    generally,&rdquo; he said with a sneer. &ldquo;Stand up, girl, and go back
    to my men. I have had enough of you already. Ye gods! what a vile crowd these
    Netherlanders are! Go back into the tap-room, do you hear, girl? and see
    that you and your ugly sister entertain my men as you should. For if you
    don&rsquo;t, and I hear of any psalm-singing or simpering nonsense I&rsquo;ll
    hand you over to the Inquisition as avowed heretics to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But truly Grete was by now almost paralysed with fear; she was no brave
    heroine of romance who could stand up before a tyrant and browbeat him by
    the very force of her character and personality, she was but a mere wreckage
    of humanity whom any rough hand could send hopelessly adrift upon the sea
    of life. Her one refuge was her tears, her only armour of defence her own
    utter helplessness.</p>
  <p>But this helplessness which would appeal to the most elementary sense of
    chivalry, had not the power to stir a single kind instinct in don Ramon de
    Linea. It must be admitted that it would not have appealed to a single Spaniard
    these days. They were all bred in the one school which taught them from infancy
    an utter contempt for this subject race and a deadly hatred against the heretics
    and rebels of the Low Countries. They were taught to look upon these people
    as little better than cattle, without any truth, honesty or loyalty in them,
    as being false and treacherous, murderous and dishonest. Don Ramon, who at
    this moment was behaving as scurrilously as any man, not absolutely born
    in the gutter, could possibly do, was only following the traditions of his
    race, of his country and its tyrannical government.</p>
  <p>Therefore when Grete wept he laughed, when she murmured the little prayers
    which her father had taught her, he felt nothing but irritation and unmeasured
    contempt. He tried to silence the girl by loud shouts and peremptory commands,
    when these were of no avail he threatened, to call for assistance from his
    sergeant. Still the girl made no attempt either to move or to stem the flood
    of tears. Then don Ramon called aloud: &ldquo;Hallo there, sergeant!&rdquo; and
    receiving no answer, he went to the door, in order to reiterate his call
    from there.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>His hand was on the latch, when the door was suddenly opened from without;
    so violently that don Ramon was nearly thrown off his balance, and would
    probably have measured his length on the floor, but that he fell up against
    the table and remained there, leaning against it with one hand in order to
    steady himself, and turning a wrathful glance on the intruder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Mass!&rdquo; he said peremptorily, &ldquo;who is this malapert
    who...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the words died on his lips; the look of wrath in his eyes gave way to
    one of sudden terror. He stared straight out before him at the sombre figure
    which had just crossed the threshold. It was the tall figure of a man dressed
    in dark tightly-fitting clothes, wearing high boots to the top of his thighs,
    a hood over his head and a mask of untanned leather on his face. He was unarmed.</p>
  <p>Don Ramon, already a prey to that superstitious fear of the unknown and
    of the mysterious which characterised even the boldest of his country and
    of his race, felt all his arrogance giving way in the presence of this extraordinary
    apparition, which by the dim and flickering light of the lamp appeared to
    him to be preternaturally tall and strangely menacing in its grim attitude
    of silence. Thus a moment or two went by. The stranger now turned and carefully
    closed and locked the door behind him. Key in hand he went up to the girl&mdash;Grete&mdash;who,
    no less terrified than her tormentor, was cowering in a corner of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Katrine,&rdquo; he asked quickly; then, as the girl almost
    paralysed by fear seemed quite unable to speak, he added more peremptorily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together, wench; your life and Katrine&rsquo;s depend
    on your courage now. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In ... in ... the cellar ... I think,&rdquo; stammered Grete almost
    inaudibly and making a brave effort to conquer her terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you reach her without crossing the tap-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, run to her at once. Don&rsquo;t stop to collect any of
    your belongings, except what money you have; then go ... go at once.... Have
    you a friend or relative in this city to whom you could go at this late hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the girl nodded, and looked up more boldly this time: &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
    sister...&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the sign of the &lsquo;Merry Beggars&rsquo; in Dendermonde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go to her at once&mdash;you and Katrine. You will be safe there
    for awhile. If any further danger threatens you or your kinsfolk, you shall
    be advised ... in that case you would have to leave the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; murmured the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Come, Grete!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned back to the door, unlocked it, and let the girl slip out of the
    room. Then he relocked the door.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>While this brief colloquy had been going on, don Ramon was making great
    efforts to recover his scattered wits and to steady his overstrung nerves.
    The superstitious fear which had gripped him by the throat, yielded at first
    to another equally terrifying thought: the hood and mask suggested an emissary
    of the Inquisition, one of those silent, nameless beings who seemed to have
    the power of omnipresence, who glided through closed doors and barred windows,
    appeared suddenly in tavern, church or street corner, and were invariably
    the precursors of arrest, torture-chamber and death. No man or woman&mdash;however
    high-born, however highly placed, however influential or however poor and
    humble, was immune from the watchful eye of the Inquisition; a thoughtless
    word, a careless jest&mdash;or the mere denunciation of an enemy&mdash;and
    the accusation of treason, heresy or rebellion was trumped up and gibbet
    or fire claimed yet another victim. Don Ramon&mdash;a Spanish grandee&mdash;could
    not of course be denounced as a heretic, but he knew that the eyes of de
    Vargas were upon him, that he might he thought importune or in the way now
    that other projects had been formed for donna Lenora&mdash;and he also knew
    that de Vargas would as ruthlessly sweep him out of the way as he would a
    troublesome fly.</p>
  <p>Thus fear of real, concrete danger had succeeded that of the supernatural;
    but now that the stranger moved and spoke kindly with Grete&mdash;the daughter
    of an heretic&mdash;it was evident that he was no spy of the Inquisition:
    he was either an avowed enemy who chose this theatrical manner of accomplishing
    a petty vengeance, or in actual fact that extraordinary creature who professed
    to be the special protector of the Prince of Orange and whom popular superstition
    among the soldiery had nicknamed Leatherface.</p>
  <p>The latter was by far the most likely, and as the stranger whoever he was,
    was unarmed, don Ramon felt that he had no longer any cause for fear. Though
    his sword&mdash;in its scabbard&mdash;was lying on the table, his dagger
    was in his belt. With a quick movement he unsheathed it, and at the precise
    moment when the masked man had his back to him in order to relock the door,
    don Ramon&mdash;dagger in hand&mdash;made a swift and sudden dash for him.
    But the stranger had felt rather than seen or heard the danger which threatened
    him. As quick as any feline creature he turned on his assailant and gripped
    his upraised hand by the wrist with such a vice-like grip that don Ramon
    uttered a cry of rage and pain: his fingers opened out nervelessly and the
    dagger fell with a clatter to the ground.</p>
  <p>Then the two men closed with one another. It was a fight, each for the other&rsquo;s
    throat&mdash;a savage, primitive fight&mdash;man against man&mdash;with no
    weapon save sinewy hands, hatred and the primeval instinct to kill. The masked
    man was by far the more powerful and the more cool. Within a very few moments
    he had don Ramon down on his knees, his own strong hands gripping the other&rsquo;s
    throat. The Spaniard felt that he was doomed: he&mdash;of that race which
    was sending thousands of innocent and defenceless creatures to a hideous
    death&mdash;he, who had so often and so mercilessly lent a hand to outrage,
    to pillage and to murder, who but a few moments ago was condemning two helpless
    girls to insults and outrage worse than death, was in his turn a defenceless
    atom in the hands of a justiciary. The breath was being squeezed out of his
    body, his limbs felt inert and stiff, his mind became clouded over as by
    a crimson mist. He tried to call for help, but the cry died in his throat.
    And through the mist which gradually obscured his vision he could still see
    the silhouette of that closely-hooded head and a pair of eyes shining down
    on him through the holes of the leather mask.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go, miscreant,&rdquo; he gasped as for one moment the grip
    on his throat seemed to relax. &ldquo;By heaven you shall suffer for this
    outrage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you will suffer,&rdquo; said the other coldly, &ldquo;even
    as you would have made two helpless and innocent women suffer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They shall suffer yet!&rdquo; cried don Ramon with a blasphemous
    oath, &ldquo;they and their kith and kin&mdash;aye! and this accursed city
    which hath given <i>you</i> shelter! Assassin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it is because you are such an abominable cur,&rdquo;  came a
    voice relentlessly from behind the leather mask, &ldquo;because you would
    hunt two unfortunates down, them and their kith and kin and the city that
    gave them shelter, that you are too vile to live, and that I mean to kill
    you, like I would any pestilential beast that befouled God&rsquo;s earth.
    So make your peace with your Creator now, for you are about to meet Him face
    to face laden with the heavy burden of your infamies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In don Ramon now only one instinct remained paramount&mdash;the instinct
    of a final effort for self-defence. When he fell, his knee came in contact
    with the dagger which he had dropped. It cost him a terrible effort, but
    nevertheless he succeeded in groping for it with his right hand and in seizing
    it: another moment of violent struggle for freedom, another convulsive movement
    and he had lifted the dagger. He struck with ferocious vigour at his powerful
    opponent and inflicted a gashing wound upon his left arm&mdash;the dagger
    penetrated to the bone, cutting flesh and muscle through from wrist to elbow.</p>
  <p>But even as he struck he knew that it was too late; he had not even the
    strength to renew the effort. The next moment the vice-like grip tightened
    round his throat with merciless power. He could neither cry for help nor
    yet for mercy, nor were his struggles heard beyond these four narrow walls.</p>
  <p>The soldiers whom he himself had bidden to be merry and to carouse, were
    singing and shouting at the top of their voice, and heard neither his struggles
    nor his cries. The dagger had long since slipped out of his hand, and at
    last he fell backwards striking his head against the leg of the table as
    he fell.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>In the tap-room the soldiers had soon got tired of waiting for Katrine.
    At first some of them amused themselves by reopening the trap-door, then
    sitting on the top step of the ladder that led to the cellar and thence shouting
    ribald oaths, coarse jests and blasphemies for the benefit of the unfortunate
    girl down below.</p>
  <p>But after a time this entertainment also palled, and a council was held
    as to who should go down and fetch the girl. The cellar was vastly tempting
    in itself&mdash;with no one to guard it save a couple of wenches&mdash;and
    the captain more than half-inclined to be lenient toward a real bout of drunkenness.
    It was an opportunity not to be missed; strange that the idea had not occurred
    to seven thirsty men before.</p>
  <p>Now the provost declared that he would go down first, others could follow
    him in turn, but two must always remain in the tap-room in case the captain
    called, their comrades would supply them with wine from below. The provost
    descended&mdash;candle in hand&mdash;so did four of the men, but Katrine
    was no longer in the cellar. They hunted for her for awhile, and discovered
    a window, the shaft of which sloped upwards to a yard at the back of the
    house. The window was open and there was a ladder resting against the wall
    of the shaft.</p>
  <p>The men swore a little, then went back to investigate the casks of wine.
    With what happened in the cellar after that this chronicle hath no concern,
    but those soldiers who remained up in the tap-room had a curious experience
    which their fuddled brains did not at first take in altogether. What happened
    was this: the door which gave on the passage was opened, and a man appeared
    under the lintel. He was dressed in sombre, tight-fitting doublet and hose,
    with high boots reaching well above his knees; he had a hood over his head
    and a mask on his face. The soldiers stared at him with wide-open, somewhat
    dimmed eyes.</p>
  <p>The masked man only spoke a few words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell your provost,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that se&ntilde;or captain
    don Ramon de Linea lies dead in the room yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he disappeared, as quietly as he had come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    Vengeance</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Satan! Satan! Assassin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Donna Lenora had stood beside the dead body of her lover and kinsman wide-eyed
    and pale with rigid, set mouth and trembling knees while her father explained
    to her how don Ramon de Linea had been murdered in the tavern of the &ldquo;Three
    Weavers&rdquo; by an unknown man who wore a leather mask. She had listened
    to the whole garbled version of the sordid affair, never thinking to doubt
    a single one of her father&rsquo;s words: don Ramon de Linea, according to
    the account given to his daughter by Juan de Vargas, had&mdash;while in the
    execution of his duty&mdash;been attacked in a dark passage by a mysterious
    assassin, who had fled directly his nefarious work had been accomplished.</p>
  <p>The murderer, however, was seen by the provost in command and by two of
    the soldiers, and was accurately described by them as wearing doublet and
    high-boots of a dark-brown colour, a hood over his head and a mask of untanned
    leather on his face. The man had rapidly disappeared in the darkness, evading
    all pursuit.</p>
  <p>And donna Lenora&mdash;thus face to face for the first time in her sheltered
    life with crime, with horror and with grief&mdash;had, in the first moment
    of despairing misery, not even a prayer to God in her heart, for it was filled
    with bitter thoughts of resentment and of possible revenge.</p>
  <p>She had loved her cousin don Ramon de Linea with all the ardour of her youth,
    of her warm temperament and of a heart thirsting for the self-sacrifice which
    women were so ready to offer these days on the altar of their Love. She had
    never thought him shallow or cruel: to her he had always been just the playmate
    of childhood&rsquo;s days, the handsome, masterful boy whom she had looked
    up to as the embodiment of all that was strong and noble and chivalrous,
    the first man who had ever whispered the magic word &ldquo;love&rdquo; in
    her ear.</p>
  <p>Now an unknown enemy had killed him: not in fair fight, not in the open,
    on the field of honour, but&mdash;as her father said&mdash;in a tavern, in
    the dark, surreptitiously, treacherously; and donna Lenora in an agony of
    passionate resentment had at last broken the silence which had almost frightened
    her father and had suddenly called out with fierce intensity: &ldquo;Satan!
    Satan! Assassin!&rdquo; Her father had given her an account of the horrible
    incident, which was nothing but a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to
    end, and Lenora had listened and believed. How could she doubt her own father?
    She hardly knew him&mdash;and he was all she had in the world on whom to
    pour out the wealth of her affection and of her faith.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Truth to tell, de Vargas had received the news of don Ramon&rsquo;s death
    with unbounded satisfaction.</p>
  <p>Lenora had obeyed him and had been this night publicly affianced to Mark
    van Rycke; but between her consent to the marriage and her willingness to
    become Alva&rsquo;s tool as a spy among her husband&rsquo;s people there
    was the immeasurable abyss of a woman&rsquo;s temperament and a woman&rsquo;s
    natural pity for the oppressed.</p>
  <p>But the outrage to-night&mdash;the murder of the man whom she still loved
    despite paternal prohibitions&mdash;was bound to react on the girl&rsquo;s
    warm and passionate nature&mdash;and react in the manner which her father
    desired. He trusted to his own powers of lying, to place the case before
    his daughter in its most lurid light. He had at once spoken of &ldquo;spies&rdquo; and &ldquo;assassins&rdquo;  and
    his words had been well chosen. Within a few moments after he had told Lenora
    the news, he felt that he could play like a skilled musician upon every string
    of her overwrought sensibilities. Her heart had already been very sore at
    being forced to part from her first lover; now that the parting had suddenly
    become irrevocable in this horrible way, all the pent up passion, fierce
    resentment and wrath which she had felt against her future husband and his
    people could by clever manipulation be easily merged into an equally fierce
    desire for revenge.</p>
  <p>It was a cruel game to play with a young girl who by blood and race was
    made to feel every emotion with super-acuteness: but de Vargas was not the
    man who would ever allow pity or chivalry to interfere with his schemes:
    he saw in his daughter&rsquo;s mental suffering, in the shattering of her
    nerves and the horror which had well-nigh paralysed her, nothing but a guarantee
    of success for that comprehensive project which had the death of the Prince
    of Orange for its ultimate aim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; murmured the girl after awhile, &ldquo;that
    when Ramon talked with me in the Town House last night, he said that these
    Netherlanders had a habit of striking at an enemy in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A presentiment, no doubt,&rdquo; rejoined de Vargas with well-feigned
    gentleness. &ldquo;Now, my child, you begin to understand&mdash;do you not?&mdash;why
    it is that we Spaniards hate these treacherous Netherlanders. They are vile
    and corrupt to the heart, every single man, woman or child of them. They
    fear us and have not the pluck to fight us in the open. Orange and his contemptible
    little army have sought shelter in Holland&mdash;they dare not face the valour
    and enthusiasm of our troops. But mark you, what Orange hath done! He hath
    sown the entire country with a crop of spies! They are here, there, everywhere&mdash;not
    very cunning and certainly not brave&mdash;their orders are to strike in
    the dark when and how they can. They waylay our Spanish officers in the ill-lighted,
    and intricate streets of their abominable cities, they dog their footsteps
    until they meet them in some lowly tavern or a tenebrous archway: then out
    comes their dagger, swift and sure, and they strike in the gloom&mdash;and
    a gallant Spanish officer&rsquo;s blood stains the cobblestones of one of
    their towns. It was don Ramon to-day&mdash;it will be Julian Romero perhaps
    to-morrow&mdash;or don Juan de Vargas&mdash;who knows? or mayhap the duke
    of Alva one day. Orange and his crowd are out on a campaign of assassination&mdash;an
    army of assassins has been let loose&mdash;and their captain-general wears
    a mask of leather and our soldiery have dubbed him &lsquo;Leatherface&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have heard of this man &lsquo;Leatherface,&rsquo;&ldquo; said Lenora
    slowly. &ldquo;It is he, you think, who murdered Ramon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have we not the soldiers&rsquo; testimony?&rdquo; he rejoined blandly, &ldquo;two
    men and the provost saw him quite clearly. As for me, I am not surprised:
    more than once our spies have reported that the man undoubtedly hailed from
    Ghent, and once he was traced to the very gates of this city. But,&rdquo;  he
    added insinuatingly, &ldquo;here he is surrounded by friends: every burgher
    in Ghent, no doubt, opens wide his hospitable door to the murderer of Spanish
    officers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think you it is likely that the High-Bailiff of Ghent or ... or ...
    my future husband would harbour such an assassin?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he replied evasively, &ldquo;all Netherlanders are treacherous.
    The High-Bailiff himself and his son Mark are said to be loyal ... but there&rsquo;s
    another son ... and the mother ... one never knows. It would be strange,&rdquo; he
    continued unctuously, &ldquo;if at some future time the murderer of Ramon
    should find shelter in your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall pray to the saints,&rdquo; she rejoined with passionate intensity, &ldquo;that
    he and I may meet face to face one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed de Vargas had no cause to fear that henceforth his daughter would
    fail in her vigilance. The assassination of her lover had stirred her soul
    to its inmost depths. Indifference and light-hearted girlishness had suddenly
    given place to all the violent passions of her ardent nature. For the moment
    desire for vengeance&mdash;for justice she called it&mdash;and hatred of
    the assassin and his mates had swept every other thought, every soft aspiration
    away: all her world&mdash;the world as seen through the rose-coloured windows
    of a convent window&mdash;had tottered and opened beneath her feet, and through
    the yawning chasm she now saw evil and lust and cruelty dancing a triumphant
    saraband over Ramon&rsquo;s dead body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a means,&rdquo; resumed de Vargas after a slight pause,
    during which through half-closed lids he studied the play of every varying
    emotion upon his daughter&rsquo;s beautiful face, &ldquo;there is a means,
    my child, whereby you or any faithful servant of our King can henceforth
    recognise at a glance the man who killed your cousin Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He carries upon his arm the brand of his own infamy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you tell me more clearly what you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ramon had not breathed his last when the provost found him and ultimately
    brought him here to my lodgings. He was able to speak and to give a fragmentary
    account of what had taken place: how he was set upon in the dark and stabbed
    to death ere he could utter a cry. But at the last moment he made a supreme
    effort and wrenching his dagger from his belt he struck with it at his assailant.
    It seems that he inflicted a very severe wound upon the miscreant: the dagger
    penetrated into the left forearm close to the elbow and gashed the flesh
    and muscle as far as the wrist and right through to the bone. It is not likely
    that at this moment there is more than one man in Ghent who hath such a wound
    in the left forearm: the wound was deep too, and will take some time to heal,
    and even when it is healed it will leave a tell-tale scar which will last
    for years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; rejoined Lenora coldly, &ldquo;that I should know
    the man who killed Ramon, even if he bore no brand of Cain upon his person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Father and daughter looked at one another and for the space of a few seconds
    their souls&mdash;so different in every ideal, every feeling, every aspiration&mdash;met
    in one common resolve. He could hardly repress a sigh of satisfaction. He
    knew that he held her, closely, firmly, indissolubly at last. He held her
    by all the romance which her girlish imagination had woven round the personality
    of a worthless man, and by all the deep sense of injury which she felt as
    well as all the horror and the indignation at the dastardly deed. And his
    own warped and gloomy soul was at one with her pure and childlike one&mdash;pure
    because even the desire for revenge which she felt, she ascribed to God,
    and called it justice. The Moorish blood in her which mingles even with the
    bluest Castilian claimed with savage, primeval instinct that &ldquo;eye for
    an eye&rdquo;  and &ldquo;tooth for a tooth&rdquo; which alone can satisfy
    a hot-headed and passionate race.</p>
  <p>Lenora&rsquo;s eyes as she met those of her father lost their look of dull
    despair: something of the fanatical hatred which he felt for the whole of
    the despised race communicated itself to her, now that she too had so much
    cause for hatred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We understand one another, Lenora,&rdquo; he said. And like a feline
    creature sure of its prey, he drew quite close to her and took her hand,
    and began gently to stroke it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to teach me what to do, father,&rdquo;  she rejoined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your heart and wits will tell you that. In a few days you will have
    entered the van Rycke household. Keep your eyes and ears open, and win the
    confidence and love of all those around you. Let not a word, a sign, a gesture
    escape you, and come and tell me at once all that you see and hear. Will
    you promise to do that, my Lenora?&rdquo; he added, forcing his harsh voice
    to tones of gentleness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she replied fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Lieutenant-Governor believes that Orange himself has been visiting
    Ghent lately! Keep your eyes and ears open, Lenora, you may be the means
    of bringing that arch-traitor to his just punishment. Promise me that you
    will listen,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; she reiterated firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Lieutenant-Governor comes to Ghent in a few days&rsquo; time.
    Wherever he goes there is always fear for his precious life. If Orange has
    been in Ghent then he hath hatched a plot against the Duke&mdash;on this
    I would stake my life&mdash;promise me that you will be on the watch, Lenora!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon your soul, my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon my soul!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And next to Orange himself, I&rsquo;d sooner see that masked assassin
    Leatherface hang than any man in Europe; remember that, little one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The outrage on don Ramon de Linea must not remain unavenged, remember
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then let Orange and his rebels look to themselves!&rdquo; ejaculated
    de Vargas with a note of triumph.</p>
  <p>He took from the breast pocket of his doublet a piece of silk ribbon to
    which was attached a flat, yet curiously fashioned and shaped piece of steel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take this, my child,&rdquo; he said significantly, as he held the
    trinket out to her. &ldquo;This little bit of metal hath already done more
    service to our Lord the King, to our country, and to our faith than a whole
    army of spies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a little talisman,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that will turn
    any lock and open any secret drawer by whomsoever lock and drawer have been
    manufactured. It was made for me by the finest metal-cutter of Toledo&mdash;one
    in fact whose skill was so paramount that we had reluctantly to ... to put
    him out of harm&rsquo;s way. He was getting dangerous. This pass-key was
    his masterpiece. I have tested it on the most perfect specimens of the locksmith&rsquo;s
    art both in Toledo and in Florence. It hath never failed me yet. Take it,
    my child, and guard it carefully. An I mistake not, you will find use for
    it in your new home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before she could protest he had thrown the ribbon over her head, and she&mdash;mechanically
    but with unaccountable reluctance withal&mdash;slipped the trinket into the
    bosom of her gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, my dear,&rdquo; concluded de Vargas, &ldquo;that the day
    after your marriage I must return to Brussels. But if you see or hear anything
    that may concern the welfare of our Sovereign Lord the King, or of his government,
    you must come to me at once&mdash;do not hesitate&mdash;invent a pretext&mdash;come
    away in secret&mdash;do anything rather than delay. And remember also that
    anything you may tell me, I will treat in absolute confidence. Your name
    will never appear in connection with any denunciation ... I mean,&rdquo; he
    interrupted himself hastily, &ldquo;with any service which you may render
    to the State. Will you remember that also, my child?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will remember,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>It seemed almost as if she were under the potent spell of some wizard. She
    spoke and acted just as her father directed&mdash;and yet he looked so evil
    at this moment, hypocrisy and lust were so apparent in his jaundiced face,
    that even Lenora felt a sudden pang of doubt and of fear&mdash;doubt as to
    the purity of her own motives and fear at the terrible companionship which
    would henceforth exist between herself and her father&rsquo;s friends, men
    who&mdash;like him&mdash;were bent on the destruction of a nation and were
    actuated by blind hatred to oppress an entire people.</p>
  <p>De Vargas&mdash;vaguely guessing what went on in the girl&rsquo;s mind&mdash;made
    an effort to regain his former bland manner: he strove by gentleness and
    soft words to lull her suspicions. After all, he was her father and she&mdash;a
    motherless child&mdash;had no one now in the world to whom she could cling,
    on whom she could pour out that wealth of love and tenderness which filled
    her young heart to overflowing. So now&mdash;very soon&mdash;she was kneeling
    close beside him, her head resting against his bosom&mdash;the dove nestling
    near the hawk; and the tears which would not come all the while that her
    soul was consumed with bitterness, flowed beneficently at last and eased
    her overburdened heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will not fail me, little one?&rdquo; asked de Vargas even in
    the midst of tender, endearing words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;if you turned against me, father
    dear, whither could I go? I have no one in the world but you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As her head was bent and her eyes downcast, she could not see the cold and
    cruel glitter that shone in his face as he heard this simple profession of
    whole-hearted devotion and faith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me what to do and I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; she whispered again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will God Himself reward you,&rdquo; he rejoined unctuously, &ldquo;for
    you will be serving Him and His Church, His anointed and the country of His
    chosen people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which he rose, kissed her and finally with a sigh of intense satisfaction
    left her to meditate alone, to dream and to pray.</p>

    A Stranger In A Strange Land</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>A week later was the marriage solemnised between donna Lenora de Vargas
    and Mark van Rycke, son of the High-Bailiff of Ghent.</p>
  <p>The religious ceremony took place in the abbey church of St. Bavon in the
    presence of several members of the Grand Council and of all the high functionaries
    of the city. Nothing had been spared to make the occasion a magnificent and
    imposing one. The union between the two young people was known to have the
    warm approval of the King himself: His Holiness the Pope had sent a special
    blessing to the bride and bridegroom, whilst the Captain-General had granted
    the use of a number of picked troops to render the display more gorgeous.
    Seven hundred and fifty arquebusiers, spearmen and halberdiers lined the
    route of the bridal procession between the town-house and the church: they
    were dressed in the heraldic colours of the city of Ghent, one leg blue and
    the other yellow, and wore enormous hats with huge feathers dyed in the two
    colours.</p>
  <p>The Regent too had graciously lent his court musicians for the occasion
    and they headed the procession with full orchestra playing the newest motets.
    The church itself had been magnificently decorated with tapestries, and a
    huge concourse of people lined the streets in order to view all this pomp
    and magnificence.</p>
  <p>After the religious ceremony a grand banquet was held in the great hall
    of the Town House at which eighty-four privileged guests were bidden. It
    was served at separate tables each laid for a dozen guests, and consisted
    of twenty-five courses&mdash;which were both varied and succulent. There
    were fowls stewed in milk and dressed with sweetmeats and spices, there were
    pickled partridges and pastries, sausages and omelettes of every kind, whilst
    huge flagons of iced beer and Rhenish wines added to the conviviality of
    the entertainment.</p>
  <p>Se&ntilde;or de Vargas presided at the chief table, and he had the bride
    on his right and the bridegroom on his left. The High-Bailiff also sat at
    this table as did Madame his wife and Messire Laurence van Rycke, and every
    one remarked that se&ntilde;or de Vargas was in high good-humour and that
    he bestowed marked evidences of his favour both upon the High-Bailiff and
    upon the bridegroom.</p>
  <p>During the banquet the court musicians discoursed sweet music; in fact everything
    was done not only with decorum but with liberality: this was the first union
    between a noted and highly placed Spanish family and an equally distinguished
    patrician house of Flanders, and in a brief toast, tankard in hand, se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas expressed the hope that it might prove the precursor of a great
    many more.</p>
  <p>Those present at the feast remarked moreover that the bride was beautiful
    beyond powers of description, that the bridegroom looked as usual, as if
    he had been spending half his nights in the taverns, and that Messire Laurence
    van Rycke looked pale and sick.</p>
  <p>But nothing of any grave moment occurred during the length of this exciting
    and strenuous day. After the banquet the tables were cleared and many more
    guests arrived to take part in a grand reunion and ball which lasted well
    into the night. But neither the bride or bridegroom nor any of the grand
    Spanish seigniors stayed for that: a small procession was formed soon after
    the conclusion of the banquet, consisting of the parents of bride and bridegroom
    flanked by a guard of honour, which conducted the young couple from the Town
    House to the residence of the High-Bailiff, which was to remain their home
    until such time as a more fitting permanent abode could be provided for them.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>And now the escort had taken leave of the young people: don Juan de Vargas
    and the High-Bailiff had to return to their guests at the Town House and
    Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke had gone to rest. The arquebusiers had gone and
    the serving men and women&mdash;with the exception of Pierre and Jeanne&mdash;had
    gone to watch the illuminations and to listen to the strains of the orchestra
    which could be heard quite plainly through the open windows of the Town House.</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke had conducted the bride upstairs to the nuptial-chamber.
    With her own hands she had drawn a high-backed chair close to the fire and
    made the young girl sit down. Mark then placed a footstool to her feet and
    a down cushion to her back.</p>
  <p>Lenora accepted all these little attentions without a word, but with a grateful
    smile. She was far too tired to speak, and when Cl&eacute;mence finally kissed
    her on the forehead and whispered a motherly: &ldquo;God bless you, my child!&rdquo; she
    could hardly murmur a feeble &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; in reply.</p>
  <p>Then Madame van Rycke went away, and the house seemed suddenly to become
    very still. Lenora was still in her bridal gown, which was of stiff white
    brocade, with very high starched collar and hard stomacher that cramped her
    movements and made her sides ache. Her hair had been combed away from her
    forehead and only a few unruly curls lay moist against her brow: her delicate
    skin rebelled against the conventional white and pink unguents which the
    careful fingers of a highly-trained waiting woman had laid upon her cheeks
    and lips, and the dark lines of a black pencil round her lashes could not
    add lustre to her luminous dark eyes which, despite fatigue, shone with marvellous
    brilliancy.</p>
  <p>She sat with hands folded before her, staring into the fire, and the flames
    in wanton frolic threw a golden glow upon her face and her gown and deep
    blue shadows all around her. Mark van Rycke&mdash;unseen by her&mdash;stood
    at the other end of the monumental hearth, one arm resting against the ledge,
    his head against his hand, so that his face was completely in shadow and
    she could not know that he was watching her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are tired, Madonna?&rdquo; he asked after a little while, and
    she replied, pathetically, like a child about to cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very tired, Messire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has been a long and trying day for you,&rdquo; he continued lightly. &ldquo;I
    confess to being very tired myself, and as soon as Jeanne comes to wait on
    you, I would beg of you that I might take my leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she said nothing, but continued to stare into the fire in a listless
    manner, he added a little impatiently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jeanne will not be long; she attends upon my mother every night,
    but will be at your service directly. Can you put up with my company, Madonna,
    till she come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am at your service, Messire,&rdquo; she rejoined stiffly, &ldquo;if
    there is aught you wish to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How cold you are, sweetheart,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly. &ldquo;It
    would seem as if we were still in the presence of that awe-inspiring duenna
    of yours: what was her name?&mdash;I forget&mdash;but by the Mass! I tell
    you, sweet, that she froze the very marrow in my bones ... and you were so
    formal in her presence too&mdash;brrrr!&mdash;it makes me shiver to think
    of those half-hours spent during the past week in such a freezing atmosphere!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughed&mdash;a quaint little laugh&mdash;half merry and half shy, and
    after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, he drew a low chair forward and sat
    down in front of the fire, close to her. Even then she did not turn to look
    at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had it not been for your eyes, Madonna,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;I
    would have sworn that you were fashioned of marble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now he was leaning a little forward, his elbow resting on his knee, his
    hand shading his face from the light of the fire. He was studying her face
    closely, and thought that he had never seen any woman quite so beautiful. &ldquo;Laurence
    was a fool!&rdquo; he was saying to himself as he took in every detail of
    the perfect face, the delicate contour of the cheeks, the pearly whiteness
    of the skin, the exquisite line of chin and throat, and above all those dark,
    glowing, unfathomable eyes which betrayed all the latent fire and passion
    which coldness of demeanour strove vainly to conceal. &ldquo;Laurence was
    a fool! He would have fallen madly in love with this beautiful creature,
    and would have made her happy and contented with her lot, whilst the bonds
    of matrimony would have sat more lightly on him than on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sighed, feeling a little sorry for himself, but nevertheless he stretched
    out his hand and captured hers&mdash;an exquisitely fashioned little hand
    it was, delicate to the touch and pulsating with life, like a prisoned bird.
    Mark was a young man&mdash;and one who had already got out of life most of
    the joys which it holds, but just for a moment he felt a curious thrill of
    unaccustomed pleasure, in holding this perfect thing&mdash;donna Lenora&rsquo;s
    hand. His own hands were strong, yet slender, finely shaped and warm to the
    touch, but it must be supposed that as he held hers, he must&mdash;quite
    unconsciously&mdash;have hurt her, for suddenly he saw that she turned even
    whiter than she had been before, her eyes closed and quite abruptly she withdrew
    her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do I anger you, Madonna?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Messire,&rdquo; she replied coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I not then hold your hand&mdash;for a very little while in mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she did not voluntarily put her hand out to him, and he made no second
    attempt to capture it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We do not seem to be getting along very fast,&rdquo; he said quaintly.</p>
  <p>She smiled. &ldquo;Seeing how we came to be together, Messire,&rdquo; she
    said, &ldquo;we were not like to have much in common.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet, we shall have to pass our lives together, Madonna.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I own that the prospect cannot be very alluring for you&mdash;it
    doth not seem to suggest an interminable vista of happiness....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured as if involuntarily, &ldquo;I was not thinking
    of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; he retorted gently, &ldquo;now, whenever I look
    at you, Madonna, I invariably think of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happiness? With me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With you, sweetheart, if you will but allow me to work for that object.
    After all, my dear,&rdquo; he added with that whimsical smile of his, &ldquo;we
    are both young, you and I; life lies all before us. I own that we have made
    a sorry beginning, that the first chapter of our book of life hath been ill-writ
    and by clumsy hands. But suppose we turn over a few pages, do you not think
    that we might happen on a more romantic passage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew nearer still to her, so near that as he bent toward her his knee
    touched the ground and his arm instinctively stretched out behind her, so
    that at the least movement on her part it would close around her and hold
    her&mdash;as indeed he longed that it should do. She was so very beautiful,
    and that air of settled melancholy, of childlike helplessness and pathos
    in her made an irresistible appeal to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;an you would let me, I should
    like to make love to you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she, with a quick, impatient jerk suddenly sat bolt upright and freed
    herself almost roughly from that arm which was nearly encircling her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love!&rdquo; she said with cold sarcasm. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bit his lip and in his turn drew back: the dour look in his face became
    more marked and the merry twinkle died out of his eyes: his knee no longer
    touched the ground, but he remained quite self-possessed and said, still
    quite good-humouredly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;your husband as it happens, Madonna. Would love from
    me be so very distasteful to you then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no love for you, Messire, as you well know,&rdquo; she said
    coldly. &ldquo;I told you what my feelings were toward yon, the first time
    that we met&mdash;at the Town House, the night of our betrothal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he owned, &ldquo;you spoke very plainly then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And since then I have had no cause to change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am as distasteful to you as I ever was?&rdquo; he asked with droll
    consternation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;not distasteful, Messire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come! that&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough, methinks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not by a long way, but it is a beginning. To-day I am not altogether
    distasteful&mdash;to-morrow I might e&rsquo;en be tolerated ... in a week
    toleration might turn to liking ... and after that, liking to...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she broke in firmly, &ldquo;I should have to forget
    that which is indelibly writ upon my memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you married me without love and without wooing&mdash;bought
    me like a bundle of goods just because my father is powerful and yours ambitious.
    A week ago we were betrothed, Messire. Since then how hath your time been
    passed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In wild, ecstatic half-hours spent in the presence of your duenna
    and sitting opposite to the chilliest bride in Christendom,&rdquo; he said
    whimsically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the rest of the time in the taverns of Ghent,&rdquo;  she retorted
    hotly, &ldquo;and places of ill-repute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your reputation is well known: how could it fail to reach mine
    ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evil tongues always make themselves heard, Madonna,&rdquo; he said,
    still speaking very quietly, although now he sat quite apart from her, with
    his long legs stretched out before him and his hands clasped between his
    knees. &ldquo;I would you had not listened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would I had not heard,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;for then I should
    not have added one more humiliation to all those which I have had to endure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I another regret,&rdquo; he said with a short sigh.  &ldquo;But
    even if evil tongues spoke true, Madonna,&rdquo; he continued more lightly, &ldquo;the
    shame of my conduct would sit on me and not on you. They call me a ne&rsquo;er-do-well
    in the city&mdash;and have it seems done so in your hearing! Well! let me
    plead guilty for the past and lay my contrition at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more the more gentle mood overcame him. The house was so still and
    there was something quite unaccountably sweet in this sentimental dalliance
    with this exquisitely beautiful woman who was his wife&mdash;sentimental
    indeed, for though she appeared cold and even cruelly sarcastic, he felt
    the strength of a fine nature in her. Here was no mere doll, mere puppet
    and slave of man content to take her lot as her family or her husband chose
    to shape it&mdash;content to endure or accept a husband&rsquo;s love without
    more return than passive obedience and meaningless kisses. At the back of
    his mind he still thought Laurence a fool, and felt how well suited two such
    warm natures would have been to one another, but for the moment a strange
    desire seized him, to win a kind look from this beautiful woman on his own
    account, to see her smile on him, willingly and confidingly, to win her friendship
    and her trust, even though no warmer feeling should ever crop up between
    him and her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said, and once again he dropped his knee to the
    ground and leaned toward her so that her warm breath touched his hand, which
    he placed upon hers, &ldquo;there are many men in the world who ne&rsquo;er
    do well because they have been left to the companionship of those who do
    equally badly. Will you deign to believe that all the evil that is in me
    lies very much on the surface? They call me wild and extravagant&mdash;even
    my mother calls me careless and shallow&mdash;but if you smiled on me, Madonna,
    methinks that something which lies buried deep down in my heart would stir
    me to an effort to become worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His voice&mdash;habitually somewhat rough and always slightly ironical&mdash;was
    wonderfully gentle now. Instinctively, perhaps even against her will, Lenora
    turned her head slowly round and looked at him. He had never before looked
    so straight and closely into her eyes; and, as she bore his scrutinising
    glance, the warm blood slowly mounted to her cheeks. Her face was partly
    in shadow, only the outline of her small head was outlined by the ruddy glow
    of the fire, and the tiny ear shone, transparent and crimson, like a shell,
    with the golden tendrils of her fair hair gently stirring in the draught
    from the wide, open hearth.</p>
  <p>As she was excited and perhaps a little frightened, her breath came and
    went rapidly, and her lips were slightly parted showing a faint glimmer of
    pearly teeth beyond. Mark felt a sudden rush of blood to his head; to be
    alone with this adorable woman so close to him, to feel her panting like
    a young creature full of life and passion, slightly leaning against his arm,
    to look into those wonderful, dark eyes and know that she was his, was indeed
    more than man could endure in cold blood.</p>
  <p>The next moment he had caught her with irresistible masterfulness in both
    his arms and drawn her down to him as he knelt, whilst his eager lips sought
    hers with a mad longing for a kiss. But with an agonised cry of horror, she
    pushed him away with all her feeble might. For a moment she struggled in
    his arms like a wild creature panting for liberty and murmuring mad, incoherent
    words: &ldquo;Let me go! Let me go! I hate you!&rdquo;&mdash;the next, she
    was already free, and he had struggled to his feet. Now he stood at some
    little distance from her, looking down on her with a scared gaze and passing
    his hand mechanically backwards and forwards across his brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Madonna,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I did not understand
    that you could hate me so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fire was burning low, and the two candles in tall sconces at the further
    end of the room threw but a fitful light upon that hunched up young figure
    in the big, high-backed chair, cowering there half frightened at her own
    violence, tired out with emotion, her nerves quivering after the final, tense
    moment which had left her exhausted and almost unconscious.</p>
  <p>Mark could only see her dimly; the stiff folds of her wedding gown and the
    high starched collar were alone visible in the gloom; she had hidden her
    face in the cushion of the chair. Presently a sob rose to her throat, and
    then another, and soon she was crying just like a tired child. Mark felt
    that he had been a brute and was seized with an infinite pity for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;I think I can hear Jeanne&rsquo;s
    footstep in the corridor. May I call to her to come and attend on you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, Messire,&rdquo; murmured Lenora, who was making a great
    effort to swallow her tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you dry your eyes,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;I would
    be so ashamed if Jeanne saw that I had made you cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up and even in the gloom he thought that he could see a swift
    smile pass across her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow an you desire,&rdquo; he continued more lightly, &ldquo;your
    old dragon Inez shall be here to wait on you, until then I trust that you
    will not feel too lonely, away from those you care for. My mother is an angel.
    You will love her, I think, and my brother Laurence is learned and well-read
    ... my father too is kind. We will all strive, Madonna, to make you somewhat
    more contented with your lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mistake, Messire,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already he had bowed before her and bidden her a formal good-night.
    She had meant to give him her hand and to ask his forgiveness, for indeed
    she had behaved like an ill-tempered child&mdash;a bad beginning for the
    role which she had sworn to play&mdash;but he had gone, and before she could
    call him back he was speeding down the corridor and anon she heard him loudly
    calling to Jeanne.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Lenora did not see her husband during the whole of the next day, and on
    the one occasion when she ventured to ask after him&mdash;with well-feigned
    indifference lest any one guessed that all was not well between them&mdash;Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke sighed, Messire the High-Bailiff gave a forced laugh and Laurence
    van Rycke frowned with obvious anger. And in the evening&mdash;when she retired
    to her room and felt strangely irritable and hurt at being left in such solitude&mdash;she
    questioned Inez, who had been allowed to come and wait on her and who had
    a marvellous faculty for gleaning all the gossip that was going about the
    town.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They do say, my angel,&rdquo; said the old woman with that complacency
    which characterises your true gossip, &ldquo;that Messire Mark van Rycke
    hath spent his whole day in the tavern opposite. It is known as the &lsquo;Three
    Weavers,&rsquo; and many Spanish officers are quartered in there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven protect us!&rdquo; ejaculated Lenora involuntarily, &ldquo;I
    trust they did not quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quarrel, my saint?&rdquo; retorted Inez with a spiteful little laugh,
    for she had no liking for these Netherlanders. &ldquo;Nay! Messire van Rycke
    would not dare quarrel with a Spanish officer. No! no! it seems that the <i>tapperij</i> of
    the &lsquo;Three Weavers&rsquo; was most convivial all the day. It is always
    frequented by Spanish officers, although the inn-keeper is said to be an
    abominable heretic: there was much gambling and heavy drinking there, so
    they say, and even now...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as if to confirm the old woman&rsquo;s say, there came from the house
    opposite and through the open windows loud noise of gay laughter and hilarious
    song. A deep flush rose to Lenora&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Close that window, Inez,&rdquo; she said peremptorily, &ldquo;the
    night hath turned chilly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She went to sit by the fire, and curtly dismissed the gossiping old woman.
    She knew all that she had wanted to know, and the flush of shame deepened
    on her cheek. There had been times during the past week when a vague hope
    had stirred in her heart that mayhap life did hold a small measure of happiness
    for her. There were times when she did not altogether dislike Mark van Rycke,
    when that winning merriment and good-humour which always lurked in his eyes
    provoked a response in her own ... and others, when certain notes of gentleness
    in his voice caused a strange thrill in her heart and brought tears into
    her eyes, which were not altogether tears of sorrow. She had also felt deeply
    remorseful at her conduct last night at the cruel words: &ldquo;I hate you!&rdquo; which
    she had flung so roughly in his face: indeed she could scarcely sleep all
    night, for she was persistently haunted by the dazed look in those merry,
    grey eyes of his which had just for one brief moment flashed tender reproach
    on her.</p>
  <p>But now she felt nothing but shame&mdash;shame that she should ever have
    thought tenderly of a man who could so wrong her, who had so little thought
    of her that he could spend his whole day in a tavern whilst his young girl-bride
    was left to loneliness and boredom in a house where she was a total stranger.
    She thought him vindictive and cruel: already she had thought so last night
    when he went away hurriedly without waiting for the apology which was hovering
    on her lips. Now she was quite sure that she hated him, and the next time
    she told him so, she certainly would not regret it.</p>
  <p>But somehow she felt more forlorn than she had been before that dotard Inez
    had filled her ears with gossip. The house as usual was very still, but Lenora
    knew that the family had not yet gone to rest. Awhile ago she thought that
    she had heard footsteps and a murmur of voices in the hall below. A desire
    for company seized the young girl, and she racked her brain for an excuse
    to go down to her mother-in-law, who she knew was kind and who perhaps would
    cheer and comfort her a little and give her kind pity in her loneliness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    The Rebels</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>At this same hour in the small withdrawing-room which adjoined the dining-hall
    in Messire van Rycke&rsquo;s house, five men were sitting round the gate-legged
    table in the centre of the room. At the top of the table sat Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke, in a tall chair covered with crimson velvet; opposite to her sat
    a man who was dressed in rough clothes of dark-coloured buffle, and whose
    ruff was of plain, coarse linen; he wore a leather belt to which was fastened
    a heavy wallet, and high, tough boots that reached above his knee. His black
    hat and mantle lay on a chair close by. In fact, his clothes&mdash;more than
    ordinarily sombre and plain&mdash;were such as the serving man of a poor
    burgher might wear; nevertheless this man had round his neck a crimson ribbon
    to which was attached a gold pendant in the shape of a dead wether&mdash;which
    is the badge worn by the Knights of the Golden Fleece.</p>
  <p>When this man spoke the others listened to him with marked deference, and
    Laurence van Rycke stood all the time beside his chair and served him with
    wine. In appearance he was spare of build and tall, he wore full beard and
    moustache and hair brushed away from an unusually high forehead. His eyes
    were prominent and very keen and astute as well as frank and kindly in expression,
    and his eyebrows were fully and markedly arched.</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke was the only woman present. The other three men
    were all dressed in dark clothes, and their black mantles hung over the backs
    of their chairs. The room in which these half-dozen people were assembled
    was narrow and oak-panelled; at the end of it there was a low and very wide
    window recess, across which heavy curtains of crimson velvet had been drawn;
    at the side a door gave on the dining-hall; this door was open and the hall
    beyond was in complete darkness.</p>
  <p>The whole room was only dimly lighted by one thick wax candle which burned
    in a tall sconce that stood on a bracket in an angle of the room, and threw
    a fitful light on the grave faces of the men sitting around the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The High-Bailiff hath business at the Town House,&rdquo;  Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke was saying in reply to the stranger who sat opposite to her.  &ldquo;He
    will not be home until midnight. My son Mark, too, is from home,&rdquo; she
    added more curtly. &ldquo;Your Highness can discuss your plans with these
    gentlemen in all security. And if you wish me to retire...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She half rose as if she meant to go, but a word from the stranger kept her
    in her place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you to stay with us, mevrouw,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;we
    would wish you to hear all that we have to say. Of a truth we have no more
    loyal adherents than mevrouw van Rycke and her son, and what we should have
    done in this city without their help I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned at the same time to Laurence and stretched out his hand to him.
    The young man at once bent the knee and kissed the gracious hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The little that we have done, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Cl&eacute;mence
    softly, &ldquo;hath been done with great gladness seeing that it was in your
    service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not only mine, mevrouw,&rdquo; rejoined the stranger. &ldquo;I am
    but the instrument of God&rsquo;s will, an humble follower of His cause.
    What you have done was done for Him and for the cause of liberty, of justice
    and of right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May God&rsquo;s blessing rest upon your Highness&rsquo;  enterprise,&rdquo; murmured
    Cl&eacute;mence fervently. &ldquo;For God and William of Orange is our cry.
    Your cause is the cause of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the Prince, with a sigh of utter weariness and
    dejection, &ldquo;you know how little success I have had in this city ...
    promises! promises! promises I have in plenty, and a couple of thousand young
    men from the town have rallied to my standard. A poor result indeed after
    all my efforts! So much tyranny!&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;such
    wanton oppression! the dastardly outrages at Mons and at Mechlin! and only
    two thousand men among thirty, willing to take up arms to defend their liberty,
    their ancient privileges, their very homes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He leaned his elbows on the table and buried his head in his hands. Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke was silent as were the men; their hearts echoed all the bitterness
    which had surged up in William of Orange&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet your Highness refuses to take me with you,&rdquo;  said Laurence
    with gentle reproach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for the moment, Messire,&rdquo; rejoined the Prince, &ldquo;only
    for the moment. Never fear but I will send for you as soon as I have need
    of you. Can I afford to reject so devoted a champion? But for the moment
    you can do so much more for me by staying quietly at home than if you followed
    me on my recruiting campaign. I have not yet exhausted the resources and
    enthusiasm of this city&mdash;of that I feel confident, I shall try again&mdash;for
    another week. There are still several likely houses that I have not visited,
    and whose cordial invitation I have received...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beware of treachery, your Highness!&rdquo; broke in Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Madonna,&rdquo; he said, whilst that same winning smile lit
    up the sombre dejection of his face, &ldquo;but have I not told you that
    my dragon is on the watch? Not a step am I allowed to take in this city without
    his permission. He allowed me to come to this house to-night, because he
    knew that I desired to express my gratitude to you personally. But I can
    assure you,&rdquo;  he added, laughing softly to himself, &ldquo;I had to
    fight for the permission.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that not insolence?&rdquo; exclaimed one of the others hotly. &ldquo;Were
    we not to be trusted with the care of your sacred person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You all, seigniors, and Messire van Rycke and his mother,&rdquo; rejoined
    the Prince; &ldquo;but there are others in this house. Do not blame my devoted
    Leatherface,&rdquo; he continued earnestly; &ldquo;but for him I should not
    be here now. No man could be more watchful, no man more brave or more resourceful.
    Countless times did he save me from the assassin&rsquo;s dagger and the poisoner&rsquo;s
    cup. If my life is necessary for the cause of freedom and justice, then have
    freedom and justice in Leatherface their truest and most efficient champion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen to that,&rdquo; rejoined Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke with fervour. &ldquo;I
    only wish I knew who he was, that I might pray more personally for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! we none of us know who he is, Madonna,&rdquo; said William of
    Orange more lightly. &ldquo;He is Leatherface, and that is enough for us.
    And this reminds me that he begged me to be back at my lodgings by ten o&rsquo;clock,
    so I have not much time to spend in this pleasing gossip. Shall we to serious
    business now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your Highness&rsquo; service,&rdquo; replied Laurence, and the
    others also murmured a quick assent.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, seigniors, having decided on our coup we have only the
    details to consider. You have all assured me that the Duke of Alva will come
    to Ghent within the next few days, and that our two thousand recruits are
    ready to carry out the orders which we have framed for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The numbers will be doubled within the next few days,&rdquo; interposed
    one of the grave seigniors with conviction. &ldquo;Your Highness&rsquo;  presence
    in the town&mdash;though only known to a very few loyalists&mdash;hath wrought
    miracles already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wave of enthusiasm is spreading,&rdquo; asserted another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! if we had more men,&rdquo; quoth the Prince cheerily, &ldquo;our
    plan would, of a surety, be more certain of success. I cannot say that I
    altogether approve of the plan&mdash;for as you know, I am a soldier and
    have no great mind for plots and conspiracies; but those on whose judgment
    I place infinite confidence&mdash;men such as Messire Paul Buys, pensionary
    of Leyden, Marnix of Tholouse, Marnix of St. Aldegonde and others, all approve
    of it, and I have therefore given it mine assent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sank his voice yet lower to a whisper, and he leaned right across the
    table as did the other men so that their ears were quite close to his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Duke of Alva comes to Ghent in about a week&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he
    continued. &ldquo;The idea is to seize his person and hold him a prisoner
    here and an hostage whilst we demand the withdrawal of all the Spanish troops
    from the Netherlands and the abolition of the Spanish Inquisition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To seize the person of the Duke of Alva!&rdquo;  murmured Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke, and so great was the terror which the tyrant inspired in every
    Flemish heart, that even those who already knew of this daring plot were
    appalled at the magnitude of such an outrage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; quoth William of Orange earnestly. &ldquo;Less than
    a hundred years ago the town of Br&uuml;ges held the Archduke Maximilian
    King of the Romans a prisoner within her walls, until he swore to dismiss
    all foreign troops from the Netherlands within four days, and gave hostages
    for his fidelity. What Br&uuml;ges did then, cannot Ghent do now? With Alva
    a prisoner in our hands, we can dictate our terms to the King. It is a bold
    coup, seigniors, I own, but it hath every chance of success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A murmur of approval went round the table. Cl&eacute;mence alone was silent.
    She was old and feeble, perhaps she had seen more than one bold coup fail,
    and terrible reprisals follow such failures; but Laurence was full of eagerness
    and enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It cannot fail,&rdquo; he asserted vehemently. &ldquo;Are there not
    two thousand men in the city who are devoted to your Highness heart and soul,
    and who are ready to give their lives for your cause? Two thousand, and within
    three days there will be five! more than enough for such a bold coup. It
    will and must succeed! One lucky hazard, and we may win all that we have
    fought for, lived for, died for, for over a century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It cannot fail!&rdquo; came with fervent conviction from every one
    of the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ghent can do what Br&uuml;ges hath done!&rdquo; they affirmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With the tyrant a prisoner in our hands, we can dictate terms as
    Br&uuml;ges did an hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, seigniors,&rdquo; rejoined William of Orange, &ldquo;and
    your approval&mdash;you who know this city so much better than I do&mdash;hath
    given me further encouragement. And now,&rdquo; he added with serious earnestness, &ldquo;you
    will want to know why I convened this meeting, which by Mevrouw van Rycke&rsquo;s
    graciousness I have been able to do, and you will wish to hear what role
    hath been assigned to each of you in the great event which we are preparing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me but offer my life...&rdquo; interposed Laurence eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! not your life, I hope, Messire,&rdquo; quoth the Prince with
    a smile, &ldquo;your forethought and prudence and your united co-operation
    are what we want. Ye are risking your lives, seigniors, in this enterprise,
    that I&rsquo;ll not deny&mdash;but ye are men and know which you value most,
    your life or the very existence of your nation which is threatened with complete
    destruction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For Orange, for faith and for liberty!&rdquo; said one of the men
    simply, and the others merely murmured: &ldquo;Tell us what we must do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must be wary and alert above all things, seigniors, for I have
    chosen you for a very arduous task in connection with this enterprise, and
    you must recognise that however carefully we organise it, there will always
    be one weak link in the chain which we are forging for the capture of that
    abominable tyrant, the Duke of Alva.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One weak link?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. We do not and cannot know for certain on which date Alva proposes
    to come to Ghent. The dates of his visits to Flemish towns are always kept
    a secret until the very moment of departure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He dreads assassination,&rdquo; interposed one man with a sneer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the last occasion of the Duke&rsquo;s visit to Ghent,&rdquo; said
    Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke, &ldquo;my husband was only apprised of it by courier
    two hours before his arrival. The courier had started from Brussels a bare
    half-hour before the Lieutenant-Governor and his cort&egrave;ge left the
    city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely, and even then the High-Bailiff was in advance of every
    one else with the news,&rdquo; nodded the Prince, &ldquo;and that is where
    our difficulty lies. How to collect together a couple of thousand men at
    perhaps an hour&rsquo;s notice&mdash;men who are scattered in different portions
    of this city and probably engaged in their usual avocations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where will their leaders be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Each at the different points where our secret stores of arms are
    kept. There are four of these points and four captains whom I have appointed
    to command five hundred men each. Having distributed the arms, the captains
    will lead their respective companies to the Waalpoort, where a crowd is sure
    to collect as soon as the rumour has spread to the town that the Lieutenant-Governor
    is coming. Our men will mix with the crowd, and at a given signal&mdash;when
    the Duke&rsquo;s cort&egrave;ge crosses the bridge&mdash;they will rush the
    bodyguard, scatter confusion among the escort, and in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
    seize the person of Alva. During the inevitable tumult that will ensue among
    the soldiers and the populace, our valuable hostage shall be conveyed in
    absolute secrecy to Het Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel, where of course we can
    easily keep him a close prisoner whilst we negotiate with the King. But this
    of course is for the future, seigniors,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and my concern
    now is to explain to you the method which I and my councillors have devised
    for the calling together of our stalwarts as soon as the Duke&rsquo;s coming
    visit is announced. Have I your close attention, seigniors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had indeed. The four men round the table bent forward more eagerly still
    so as not to lose one word of their noble chief&rsquo;s commands. But before
    they could formulate the words of loyalty and of enthusiasm which hovered
    on their lips, a soft sound like the beating of a bird&rsquo;s wing against
    the window-pane froze those whispered words upon their lips.</p>
  <p>Every head was immediately turned to the window, every face became rigid
    and pale, every brow was contracted with the effort to strain the faculty
    of hearing to its tensest point. It seemed as if six pairs of glowing eyes
    would pierce the folds of the velvet curtain which hung before the window.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The Prince was the first to recover himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Leatherface,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;come to give me warning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose and would have gone to the window, but Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke
    caught him by the arm and clung convulsively to him. &ldquo;Not you, Monseigneur,&rdquo; she
    entreated, &ldquo;not you&mdash;it might be a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the tapping was repeated and Laurence went cautiously up to the window,
    and after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, he suddenly drew the curtains aside
    with a resolute gesture. Then he unfastened the tall casement and threw it
    open.</p>
  <p>The night was of an inky blackness, and as the lattice flew open a gust
    of wind and heavy driving rain nearly extinguished the light of the candle,
    but in the framework of the window a man&rsquo;s head and shoulders detached
    themselves from out the gloom. The head and shoulders were closely enveloped
    in a hood and cape, and the face was hidden by a mask, and all were dripping
    with wet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leatherface!&rdquo; murmured the Prince, and Cl&eacute;mence van
    Rycke gave a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a light in the window above,&rdquo; whispered the man with
    the mask, &ldquo;and a shadow has crossed behind the windows of the corridor.
    Someone is astir overhead&mdash;and the civic business at the Town House
    is drawing to an end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have nearly finished,&rdquo; murmured the Prince in reply. &ldquo;And
    I&rsquo;ll come away at once. Is the street clear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite&mdash;and will be for another ten minutes till the night-watchman
    comes round. I saw him just now, he is very drunk and might make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come, friend,&rdquo; rejoined the Prince, &ldquo;and as soon as
    may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hooded head disappeared in the gloom; Laurence closed the window and
    drew the curtains together again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I envy that man,&rdquo; he said, and Cl&eacute;mence murmured a fervent: &ldquo;God
    bless him!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Then the Prince turned once more to his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said with his grave smile, &ldquo;how carefully
    my dragon guards me. There is evidently no time for lengthy explanations,
    and I must be as brief as I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He now opened the wallet at his belt and took out from it a small packet
    of papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to entrust these papers to Messire Laurence van Rycke,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;they contain the names and places of abode and of business of
    every one of those two thousand men who have actually tendered me their oath
    of allegiance, and have sworn to give me unconditional support. I propose
    that Messire van Rycke keep these lists, because it will undoubtedly be his
    father, the High-Bailiff, who will learn sooner than any one else in the
    town the day and hour of the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s visit to Ghent. As soon
    as this is known to him, Messire van Rycke will then go to each of you, seigniors,
    and give you each a list of five hundred names, at the head of which will
    be noted the rallying point where these men will have to meet their captain
    and receive their arms. You in your turn will then each go and beat up the
    five hundred men whose names will have been given you, and order them to
    go to their respective rallying points. All this plan,&rdquo; added the Prince, &ldquo;has
    been very carefully thought out, and it seems to me simple and easy of execution.
    But if any of you, seigniors, can think of a better one, I am, of course,
    always ready to take advice. You know your own city, better than I do&mdash;you
    might devise something still more practical than what I propose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; interposed one of the men, &ldquo;meseems that nothing
    could be more simple, and I for one do vote unconditionally for the acceptance
    of His Highness&rsquo; plan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The others all gave their assent&mdash;hastily now, for again that gentle
    tapping was heard against the window-pane, only rather more firmly, more
    urgently this time. But no one went to the window to see what the tapping
    meant; obviously the faithful watcher outside scented some still hidden danger.
    The Prince at once by rising gave the signal that the conference was at an
    end. As he did so he handed the packet of papers to Laurence van Rycke who
    received it on bended knee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a treasure, Messire,&rdquo; said William of Orange earnestly, &ldquo;which
    involves the lives of many and even, perhaps, the whole existence of this
    city. Where will you keep it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke who replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This room,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is mine own private withdrawing-room;
    that bureau there hath a wonderful lock which defies the cleverest thief;
    it contains my most valuable jewels. The papers will be safer there than
    anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see you lock them up in there, mevrouw,&rdquo;  rejoined the
    Prince graciously, &ldquo;I entrust them to you and to Laurence with utmost
    confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence then handed a key to her son and he locked the packet up
    in the tall bureau of carved and inlaid mahogany and satin-wood which stood
    in an angle of the narrow room close to the window and opposite to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am meeting some friends and adherents to-morrow,&rdquo; said William
    of Orange finally, &ldquo;at the house of Messire the Procurator-General
    whom of a truth God will bless for his loyalty&mdash;and I pray you, seigniors,
    as many of you as can do so to meet me there at this same hour. But should
    we not meet again, do you understand all that you have to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men nodded in silence, whereupon the Prince took formal leave of them
    and of his host and hostess. He said kind and grateful words to Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke, who, with tears in her eyes, kissed the gracious hand which was
    held out to her. She then escorted her noble guest out of the room and across
    the dining-hall, the others following closely behind. All were treading as
    noiselessly as they could. The door which gave from the dining-room on the
    hall and staircase beyond was wide open: the room itself was in absolute
    darkness, and only a tiny light flickered in the hall, which made the shadows
    round corners and in recesses appear all the more dense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will your Highness grope your way to the front door,&rdquo; whispered
    Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke, &ldquo;or shall my son bring a lanthorn to guide
    you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said William of Orange hurriedly, &ldquo;that small
    light yonder is quite sufficient. I can see my way, and we must try not to
    wake your hall-porter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing will rouse him save a very severe shaking, and the bolts
    and bars have been left undone, as my husband will be coming home late to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, if I am not mistaken,&rdquo; quoth the Prince, &ldquo;my devoted
    friend Leatherface is waiting for me outside to see me safely to my lodgings.
    He is always mistrustful of hidden traps or hired assassins for me. Farewell,
    seigniors!&rdquo; he added lightly, &ldquo;remember my instructions in case
    we do not meet again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But to-morrow...&rdquo; interposed Laurence van Rycke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! to-morrow,&rdquo; said William of Orange, &ldquo;at this hour
    at the house of Messire Deynoot, the Procurator-General: those of you, seigniors,
    who care to come will be welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not one of us would care to stay away,&rdquo; rejoined Laurence with
    earnest conviction.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    The Watcher In The Night</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Lenora, thinking that Mevrouw van Rycke was still astir, and pining for
    motherly comfort and companionship, had crept softly down the stairs candle
    in hand, when all of a sudden she paused in the vast hall. Everything was
    so still and so weird that any noise, even that of a mouse skimming over
    a carpet, would have made itself felt in the absolute silence which lay over
    the house, and Lenora&rsquo;s ear had most certainly heard&mdash;or rather
    felt, a noise&mdash;the sound of people moving and speaking somewhere, not
    very far from where she stood ... listening ... every sense on the alert.</p>
  <p>With a sudden instinct, half of fear and half of caution, she blew out the
    candle and then groped her way, with hands outstretched, hardly daring to
    breathe. The tiny, flickering light which came from an iron lamp fixed to
    a bracket at the foot of the stairs made the hall seem yet more vast and
    strange; but one small, elvish ray caught the polished brass handle of the
    dining-room door, and this glimmer of metal seemed to attract Lenora toward
    it. After awhile her eyes became a little more accustomed to the gloom, she
    tip-toed up to that door-handle which so attracted her, and placing both
    her hands upon it, she crouched there&mdash;beside the door&mdash;listening.</p>
  <p>In effect there were people moving and talking not far from where she crouched&mdash;no
    doubt that they were in the small withdrawing-room beyond, and that the door
    of communication between the two rooms was open. Lenora&mdash;motionless,
    palpitating, her heart beating so that it nearly choked her, felt that all
    her faculties must now be merged into those of hearing, and, if possible,
    seeing what was going on in this house, and at this hour of the night when
    the High-Bailiff was from home.</p>
  <p>Whether any thought of conspiracy or of State secrets had at this time entered
    her head it were impossible to say, whether she thought of Ramon&rsquo;s
    murderer or of her oath to her father just then, who can tell? Certainly
    not the girl herself&mdash;she only listened&mdash;listened with all her
    might, and anon she heard the scraping of a chair against the tiled floor,
    then the iron rings of a curtain sliding along the rod, finally the whistling
    sound of a gust of wind rushing through an open window. This moment she chose
    as her opportunity. She turned the handle of the door very gently, and quite
    noiselessly it responded to her touch. Then she pushed the door wide open
    and waited&mdash;listening.</p>
  <p>The door into the withdrawing-room was wide open just as she had conjectured,
    the wind was blowing the feeble light about which flickered in that room,
    and there were men in there who moved stealthily and spoke in whispers. Lenora
    crept forward&mdash;furtive as a mouse. The darkness in the dining-hall was
    impenetrable, and she in her house-dress of dark woollen stuff made no noise
    as she glided along, keeping well within the gloom, her hands stretched out
    before her to feel the objects that might be in her way.</p>
  <p>At last she came within range of the open door and had a view of the little
    room beyond. She saw the table in the centre, the men sitting around it,
    and Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke in a high-back chair at its further end. Just
    now they all had their faces turned toward the window, where in the open
    casement the head and shoulders of a man were dimly visible to Lenora for
    one instant and then disappeared.</p>
  <p>After that she heard the men talking together and heard what they said:
    she saw that one man appeared to be the recipient of great marks of respect,
    and that the others called him &ldquo;Your Highness.&rdquo; She was now listening
    as if her very life depended on what she heard&mdash;crouching in the angle
    of the dining-room as closely as her unwieldy farthingale would allow. She
    heard the man whom the others called &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; and who
    could be none other than the Prince of Orange, explain to the others a plan
    for massing together two thousand men in connection with a forthcoming visit
    of the Duke of Alva to Ghent, she heard the word &ldquo;Leatherface&rdquo; and
    a great deal about a packet of papers. She heard the Prince speak about a
    meeting to-morrow in the house of the Procurator-General, and finally she
    saw Laurence van Rycke take a packet of papers from the Prince&rsquo;s hand
    and lock it up in the bureau that stood close to the window.</p>
  <p>Indeed she could not for a moment be in doubt as to the meaning of what
    she saw and heard.</p>
  <p>Here was a living proof of that treachery, that underhand conspiracy of
    which her father had so often spoken to her of late! Here were these Netherlanders,
    living under the beneficent and just laws of their Sovereign Lord and Master
    King Philip of Spain&mdash;the man who in every born Spaniard&rsquo;s eyes
    was greater, nobler, more just and more merciful than any other monarch alive,
    who next to His Holiness himself was surely anointed by God Himself and placed
    upon the mightiest throne on earth so that he might administer God&rsquo;s
    will upon all his subjects&mdash;and here were these traitors plotting and
    planning against the Government of that high and noble monarch, plotting
    against his representative, the Lieutenant-Governor whom he had himself put
    in authority over them.</p>
  <p>To a girl born and bred in the atmosphere of quasi-worship which surrounded
    Philip&rsquo;s throne, the revolt of these Netherlanders was the most heinous
    outrage any people could commit. She understood now the hatred and loathing
    which her father had for them&mdash;she hated them too, since one of these
    vile conspirators had foully murdered her cousin Ramon in the dark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leatherface!&rdquo;&mdash;the man in the room below whom the others
    called &ldquo;Your Highness&rdquo; spoke of Leatherface as his friend!</p>
  <p>A Prince consorting with a hired assassin! and Lenora felt that her whole
    soul was filled with loathing for all these people. Was not the man who had
    killed Ramon&mdash;foully, surreptitiously and in the dark&mdash;was he not
    even now just outside this very house&mdash;the house which was to be her
    home for life&mdash;waiting mayhap for some other unsuspecting Spanish officer
    whom he could murder in the same cowardly and treacherous way?&mdash;and
    were not all these people in that room yonder, execrable assassins too?&mdash;had
    she not heard them speaking of armed conspirators?&mdash;and could she not
    see even now in her mind&rsquo;s eye the unsuspecting Duke of Alva falling
    into their abominable trap?</p>
  <p>But horror-struck as she was, she never stirred. Truth to tell, a sudden
    fear held her now&mdash;the fear that she might be detected ere she had done
    her best to save the Duke from this infamous plot. What she would do presently,
    she did not know as yet&mdash;for the moment all that she needed was safety
    from discovery and the privacy of her own room where she could pray and think.</p>
  <p>After Laurence had locked the papers in the bureau it was obvious that the
    meeting was at an end. She had only just time to flit like a dark ghost through
    the dining-hall and to reach the stairs, before she heard unmistakable signs
    that the Prince and his friends were taking leave of their host and hostess.
    Gathering her wide gown together in her hands, she crept up the stairs as
    fast as she could. Fortunately she was well out of the range of the small
    light at the foot of the stairs, before the five men and Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke came out into the hall. She heard their few words of farewell and
    heard the Prince arranging for the meeting the next evening at the house
    of Messire Deynoot.</p>
  <p>After that she felt that further delay would inevitably spell detection.
    Even now someone must have opened the front door, for a gust of wind and
    heavy rain driving into the house told the listener quite clearly that the
    Prince and his friends were leaving the house: anon Cl&eacute;mence and Laurence
    would be going up to their own apartments.</p>
  <p>As swiftly, as furtively as a mouse, Lenora made her way up the stairs:
    and now there she sat once more in the vast bedchamber, quivering with excitement
    and with horror, listening for footsteps outside her door. She heard Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke&rsquo;s shuffling footsteps passing down the corridor, and Laurence&rsquo;s
    more firm ones following closely in their wake: a few whispered words were
    spoken by mother and son, then doors were closed and all was still once more.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The fire had burnt low, only the last dying embers of the charred pine logs
    threw a wide glowing band across the centre of the room. Lenora sitting by
    the fire had scarcely moved for a quarter of an hour or even more. Anon she
    heard the opening and shutting of the front door.</p>
  <p>It was the High-Bailiff returning home&mdash;not knowing, of a truth, that
    his house had just been used as a meeting-place for conspirators. The hall-porter
    slept between two doors in the outer lobby. Lenora heard him scrambling out
    of bed, and the High-Bailiff&rsquo;s voice bidding him close everything up
    for the night. Then came the pushing home of bars and bolts and the rattle
    of chains, and finally the sound of the High-Bailiff&rsquo;s heavy footsteps
    across the hall and up the stairs.</p>
  <p>After that silence once more.</p>
  <p>Lenora, however, still sat on for awhile staring into the glow. Vaguely
    she wondered if Mark would be staying out all night, or whether he had been
    home all along, knowing perhaps, and perhaps not caring about, what was going
    on in his father&rsquo;s house; keeping aloof from it all: or like Laurence,
    up to his neck in all this treachery and abominable rebellion!</p>
  <p>Another quarter-of-an-hour went by: the clock of St. Bavon had chimed the
    half after eleven, and now the quarter before midnight. Lenora felt that
    at last she might slip downstairs with safety.</p>
  <p>Quickly now she took off her stuff gown and heavy farthingale which had
    so impeded her movements awhile ago, and groped in the press for a clinging
    robe which would envelop her closely and glide noiselessly upon the tiled
    floors.</p>
  <p>There is absolutely no doubt that all through this time Lenora acted almost
    unconsciously. She never for one moment paused to think: she was impelled
    by a force which she herself could not have defined&mdash;a force which can
    best be described as a blind instinct. Obedience! She had been born and bred
    in obedience and a sense of sacred duty to her King as Sovereign Lord, to
    her faith and to her father.</p>
  <p>In the convent at Segovia she had learned the lesson of obedience so absolutely
    that it never entered her mind to question the decrees of those three all-potent
    arbiters of her destiny. And when&mdash;as now&mdash;the hour came when the
    most sacred oath she had ever spoken had to be fulfilled, she would have
    thought it a deadly sin to search her own heart, to study her feelings, to
    argue with herself about it. She would as soon have thought of arguing with
    God.</p>
  <p>On Ramon&rsquo;s death-bed she had sworn to her father that she would act
    and work for her country and for her King in the way that her father would
    direct.</p>
  <p>The time had come, and she did what she believed to be her duty without
    question and without false shame.</p>
  <p>She knew that the knowledge which she already possessed was of paramount
    importance to the Government: the Prince of Orange was in Ghent&mdash;who
    but he would be called &ldquo;your Highness&rdquo;?&mdash;and moving about
    among his friends surreptitiously and at dead of night? Who but he would
    speak of the mysterious Leatherface as being on the watch for him? The Prince
    of Orange was in Ghent and was conspiring against the State. There had been
    talk of the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s visit to Ghent and of two thousand men being
    secretly armed. What other purpose save that of murder and bloodshed could
    be served by such secret plottings and the levying of troops in this illegal
    manner? The Prince of Orange was in Ghent and would on the morrow continue
    his underhand and treasonable machinations in the house of Messire Deynoot,
    Procurator-General of Ghent.</p>
  <p>That was the extent of Lenora&rsquo;s knowledge, and what could she do with
    such a secret in her possession&mdash;she, a helpless girl, a stranger in
    the midst of all these enemies of her people and of her race? Could she,
    having gleaned so much information, quietly go to bed and sleep and let events
    shape their course?&mdash;and detach herself, as it were, from the destinies
    of her own country which her father had in a measure entrusted to her stewardship?
    Could she above all be false to her oath at the very moment when God gave
    her an opportunity of fulfilling it and of working for her country and her
    King in a manner which was given to very few women to do? Indeed she did
    not pause to think. Any thought save that of obedience would be treason to
    the King and sinful before God. The hour for thought would come later, and
    with it mayhap regret. Then so be it. Whatever suffering she would have to
    endure in the future, in her sentiment and in her feelings, she was ready
    to accept unquestioningly, just as she was prepared to fulfil her duty unquestioningly
    now. She knew a good deal, but surely not enough. She had seen Laurence van
    Rycke lock up a packet of papers in the bureau, and she had in her possession
    tied with a ribbon around her neck, the precious pass-key which her father
    had given her on the very morning when he told her how Ramon had come by
    his death&mdash;the curiously-fashioned piece of steel made by the metal-worker
    of Toledo&mdash;who had been put out of the way, because his skill had made
    him dangerous&mdash;and which would turn any lock or open any secret drawer.</p>
  <p>She had no light now and did not know how to use the tinder, but in the
    wall of the corridor outside her door there was a little niche wherein stood
    a statue of the Virgin, and in front of the statute a tiny light was kept
    burning day and night: this would do in lieu of a candle. She would take
    it, she thought, and carry it into the withdrawing-room with her: it would
    help to guide her to the bureau where the papers were.</p>
  <p>Yes! she was quite prepared for what she had to do, and there was no reason
    to wait any longer. And yet for some unaccountable reason she suddenly felt
    strangely inert: there were still a few dying embers in the grate, and she
    could see quite distinctly the high-backed chair in which she had sat last
    night, and the low one wherein Mark had half sat, half kneeled close beside
    her: the memory of that brief interview which she had had with him came upon
    her with a rush. It had been the only interview between them since the blessing
    of the Church had made them man and wife. It had ended disastrously it is
    true. Her words: &ldquo;I hate you!&rdquo; had been cruel and untrue, and
    overwhelming regret suddenly held her in its grip once again&mdash;as it
    had done all the day.</p>
  <p>Closing her eyes for a moment&mdash;for they felt hot and heavy&mdash;she
    could almost believe that Mark was still there&mdash;his merry grey eyes
    looking deeply earnest, trying to read her innermost thoughts. His personality&mdash;so
    strange, so baffling even&mdash;seemed still to linger in this dimly-lighted
    room, and she almost could hear his voice&mdash;rugged, yet at times so sweet
    and tender&mdash;echoing softly along the rafters.</p>
  <p>And all of a sudden she realised the full horror of what she was doing&mdash;of
    what she must do now or else become false and perjured&mdash;a traitor to
    her race and to her King. No longer was she a blind and unconscious tool
    of Fate&mdash;she was she herself&mdash;a woman who lived and thought and
    suffered: and before her at this moment there was nothing but an interminable
    vista of sorrow and suffering and regret.</p>
  <p>Whether duty ruled her or sentiment, she&mdash;the innocent handmaid of
    Fate&mdash;could reap nothing but remorse in the future; her heart, her very
    youth, must inevitably be crushed between those two potent factors which
    were struggling even now for mastery over her soul.</p>
  <p>Indeed was there ever a woman&mdash;a mere girl&mdash;confronted with so
    appalling, so intricate a puzzle? The lives of men were in her hands&mdash;the
    Prince of Orange, the High-Bailiff, Mark, Laurence, Cl&eacute;mence on the
    one side, on the other the Duke of Alva, her own father, her kindred, all
    those whom she had clung to and loved throughout her life.</p>
  <p>And knowing that she never could solve such an awful problem by herself
    Lenora fell on her knees and prayed: she prayed with all the fervour, but
    also with all the simplicity of primitive faith&mdash;the faith that is willing
    and eager to leave everything in God&rsquo;s hands, to trust to guidance
    and help from above when life has become a hopeless and inextricable tangle&mdash;the
    faith which hath for its principle loyalty and obedience and which accepts
    suffering in its cause, and glories in it like in a martyr&rsquo;s crown.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>After a few minutes Lenora felt more calm. Her deep and fervent religious
    sentiment had risen triumphant over every doubt. While she prayed so earnestly,
    so unquestioningly, it had been made clear to her that the issue of the mighty
    problem which was putting her very soul on the rack must remain in mightier
    hands than hers. She could not be the arbiter of men&rsquo;s lives and of
    the destinies of the State; all that she could do was to obey her father
    and fulfil her oath; beyond that, God must decide; He had shown her the way
    how to obtain the knowledge which she now possessed, and since her father
    was now back in Brussels, she must find a means of placing that knowledge
    in his hands. Her father of a surety was kind and just and God would Himself
    punish whom He willed.</p>
  <p>With this calmer state of mind her resolution became more firm. She felt
    the pass-key safely in her bosom, then stealthily she slipped out of her
    room: the tiny light was flickering dimly at the foot of the Virgin&rsquo;s
    statue; Lenora lifted it carefully and with it in her hand prepared to go
    downstairs.</p>
  <p>Scarce a sound broke the silence of the night: only the patter of the rain
    against the leaded panes of the windows and an occasional gust of wind that
    came roaring down the huge chimneys and shook the frames of windows and doors.
    Before descending the stairs Lenora paused once more to listen. Down the
    corridor she could hear Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke in her bedchamber still
    moving about, and Laurence&rsquo;s footstep on the tiled floor of his room.</p>
  <p>And then the girl&mdash;shading the tiny light with her hand&mdash;began
    to descend.</p>
  <p>She paused for a moment upon the landing and peeped into the vast hall below.
    It was fortunate that she had the tiny light, as the small lamp at the foot
    of the stairs had since been extinguished; but the little wick she held only
    threw out a faint glimmer a yard or two in front of her, and beyond this
    small circle there was nothing but impenetrable darkness.</p>
  <p>The house was very still, and Lenora was absolutely without fear. From the
    church towers of the city, both near and far, there came the sound of bells
    striking the midnight hour. She waited till the last echo of the chimes had
    died away, then she continued her way down.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Lenora now entered the dining-hall and carefully closed the door behind
    her. Light in hand she stood for a moment in the very angle of the room from
    whence she had watched the plotters an hour ago. Nothing had been deranged.</p>
  <p>Then she went into the withdrawing-room, and placed the light upon the centre
    table. She looked around her mutely challenging the dumb objects&mdash;the
    chairs that stood about in disorder, the curtains which were not closely
    drawn, the bureau that was in the corner&mdash;to tell her all that she had
    failed to hear. In this spot a vile conspiracy had been hatched against the
    Duke of Alva&mdash;two thousand men were implicated in it&mdash;but in what
    way it threatened the Duke&rsquo;s life she did not know&mdash;nor yet who
    were all these men who had sat around this table and hatched treason against
    the King and State.</p>
  <p>The tiny wick only shed a very feeble glimmer of light on the top of the
    table: it made the shadows on the ceiling dance a weird rigadoon and grow
    to fantastic proportions. But Lenora&rsquo;s eyes were growing well-accustomed
    to the gloom. Quickly now she drew the pass-key from between the folds of
    her kerchief and went up to the bureau. The ribbon round her neck was in
    the way so she took it off; with trembling, unerring fingers she groped for
    the lock and having found it she inserted the pass-key into it. After a little
    adjustment, a little tugging and pulling, she found that the lock yielded
    quite smoothly to the pressure. The flap came down and displayed the interior
    of the bureau, consisting of a number of wide pigeon-holes, in each of which
    there was a small iron box such as the rich matrons of Flanders used for
    putting away their pearls and other pieces of jewellery. On the top of one
    of these boxes there was a packet of papers, tied round with a piece of orange-coloured
    ribbon. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation Lenora took it. She unfolded
    one of the papers and laid it out flat upon the table, smoothing it out with
    her hand. She drew the light a little nearer and examined the writing carefully:
    it was just a list of names&mdash;fifty in all&mdash;with places of abode
    all set out in a double column, and at the bottom was written in a bold hand:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the above to Afsemble without any delay in the Barn which is
    fituated in the North-Weft angle of the Cemetery at the back of the Chapel
    of St. Jan ten Dullen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having satisfied herself that the other papers in the packet also contained
    lists of names and brief orders as to place of assembly, she tied them all
    up together again with the orange-coloured ribbon. Then she closed the bureau,
    turned the pass-key in the lock and slipped it, together with the packet,
    into the bosom of her gown.</p>
  <p>Then she turned to go.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Light in hand she went tip-toeing across the dining-room; but close to the
    threshold she paused. She had distinctly heard a furtive footstep in the
    hall. At once she extinguished the light. Then she waited. Her thoughts had
    flown to Laurence van Rycke. Perhaps he felt anxious about the papers, and
    was coming down in order to transfer them to some other place of safety.
    The supposition was terrifying. Lenora felt as if an icy hand had suddenly
    gripped her heart and was squeezing her very life out of it. In this deathlike
    agony a few seconds went by&mdash;indeed they seemed to the unfortunate girl
    like an eternity of torment. She had slipped close to the wall right against
    the door, so that the moment it was opened from the outside, and someone
    entered the room, she could contrive to slip out. All might yet be well,
    if whoever entered did not happen to carry a light.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly she heard the steps again, and this time they approached the
    dining-room door. Lenora&rsquo;s heart almost ceased to beat: the next moment
    the door was opened and someone stood upon the threshold&mdash;just for a
    second or two ... without moving, whilst Lenora with senses as alert as those
    of some feline creature in defence of its life&mdash;waited and watched for
    her opportunity.</p>
  <p>But that opportunity never came, for the newcomer&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;suddenly
    stepped into the room and immediately closed the door behind him and turned
    the key in the lock. Lenora was a prisoner, at the mercy of a man whose secrets
    she had stolen, and whose life hung upon all that she had seen and heard
    this night.</p>
  <p>The intruder now groped his way across the room and anon Lenora heard him
    first draw aside the curtains from before the window, and then proceed to
    open two of the casements. The window gave on the Nieuwstraate, almost opposite
    the tavern of the &ldquo;Three Weavers,&rdquo; at the entrance of which there
    hung an iron street-lamp. The light of this came slanting in through the
    open casements and Lenora suddenly saw that it was Mark who was standing
    there.</p>
  <p>Even at this instant he turned and faced her. He showed no sign however
    of surprise, but exclaimed quite pleasantly: &ldquo;By the stars, Madonna!
    and who would have thought of meeting you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tension on Lenora&rsquo;s nerves had been so acute that her self-control
    almost gave way with the intensity of her relief when she recognised Mark
    and heard the sound of his voice. Her hands began to shake so violently that
    the tiny lamp nearly dropped out of them.</p>
  <p>She had been so startled that she could not as yet either speak or move,
    but just stood there close to the wall, like a pale, slim ghost only faintly
    illumined by the slanting light of the street-lamp, her soft, white gown
    clinging round her trembling limbs. Her face, bosom and arms were scarce
    less white than her gown, and in the dim, mysterious light her luminous,
    dark eyes shone with a glow of excitement still vaguely tinged with dread.</p>
  <p>He thought that never in life had he seen anything quite so beautiful, so
    pure, so desirable, and yet so pathetic as this young girl, whom but forty
    hours ago he had sworn to love, to protect and to cherish. Just now she looked
    sadly helpless, despite the fact that gradually a little air of haughtiness
    replaced her first look of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;are you indeed yourself, or
    are you your own wraith? If not, why are you wandering about alone at this
    hour of the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came to fetch my prayer-book,&rdquo; she said, trying to speak
    lightly and with a steady voice. &ldquo;I thought that I had left it here
    to-day and missed it when I went to rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You found the book, I hope,&rdquo; he said, without the slightest
    trace of irony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied coldly. &ldquo;Inez must have put it away.
    Will you be so good as to unlock that door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will with pleasure, Madonna. I locked it when I came in, because
    I didn&rsquo;t want old Pierre to come shuffling in after me, as he so often
    does when I go late to bed. But,&rdquo; he added, putting out his hand, &ldquo;may
    I take this lamp from you. Your hand does not appear to be oversteady and
    if the oil were to drip it would spoil your gown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The draught blew it out,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;and I would
    be glad if you would relight it. I am going back to my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; he rejoined dryly as he took the lamp from her
    and put it on the table, &ldquo;and with your leave I would escort you thither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she rejoined coldly, &ldquo;I can find my way
    alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; he said with perfect indifference.</p>
  <p>Now that her eyes were more accustomed to the semi-darkness she could see
    him more distinctly, and she stared at him in amazement. His appearance was
    certainly very different to what it habitually was&mdash;for he usually dressed
    himself with great care: but now he had on dark clothes, made of thick woollen
    stuff, which clung closely to his tall figure: he wore no ruff, and had on
    very high boots which reached high above his knees. Both his clothes and
    boots were bespattered with mud, and strangely enough looked also wet through.
    Somehow the appearance appeared unreal. It was Mark&mdash;and yet it was
    not. His face, too, looked flushed, and the lines round his eyes were more
    deeply marked than they had ever seemed to be before.</p>
  <p>The recollection of all the abominable gossip retailed about him by Inez
    and others took possession of her mind. She had been told by all and sundry
    that Mark van Rycke had spent most of his day at the &ldquo;Three Weavers,&rdquo; and
    now the flush on his face, the curious dilation of the pupils of his eyes,
    seemed to bear mute testimony to all that she had heard.</p>
  <p>Here, then, she already saw the hand of God guiding her future&mdash;and
    showing her the small glimmer of comfort which He vouchsafed her in the midst
    of her perplexities. Life in this house and with this man&mdash;who cared
    less than nothing for her&mdash;would anyhow be intolerable&mdash;then obviously
    the way was clear for her to go back to her father. She wished no harm to
    these people&mdash;none to this poor, drunken wretch, who probably had no
    thought of rebellion or of heresy, none to Laurence, who loved her, or to
    Cl&eacute;mence, who had been kind to her. But she despised them&mdash;aye!
    and loathed them, and was grateful to God for allowing her to keep her promise
    to her father within the first few hours of her married life.</p>
  <p>How terrible would have been the long and weary watching! the irresolution,
    the temptation, mayhap, to be false to her oath through sheer indolence or
    superacute sentiment!</p>
  <p>So now all that she had to do was to go straight back to her father, tell
    him all that she knew and then go&mdash;go back to the dear old convent at
    Segovia&mdash;having done more than a woman&rsquo;s share in the service
    of her country&mdash;and then to rest after that&mdash;to spend her life
    in peace and in prayer&mdash;away from all political intrigues&mdash;forgetting
    that she had ever been young and felt a vague yearning for happiness.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>Mark had made no sign or movement while Lenora stood there before him, gathering
    her strength together for what she felt might prove a struggle. In some unaccountable
    way she felt a little afraid of him&mdash;not physically of course, but,
    despite the fact that she had so impulsively judged him just now&mdash;afraid
    of that searching glance of his which seemed to lay her innermost thoughts
    like an open book before his eyes. She put this strange timidity of hers
    down to the knowledge that he had certain lawful rights over her as her lord
    and husband and that she would have to obtain his consent before she could
    think of going to Brussels on the morrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;during this day which you
    have seen fit to spend among your habitual boon companions, making merry
    no doubt, I have been a great deal alone. Solitude begets sober reason&mdash;and
    I have come to the conclusion that life under present conditions would be
    a perpetual martyrdom to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and he rejoined quietly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite understand,
    Madonna. Under what conditions would your life become a martyrdom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under those of a neglected wife, Messire,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
    have no mind to sit at home&mdash;an object of suspicion to your kinsfolk
    and of derision to your servants, while the whole town is alive with the
    gossip that Messire Mark van Rycke spent the first day of his marriage in
    the taverns of Ghent and left his bride to pine in solitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But methought, Madonna,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;that it was solitude
    that you craved for. Both last night and even a moment ago you told me very
    plainly that you had no desire for my company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last night I was overwrought and would have made amends to you for
    my thoughtlessness at once, only that you left me incontinently without a
    further word. As for now, Messire, surely you cannot wonder that I have no
    mind for your society after a day&rsquo;s carouse has clouded your brain
    and made your glance unsteady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thought herself very brave in saying this, and more than half expected
    an angry retort from him. Instead of which he suddenly threw back his head
    and burst into an immoderate and merry laughter. She gazed at him horrified
    and not a little frightened&mdash;thinking indeed that his brain was overclouded&mdash;but
    he, as soon as he had recovered his composure, asked her with grave attempt
    at seriousness: &ldquo;You think that I am drunk, Madonna? Ye gods!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed not without a touch of bitterness, &ldquo;hath such a farce ever
    been enacted before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A farce to you perhaps,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;but a tragedy
    to me. I have been rendered wretched and unhappy, Messire, and this despite
    your protestations of chivalry. I did not seek you, Messire. This marriage
    was forced upon me. It is ungenerous and cowardly to make me suffer because
    of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dastardly and abominable,&rdquo; he assented gravely. &ldquo;Indeed,
    Madonna, you do me far too much honour even to deign to speak with me. I
    am not worthy that you should waste a thought on me&mdash;but since you have
    been so kind thus far, will you extend your generosity to me by allowing
    me to give you my most solemn word&mdash;to swear to you if need be that
    I am not the drunken wretch whom evil tongues have thus described to you.
    There,&rdquo; he added more lightly, &ldquo;will you not deign to sit here
    a moment? You are tired and overwrought; let me get you a cup of wine, and
    see if some less strenuous talk will chase all those black thoughts from
    your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took her hand and then with gentle yet forceful pressure led her to the
    wide hearth and made her sit in the big chair close beside it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas! there are not even embers in the grate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
    fear me, you must be cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From somewhere out of the darkness&mdash;she could not see from where&mdash;he
    brought a footstool for her feet; then he pulled a low chair forward for
    himself and sat down at some little distance from her, in his favourite attitude,
    with one elbow on his knee and his face shaded by his hand. She remained
    silent for a moment or two, for she suddenly felt an extraordinary sense
    of well-being; just the same as she had felt last night, and once or twice
    before in his presence. And she felt deeply sorry for him too. After all,
    perhaps he had no more desired this marriage than she had&mdash;and no doubt
    the furrows on his face came from anxiety and care, and she marvelled what
    it was that troubled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he asked gaily, &ldquo;are you better now, Madonna?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better, I thank you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then shall I interpret the thoughts which were coursing behind that
    smooth brow of yours, when first I startled you by my presence here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He waited a moment, then said dryly: &ldquo;You desired to convey to me
    your wish to return to your father.... Oh! only for a little while,&rdquo; he
    added hastily, seeing that she had made a quick, protesting gesture,  &ldquo;but
    that was in your mind, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not deny it, and murmured: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such a wish, Madonna,&rdquo; he rejoined, gravely, &ldquo;is as a
    command to me. In the late morning the horses will be at your disposal. I
    will have the honour to accompany you to Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, Messire!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you would...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would do anything to further your wishes, Madonna; this I would
    have you believe. And a journey to Brussels is such a small matter....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; she murmured. For such are the contradictions
    of a woman&rsquo;s heart that all of a sudden she did not wish to go away.
    All thoughts of rebellion and conspiracies were unaccountably thrust into
    the background of her mind, and ... she did not wish to go away....</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no hurry,&rdquo; she continued timidly. &ldquo;I would not
    like to put you to inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he rejoined airily, &ldquo;there is no inconvenience which
    I would not gladly bear in order to gratify your wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to pack my effects....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jeanne will help Inez, and a few things are easily packed. Your effects
    shall follow in an ox-wagon; they will be two days on the way; so I pray
    you take what is required for your immediate needs and is easily stowed in
    your saddle-bow. We shall have to make an early start, if you desire to be
    in Brussels by nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! there is no hurry,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah? Then in that case I could escort you as far as Alost, and send
    a courier thence to your father, to meet you there the next day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bit her lip and could have cried with vexation. At the present moment
    she hated him for so obviously wishing to be rid of her. She had quite forgotten
    that she had ever wanted to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be too tired to make an early start in the morning,&rdquo; she
    said quite piteously. &ldquo;Why it is close on early morning now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She leaned a little forward in order to listen, for just then the chimes
    of St. Bavon rang the half-hour after midnight. She still looked a small,
    pale, slim ghost with one side of her exquisite face in shadow, the other
    but faintly illumined by the light from without. Her vexation, her indecision,
    were so plainly expressed in her eyes, that he must indeed have been vastly
    dull or vastly indifferent not to have read her thoughts. Nevertheless, he
    said with the same calm airiness as before:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A few hours&rsquo; rest will revive you, Madonna. And if we only
    go as far as Alost to-morrow, we need not start before midday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this her pride was aroused. His indifference now amounted to insolence.
    With a vigorous effort she swallowed her tears, for they were very near the
    surface, and then she rose abruptly, with the air and manners of a queen,
    looking down in her turn with haughty indifference on that abominable Netherlander
    whom she had never hated so thoroughly as she did at this moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, Messire,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;I pray you then
    to see that all arrangements be complete for my journey as early as may be.
    I would wish to be in Brussels by nightfall, and half a dozen leagues or
    so does not frighten me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose with all that stateliness which was a part of herself and suited
    her tall, graceful figure so admirably; as she did so she gave him a curt
    nod such as she would have bestowed on a serving man. He too rose to his
    feet but he made no attempt to detain her. On the contrary, he at once busied
    himself with his tinder box, and relighted the little lamp. Then he went
    to the door, unlocked it and held it open for her to pass through.</p>
  <p>As she did so she took the lamp from him, and for one moment their hands
    met. His were burning hot and hers quite cold&mdash;his fingers lingered
    upon the satiny softness of hers.</p>
  <p>But she sailed past him without bestowing another glance upon him, with
    little head erect and eyes looking straight out before her. In one hand she
    held the lamp, with the other she was holding up the heavy folds of her trailing
    gown, her tiny feet in velvet shoes made no sound as she glided across the
    hall. Soon she was a mere silhouette with the light just playing faintly
    with the loose curls round her head and touching the lines of her shoulders
    and arms and one or two folds of her gown. She mounted the stairs slowly
    as if she was infinitely weary; Mark watched the graceful, ghostlike form
    gliding upwards until the gloom had swallowed it up.</p>
  <p>Then he turned back into the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>The first thing that Mark did when he was alone was to close the door; then
    he struck a light and lit a candle. With it in his hand he went into the
    withdrawing-room and&mdash;having peered closely into the four corners of
    the room, as if he half-expected to see some night-prowler there&mdash;he
    placed the candle on the table, drew a bunch of keys from the inner pocket
    of his doublet, and going up to the bureau proceeded to unlock it just as
    Lenora had done.</p>
  <p>He gave one quick glance at the interior of the bureau, then he put up the
    flap and once more turned the key in the lock.</p>
  <p>Having done this he stood for awhile quite still, his chin buried in his
    hand, his broad shoulders bent, a deep, double furrow between his brows.
    From time to time a deep sigh escaped his lips, and his merry grey eyes almost
    disappeared beneath the heavy frown. Then he seemed to shake himself free
    from his obsession, he straightened out his tall figure and threw back his
    head with a movement of pride and of defiance.</p>
  <p>He took up the candle and started to go out of the room, but on the threshold
    he paused again and looked behind him. The table, the chairs, the bureau
    seemed in a strange weird way to be mocking him&mdash;they looked so placid
    and so immovable&mdash;so stolid in the face of the terrible calamity which
    had just fallen on this house.</p>
  <p>And suddenly Mark with a violent gesture threw the heavy candlestick to
    the ground. The flame flickered as it fell and the taper rolled about gently
    for a while from side to side until it landed close to his feet. He smothered
    a curse and put his heel upon the taper, crushing the wax into a shapeless
    mass; then with a curious groan, half of pain half of bitter irony, he passed
    his hand once or twice across his brow.</p>
  <p>Slowly the glow of wrath faded from his eyes, a look of wonderful tenderness,
    coupled with gentle good-humour and kindliness softened the rugged lines
    of his face. A whimsical smile played round the corners of his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She must be wooed and she must be won,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Mark,
    you lumbering fool, can you do it? You have less than twenty-four hours in
    which...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sighed again and laughed softly to himself, shaking his head dubiously
    the while. Then he went out of the room and closed the door softly behind
    him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    A Divided Duty</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Strange and conflicting were the feelings which ran riot through Lenora&rsquo;s
    soul when she once more found herself alone in her own room. Mortification
    held for a time undisputed sway&mdash;a sense of injury&mdash;of having gone
    half-way to meet she knew not what and having been repulsed. She was quite
    sure that she hated her husband now, far more bitterly than she had ever
    hated any one before&mdash;at the same time she felt relieved that he at
    any rate had no part in the treachery which was being hatched under his father&rsquo;s
    roof.</p>
  <p>One thing, however, gave her an infinite sense of relief. She was going
    back to her father on the morrow. She would leave this house where she had
    known nothing but sorrow and humiliation since first she entered it; above
    all she would never see those people again on whom she had been spying!</p>
  <p>Yes! Spying!</p>
  <p>There was no other word for it; hideous as it was it expressed what Lenora
    had done. Oh! there was no sophistry about the girl. She was too proud, too
    pure to try and palliate what she had done, by shirking to call it by its
    name. She had done a task which had been imposed on her by her King, her
    country, and her father. She had sworn to do it&mdash;sworn it on the deathbed
    of the only man who had ever loved her, the only man whose voice and touch
    had thrilled her, the companion of her childhood, her accepted lover and
    her kinsman.</p>
  <p>She had done it because God Himself through her father&rsquo;s and her King&rsquo;s
    own mouth had ordered her to do it; and it was not for her&mdash;ignorant,
    unsophisticated, sinful mayhap&mdash;to question God&rsquo;s decrees. But
    when she thought back on the events of the past hour, she felt a shudder
    of horror slowly creeping along her spine.</p>
  <p>And she thanked God that He would allow her to leave this house for ever,
    and for ever to turn her back on those whom she&mdash;so unwillingly&mdash;had
    betrayed.</p>
  <p>But she would not allow her mind to dwell on such morbid fancies. There
    was a great deal to be done ere the morning broke. Her task&mdash;if it was
    to be fruitful&mdash;was not completed yet.</p>
  <p>She began by taking down a pair of metal candlesticks which stood on a shelf
    above the hearth and lighting the candles at a small lamp which she had brought
    up with her. These she placed upon the table; then she went to the press
    where only a few hours ago Inez had ranged all her clothes and effects, her
    new gowns and linen. From among these things, she took a flat wallet in which
    were some sheets of paper, a quill and small inkhorn, also some wax for sealing
    letters down.</p>
  <p>She went to her task slowly and methodically, for she was unaccustomed to
    writing letters. In the convent they had taught her how to do it, and twice
    a year she had written to her father&mdash;once on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
    and once on the feast of San Juan&mdash;but the task before her was a far
    more laborious one than she had ever undertaken with pen and paper.</p>
  <p>But she sat down, courageously, to write.</p>
  <p>She wrote an account of everything that she had seen, heard and experienced
    in this house, from the moment when first she left her room in the evening
    in order to seek companionship, until the moment when, having secured the
    packet of papers, she had relocked the bureau with her pass-key and started
    to go back to her room. What she did not set down in writing was her subsequent
    meeting with her husband, for that had no connection with the Prince of Orange
    or with conspiracies, and was merely a humiliating episode in the life of
    a neglected bride.</p>
  <p>The grey dawn slowly creeping in through the leaded glass of her window
    still found her at her task. The candles had burned down low in their sockets,
    their light&mdash;of a dim yellow colour&mdash;fought feebly against the
    incoming dawn. But Lenora felt no fatigue.</p>
  <p>She wrote in a small, cramped hand and covered four sheets of paper with
    close writing. When she had finished, she read all that she had written down
    carefully through, made several corrections in the text and folded the sheets
    neatly together. Then she took from the bosom of her gown the packet of papers
    which she had found in the bureau, put it together with her own writing and
    enclosed everything in a clean sheet of paper carefully folded over. Round
    this she tied a piece of white ribbon, such as she used for doing up her
    hair, and sealed it all down with wax.</p>
  <p>Finally, on the outside of this packet she wrote with a clear hand:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;To don Juan de Vargas at his refidence in Brufsels. To be given unto
    Him with the Seal unbroken in the eyent of My death.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Lenora tired out with emotion and bodily exertion slept soundly for a few
    hours. When Inez came in, in the late morning to wait on her, she ordered
    the old woman to put up a few necessary effects in a small leather valise,
    and to pack up all her things and all her clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father hath need of me for a few days,&rdquo; she said in response
    to Inez&rsquo; exclamation of astonishment. &ldquo;We start this morning
    for Brussels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For which the Lord be praised,&rdquo; ejaculated Inez piously, &ldquo;for
    of all the dull, miserable, uncomfortable houses that I ever was in in my
    life...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, woman,&rdquo; broke in Lenora sharply,  &ldquo;and
    see to your work. You will never be done, if you talk so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Inez&mdash;more than ever astonished at this display of temper on the
    part of a young mistress who had always been kind and gentle&mdash;had perforce
    to continue her mutterings and her grumblings under her breath.</p>
  <p>Whilst the old woman laid out carefully upon the bed all the pretty things
    which she had stowed away in the presses only twenty-four hours ago, Lenora
    busied herself with yet another task which she had set herself, but which
    she had been too tired to accomplish in the night.</p>
  <p>She wrote a short letter to Laurence.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;My DEVOTED FRIEND,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;You promifed Me a very
    little while ago that if ever I wanted You to do fomething for Me, I was
    only to fend You this ring and You would do whatever I afked. Now, in the
    name of Our Lady, I adjure You to leave Ghent at once taking Your Mother
    with You. A grave danger threatens You both. I know that You have relatives
    in Haarlem. I entreat You&mdash;nay! I afk it of You as a fulfilment of Your
    promife to go to them at once with Your Mother. Your Father is in no danger,
    and Mark will be efcorting Me to Brufsels, and I fhall try and keep Him there
    until all danger is paft....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having written thus far, she paused a moment, pen in hand, a frown of deep
    puzzlement and of indecision upon her brow. Then she continued in a firm
    hand:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It is Your Mother&rsquo;s and Your own complicity in the plot which
    is being hatched in Ghent again ft the Duke of Alva which has brought Your
    lives in danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She strewed the sand over her writing, then read the letter carefully through.
    After which she took a ring from off her finger, enclosed it in the letter
    and sealed the latter down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inez!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be starting for Brussels within the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman. &ldquo;I shall not be
    ready with the packing. Why this hurry, my angel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your not being ready, Inez, is of no consequence. I shall start with
    Messire van Rycke. You will follow on in the wagon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my saint...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now do not talk so much, Inez,&rdquo; broke in Lenora impatiently; &ldquo;if
    you add to my anxieties by being quarrelsome and disobedient I shall surely
    fall sick and die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Evidently the young girl knew exactly how to work on her faithful old servant&rsquo;s
    temperament. Inez reduced to abject contrition by the thought that she was
    rendering her darling anxious and sick, swore by every saint in the calendar
    that she would bite off her tongue, toil like a slave and be as obedient
    as a cur, if only her darling angel would keep well and cheerful and tell
    her what to do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not fret about me, Inez,&rdquo; resumed Lenora as soon as
    the old woman&rsquo;s voluble apologies and protestations had somewhat subsided. &ldquo;My
    husband will escort me as far as Brussels, and in my father&rsquo;s house
    little Pepita will wait on me till you come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if that flighty wench doesn&rsquo;t look after you properly...&rdquo; began
    Inez menacingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will make her suffer, I&rsquo;ve no doubt,&rdquo; quoth Lenora
    dryly. &ldquo;In the meanwhile, listen carefully, Inez, for there is something
    that I want you to do for me, which no one else but you can do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For which the Lord be thanked!&rdquo; said Inez fervently. &ldquo;What
    is it, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This letter,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want Messire Laurence van Rycke to have it, after I have gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He shall have it, my saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He may be from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must have it before midday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He shall have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman took the letter with the ring which her mistress held out
    to her, and then only did Lenora feel that she had done all that lay in her
    power to reconcile her duty to her King with her sentiment for those who
    had been kind to her.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>How Lenora spent the rest of the long, wearisome, interminable morning she
    never afterwards could have told you. The very atmosphere around her oppressed
    her well-nigh unbearably. There were the farewells to be said to the family&mdash;to
    the High-Bailiff who was apologetic and obsequious, to Cl&eacute;mence who
    cried, and to Laurence who looked sadly enquiring and reproachful.</p>
  <p>Fortunately Mark had paved the way for these farewells in his usual airy
    and irresponsible manner. It was the Spanish custom&mdash;so he had assured
    his mother&mdash;that brides, after spending twenty-four hours under their
    husband&rsquo;s roof, returned to their parents or guardians for a few weeks.
    Cl&eacute;mence had smiled incredulously when she had heard this&mdash;but
    had allowed herself anon to be persuaded. There were such queer marriage
    customs in different parts of the world these days. (Why! in many parts of
    Germany the bridegroom was, according to tradition, soundly thrashed by his
    friends directly after the religious ceremony&mdash;it was in order that
    he should be prepared for the many vicissitudes of connubial life. And there
    were other equally strange customs in foreign lands.) Spain was a curious
    country&mdash;Cl&eacute;mence was prepared to admit, and ... ah, well! perhaps
    it was all for the best! She had been attracted by the beautiful girl whom
    indeed a cruel fate seemed to have tossed into the very midst of a family
    with whom she had absolutely nothing in common. Cl&eacute;mence had been
    sorry for her in her gentle, motherly way but she had mistrusted her ...
    and just now all Cl&eacute;mence&rsquo;s thoughts were centred on her country&rsquo;s
    wrongs, on the great fight for political and religious liberty which had
    received so severe a blow, and which the noble Prince of Orange was still
    determined to carry on with the help of God.</p>
  <p>And so&mdash;though Cl&eacute;mence cried a little, and though her kind
    heart ached for the young girl who looked so pathetic and so forlorn when
    she bade her good-bye&mdash;she nevertheless felt a sense of relief when
    she remembered all that had been talked of and planned in this house last
    night, and thought of the packet of papers which were locked away with her
    most precious jewels. She kissed the girl tenderly, and spoke of the happy
    day when she would come back to her new home never to leave it again. Lenora,
    pale, like a young ghost, with dark rings under her eyes, and lips that quivered
    with the sobs she was vainly trying to suppress, made an effort to respond,
    and then hurried out of the room. But when she saw Laurence he was alone
    in the hall and she contrived to whisper to him: &ldquo;You remember the
    ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall soon send it you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and ask you to
    do something for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Command me,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;and it shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Then at last the farewells were all spoken and Lenora and her husband started
    on their way. It had rained in torrents all the morning&mdash;therefore departure
    was delayed until long past midday. The wagons for the effects were to be
    round almost immediately, but their progress would be very slow owing to
    the bad state of the roads.</p>
  <p>The road between Ghent and Brussels runs parallel with the Schelde for the
    first two or three leagues. The river had overflowed its banks, and in places
    the road was so deep under water that the horses sank in it almost up to
    their bellies. Everywhere it was fetlock-deep in mud, and more like a ploughed
    field than a chauss&eacute;e owing to the continual passage recently of cavalry
    and artillery.</p>
  <p>Mark and Lenora were travelling alone, which was distinctly unseemly in
    a lady of her rank, but the distance was not great, and Inez had to be left
    behind to finish up the packing, whilst Mark refused to take a serving man
    with him, declaring that the roads were perfectly safe now and free from
    footpads, and that they would surely be in Brussels before nightfall. Lenora,
    who was an absolute stranger in the country and did not know one Flemish
    town from another&mdash;and who moreover had done the journey from Brussels
    to Ghent ten days ago in a covered coach drawn by four horses&mdash;was ready
    to accept any suggestion or any itinerary with the blindness of ignorance.</p>
  <p>She hardly noticed that they seemed to be making very slow progress, nor
    that the sky which had cleared up brilliantly in the early part of the afternoon
    was once more heavily overcast. Mark at first had made one or two attempts
    at cheerful conversation, but since Lenora only answered in monosyllables
    he too relapsed into silence after awhile.</p>
  <p>The flat, monotonous country&mdash;sodden with rain&mdash;looked unspeakably
    dreary to the girl accustomed to the snow-clad vistas of the Sierras and
    the blue skies of Castille. As they left Ghent further and further behind
    them, the country bore traces of the terrible ravages of Alva&rsquo;s relentless
    occupation. Poverty and wretchedness were writ largely upon every tiny village
    or hamlet which they passed: everywhere the houses bore a miserable and forlorn
    aspect, with broken chimneys and shattered roofs, trees cut down to make
    way for the passage of cavalry or merely for the supplying of firewood for
    Alva&rsquo;s army. In the little town of Wetteren through which they passed,
    the houses looked deserted and dilapidated: the people looked ill-clad and
    sullen, and as they crossed the market-place a crowd of beggars&mdash;men,
    women and children in miserable rags&mdash;flocked around their horses&rsquo; heels
    begging for alms.</p>
  <p>So much had Spanish occupation done for this proud country which only a
    very few years ago had boasted that not one of its children ever lacked clothing
    or food. Tears of pity gathered in Lenora&rsquo;s eyes: she, of course, did
    not know that the misery which she witnessed was due to her people, to her
    country and to her King ... and in no small measure to her father. She gave
    the poor folk money and said kindly words of compassion to them. Then she
    turned to Mark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is dreadful,&rdquo; she said na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;to see so much
    misery in the land, when our Sovereign Lord the King does so much for its
    welfare. It is these wretched internal dissensions, I suppose, that are ruining
    the country. Surely all those abominable rebels must see that their obstinacy
    and treachery redounds upon their own kith and kin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ought to see that, oughtn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; was Mark&rsquo;s
    dry and curt comment. And Lenora, chilled by such strange indifference, once
    more relapsed into her former silence.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>When they neared the walls of Dendermonde, Mark announced that his horse
    had cast a shoe. He dismounted, and leading his horse by the bridle he advanced
    to the city gate. Here, however, both he and Lenora were summarily stopped
    by a young provost who demanded to see their papers of identification, their
    travelling permits, and their permit to enter this fortified city.</p>
  <p>To Lenora&rsquo;s astonishment Mark, who was always so good-humoured and
    placid, became violent and abusive at this formality imposed upon him. It
    was in no way different to those which the municipality of Ghent would have
    enjoined on any stranger who desired to enter the city. These had been rendered
    necessary by the many stringent edicts formulated by the Lieutenant-Governor
    against the harbouring of rebels in fortified towns, and all law-abiding
    citizens were in consequence obliged to provide themselves with the necessary
    passes and permits whenever they desired to travel.</p>
  <p>Lenora&mdash;whose ignorance of every law, every formality, every duty imposed
    upon this once free and proud country by its Spanish masters was unbounded&mdash;could
    not quite understand why her husband, who was the son of a high civic dignitary,
    had not taken care that all his papers were in order, before he embarked
    upon this journey. It surely had been his duty to do that, in order to save
    himself and his wife from the humiliation of being thus held up at a city
    gate by an insolent provost, who had the power to make his authority felt,
    and was not sparing of abuse of loutish Netherlanders who were wilfully ignorant
    of the law, or else impudent enough to flout it. An unpleasant quarrel between
    the two men would undoubtedly have ensued and would inevitably have ended
    in disaster for Mark, but for the intervention of Lenora who spoke to the
    provost in Spanish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am this noble gentleman&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; she said haughtily
    in response to an insolent look from the young soldier, &ldquo;and the daughter
    of se&ntilde;or Juan de Vargas, who will make you responsible, sirrah, for
    any inconvenience you may cause me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At mention of the all-powerful and dreaded name, the provost&rsquo;s manner
    immediately underwent a change. At the same time he was not prepared to accept
    the statement quite so unconditionally as Lenora had supposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This noble gentleman,&rdquo; he retorted half-sullenly,  &ldquo;hath
    no papers whereby I can verify the truth of what he asserts. He has none
    whereby he can prove to me that he is the son of the High-Bailiff of Ghent,
    and that you are his wife and the daughter of don Juan de Vargas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have my word for both these assertions, you accursed fool,&rdquo; exclaimed
    Mark hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll make you rue your insolence, you dog of a Netherlander,&rdquo; retorted
    the provost, &ldquo;and teach you how to treat a soldier of the King....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark, I entreat you, not in my presence,&rdquo; broke in Lenora hastily,
    for she saw that her husband&mdash;apparently beside himself with rage&mdash;was
    about to commit one of those foolish and purposeless acts of violence which
    would have resulted for them both in a veritable chaplet of unpleasantness:
    imprisonment in a guard-room, bringing up before a sheriff, interrogations,
    abuse and insults, until the High-Bailiff or her father could be communicated
    with&mdash;a matter probably of two or three days, dependent on the good
    will of the very sheriff before whom they would appear.</p>
  <p>It was positively unthinkable. Lenora could not understand how Mark could
    be so foolish as to lose his temper, when he was so obviously in the wrong,
    nor how he could have been so thoughtless in the matter of the papers.</p>
  <p>She managed by dint of tactful speech and the power of her beautiful personality
    to pacify the wrath of the provost, and to half-persuade him to believe her
    assertion that she was indeed the daughter of don Juan de Vargas. At any
    rate the young soldier was by now sufficiently impressed by the sound of
    that dreaded name to decline any further responsibility in this difficult
    matter.</p>
  <p>He allowed the travellers to pass through the city gates: &ldquo;And to
    remain within the city for two hours,&rdquo; he added significantly; &ldquo;if
    you wish to stay the night, you must obtain permission from the Schout.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mark eased his temper by muttering a few more imprecations under his breath,
    then he seemed content and somewhat pacified, and finally led Lenora&rsquo;s
    horse and his own quietly through the inner fortifications, and thence across
    the Flax Market to the Grand&rsquo; Place.</p>

  <p>Mark established his young wife in the ingle-nook of the <i>tapperij</i> in
    the highly-respectable tavern of the &ldquo;Merry Beggars,&rdquo;  opposite
    the Cloth Hall.</p>
  <p>He enjoined the host and hostess to take every care of the noble lady, and
    then he went off himself in search of a farrier.</p>
  <p>Fortunately at this hour&mdash;it was just three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon&mdash;the <i>tapperij</i> was
    practically deserted. In one corner by the window, two middle-aged burghers
    were playing hazard, in another a soldier was fast asleep. Mine host was
    passing kind; he brought a roomy armchair up to the hearth for the pretty
    lady, threw a fresh log upon the fire, kicked it into a blaze and placed
    a footstool at Lenora&rsquo;s feet. His wife&mdash;a buxom though sad-eyed
    Flemish vrouw&mdash;brought her some warm milk and a piece of wheaten bread.
    Lenora ate and drank with relish for she was both hungry and tired, and when
    she had finished eating, she leaned back in the big armchair and soon fell
    comfortably asleep. She had had practically no rest the night before: her
    nerves were overstrung, and her eyes hot with weeping. There was also a heavy
    load on her heart&mdash;a load chiefly weighted by the packet which was destined
    for her father and which she still carried carefully hidden in the bosom
    of her gown.</p>
  <p>So strange are the contradictions of the human heart&mdash;of a woman&rsquo;s
    heart above all&mdash;that ofttimes to-day as her horse ambled slowly along
    beside Mark&rsquo;s she had caught herself wishing&mdash;hoping&mdash;that
    something unforeseen would occur which would make it impossible for her to
    go to Brussels&mdash;something which would force her to go back to Ghent
    with the contents of that packet still a close secret within her heart. In
    the morning she had watched the skies anxiously, hardly aware that within
    her innermost soul she was hoping that the continuous rains had made the
    roads impassable&mdash;broken down a bridge&mdash;that some sign in fact
    would come to her from God that she was absolved from that awful oath, the
    fulfilment of which seemed indeed an impossible task.</p>
  <p>Then would come a terrible revulsion of feeling: she would remember that
    the Prince of Orange was even now in Ghent, with two thousand men who were
    to be armed by him so that they might fight against their King and threaten
    the life of the Lieutenant-Governor, the King&rsquo;s own chosen representative.
    And she would hate and despise herself for her cowardly irresolution&mdash;her
    very prayer to God appeared like blasphemy&mdash;and she wanted to urge the
    horses forward, she fretted at every delay, for delay might mean the murder
    of the Duke of Alva, and the standard of rebellion hoisted up in triumph
    above the Town House of Ghent.</p>
  <p>Women will understand and pity her&mdash;those at least who once in their
    life have been torn &rsquo;twixt duty and sentiment. Lenora was not one of
    the strong-minded of her sex: she was very young&mdash;a mere girl reared
    in the tranquillity of convent life, and then suddenly thrown into the vortex
    of political intrigue, of cruel reprisals and bitter revolt; and heart and
    mind within her fought a terrible battle which threatened to ruin her entire
    life.</p>
  <p>But in the meanwhile she was sorely in need of rest. The <i>tapperij</i> was
    so quiet and the ingle-nook was rendered quite private by a tall screen between
    it and the rest of the room. The soldier in the corner was snoring with insistent
    monotony, a big blue-bottle droned against the window, and a pleasing glow
    and cheerful crackling came from the fire in the hearth.</p>
  <p>Lenora slept peacefully.</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>When she woke, Mark was sitting as he was so fond of doing on a low stool
    close to the hearth, with one long leg stretched out to the blaze, his elbow
    resting on his knee, his face overshadowed by his hand. Lenora&mdash;even
    as she first opened her eyes&mdash;saw that he was looking at her. A quick
    blush rose to her cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it time to go?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>She was a little startled and looked around her, puzzled and anxious. The
    room had looked so light and cheerful when she had entered it&mdash;two large
    bow windows gave on the Grand&rsquo; Place&mdash;and the weather had remained
    clear and bright. But now it seemed so dark, almost as if twilight was fading
    fast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hour is it?&rdquo; she questioned, and looked about her anxiously
    for a clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he replied airily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But your horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still at the farrier&rsquo;s: he was busy and could not shoe her
    at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am sure that it must be getting late,&rdquo; she said with
    a sudden note of anxiety in her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very late, I am afraid,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then should we not be starting for Brussels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot. I have no horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can hire one, surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in this town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I must be in Brussels by nightfall,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that this is impossible in any case. The powers that
    reign supreme in this town would not&mdash;if you remember&mdash;allow us
    into it, and now they will not allow us out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that is impossible,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;monstrous!...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monstrous, as you say, Madonna,&rdquo; he rejoined with a smile. &ldquo;But
    do you feel equal to scaling the city walls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me that that would be the only thing to do, if indeed you
    desire to be in Brussels this night ... and even then, I doubt but that they
    would bring us back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, Messire,&rdquo; she asked, trying to appear as calm, as detached,
    as he seemed to be, &ldquo;do you mean to tell me that we must spend the
    night&mdash;here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a pretty city...&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That we cannot now start for Brussels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible. The Schout of Dendermonde hath refused to allow us out
    of this city until we have proved to his satisfaction that we are neither
    spies of the Prince of Orange, nor emissaries of the Queen of England.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have seen to it, Messire,&rdquo; she said haughtily, &ldquo;that
    all our papers were in order. This is an exceedingly mortifying and unpleasant
    contretemps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not know the French word for it, Madonna,&rdquo;  he rejoined
    with exasperating good-humour, &ldquo;but I know that it must be somewhat
    unpleasant ... for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She tried to meet his glance, without that tell-tale blush spreading immediately
    over her cheeks: and she could have cried with vexation when she saw that
    the merry twinkle was more apparent in his grey eyes than it had been since
    their wedding day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;that you, Messire, have
    devised this scheme from beginning to end. You neglected your papers purposely&mdash;purposely
    you quarrelled with the provost at the gate&mdash;purposely you have caused
    me to be detained in this miserable city....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A pretty city, Madonna,&rdquo; he interposed imperturbably, &ldquo;the
    church was built three hundred years ago ... the Cloth Hall...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now you are impertinent,&rdquo; she declared hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impertinent,&rdquo; he said quietly, even though the merry, gently
    mocking glance still lingered in his eyes, &ldquo;impertinent because I decline
    to look on the present situation as a tragedy? How can I do that, Madonna,
    since it gives me the opportunity of spending an evening alone with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might have done that yesterday and saved me much humiliation,&rdquo; she
    retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday I was a fool, Madonna,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-day I
    have become a wise man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hath changed you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten minutes of your company in the dining-hall last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no reply, glad enough that at this moment twilight was already
    fading into dusk. In the ingle-nook where they sat, there was hardly any
    light now save the glow of the fire. Anon the buxom, sad-eyed hostess came
    in carrying a lamp which she placed on one of the tables in the <i>tapperij</i>.
    She seemed to know&mdash;by that subtle instinct which pertains to every
    woman&rsquo;s heart&mdash;that the seignior and his noble lady did not wish
    to be disturbed. This was not the busy hour at the hostel: in about an hour&rsquo;s
    time, the soldiers off duty would be coming in, and the shopkeepers from
    their shops after their day&rsquo;s work; but just now there was no one,
    so the kindly old soul having so placed the lamp that a beneficent shadow
    still enveloped the ingle-nook, quietly tip-toed out of the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Several minutes went by before Lenora was able to shake off the curious
    torpor which had fallen over her senses: nor could she in any way account
    for the sweet feeling of well-being which accompanied it. She had made no
    reply to Mark&rsquo;s last words, nor did she make any now. She lay back
    in her chair with eyes half closed, feeling, knowing that he was looking
    at her unceasingly, with that intent, searching gaze of his which she had
    encountered once or twice before. She felt as if he were trying to reach
    her very soul&mdash;he, the careless ne&rsquo;er-do-well, the dissolute frequenter
    of taverns&mdash;what did he care for a woman&rsquo;s soul?</p>
  <p>And yet it seemed impossible for Lenora at this moment to disguise from
    that searching gaze all those terrible conflicts which had literally been
    tearing her heart asunder in the past few hours&mdash;nay, more! it seemed
    as if the very letter which lay inside the folds of her kerchief addressed
    to her father must be lying open before her husband&rsquo;s eyes and that
    he was reading it even now.</p>
  <p>The feeling became akin to a sweet obsession, and gradually she allowed
    her senses to yield themselves to its soothing influence. After all had she
    not been sure that sooner or later God would make His will manifest to her?
    had she not prayed for guidance? had she not hoped all the morning that something
    would prevent her journey to Brussels? Content to leave everything in God&rsquo;s
    hands she had yet hoped that God would point the way to which her own heart
    was tending.</p>
  <p>And now, circumstances had suddenly occurred which did impede the journey&mdash;the
    horse had cast a shoe, the provost at the gate had proved officious, the
    hour had slipped by and no horse was forthcoming.</p>
  <p>Given the absolute simplicity of the girl&rsquo;s religious thoughts, her
    upbringing, the superstition which underlay all beliefs in the old tenets
    of the Church during this period of stress and struggle through which she
    was groping her way through darkness into light: given Lenora&rsquo;s pure
    nature and the proud humility which accepted unquestioningly all the commands
    of those whom she had been taught to reverence, was it to be wondered at
    that while she was quite ready to do her duty, she should nevertheless hope
    and think that she had at last received a distinct, supernatural sign that
    her journey to Brussels was not one of those decrees of God before which
    everything on earth must bow and every obstacle be removed?</p>
  <p>But even then&mdash;in spite of her wishes and her hopes&mdash;she fought
    on to the last and refused to yield to the sweet, insistent call of peace
    and of sentiment. What she took to be a sign from God might easily be an
    insidious machination of the devil. There was a quaint look of gentle amusement
    in Mark&rsquo;s eyes, which was certainly disquieting, and it was just possible
    that it was he who had&mdash;wittingly or unwittingly&mdash;assumed the role
    of a guiding Providence in the matter.</p>
  <p>Therefore she steeled her heart against those subtle whisperings which seemed
    to lure her on every side to give up the fight, to allow herself to drift
    on the soothing wave which even now was carrying her to a haven, where all
    was peace and quietude and where there was neither strife nor intrigue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; she said abruptly and as repellently as she could, &ldquo;I
    pray you enlighten mine ignorance. How many cowardly deeds of this sort stand
    to your discredit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smiled quite unperturbed: &ldquo;You think me an adept?&rdquo; he asked
    quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not ashamed?&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least. What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insulted me at every turn,&rdquo; she said very calmly.  &ldquo;What
    is this detention&mdash;here, alone with you, in this strange town, away
    even from the protection of my own serving wench&mdash;what is it but an
    insult? You have shown me plainly enough, by every means in your power, that
    you had no liking for me. Even last night...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused because tears of humiliation&mdash;which she would have given
    worlds not to shed&mdash;would come to her eyes, and her voice shook in spite
    of every effort which she made at self-control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he entreated, and suddenly he was quite close to
    her, with one knee almost touching the ground, &ldquo;as you are beautiful,
    so will you not be merciful to a miserable wretch, who hath been sorely perplexed
    by all the disdain which you have so generously lavished upon him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Disdain, Messire ... surely I...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he broke in gently, &ldquo;you have every right to
    despise a worthless fellow whom an evil Chance hath given you for husband,
    but have I not been punished enough for daring to accept what the kind goddess
    did offer me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had no thought of punishing you, Messire,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;When
    I stood beside you at the altar, I was a broken-hearted woman to whom Fate
    in the person of a miserable assassin had dealt a cruel blow. I loved my
    cousin, Messire ... oh! I know,&rdquo; she broke in quietly, &ldquo;I ought
    not to speak of this ... it is unseemly and perhaps unkind ... but I did
    love him and he was murdered ... foully, abominably, wickedly murdered ...
    not killed in fair fight&mdash;not openly&mdash;but in a dark passage&mdash;waylaid
    by a brigand ... killed! he! the only man who had ever spoken tenderly to
    me! ... and killed by one of your own people ... a friend of the Prince of
    Orange ... a man whom popular talk hath nicknamed Leatherface.... Oh! I know,&rdquo; she
    added hastily, seeing that instinctively he had drawn away from her and was
    now staring straight into the fire, with a hard expression on his face which
    she could not fathom, &ldquo;I know that you have no hand in these conspiracies
    ... that from indifference rather than loyalty, I believe you have never
    taken up the cause of rebellion against our Sovereign Lord; but tell me,
    Messire, could I&mdash;a young, inexperienced girl&mdash;could I dissociate
    you and yours in my mind from that faction who had sent my kinsman to his
    death? could I come to you with a whole heart, and a soul freed from all
    thoughts of hatred and revenge? I meant to do my duty by you and had you
    but helped me I might have succeeded&mdash;instead of which your coldness
    repelled me. I am of the south, Messire, I am not one of your cold, unemotional
    Netherlanders who can go through life without one thrill of the heart brought
    on by a tender word or a caress. I was in your house but a few hours and
    already my soul was starving&mdash;my heart craved for that which you were
    not able to give.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God forgive me, Madonna,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;for a blind,
    insensate fool!&rdquo; But he did not look at her as he said this, and there
    was a curious dreary tone in his voice so unlike his usual light-hearted
    gaiety. &ldquo;How you must hate us all!&rdquo; he added with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not hate you, Messire,&rdquo; she said so softly that he
    scarcely could hear; &ldquo;your brother Laurence hath been kind to me and
    I know that you take no part in those miserable plots that have treachery
    and assassination for their ultimate goal. As for the Prince of Orange and
    his friends! Yes! I do hate them as I do all pestilential creatures that
    turn on the hand that feeds them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he exclaimed hotly&mdash;and suddenly he was quite
    close to her once again, both her little hands held tightly in his own: his
    eyes had lost all their merriment: they were full of a glowing ardour which
    seemed to penetrate into her very soul. &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;may
    God forgive you, for indeed you know not what you say. Child! child! will
    you think a moment&mdash;are we not human creatures like yourself? do we
    not live and breathe, and eat and love just like you do in Spain? Have we
    no hearts to feel, no eyes to see the misery which our people suffer through
    the presence of a stranger in our land? Would you see a Teuton place his
    iron heel on Spain and on her people? Would you see the Emperor enforce his
    laws, his faith, his ideals upon your kith and kin? Would you stand by whilst
    foreign soldiery swaggered about your cities, outraged your women and plundered
    your homes? Would you rest content if the faith which God hath given you
    was made akin to treachery and to rebellion? The hand that feeds the Netherlands,
    Madonna!&rdquo; he added whilst a bitter, mirthless laugh escaped his lips, &ldquo;nay!
    the hand against which the valiant Prince of Orange hath raised his in vengeance,
    is the hand that hath devastated our land, pillaged our cities and sent our
    people naked and starving out into the world!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gradually while he spoke she had drawn herself away from him, and she would
    have disengaged her hands too, only that he held them so tightly imprisoned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Ramon was murdered, Messire,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;can
    you expect me to forget that?&mdash;and even now&mdash;I would dare swear&mdash;there
    are men who would murder the Duke of Alva if they could ... or my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made no answer to that&mdash;perhaps had she not mentioned her father
    he might have tried to tell her that killing was not always murder, but,
    at times, the work of a justiciary. Ramon&mdash;like the noisome brute that
    he was&mdash;deserved death as no mere ordinary criminal ever had deserved
    it. But how could he tell her that, when in her heart she had evidently kept
    a picture of the man so totally unlike the vile and execrable reality? So
    now he only sighed and remained silent.</p>
  <p>The time had not yet come when this exquisite, tender-hearted girl must
    see the riddles of life solved before her one by one&mdash;when she would
    realise that there is a wider horizon in this world than that which she perceived
    above a convent wall. She had been brought up with ideals, thoughts and aspirations
    that had nothing to do with the great and bitter truths which were proclaimed
    in every corner of this downtrodden land. Her ideas of King and country,
    of duty, of loyalty, must all be shattered by the crude realities of life
    ere upon their ruins she built for herself a purer, holier edifice of faith
    and hope and infinite charity.</p>
  <p>A tender pity for her innocence and her ignorance filled Mark&rsquo;s heart
    and soul, A maddening desire seized him to fold her in his arms and carry
    her away somewhere into a dream-world far away where there were no intrigues
    and no cruelties, no oppression and misery: and yet again he would have loved
    to go with her there where sorrow and poverty were keenest, for he knew that
    her soul&mdash;unbeknown even to herself&mdash;was full of that gentle compassion
    which knows how to alleviate pain just by a look from tear-dimmed eyes, or
    a touch from a gentle hand.</p>
  <p>All that and more his look conveyed to her although he remained silent,
    and she&mdash;by a curious intuition&mdash;knew just what was in his mind.
    The impassioned appeal which he had made to her just now, told her that he
    was not the indifferent ne&rsquo;er-do-well that every one supposed. He felt
    deeply and keenly&mdash;more deeply and keenly mayhap than those men who
    plotted murders at dead of night. He was not a blind follower of the Lieutenant-Governor
    or of her father: he saw the misery under which his people groaned, and his
    careless, detached air obviously hid intense bitterness and resentment.</p>
  <p>But strangely enough, she did not blame him for this. Suddenly she seemed
    to see the whole aspect of this strange country under a new light: the cause
    of the Netherlanders had&mdash;in one instant&mdash;appeared to her from
    a wholly different point of view. Because Mark was their defender and their
    champion she felt that they could not be wholly vile. This, mayhap, was not
    logic, but it was something more potent, more real than logic&mdash;the soft
    insinuating voice of Sentiment which whispered: &ldquo;Would he champion
    that cause if it were base? Would that fiery ardour fill his soul for a cause
    that was unworthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Lenora suddenly felt an overwhelming desire to confide in this one man;
    to place before him all the perplexities which were tearing her soul. Somehow
    she felt that he would help her out of that tangled labyrinth wherein she
    had been groping all night and all day; but shyness held her back. She did
    not know how to broach the subject, how to tell him all about her oath, her
    obedience to her father, what she had done last night, what she thought it
    her duty to do in the future.</p>
  <p>It was all very difficult and Lenora sighed wearily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is so much in what you said just now, Messire,&rdquo; she began
    timidly, &ldquo;that I would like to understand more clearly. I am so ignorant
    ... my life has been so restricted ... I know so little of the world....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me give you a few lessons?&rdquo; he queried softly. &ldquo;There
    are so many mazes in life through which it is only possible to find the way
    by going hand in hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hand in hand?&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I am a stranger in this strange
    land, Messire ... all that I know of it hath been taught me by those who
    have no love for it....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a stranger in this whole world, dear heart,&rdquo; he said
    with a smile. &ldquo;This little bit of Netherlands is but a tiny corner
    of it: its sorrows, its joys, its pain and happiness are but the sorrows
    and happiness of the rest of the world. One day perhaps you will let me take
    your little hand in mine, and then we would go and explore the whole of this
    strange world together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder what we would find?&rdquo; she mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We would find that despite intrigues and cruelty and hatred there
    is much in it that is still beautiful and pure. If we went hand in hand,
    you and I, we would not wander with eyes downcast and seeking in the mud
    for the noxious things which foul God&rsquo;s creation by their presence&mdash;we
    would look upwards, sweet, and see the soft blue of our northern skies, veiled
    as it so often is with silvery mists that hold the entire gamut of exquisite
    colours in their fairy bosoms; we would see the green leaves of the trees
    turn to russet and gold in the autumn, we would see the linnets nesting in
    the bay trees in the spring. There are many beautiful things in this dreary
    world of ours, dear heart, but they can only be seen if two pairs of eyes
    look on them at one and the same time and two pairs of lips whisper together
    in thankfulness to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How strange it was to hear him talking like this&mdash;Mark van Rycke, the
    haunter of taverns and careless profligate. Lenora&rsquo;s eyes, dark, luminous,
    enquiring, were fixed upon him&mdash;and gradually as he spoke his arm stole
    closer and closer round her shoulders as it had done two nights ago in Ghent
    when she had so wantonly turned on him in hatred. Now she felt as if she
    could go on listening to him for hours and hours&mdash;thus alone in this
    semi-darkness with the glow of dying embers upon his face, showing the strong
    outline of cheek and jaw, and the fine sweep of the forehead with the straight
    brows above those kind, grey eyes. She could have listened because she loved
    the sound of his voice, and the quaint, foreign intonation wherewith he spoke
    the Spanish tongue.</p>
  <p>No! of a truth she did not dislike him: certainly she had no cause for hatred
    against him, for what had he to do with traitors or with assassins, he who
    spoke so gently of birds and skies and trees?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will still let me hold this little hand, dear heart,&rdquo; he
    whispered now, speaking so low that in order to hear she had to lower her
    head until his lips were quite close to her ear, &ldquo;we could learn one
    lesson together which God only teaches to His elect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what lesson is that?&rdquo; she asked, feigning not to understand,
    though she knew quite well what the answer would be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That which the nightingale teaches its mate when in May the hawthorn
    is in bloom and the west wind whispers among its leaves. The lesson of love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo; she said with a strange tremour in her voice, &ldquo;the
    world no longer contains love for me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The world perhaps not, dear sweet,&rdquo; he said more gaily, &ldquo;but
    there is a heart beating close to yours now which holds I swear an infinity
    of love for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And once more as he spoke, the same magic spell of a while ago descended
    upon Lenora. It seemed as if for the moment life&mdash;the dreary, wretched
    life of the past few days&mdash;had ceased, and a kind of dream-existence
    had begun. And in this dream-existence she&mdash;Lenora&mdash;was all alone
    with this stranger&mdash;this man whom but a few days ago she had not even
    seen&mdash;who had had no part in her life in the peaceful past when she
    knew nothing of the world beyond the old convent walls at Segovia; yet now&mdash;in
    the dream-existence&mdash;she was alone with him and she was content. Ramon
    was not there&mdash;he had become the past&mdash;all the future for her seemed
    suddenly to be bound up with Mark, and she was content. He had spoken of
    beauty, of skies, of birds and of the gifts of God, and he still held her
    hand, and his arm now was right round her, so that she could feel him drawing
    her closer and closer to him, the while the magic spell worked upon her senses
    and she felt a delicious languor pervading her entire being.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me your lips, sweetheart,&rdquo; he whispered in her ear, &ldquo;and
    I&rsquo;ll give you your first lesson even now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And verily I do believe that Lenora would have yielded here and now&mdash;content
    to leave the great solution of her life&rsquo;s riddle in the omnipotent
    hands of love&mdash;forgetting her oath to her father, the death of Ramon,
    the danger which threatened the Duke of Alva, conspiracies, treacheries,
    rebellion ... everything! What did it all matter? what did the world and
    its intrigues and its politics count beside the insistent, the wonderful
    call of Love?&mdash;the call of man to woman, of bird to bird, to mate and
    to nest and to be happy, to forget the universe in one embrace, to renounce
    the kingdoms of the world in the first blissful kiss.</p>
  <p>For a few seconds Lenora remained quite still, while Happiness&mdash;the
    strange and mysterious elf&mdash;fluttered softly about the room. It hovered
    for awhile above that ingle-nook where two young hearts were mutely calling
    one to another, and it looked down on the beautiful girl with the glowing
    eyes and parted lips who with every fibre of her ardent being and the insistence
    of her youth was ready to capture it....</p>
  <p>And Chance, Fate or its own elusive nature drove it relentlessly away.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>How peaceful was the sleepy little town at this moment when dusk finally
    faded into night!</p>
  <p>The tower bells of the Cloth Hall chimed the sixth hour: outside on the
    Grand&rsquo; Place all had been still save for the occasional footstep of
    a passer-by or the measured tramp of a company of halberdiers on duty.</p>
  <p>And now suddenly that peace was broken, the quietude of the town disturbed
    by piercing woman&rsquo;s shrieks, followed by shouts and curses uttered
    loudly by a rough, masculine voice.</p>
  <p>Mark instinctively jumped to his feet; the cries had become pitiable and
    were multiplied by others which seemed to come from children&rsquo;s throats,
    and the shouts and curses became more peremptory and more rough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Lenora, not a little frightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! the usual thing,&rdquo; replied Mark hastily, &ldquo;a woman
    insulted in the streets, vain protests, rough usage, outrage and probably
    murder. We are used to such incidents in Flanders,&rdquo; he added quietly.</p>
  <p>Already he was half way across the <i>tapperij</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; she queried anxiously, &ldquo;whither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out into the street,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you not hear that
    a woman is in distress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what can you do?&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;the soldiers are there
    ... you cannot interfere ... you, a Netherlander....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I, a Netherlander,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a Flemish woman
    who is calling for help now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to go, and she&mdash;with the same instinct that was moving him&mdash;rose
    too and followed him:&mdash;the same instinct of protection: his&mdash;the
    man&rsquo;s for the woman who was in distress: hers&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s
    for the man who would pit his strength alone against superior numbers. She
    overtook him just as he reached the threshold of the <i>tapperij</i>. Beyond
    it was only the porch, the door of which stood wide open, and beyond that
    the Grand&rsquo; Place; the shrieks and the ever-increasing noise of a scuffle
    came from an adjacent street close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not go, Messire,&rdquo; she said insistently, as with both
    hands she clung to his arms, &ldquo;what can you do? there is a crowd there
    ... and the soldiers....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smiled and tried very gently to disengage his arm from her clinging,
    insistent grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will not be the first time, Madonna,&rdquo; he said with a light
    laugh, &ldquo;that I have had a scuffle with a posse of soldiery ... they
    sometimes mean no harm,&rdquo; he added reassuringly seeing the look of anxious
    terror in her eyes, &ldquo;many a time has a scuffle ended in jollity at
    a few words of common sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, in Ghent,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;where you are known.
    But here! ... where no one knows you ... spies of the Inquisition might be
    about ... if they see you interfering in favour of a heretic or a rebel ...
    or ... Oh! men have been hanged and burned for lesser crimes than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said looking down with a whimsical smile into her flushed
    and eager face, &ldquo;that is part of the benevolent rule which our Sovereign
    Lord the King exercises over the Low Countries!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then seeing that at his flippant words&mdash;through which there rang a
    note of intense bitterness&mdash;her eyes had suddenly filled with tears,
    he murmured tenderly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless you, Madonna, for your sweet thoughts of me! I pray you
    let me go! I&rsquo;ll come back soon,&rdquo; he added while a look of triumph
    flashed up in his eyes, &ldquo;never fear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He ran out quickly into the street.</p>
  <p>She hesitated, but only for a second: the next she had followed him, without
    thought that she had neither hood nor mantle, nor that the unseemliness of
    her conduct would surely have shocked all the great ladies of Spain.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The Grand&rsquo; Place was deserted and dark, only here and there in the
    windows of the Cloth Hall there was a glimmer of light. For a moment Lenora
    paused in the porch peering out into the gloom, trying to trace whence came
    the noise of the scuffle, for Mark had already disappeared: then she ran
    out swiftly, turning to her right from the porch till she reached the corner
    of a narrow street. Here an oil lamp fixed into a wall by an iron bracket
    threw a dim circle of light, beyond which the shadows appeared almost impenetrable.
    It was somewhere in amongst those shadows that a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e between
    shouting soldiers and shrieking women was taking place.</p>
  <p>Up to this moment Lenora had never stopped to reflect as to what she meant
    or wanted to do. Blind instinct had driven her in the wake of Mark, feeling
    that he was in danger&mdash;as indeed he was: a Netherlander these days was
    in himself always an object of suspicion, and interference with Spanish soldiery
    under any circumstances was indeed likely to lead him into very grave trouble.
    If the soldiers were arresting or merely molesting a heretic or a rebel,
    any one who interfered with them would at once fall under the searching eye
    of the Inquisition&mdash;and there was never a lack of spies on such occasions:
    the <i>seven stiver people</i>&mdash;who for that paltry daily sum spent
    their lives in reporting treason, listening for it in every tavern, and in
    every back street of every city.</p>
  <p>But now that she stood here at the street corner, hearing the ever-increasing
    noise of the scuffle close by, hearing the shouts, the cries, the pitiable
    appeals followed by peremptory commands, she realised how miserably impotent
    and helpless she was. Yet she could hear Mark&rsquo;s voice&mdash;speaking
    now in Spanish and now in Flemish, as he tried&mdash;obviously&mdash;to understand
    the situation and to plead for those who were in distress. At first his voice
    had sounded rough and peremptory: indeed Lenora could not help but marvel
    at its commanding quality, then gradually it became cheerful, and its tone
    turned to one of merry banter. The incident indeed was evidently one of those
    which, alas! were so usual in the cities and villages of the Low Countries
    these days: two young women coming home down the dark, back streets from
    some farm or silk-weaving shop where they had been at work, and a posse of
    half-drunken soldiers to whom a Flemish peasant was an acknowledged prey
    for ribald sport.</p>
  <p>The women had resisted and tried to flee: they were pursued and rough horse-play
    had ensued: then they had screamed and the men had sworn, and presently other
    women and children joined in the scuffle while those who were wise stayed
    quietly indoors.</p>
  <p>Horse-play had become a matter of blows followed by threats of arrest and
    dark hints at heresy, rebellion and the Inquisition: the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
    was at its height when Mark interfered. Several blows were still exchanged
    after that, and there was a good deal of swearing and mutual objurgation.
    Lenora, listening, wondered with what skill Mark gradually made those curses
    turn to facetious remarks&mdash;ill-natured at first and uncouth&mdash;then
    more light-hearted, and finally grudgingly pleasant. Within five minutes
    the tumult began to subside: Lenora could hear the women weeping and the
    soldiers laughing quite good-humouredly. How it had all been done she did
    not know: presently from the tramping of feet she gathered that the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
    had broken up: a woman&rsquo;s voice said loudly: &ldquo;<i>Gott vergelte!</i>&rdquo; and
    Lenora thought that indeed God would repay the light-hearted man of the world
    who had by sheer good-humour and compelling personality turned a drama into
    pleasing farce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, friend!&rdquo; she heard a man&rsquo;s voice saying in Spanish, &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know who you are, but a right good fellow; an I&rsquo;m not mistaken.
    Perhaps it was wisest to leave those women alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure of it, friend,&rdquo; quoth Mark gaily, &ldquo;the commandant
    oft makes a to-do about street-brawling, and you might have been blamed and
    got two days&rsquo; guard-room arrest just for kissing a pair of Flemish
    wenches. The game was not worth the candle. Even the devil would have no
    profit in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, mate,&rdquo; retorted the other lustily, &ldquo;come and
    have a mug of ale on it with me and my men at the &lsquo;Duke&rsquo;s Head&rsquo; down
    yonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, friend, but I put up at the &lsquo;Merry Beggars&rsquo; and
    must return thither now. A little later perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, comrade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause during which Lenora made up her mind&mdash;since all tumult
    and all danger had passed&mdash;to go back to that ingle-nook beside the
    fire and there to wait till Mark returned ... to wait so that she might resume
    with him that conversation of awhile ago which had interested her so much.
    But on the point of turning she halted. Three words&mdash;spoken by one of
    the soldiers&mdash;had come to her out of the gloom, and caused her heart
    to stop its beating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are hurt?&rdquo; one man had said&mdash;in a kind, gruff way&mdash;evidently
    in deep concern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Mark replied, &ldquo;a small scratch
    ... in the scuffle just now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you are bleeding....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I am, friend, it won&rsquo;t be the first time in my life.
    I tell you it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; added Mark with obvious impatience. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; came in chorus from the men.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>The measured tramp of booted feet slowly dying away in the distance down
    the narrow street, told Lenora that at last the men had gone.</p>
  <p>But Mark was hurt and she stood waiting at the street corner for she heard
    his step coming slowly toward her.</p>
  <p>He was hurt and had made light of it, but one of the soldiers had remarked
    that he was bleeding and she waited now for him, dreading yet vaguely hoping
    that he was really wounded&mdash;oh! only slightly!&mdash;but still wounded
    so that she might wait on him.</p>
  <p>So strange is a woman&rsquo;s heart when first it wakes from the dreams,
    the unrealities, the fairy-worlds of childhood! With beating heart Lenora
    listened to that slowly-advancing footstep&mdash;how slow it seemed! as if
    it had lost that elasticity which but a few moments ago had carried Mark
    bounding down this same street. Now it dragged and finally came to a halt,
    just as Mark&rsquo;s figure emerged into the shaft of light thrown along
    the wall by the street lamp close to which Lenora was standing.</p>
  <p>She smothered a little cry and ran forward to meet him, for she had seen
    his figure sway, and halt, then lean heavily against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are hurt!&rdquo; she exclaimed, even before she reached him.</p>
  <p>At sound of her voice, he pulled himself together, and in a moment had straightened
    out his shoulders and was walking quite steadily toward her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; he cried in astonishment, &ldquo;what are you doing
    here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I ... I...&rdquo; she murmured, a little ashamed now that she
    met his pleasant, grey eyes fixed so kindly upon her, &ldquo;I heard the
    noise ... I became anxious....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was only a street-brawl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not fit for you
    to witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even now, though he spoke quite firmly, his voice sounded weary and weak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are hurt!&rdquo; she reiterated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurt? No!&rdquo; He laughed, but the laughter died on his lips: he
    had to steady himself against the wall, for a sudden dizziness had seized
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you take my arm,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Can you walk
    as far as the tavern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I can,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;on my honour &rsquo;tis
    a mere scratch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you&rsquo;ll not take my arm,&rdquo; she said peremptorily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    call for help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; he exclaimed gaily. &ldquo;I should be laughed
    at for a malingerer. Shall we return to the tavern, Madonna? and will you
    not take mine arm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held his right arm out to her, but as he did so she noticed that he kept
    the other behind his back.</p>
  <p>She did take his arm, however. It was obviously best&mdash;since he was
    more severely hurt than he cared to admit&mdash;to go at once back to the
    tavern, and dress the wound there with water and clean linen.</p>
  <p>They walked in silence side by side. It was only a matter of an hundred
    yards or so, and after a very few moments they reached the porch of the &ldquo;Merry
    Beggars,&rdquo; and as the buxom hostess was standing there, vaguely wondering
    what had happened to her guests, Lenora at once despatched her off for a
    basin of clean warm water and her very softest linen towels.</p>
  <p>Then she went into the <i>tapperij</i>, and Mark followed her.</p>
  <p>The room was as peaceful, as deserted as it had been awhile ago. The host
    himself had in the interval made up the fire, and it was blazing brightly,
    lighting up the little ingle-nook, with the high-backed chair wherein Lenora
    had sat and the low one drawn so close to it.</p>
  <p>Turning to Mark, she noticed that he still kept his left arm resolutely
    behind his back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our good hostess won&rsquo;t be long with the water,&rdquo;  she
    said, &ldquo;in the meanwhile, I pray you let me tend to your wound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was nothing, Madonna, I entreat you,&rdquo; he said with marked
    impatience, &ldquo;a blow from a halberd caught me on the arm. I scarcely
    feel it now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
  <p>Then as he made no movement to obey, she&mdash;half crying with anxiety,
    and half-laughing with excitement&mdash;ran swiftly round him, and in an
    instant she had hold, of his left hand, and with gentle pressure compelled
    him to yield it to her. He tried to struggle, but the pain in his arm rendered
    it somewhat helpless.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I insist!&rdquo; she said gently, and clung to his hand supporting
    the fore-arm as she did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your sleeve is covered with blood!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is nothing!&rdquo; he persisted obstinately.</p>
  <p>But for the moment she was the stronger of the two. Short of doing her violence
    he could not prevent her from holding his hand with one of hers, and with
    the other undoing the buttons at his wrist; then with utmost gentleness she
    detached the shirt which was sticking to a deep, gaping wound, that stretched
    from the wrist right up to the elbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! but this is terrible!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No blow from a
    halberd could have inflicted such a wound! ... Oh! why does not that woman
    hurry?&rdquo; she added, whilst tears of vexation and impatience rose to
    her eyes. There was nothing to hand wherewith she could staunch the wound,
    even momentarily&mdash;every second was precious!...</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have a knowledge of such matters,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;At
    the convent we tended on many wounded soldiers, when they came to us hurt
    from the wars. This is no fresh wound, Messire,&rdquo; she added slowly, &ldquo;but
    an old and very severe one, dealt not so very long ago ... by a dagger probably,
    which tore the flesh and muscle right deeply to the bone ... it had not healed
    completely ... the blow from the halberd caused it to reopen ... and...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the next words remained frozen on her lips: even whilst she spoke she
    had gradually felt a deathlike feeling&mdash;like an icy hand gripping her
    heart and tearing at its strings. An awful dizziness seized her. She looked
    up&mdash;still holding Mark&rsquo;s hand&mdash;and gazed straight into his
    face. He too was as pale as the dead ashes in the grate&mdash;his whole face
    had become wax-like in its rigidity, only his eyes remained alive and glowing,
    fixed into her own now with a look which held a world of emotion in its depths:
    passionate tenderness and mute appeal, an avowal and a yearning and with
    it all an infinity of despair.</p>
  <p>And she, thus looking into that face which only lived through the eyes,
    saw all around her the narrow white-washed walls of the <i>tapperij</i> fading
    away into darkness. In their stead she saw a narrow passage, dark and gloomy,
    and in its remotest and darkest corner a figure cowered, clad in dark clothes
    from head to foot and wearing a mask of leather upon its face&mdash;the assassin
    waiting for his prey. And she saw Ramon&mdash;handsome, light-hearted, debonnaire
    Ramon&mdash;her kinsman and her lover, standing unsuspecting by. She saw
    it all&mdash;the picture as her father had painted it for her edification.
    The assassin lying in wait&mdash;Ramon unsuspecting. She saw the murder committed
    there in the dark, the stealthy, surreptitious blow. She saw Ramon totter
    and fall&mdash;but before falling turn on the dastardly murderer, and with
    hand already half paralysed by oncoming death, deal him a deep and gashing
    wound ... in the left fore-arm ... with his dagger which tore flesh and muscle
    between elbow and wrist right through to the bone.</p>
  <p>And while she looked straight into his eyes and yet saw nothing but the
    vision of that awful deed, her lips murmured automatically the four accusing
    words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it was you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had not for one second lost his hold upon himself, since that awful moment
    when he realised that she guessed. He had no idea that don Ramon, at the
    point of death, had spoken of the wound which he had inflicted on the man
    who had meted out summary justice to him for his crimes. But now he knew
    that the secret which he would have buried with him in a bottomless grave
    was known to her&mdash;to the woman whom he had learned to love with his
    whole soul. She knew now, and henceforth they must be not only strangers
    but bitter enemies. Nothing&mdash;not even perhaps his own death&mdash;would
    ever wipe away the sense of utter abhorrence wherewith she regarded him now.
    He took his last look of her as one does of one infinitely dear, who sinks
    into the arms of Death.</p>
  <p>He drank in every line of her exquisite face, the child-like contour of
    chin and throat, her alabaster-like skin, the exquisite mouth which he was
    destined now never to touch with his yearning lips. In this supreme moment,
    his love for her&mdash;only just in its infancy&mdash;rose to its full effulgence;
    he knew now that he worshipped her, and knew that never while the shadow
    of her dead kinsman stood between them would he hold her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it was you!&rdquo; she murmured again, and with those fateful
    words pronounced his condemnation and her own indomitable hate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he entreated, speaking with the infinite tenderness
    and pity which filled his heart, &ldquo;will you deign to listen, if I try
    to plead mine own cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But no look of softness came into her eyes: they were glowing and dry and
    unseeing: she did not see him&mdash;not Mark, her husband as he stood there
    now before her&mdash;she saw him cowering in a dark corner, clad in sombre
    clothes and wearing a leather mask&mdash;she saw him with an assassin&rsquo;s
    dagger in his hand and she saw Ramon lying dead at his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then it was you!&rdquo; she said for the third time.</p>
  <p>And he bent his head in mute avowal.</p>
  <p>For a few seconds longer she stood there, rigid and silent: slowly her fingers
    opened and his hand which she had held dropped away to his side. A shudder
    went right through her, she tottered and nearly fell, only saving herself
    by holding on to the corner of the table. He made a movement as if he would
    try and support her, as if he would put his arms around her and pillow her
    against his breast, but with an exclamation of supreme loathing, she drew
    away from him, and with a pitiable cry half of hatred and wholly of misery,
    she turned and fled from the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    Utter Loneliness</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>What happened directly after that, Lenora did not know. Consciousness mercifully
    left her, and when she woke once more she found herself sitting in a small
    room which smelt of lavender and warm linen, beside a fire which burned low
    in a wide-open hearth.</p>
  <p>She opened her eyes and looked enquiringly around her. The room was dark&mdash;only
    faintly lighted by the lamp which hung from a beam in the ceiling. A young
    girl was busy in a corner of the room bending over an ironing board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does the noble lady feel better?&rdquo; she asked kindly but with
    all the deference which those of the subject race were expected to show to
    their superiors.</p>
  <p>She spoke in broken French&mdash;most women and men who served in the inns
    and taverns in the cities of the Low Countries were obliged to know some
    other language besides their own, seeing that the <i>tapperijen</i> were
    frequented by Spanish, French and German soldiery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am quite well, I thank thee,&rdquo; replied Lenora gently, &ldquo;but
    wilt thou tell me where I am and how I came to be sitting here when...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused; for with a rush the recollection of the past terrible moments
    came sweeping back upon her, and it seemed as if consciousness would flee
    from her once again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The noble lady must have felt dizzy,&rdquo; said the girl quietly. &ldquo;Aunt
    sent me in with the warm water for the noble seigneur&rsquo;s wound, and
    I saw the noble lady just running out of the <i>tapperij</i> to the porch
    and then fall&mdash;in a swoon. I was frightened, but the noble seigneur
    ordered me quickly to tie a towel around his wounded arm and then he carried
    the noble lady up here to a nice warm room, where he told me that mayhap
    she should deign to pass the night. Oh! the noble seigneur is grievously
    wounded, he...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, girl,&rdquo; cried Lenora suddenly, for indeed with every
    word the child seemed to be touching an aching place in her heart. &ldquo;No,
    no,&rdquo; she added more gently, seeing that the girl, abashed and not a
    little frightened, had gone back in silence to her ironing-board, &ldquo;I
    did not mean to be unkind ... but ... as thou seest, I am not well. Come!
    tell me what happened after ... after the noble seigneur carried me up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt waited on him, noble lady,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;for
    the wound in his arm bled grievously ... but he was impatient and soon ordered
    her to leave him alone ... then I came up here, and did all I could to bring
    the noble lady round.... I tried vinegar and burned feathers under the noble
    lady&rsquo;s nose ... but I was not frightened ... I knew the noble lady
    would revive ... and the leech lives but two doors off.... We were all of
    us anxious about the noble seigneur ... because of his wound ... and he looked
    so pale and haggard ... so aunt and I soon ran down to him again.... We found
    him sitting by the table ... just sealing down a letter which he had been
    writing. &lsquo;I am going, mevrouw,&rsquo; he says to aunt quite curtly. &lsquo;Take
    thine orders from the noble lady. She will tell thee her own wishes.&rsquo; He
    gave her some money and a letter which he ordered her to give to the noble
    lady as soon as she deigned to wake. And then he took his hat and mantle
    and went out by the porch ... just like that ... all alone ... into the darkness
    ... whither he did not deign to say.... We are just poor people and we did
    not dare to ask, but the wind has sprung up and it hath begun to rain ...
    the night will be rough ... and the noble seigneur is not fit to hold a horse
    with his arm in such a grievous state.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is the letter?&rdquo; asked Lenora curtly.</p>
  <p>From the pocket of her apron the girl produced a letter folded into four
    and sealed down with wax which she handed to the noble Spanish lady with
    a respectful curtsey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aunt told me to give it to the noble lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as
    soon as she deigned to wake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is thine aunt the hostess of this inn?&rdquo; queried Lenora. She
    was fingering the letter, feeling a curious hesitancy and reluctance to read
    its contents, and asked a few idle questions whilst she made an effort to
    control her nerves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! at the noble lady&rsquo;s service,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art of this city, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, so please you. I come from Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From Ghent? What is thy name, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete, so please the noble lady,&rdquo; whispered the girl.</p>
  <p>Then, as the noble lady said nothing more, but sat just quite still with
    the unopened letter in her hand, Grete went back to her ironing-board. Lenora
    watched her mechanical movements for awhile&mdash;a mist was before her eyes,
    and she could not see very clearly, but somehow she liked the look of Grete&mdash;Grete
    who was from Ghent&mdash;whom she would have liked to question further, only
    that when she tried to speak, the words seemed to get choked in her throat.</p>
  <p>All of a sudden, she broke the seal upon the letter and swept away the mist
    before her eyes with an impatient movement of the hand.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he had written, &ldquo;I would not leave You thus
    all alone in this ftrange place, to which an act of folly on My part did
    bring You, but that I read My difmifsal in Your eyes. The fight of me is
    hateful to You&mdash;alas! this I can underftand! By the time You read this,
    I fhall be far away. But anon upon the road I fhall meet the ox-wagon with
    Your effects and Your ferving-woman; it cannot be far from here, as the driver
    had orders to put up in this town for the night. I will fpeed him on as faft
    as He can, and then to-morrow You can continue Your journey in peace, for
    the driver will arrange for an efcort to accompany You as far as Brufsels.
    He will have His orders. In the meanwhile I have ventured to flip a sealed
    packet containing money into the pocket of Your gown: (it was done while
    you lay unconfcious in My arms.) I pray You do not fcruple to take it. The
    money is Yours: a part of Your dowry, an account of which My Father will
    render unto Yours as foon as may be. In the meanwhile You are free to come
    and go or ftay in this town, juft as You were in Brufsels or in Ghent. Your
    pafs and permit as well as Mine were in perfect order; the difpute with the
    Provoft at the gate, the difficulty about the permits, was but a rufe on
    My part fo that I might fpend a time in Your company, under the pretence
    that We were not allowed to continue Our journey to Brufsels. To afk Your
    forgivenefs for this as well as for other graver matters were ufelefs, I
    know. To afk You to erafe the events of the paft two weeks from Your memory
    were perhaps an infult. As for Me I fhall look upon it as a facred duty never
    to offend You with My prefence as long as I live. But I lay Mine undying
    homage at Your feet.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;MARK VAN RYCKE.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The letter dropped into her lap, for awhile she sat, staring straight into
    the fire.</p>
  <p>The girl was putting away her ironing-board and folding away the linen,
    ranging it carefully in the press. Having made the room quite tidy, she asked
    timidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will the noble lady deign to take supper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she had to repeat her question three times at intervals before Lenora
    gave answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said vaguely, like one waking from a dream. &ldquo;Yes!&mdash;No!&mdash;What
    didst say, girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will the noble lady deign to take supper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bring me some milk and bread,&rdquo; replied Lenora, &ldquo;and ...
    can I sleep here to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In this bed,&rdquo; said the girl: and she pointed to the recess
    in the wall, where snow-white sheets and pillows seemed literally to invite
    repose, &ldquo;if the noble lady will deign to be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to rest here,&rdquo; said Lenora with a woe-begone
    little sigh, &ldquo;for I am very tired. Anon a wagon will be here with my
    effects and my serving woman. Send her to me directly she arrives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice was absolutely toneless and dull: she spoke like one who is infinitely
    weary, or in utter hopelessness: but the girl, whose kind heart ached for
    the beautiful lady, did not dare to offer comfort. She prepared to leave
    the room in order to fetch the frugal supper. Lenora turned her head once
    more toward the fire: her eyes caught sight of the letter which still lay
    in her lap. With a sudden fierce gesture she picked it up, crushed it between
    her fingers and threw it into the flames.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>A few minutes later Grete came back carrying a tray with fine wheaten bread,
    a jar of milk, and some fresh cheese, her round young face beaming with benevolence
    and compassion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the noble lady will deign to eat,&rdquo; she said, as she put
    the tray down upon the table, &ldquo;the noble lady will feel less weary
    ... and then, as soon as the ox-wagon arrives with the serving woman, the
    noble lady could go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait one moment,&rdquo; said Lenora, as the girl once more prepared
    to go, &ldquo;I want a courier&mdash;now at once&mdash;to take an urgent
    message as far as Brussels. Can you find me one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are four butchers in the town, noble lady, who deliver all
    the messages for three or four leagues round. Uncle can go and see if one
    of them is inclined to go.... But the night is very rough....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will give the man who will take my message to Brussels this night
    five golden ducats,&rdquo; said Lenora peremptorily.</p>
  <p>Grete opened her eyes wide with astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five golden ducats!&rdquo; she exclaimed ecstatically. Of a truth
    the poor trading folk of Dendermonde had never seen quite so much money all
    at once and in the same hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I doubt not but that Michel Daens, the butcher, at the sign of the &lsquo;Calf&rsquo;s
    Head&rsquo; in the Meerhem, will be glad to earn the money. And he hath a
    very strong horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell your uncle, child, to go at once to him: and to give him
    this letter, which he is to deliver without fail before ten o&rsquo;clock
    this night.&rdquo; From the bosom of her gown she drew the letter which she
    had written during the previous night, and handed it to the young girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The letter,&rdquo; she added slowly, &ldquo;is for Messire don Juan
    de Vargas, chief of the Council of His Highness the Lieutenant-Governor.
    He lodges in Brussels at the sign of the &lsquo;Blue Firmament,&rsquo;  over
    against the Broodhuis. Let your uncle explain to Michel Daens, the butcher,
    that if this letter is not delivered before ten o&rsquo;clock this evening,
    he will be made to suffer the severe penalty imposed by the law on all those
    who neglect to do their duty to the State. Take the letter, child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed, this last peremptory order was necessary, for Grete, hearing to
    whom the letter was addressed, hardly dared to touch it. Indeed there would
    be no fear that Michel Daens would fail to execute the noble lady&rsquo;s
    commands with punctuality and utmost speed. The name of don Juan de Vargas
    was one that would make any man fly to the ends of the earth if ordered so
    to do. A message or letter to or from him would of a surety be delivered
    punctually, even if the heavens were on the point of falling or the earth
    about to open.</p>
  <p>To Grete the name meant something more than that: it was the dreaded symbol
    of an awful reality&mdash;a reality which for her had meant the terrors of
    that awful night, when the Spanish officer threatened and insulted her and
    Katrine, when death or outrage stared them both in the face, and the awful
    catastrophe was only averted by the interference of the mysterious Leatherface.</p>
  <p>So she took the letter which was addressed to one who was even greater,
    even more to be feared than the Spanish officer; she took it with a trembling
    hand as she would some sacred symbol: then she curtseyed and went out of
    the room.</p>
  <p>Lenora rose and followed her into the passage, where she stood listening
    until she heard Grete calling to her uncle and aunt. The three of them then
    spoke together in Flemish which Lenora hardly understood; but she caught
    the names Michel Daens and Messire don Juan de Vargas, and then the words
    spoken very emphatically by Grete: &ldquo;Before ten o&rsquo;clock this night.&rdquo; Then
    she went back to her room, and closed the door softly behind her.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>So, then, the die was cast. There was an end to all the irresolution, the
    heart-achings, the tearing of soul and nerves upon the rack of doubt and
    indecision. Hopeless misery and deathly bitterness filled Lenora&rsquo;s
    heart now.</p>
  <p>She had been fooled and deceived! Fooled by soft words and cajoling ways,
    by lies and treachery: and she had very nearly succumbed to the monstrous
    deceit.</p>
  <p>Fool! fool! that she was! She reiterated the word aloud over and over again,
    for there was a weird pleasure in lashing her pride with the searing thongs
    of that humiliating memory. Had not God Himself intervened and torn the mask
    from the traitor&rsquo;s face she might even now be lying in his arms, with
    the kiss of an assassin upon her lips! A shudder of loathing went right through
    her. She shivered as if stricken with ague, and all the while a blush of
    intense shame was scorching her cheeks.</p>
  <p>Fool! Fool!</p>
  <p>She had stood with her father beside the dead body of her lover&mdash;her
    lover and kinsman&mdash;and there she had registered an oath which a few
    cajoling words had well-nigh caused her to break. Surely the dull, aching
    misery which she was enduring at this moment was but a very mild punishment
    for her perjury.</p>
  <p>She had allowed Ramon&rsquo;s murderer to cajole her with gentle words,
    to lull her into apathy in the face of her obvious duty to her King and to
    the State. He had played the part of indifference when all the while he&mdash;above
    all others&mdash;was steeped to the neck in treason and in rebellion! He!
    the spy of the Prince of Orange! the hired assassin! the miserable cowardly
    criminal! And she had listened to him, had sat close beside him by the hearth
    and allowed his arm to creep around her shoulders ... the arm which had struck
    Ramon down in the dark ... the arm&mdash;she no longer doubted it now&mdash;which
    would be hired to strike the Duke of Alva, or her own father with the same
    abominable treachery.</p>
  <p>Oh! the shame of it! the hideous, abominable shame! He had guessed last
    night that she was on the watch, that she had seen and heard the odious plotting
    against the life of the Lieutenant-Governor: he had guessed, and then&mdash;by
    tortuous means and lying tongue&mdash;had sought to circumvent her&mdash;had
    lured her into this city&mdash;and then, by dint of lies and more lies and
    lies again, had hoped to subdue her to his will by false kisses and sacrilegious
    love.</p>
  <p>And she had been on the point of sacrificing her country&rsquo;s needs and
    the life of the Duke of Alva to the blandishments of a traitor!</p>
  <p>Oh! the shame of it! The terrible, burning shame!</p>
  <p>But God had intervened! ... At least of this she could have no doubt. All
    day she had prayed for an indication from above&mdash;she had prayed for
    guidance, she had prayed for a sign, and it had come! Awesome, terrible and
    absolutely convincing. God, in unmasking the one traitor who had well-nigh
    touched her heart, had shown her plainly that her duty lay in unmasking them
    all! Traitors! traitors! every one of them! and God had given her an unmistakable
    sign that He desired to punish them all.</p>
  <p>Did she neglect those signs now she would be the vilest traitor that ever
    defiled the earth.... It had all been so clear.... The m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
    in the streets ... Mark&rsquo;s interference&mdash;the blow from the halberd
    which had reopened the half-healed wound ... his momentary weakness and her
    sudden vision of the truth! ... Thank God it was not too late! The meeting
    was to be held this night at the house of Messire Deynoot the Procurator-General
    ... the Prince of Orange and all the other rebels would make the final arrangements
    for taking up arms against the King and murdering or capturing the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
  <p>This meeting, at any rate, she&mdash;Lenora&mdash;had frustrated. Mark of
    a surety had already warned the conspirators, before he started on the journey&mdash;and
    Laurence too after he received her letter.... The meeting of a certainty
    would be postponed. But even so, and despite all warnings, the band of assassins
    could not escape justice. Her letter would be in her father&rsquo;s hands
    this night: in a few hours he&mdash;and through him the Lieutenant-Governor&mdash;would
    know every phase of the infamous plot which had the murder of His Highness
    for its first aim&mdash;they would know the names of the two thousand traitors
    who were waiting to take up arms against the King&mdash;they would know of
    William of Orange&rsquo;s presence in Ghent, of his recruiting campaign there,
    of the places where he kept stores of arms and ammunition.</p>
  <p>All that she had set forth clearly and succinctly&mdash;omitting nothing.
    Oh! her father would know how to act! He would know how to crush the conspiracy
    and punish the traitors!</p>
  <p>Would he also know how to lay his powerful hand on the mysterious Leatherface
    ... the man of dark deeds and cruel, treacherous blows ... the murderer of
    Ramon de Linea&mdash;the one whom others paid to do the foul deeds which
    shunned the light of day...?</p>
  <p>Lenora leaned back against the cushions of her chair. Physical nausea had
    overcome her at the thought of all that she had done. She had served the
    King and had served the State! She had undoubtedly saved the life of the
    Duke of Alva, and therefore rendered incalculable service to her country
    ... she was the means whereby a band of pestilential traitors and rebels
    would be unmasked ... and punished ... and among these she must reckon Mark
    van Rycke ... her husband.... Oh! him she hated with a real, personal hatred
    far stronger and more implacable than that wherewith she regarded&mdash;impersonally&mdash;all
    the enemies of the King. He seemed to her more cruel, more cowardly, more
    despicable than any man could be! ... Yes! she had done all that, and now
    her one hope was that she might die this night&mdash;having done her duty
    and kept her oath, and then been left unutterably lonely and wretched&mdash;in
    hopeless desolation.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The night was rough, as Grete had foretold. Gusts of wind blew against the
    window-frames and made them rattle and creak with a weird and eerie sound.
    The rain beat against the panes and down the chimney making the fire sizzle
    and splutter, and putting out the merry little tongues of flame. Lenora drank
    some milk and tried to eat the bread, but every morsel seemed to choke her.
    She went to the window and drew aside the thick curtains and sat in the seat
    in the embrasure&mdash;for she felt restless and stifled. Anon she threw
    open one of the casements.</p>
  <p>The rain beat in against her face and bare neck, but this she did not mind;
    she was glad to cool her head and face a little. The Grand&rsquo; Place looked
    gloomy and dark; most of the lights in the Cloth Hall opposite were extinguished&mdash;only
    in a few windows they still glimmered feebly. Lenora caught herself counting
    those lights: there were two small ones in the dormer windows at the top,
    and one in a tall window in the floor below, and right down on a level with
    the street the main door stood wide open and showed a long, shallow streak
    of light. One! two! up above! they looked like eyes! Then one in the middle
    that was the nose&mdash;all awry and out of the centre!&mdash;and below the
    long mouth&mdash;like a huge grin! And the roof looked like a huge hat with
    the tower like a feather! The more Lenora looked into those lights opposite,
    the more like a grinning face did they seem, until the whole thing got on
    her nerves, and she started laughing! laughing! ... She laughed until her
    sides ached, and her eyes were full of tears! she laughed though her head
    was splitting with pain, and the nerves of her face ached with intolerable
    agony. She laughed until her laughter broke into a sob, and she fell forward
    with her hands upon the window sill, her burning forehead upon her hands,
    the rain and wind beating upon her head, her neck, her back; her hair was
    soon wet through; its heavy strands fell away from the pins and combs that
    confined them and streamed down like a golden cascade all about her shoulders,
    the while she sobbed out her heart in misery and wretchedness.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>The clock of the Cloth-Hall tower chimed the ninth hour. Lenora raised her
    head and once more peered out into the night.</p>
  <p>Nine o&rsquo;clock! If Michel Daens had done his duty, he must be more than
    half-way to Brussels by now. It almost seemed to Lenora&rsquo;s supersensitive
    nerves at this moment that she could hear the tramp of his horse&rsquo;s
    hoofs upon the muddy road&mdash;Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Surely, surely she
    could hear it, or was it her own heart-beats that she was counting?</p>
  <p>Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! Two horses, each with a rider, were speeding along
    the road: one to Brussels&mdash;Michel Daens the butcher-messenger, bearing
    the letter for don Juan de Vargas which would raise in its trail a harvest
    of death for traitors ... and along the road to Ghent Mark speeding too,
    to warn those traitors to remain in hiding&mdash;or to flee while there was
    yet time&mdash;for justice was on their track. Mark had gone to Ghent, of
    this Lenora was sure; she had burned his letter, but she remembered its every
    word. He spoke of meeting the ox-wagon which was on its way from Ghent! besides
    which, of course, he was bound to go back. Was he not the paid spy of the
    Prince of Orange&mdash;his mentor and his friend?</p>
  <p>And mentally Lenora strained her ears to listen ... to hear which of those
    two riders would first reach his destination. And as she listened it seemed
    as if that monotonous hammer! hammer! was beating against her heart, and
    with every blow was crushing to death more of her life, more of her youth
    ... and all her hopes of happiness.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>Inez&mdash;tired out with the jolting of the wagon, wet to the skin, fagged
    and cold&mdash;found her mistress still sitting by the open window, with
    streaming hair and eyes glowing as with inward fever. The devoted soul very
    quickly forgot her own discomfort in view of her young mistress&rsquo;  sorry
    plight. She chafed the ice-cold hands and combed the dripping hair; she took
    off the heavy gown, and the leather shoes and silk stockings. She bathed
    the hot brow and little cold feet, and finally got Lenora into bed and had
    the satisfaction of seeing her smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There now, my saint,&rdquo; she said cheerily, &ldquo;you feel better,
    do you not? I tell you when I met Messire van Rycke and he told me that you
    were here and that we were to get to you at once, I nearly swooned with fright
    ... I wanted to ask him a dozen questions ... but he had ridden away out
    into the darkness before I could speak a single word....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The pillow was fresh and smelt sweetly of lavender. Lenora had closed her
    eyes and a sense of physical well-being was&mdash;despite heart-ache and
    mental agony&mdash;gradually creeping into her bones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you meet Messire van Rycke, Inez?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! a long way from here, my saint. We did not start from Ghent till
    four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and have been jogging along at foot-pace
    ever since. Oh! these interminable roads, and horrible, jolting wagons! It
    was about two hours ago that we came on Messire van Rycke riding like one
    possessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was riding toward Ghent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Toward Ghent, my saint. And as I told you&mdash;as soon as he had
    given Jan his orders, he flew by like the wind. The roads were quite lonely
    after that. I tell you, my saint, I was passing glad that we had a good escort&mdash;two
    mounted men you know rode beside the wagon&mdash;or I should have been mightily
    afraid of malefactors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You gave the sealed packet to Messire Laurence van Rycke,&rdquo; asked
    Lenora, &ldquo;as I had directed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gave him the packet two hours after you had started.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said nothing, my saint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a weary sigh, Lenora turned her head away. She kept her eyes closed
    resolutely, and after a while Inez thought that she slept. So she tip-toed
    quietly out of the room, having drawn the coverlet well over her mistress&rsquo; form.
    She left the lamp in the room, for she had enough understanding to know that
    Lenora was perturbed and anxious, and in times of anxiety darkness is oft
    an evil counsellor.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Book3"></a>Book 3 - Ghent</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Reprisals</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>It is to the seigneur de Vaernewyck&mdash;that excellent and faithful chronicler&mdash;that
    we are indebted for the most detailed account of all the events which occurred
    in the city of Ghent during those few memorable days in October.</p>
  <p>The weather, he tells us, had been perpetually rainy, and the days were
    drawing in rapidly, for it was then the 19th of the month, and what with
    the sky so perpetually overcast it was nearly dark when close upon five o&rsquo;clock
    in the afternoon the ensigns of the companies of Walloon soldiery first entered
    the city by the Waalpoort. They demanded admittance in the name of the King,
    the Regent and the Lieutenant-Governor, and the guard at the gate would certes
    never have ventured to refuse what they asked.</p>
  <p>At first the townsfolk were vastly entertained at seeing so many troops;
    nothing was further from their mind than the thought that these had been
    sent into the city with evil intent. So the gaffers and gossips stood about
    in the streets and open places staring at the fine pageant, and the women
    and children gaped at the soldiers from the windows of their houses, all
    in perfect good humour and little dreaming of the terrible misery which these
    soldiers were bringing in their train into the beautiful city of Ghent.</p>
  <p>No one thought of civil strife then.</p>
  <p>In the forefront marched men and young boys who carried javelins in their
    hands and had round shields swung upon their arm; these shields were bordered
    with a rich fringe of crimson silk and they glittered like steel in the damp
    atmosphere. After these men came a company of halberdiers from the garrisons
    of Mechlin and Alost, and they looked splendid in their striped doublets,
    their plumed bonnets slung behind their backs, their enormous boots reaching
    half-way up their thighs. In the midst of them rode the Master of the Camp
    on his cream charger; the ends of his crimson and yellow scarf, soaked through
    with the rain and driven by the wind, flapped unremittingly against his steel
    cuirass, whilst the plumes on his felt hat hung&mdash;bedraggled&mdash;into
    his face.</p>
  <p>Then came the arquebusiers, marching five abreast, and there were several
    thousands of them, for it took half an hour for them all to cross the bridge.
    These were followed by a vast number of elegant foot-soldiers carrying their
    huge lances upon their shoulders, well-armed, magnificently accoutred, their
    armour highly polished and richly engraved and wearing gauntlets and steel
    bonnets. Finally came three companies of artillery with culverines and falconets
    and with five wagons, and behind them the massed drummers and fifers who
    brought up the rear playing gay music as they marched.</p>
  <p>The troops assembled on the Kouter which was thronged to overflowing with
    gaffers and idlers. Everyone was talking and jesting then, no one had a thought
    of what was to come, no one looked upon these gaily-decked troops with any
    sinister prescience of coming evil. They were nearly all Walloons, from the
    provinces of Antwerp and Brabant, and many of them spoke the Flemish tongue
    in addition to their own&mdash;and when after inspection they stood or walked
    at ease on the Kouter, the girls exchanged jests and merry sallies with them.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Two hours later the Duke of Alva entered the city. It was a very dark night,
    but the rain had left off. The Lieutenant-Governor had a company of lancers
    with him, and these were Spanish, every man of them. One hundred torch-bearers
    accompanied the Duke and his escort and they had much difficulty in keeping
    their torches alight in the damp night air; the flames spluttered and sizzled
    and the men waved the torches about so that sparks flew about in every direction
    to the grave danger of the peaceable citizens who were in the foremost ranks
    of the crowd.</p>
  <p>It was to be supposed that the High-Bailiff and Sheriffs of the city had
    been warned of the arrival of His Highness, for they met him at the Waalpoort,
    attired despite the threatening weather in their magnificent civic robes.
    The Duke who rode a black charger paused just inside the gates and listened
    in silence to the loyal address which these dignitaries presented to him.
    The sizzling torches threw a weird, unsteady light upon the scene, distorting
    every form into a grotesque shape, half-concealing, half-illumining the stern
    face of the Lieutenant-Governor draped in his velvet robe.</p>
  <p>When the loyal address had been duly presented, and further speeches of
    welcome delivered by the senior sheriff and by the Schout, the Lieutenant-Governor
    demanded that the keys of the city be within the hour brought to him on the
    Kouter where he would be inspecting the troops. This demand greatly astonished
    the sheriffs and aldermen, but they did not dare to raise any objections
    and promised that they would most dutifully comply with His Highness&rsquo; request.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With my commands,&rdquo; the Duke corrected them curtly.</p>
  <p>Nor would he dismiss the grave seigneurs, but kept them kneeling there before
    him in the mud, until they had humbly assured him that they would execute
    his commands.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the Duke proceeded to the Kouter.</p>
  <p>The troops had been aligned for his inspection, and a very gay and gaudy
    throng they looked in the flickering torch-light. All the houses round the
    Place were lighted up from within by now, and crowds thronged in from all
    the side streets. It was many years since Ghent had seen so gay a sight.
    There were three hundred torch-bearers on the parade ground by now, each
    with huge resin torches, and so brightly illumined was the Place that you
    could have deciphered a letter out in the open just as easily as you would
    in daylight. Lances and halberds held erect formed a shimmering background
    to the picture like a forest of straight tall stems, and their metal heads
    glimmered like little tongues of fire, throwing out strange and unexpected
    flashes of light as the men moved who held them.</p>
  <p>In the centre of the picture the Duke of Alva on horseback. The endurance
    of the man was absolutely wonderful! He had ridden all the way from Brussels
    that day&mdash;starting at daybreak&mdash;a matter of nine leagues and more.
    He had tired two horses out, but not himself&mdash;and he was a man of sixty.
    The chronicler goes on to tell us that the Duke&rsquo;s face looked grim
    and determined, but not fatigued, and in his prominent eyes under their drooping
    lids was a glitter like steel&mdash;hard and cruel and triumphant too.</p>
  <p>He held the reins of his charger with one hand, the other was on his hip.
    He wore a felt hat which he had pulled down upon his brow, and a huge cape
    of dark woollen stuff lined with purple silk which covered his shoulders
    and fell right round him over his saddle-bow. A group of cavaliers surrounded
    him in fantastic multi-coloured doublets and hose, all slashed and pinked,
    and enormous bonnets covered with gigantic plumes, and behind these stood
    the standard bearers. The autumn wind had caught the folds of the huge ensigns
    which were grouped in half dozens close together, so that the great folds
    interlocked from time to time and spread themselves out like a monster moving,
    waving mass of crimson and yellow with the devices of the companies embroidered
    thereon in black and silver.</p>
  <p>It was indeed a fine and picturesque spectacle, arranged with a view to
    making it impressive and to strike awe into the hearts of the citizens. The
    civic dignitaries had returned by now, and the High-Bailiff had brought the
    keys of the town upon a velvet cushion. He and the ten sheriffs and the Schout,
    the fifteen Vroedschappen who were the city councillors and the Schepens
    who were the aldermen all approached the Lieutenant-Governor with back nearly
    bent double in their loyalty and humility.</p>
  <p>But when they were within speaking distance of the Duke they all had to
    kneel&mdash;just as before&mdash;in the mud and the dirt. The Master of the
    Camp was there to direct them and they had not the pluck to resist. Then
    the High-Bailiff was made to advance alone with the cushion in both his hands
    and upon the cushion the keys of the city, and he was made to kneel close
    to the Duke&rsquo;s stirrup and humbly present him with the keys.</p>
  <p>The Lieutenant-Governor said curtly: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well!&rdquo;  and
    ordered the chief gentleman of his body-guard to take possession of the keys.
    Then he said in a loud voice so that every one could hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gates of this city shall be closed this night, and will so remain
    until such time as the order which I am about to give to the inhabitants
    is complied with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a prolonged roll of drums; and the gentleman of the bodyguard
    rode away from the Place with a company of halberdiers, and he carried the
    keys of the city with him. He was going to close the gates of the city as
    the Lieutenant-Governor directed.</p>
  <p>When the roll of the drums had died away there was a moment&rsquo;s silence
    on the huge overcrowded Kouter through which you might have heard a thousand
    hearts beating in sudden deathly anxiety. Here then was no ordinary pageant,
    no mere display of soldiery and of arms such as the Spaniards were overfond
    of. Something momentous was about to happen which in these days of perpetual
    strife and continuous oppression could but mean sorrow and humiliation to
    this proud city and to her freedom-loving children. The High-Bailiff and
    the Schout and the town councillors were all kept kneeling, though they were
    elderly men most of them, and the ground was very damp; and the people crowded
    in all round the soldiers, as near as they could, in order to hear what His
    Highness wished to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Citizens of Ghent,&rdquo; he began in his harsh and strident voice
    which could be heard from end to end of the Kouter. &ldquo;It has come to
    my knowledge that William of Nassau Prince of Orange is dwelling in this
    city, and that, contrary to the ordinance of our Sovereign Lord the King,
    he hath attempted to levy troops within these gates for an unlawful purpose.
    Those who have thus in defiance of all law and order enrolled themselves
    under a standard of rebellion and have taken up arms against our Sovereign
    Lord and King will be dealt with summarily. But in the meanwhile understand
    that any one who henceforth harbours under his roof the said William of Nassau
    Prince of Orange, or assists or aids him to leave this city, is guilty of
    rebellion, and will be punished with death. Understand also that it is my
    desire that the person of the Prince of Orange be delivered unto me within
    forty-eight hours at the Kasteel where I shall be lodging, and that I have
    ordered that the gates of the city be closed until the expiration of that
    time. And finally understand that if within forty-eight hours the person
    of William of Nassau Prince of Orange is not delivered unto me, then will
    the whole city of Ghent be guilty of treason and rebellion, and every man,
    woman and child in it will be punishable with death; and the town itself
    will be dealt with as summarily as were Mons and Valenciennes and Mechlin.
    God bless our gracious and merciful King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He raised his hat and lifted his face up to heaven, and his lips were seen
    to move as if in prayer. The Master of the Camp gave the signal for a huge
    and prolonged roll of drums which echoed from end to end of the Kouter and
    into every corner of the city, and all the soldiers set up a lusty shout
    of &ldquo;God bless our Sovereign Lord and King!&rdquo; But the people were
    silent. No one uttered a word, no one joined in the shouting. Men looked
    at one another with scared, wide-open eyes; the boldest had become as pale
    as death. Some of the women swooned with terror, others broke into terrified
    sobs; even the children realised that something very terrible had occurred;
    they clung weeping to their mothers&rsquo; skirts.</p>
  <p>The Lieutenant-Governor, having spoken, wheeled round his horse and rode
    slowly across the Kouter closely surrounded by his bodyguard and his torch-bearers.
    Just then, so Messire de Vaernewyck assures us, the wind, which had been
    very boisterous all the evening, suddenly dropped, and the air became very
    still and strangely oppressive. A few huge drops of rain fell making a loud
    patter upon the steel bonnets and cuirasses of the soldiers, and then a streak
    of vivid lightning rent the black clouds right out over the Leye and a terrific
    clap of thunder shook the very houses of the city upon their foundation.
    The Duke of Alva&rsquo;s horse reared and nearly threw him; there was momentary
    confusion, too, among the bodyguard. Those who were devout Catholics promptly
    crossed themselves; those who were superstitious at once saw in that curious
    and unexpected phenomenon a warning from God Himself.</p>
  <p>Then the rain came down in torrents and speedily dispersed the crowd. The
    civic magistrates and councillors were at last able to struggle to their
    feet&mdash;most of them felt cramped from the lengthy kneeling. They assembled
    in groups and whispered with one another; the townsfolk looked on them with
    eyes full of anxiety; it was to them that the poorer people must look for
    help in this awful calamity which threatened them all.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>After the Lieutenant-Governor and his cort&egrave;ge had left the Kouter
    the soldiers broke ground and ran wild throughout the city. No special lodgings
    had been allotted to them, but apparently they had been told that they could
    quarter themselves where they listed. They began by taking possession of
    the covered markets&mdash;and this could easily have been tolerated; but
    many of them raided the houses of peaceful citizens in a manner most unseemly
    and often brutal, making terrible noise and confusion throughout the city.
    They treated the owners of the houses as if the latter were nought but menials
    and they themselves the masters of the place; so much so indeed that several
    families left their homes in the possession of these soldiery, and took refuge
    with relations who had not been thus inflicted.</p>
  <p>Terror and misery had rapidly spread throughout the city. There were many
    who had not heard the proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor, and when the
    rumour reached them that numbers of soldiers were billeted in the town they
    made preparations for immediate flight. Some even went so far as to load
    all their furniture and effects upon wagons, ready to go out of the city
    this very night&mdash;for they remembered how five years ago when first the
    Duke of Alva&rsquo;s troops were quartered in Ghent, how abominably they
    had behaved toward all the citizens&mdash;robbing, looting, and pillaging,
    for all the world as if they were bands of brigands, rather than disciplined
    soldiers.</p>
  <p>Great was the terror and consternation of those who wanted to flee now when
    they understood that all the city gates were closed and that no one would
    be allowed to go through them until the Prince of Orange, who was said to
    be in Ghent, was delivered over to the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
  <p>This was indeed a terrible state of things and one destined to strike hopeless
    terror in the hearts of most, seeing that hardly any one inside the city
    knew aught of the Prince of Orange or of his comings and goings, and yet
    they were liable to be punished for treason in which they had had no share.</p>
  <p>And in the meanwhile the soldiers ran riot throughout the city&mdash;even
    though, with much ostentation, a great deal of to-do and much beating of
    drums, their provosts read out at the four corners of the city a proclamation
    forbidding all looting and marauding, and enjoining the men under pain of
    hanging to take anything from the citizens without paying for it.</p>
  <p>This proclamation was of course a mere farce, for the soldiers, despite
    the lateness of the hour, had at once raided the butchers&rsquo;, bakers&rsquo;,
    and other provision shops, and though they professed to pay for everything
    they took, they refused to give more than one sou for a pound of meat, and
    then they cut out all the bone, and threw it back in the face of the wretched
    butcher who tried to argue with them.</p>
  <p>And all the while remember that these men were not Spaniards; they were
    Walloons of the provinces immediately adjacent to the two Flanders, and their
    kith and kin had also grievously suffered from Spanish arrogance and oppression.
    But what will men not do for money or under compulsion&mdash;or mayhap under
    that abject fear which the very name of Alva had brought forth into the heart
    of people who had once been so proud and so independent? The Seigneur de
    Vaernewyck puts it on record that in his opinion the employing of Walloon
    troops to check the so-called revolt of Ghent was an act of refined cruelty
    on the part of the Duke. He liked to pit brother against brother, kinsman
    against his own kind. He had cowed the Flemings and the Walloons to such
    an extent that now at last he could use one against the other, and could
    rely on each side being more cruel and relentless through that extraordinary
    perversion of human nature which makes civil strife so much more brutal and
    horrible than any war between the nations.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
    My Faithful Watch-Dog</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Some two hours later&mdash;in a long, low, vaulted room which was the refectory
    of the convent of the Sisters of St. Agneten&mdash;some two thousand men
    were assembled. They sat on wooden benches all round the two huge, horseshoe-shaped
    tables at which the Sisters were wont to take their meals. The room was situate
    on the ground floor of the convent building, and a row of low, groined windows
    ran the whole length of one of the walls; heavy curtains hung before all
    the windows, and porti&egrave;res were drawn over the doors at either end,
    both in order to deaden all sound and to prevent all light from showing without.
    Tallow candles burned in tall pewter candelabra at intervals upon the tables.</p>
  <p>The bulk of the men who were there were young&mdash;or at any rate still
    in the prime of life, strong and well-knit in figure&mdash;the sort of men
    whom any leader would be glad to enrol as soldiers under his banner; but
    there were others among them who were grave and elderly&mdash;like Messire
    Deynoot, the Procurator-General, and the Baron van Grobbendock, chief financial
    adviser on the Town Council. Messire Pierre van Overbeque, Vice-Bailiff of
    Ghent, was also there, as well as Messires Lievin van Deynse, the wealthy
    brewer at the sign of the &ldquo;Star of the North&rdquo; in the Nieuwpoort,
    Laurence van Rycke, son of the High-Bailiff, and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric van
    Beveren, wardmaster of the Guild of Armourers; and there were a good many
    others&mdash;gentlemen of substance and consideration in the town.</p>
  <p>At this moment every one of those two thousand men were keeping their eyes
    fixed upon one who alone was standing under the dais at the end of the refectory
    where the abbess of the convent usually had her place. This portion of the
    room was raised two steps above the rest, and standing there, the man who
    thus held the attention of all the others looked abnormally tall, for he
    was dressed in doublet and hose of some dark stuff which clung to him like
    a skin. His high boots reached well over his thighs, his head was closely
    shrouded in a hood, and his face was hidden by a mask, made of untanned leather&mdash;which
    left the mouth only quite free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Highness the Prince of Orange, whom may God protect,&rdquo; he
    was saying in a loud, clear voice which rang out from end to end of the room, &ldquo;was
    fortunately able to furnish me with all your names and places of abode. With
    the help of Messire van Deynse, who lent us his horses, and Messire Laurence
    van Rycke and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric van Beveren, who gave me their assistance,
    we were able to communicate with you all during the night and warn you of
    the imminent danger which hung over your heads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was well done, friend Leatherface,&rdquo; said Messire Deynoot, &ldquo;so
    well, indeed, that we are all ready and willing to place ourselves under
    your guidance and to accept you as our leader, for of a truth we know not
    what we must do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would to God,&rdquo; said the man whom they called Leatherface, &ldquo;that
    I could do more for you than the little which I have done. To each of you
    last night I gave the same warning: &lsquo;Danger is nigh! terrible! imminent!
    for our plans are discovered and the presence of the Prince of Orange in
    Ghent known to the Duke of Alva! Let all those who wish to do so leave the
    city at once with their wives and children, for death and torture threatens
    those who remain!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Lievin van Deynse, the wealthy
    brewer, quietly, &ldquo;not one of us hath followed this portion of your
    advice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are all brave men and noble sons of Flanders,&rdquo;  quoth Leatherface
    earnestly. &ldquo;His Highness is proud of you, he believes in you, he trusts
    you. A cause which has such men as you for its champions and defenders is
    assured of victory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A murmur of satisfaction went round the room, and Leatherface resumed after
    a little while:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, with the help of God, the precious person of the
    Prince of Orange is safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A hearty cheer&mdash;quickly suppressed&mdash;greeted this announcement
    from every side. &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; continued Leatherface, &ldquo;I
    could not persuade His Highness to leave the city early this morning. He
    would not believe in the danger which was threatening him.... He would not
    believe that his plans and his presence here had been betrayed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! betrayed!&rdquo; now said one of the younger men vehemently, &ldquo;and
    by whom? Dost know by whom, friend Leatherface?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And all around the tables, grimly set lips murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom? My God! by whom were we betrayed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Laurence van Rycke&rsquo;s glowing eyes were fixed upon the man under
    the canopy as if he would have torn the mask from off his face and read in
    those mysterious eyes the confirmation of his own horrible fears.</p>
  <p>And Leatherface, looking straight into Laurence&rsquo;s pale and haggard
    face, said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By one who hath already paid the full price for all the misery which
    that betrayal will bring in its wake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; came in awed yet eager query from most of them there.</p>
  <p>Leatherface bent his head, but gave no direct reply, and all of them there
    were satisfied, for they believed that the faithful and wary watch-dog&mdash;justiciary
    as well as guardian angel&mdash;had discovered the betrayer, and had killed
    him, making him pay the &ldquo;full price&rdquo; for all the misery which
    he had brought about. Only Laurence hung his head and dared not ask any more.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;And now tell us about the Prince,&rdquo; urged Messire van Overbeque,
    the Vice-Bailiff. &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well on his way to Br&uuml;gge, please God,&rdquo; replied the man
    with the leather mask. &ldquo;All day I had entreated him to go, but he refused
    to listen. &lsquo;You dream of treachery,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;and
    see it where none exists!&rsquo; I spent the day scouting as far as Melle
    and Wetteren, for I felt that nothing would convince him but actual facts.
    At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the advance courier arrived from Alost.
    Luckily, his horse was less swift than mine. I managed to gain on him and
    brought in the news of the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s arrival to His Highness half
    an hour before the commandant of the garrison knew of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even then it might have been too late,&rdquo; quoth one of the listeners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It very nearly was,&rdquo; retorted Leatherface light-heartedly. &ldquo;Had
    the Lieutenant-Governor sent advance orders that his arrival be kept a secret
    until his troops passed through the city gates, the Prince of Orange would
    still be in Ghent at this hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed Laurence van Rycke, &ldquo;and what
    did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Highness donned doublet and hose of common buffle and pulled
    a tattered felt hat well over his eyes, as did also the Count of Hoogstraaten
    and young Count Mansfeld. I made myself look as like a draper&rsquo;s assistant
    as I could, and then the four of us joined the crowd. The rumour of the Duke&rsquo;s
    coming had spread all over the city; there were plenty of gaffers about.
    All round by the Waalpoort they abounded, and as the twilight slowly faded
    into dusk the approaches to the gate were densely packed. No one was allowed
    to loiter round the guard-house or upon the bridge, but there were many who,
    with overwhelming loyalty, desired to greet the Duke of Alva even before
    he reached the confines of the city. That was our opportunity. The commandant
    at the Waalpoort happened to be in rare good humour; he thought the idea
    of meeting the Lieutenant-Governor and his troops some way outside the city
    an excellent one. He allowed those who wished, to go across the bridge. The
    Prince of Orange, his two friends and I were merged in that crowd, and no
    one took notice of us. Directly we reached Meirelbeke we struck across the
    fields. In ten minutes we left the crowd a long way behind us, and had skirted
    the town as far as Wondelghem. We were in no danger then, but His Highness
    was greatly fatigued. There was a difficulty too about getting horses; young
    Count Mansfeld was footsore and the Count of Hoogstraaten perished with thirst.
    In short, it was six o&rsquo;clock before we had the horses ready, and I
    had the satisfaction of seeing the Prince safely started on his way. When
    I returned it was close on eight, and the city gates had all been locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a light, good-humoured laugh, and one of the men asked: &ldquo;Then
    how did you get in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swam and I scaled the walls,&rdquo; he replied simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But ... how?&rdquo; asked another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I swim like a fish and climb like an ape....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But were you not seen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! and shot at ... but the Spaniards are bad shots and ...
    I am here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again he laughed gaily, light-heartedly like a &rsquo;prentice after an
    escapade, and the two men who sat nearest him&mdash;the Procurator-General
    and the Baron van Groobendock&mdash;surreptitiously took hold of his hand
    and pressed it warmly.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;So much for the past, seigniors,&rdquo; resumed Leatherface, after
    awhile: &ldquo;my duty is done. I leave the planning of the future to wiser
    heads than mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; quoth the Vice-Bailiff emphatically. &ldquo;Have we
    not said that we want you to lead us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; retorted the other gaily. &ldquo;What do I know of leadership?
    I am only His Highness&rsquo; watch-dog. Let me follow a leader and bear
    my share in the present trouble. I am not fit to command....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A murmur went round the room, and the Procurator-General rejoined earnestly: &ldquo;The
    men will obey no one but you. Take off your mask, friend, and let us all
    look upon the face of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have all despised me too much in the past to heed my counsels
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you spoke a lie, man,&rdquo; said Messire van Deynse, the brewer. &ldquo;We
    have all honoured the man whom we called Leatherface, as the bravest amongst
    us all. We do not know who you are&mdash;we only know you as a gallant gentleman
    to whom next to William of Orange himself we owe every triumph which our
    cause hath gained over our execrated tyrants. Therefore I pray you to unmask
    and let us know at least to whom&mdash;next to God Himself&mdash;we owe the
    life of the noble Prince of Orange, and also to whom we must look in future
    for guidance and leadership.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more the murmur went round the room: words of warm approval came from
    every side, whilst among the younger men the cry was raised and repeated
    insistently: &ldquo;Unmask!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unmask!&rdquo; cried Laurence van Rycke. &ldquo;Be you criminal or
    ne&rsquo;er-do-well in the eyes of others, you are a hero in our sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unmask! unmask!&rdquo; they reiterated unanimously.</p>
  <p>The man with the leather mask then advanced to the very edge of the platform,
    and, putting up his hand, he asked for silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seigniors,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I am your servant and will do
    as you wish. I have told you that I am no leader and am not fit to command
    ... yet you choose to honour me, and this is no time for false humility and
    the diffidence which is the attribute of cowards. But&mdash;despite your
    gracious choice of me as your leader in this terrible emergency&mdash;will
    you ere you finally decide to follow me hear from me what plan I should pursue,
    and to what heights of self-sacrifice I would ask you to rise in the face
    of the awful calamity which threatens our city. Seigniors,&rdquo; he continued,
    and indeed now save for the ring of that deep-toned voice, so great was the
    silence in the vast refectory that every heart-beat might have been heard, &ldquo;you
    have heard the decree of our tyrant. Unless we deliver to him the precious
    person of our noble Prince, the whole city will be delivered over to the
    brutal soldiery, who will pillage our houses, desecrate our churches, murder
    and outrage our wives, our mothers and our children&mdash;just as they did
    in Mons, in Valenciennes and in Mechlin. Seigniors, we are men&mdash;all
    of us here&mdash;and at thought of what awaits us and our fellow-citizens
    our very heart blood seems to freeze with horror. It is of our women that
    we must think and of our children! Thank God that the Prince knows nothing
    of this decree&mdash;which hath been framed by the most inhuman monster the
    world hath ever known&mdash;or of a certainty he would have gone straight
    to the Kasteel and given up his precious life to save our fellow-citizens.
    Seigniors, what the Prince would have done, we know; and as he would have
    acted, so must we be prepared to act. But before I parted from him, I had
    his advice on the plan which I now beg leave to place before you. On my word
    of honour, seigniors, he approved of it in its entirety, and much that I
    will submit to you anon hath been framed under his guidance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused awhile and through the holes in the mask his glowing eyes searched
    the faces of his listeners with a masterful glance that was both challenging
    and appealing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every one of us here,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;is, I know,
    ready to sacrifice his life for faith, for freedom and country, and ere we
    give in to the monstrous tyranny which hath planned the destruction of our
    city we must fight, seigniors, fight to the death, fight for every inch of
    our ground, fight for every homestead which we would save from outrage. Death
    awaits us all anyhow, then at any rate with God&rsquo;s help let us die fighting
    to the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more he paused in order to draw breath, even whilst from every side
    there came emphatic words of enthusiasm and of approval. He held his hearers
    now in the hollow of his hand; they were unemotional, stolid men for the
    most part, these Flemish burghers and patricians&mdash;men who throughout
    the terrible oppression under which they had groaned for over fifty years
    had grimly set their teeth and endured where others had fought&mdash;because
    reason and common sense had shown the futility, the irreparableness of the
    conflict&mdash;but they were men, too, who, once roused to action, would
    never give in until they had won their fight or had been destroyed to the
    last man of them; and with that inspiring prophet standing there before them,
    stirring their sluggish blood with his ringing voice, some of that same determination
    began to creep into their bones which had animated valiant Orange and his
    brothers and his Dutch followers to carry on the struggle for freedom at
    all costs and with the last drop of their blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight with you and under your standard, friend,&rdquo; said
    the Procurator-General who was the spokesman of the others. &ldquo;We are
    well armed....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! ye are well armed,&rdquo; rejoined Leatherface triumphantly. &ldquo;The
    guild of armourers are with us to a man; and we have been able to supplement
    our secret stores with all the treasure in the magnificent armoury which
    Messire van Beveren has placed at our disposal in the name of his guild.
    Aye! we are well armed and well manned! There are two thousand of us, seigniors,
    and our numbers will be doubled before noon to-morrow. The Duke hath brought
    ten thousand soldiers with him! well! it will be a three-to-one fight; but
    if we were still more completely outnumbered we would still carry on the
    struggle, seeing that the lives of our children and the honour of our women
    are at stake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can fight,&rdquo; murmured one of the older men, &ldquo;but we
    cannot conquer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! we cannot conquer,&rdquo; said Leatherface earnestly. &ldquo;We
    must perish, because might is greater than right, unless God chooseth to
    perform a miracle&mdash;and I, for one, still believe that He will. But we
    must not weaken our determination by reckoning childishly on divine interference.
    If we fight, we fight because we refuse to die like cowards, because we refuse
    to go before our Maker shamed at having allowed our homes to be devastated,
    our women outraged, our children massacred without striking a blow&mdash;however
    futile&mdash;in their defence. We fight then, seigniors?&rdquo; he added
    exultantly. &ldquo;Is that your decision?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was not one dissentient voice. Old and young, grave and gay, prudent
    and hot-headed, every man there was ready to follow the leader of their choice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For freedom, faith and country!&rdquo; cried Leatherface loudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For freedom, faith and country,&rdquo; came from two thousand panting
    throats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As to our plan of campaign,&rdquo; now resumed the man with the mask
    as soon as silence and calm was restored once more, &ldquo;I have not yet
    had the time to think on all the details soberly. But the main outline of
    it was dictated to me by the Prince of Orange even whilst we halted at Wondelghem,
    waiting for horses. He is the finest military strategist the world hath ever
    known, misfortune hath pursued him, but hath not impaired his marvellous
    powers of command. I will ask some of you, seigniors, to aid me with your
    counsels, and with the directions which His Highness hath given me we may
    yet give such a fine account of ourselves as will force our tyrants to treat
    with us for peace. There are only two thousand of us now; by to-morrow we
    can reckon on several thousands more; but of a certainty at the first clash
    of arms all our young and able-bodied fellow-citizens will take heart and
    join us in our desperate struggle, and may God help us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There is no doubt that he had enflamed the blood of his hearers; by the
    dim light of the tallow candles every face now looked flushed, every pair
    of eyes glowed with the noble fire of patriotism and of courage. Leatherface
    waited for a time in silence while whispered conversation and discussion
    became general. He did not join in it himself, but stood somewhat apart from
    the others, the cynosure of all eyes, a strange, almost mysterious figure
    in his tightly-fitting clothes which gave full play to the powerful muscles
    of arms and thighs and displayed the great breadth of shoulder and depth
    of chest. Many there were who still eyed him curiously; Laurence van Rycke
    in particular did not take his eyes off him, but no one thought of challenging
    him again to unmask. What mattered what the face was like, when the heart
    was so great and fine?</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>After a few minutes the man with the mask once more advanced to the edge
    of the platform. There was still something that he wished to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must not forget, seigniors,&rdquo; he began very quietly, &ldquo;that
    the tyrant hath given us a respite of forty-eight hours before he will embark
    on his hellish work of destruction. He hath demanded the person of the Prince
    of Orange as the price of his mercy. Well, seigniors, the Prince, thank God,
    is no longer here; but it is just possible that we may bribe the wild beast
    yet into satisfaction by giving him some of the blood for which he thirsts,
    and thus save our beautiful city from all the horrors which he hath in contemplation
    against her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how wilt do that, friend?&rdquo; sighed, Messire van Overbeque
    despondently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With your permission I will explain,&rdquo; rejoined the other. &ldquo;I
    propose that anon in the early morning a certain number of you seek out the
    Duke of Alva in Het Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel and tell him that the Prince
    of Orange&mdash;aided by his humble watchdog&mdash;did succeed in evading
    once again the trap which had been set for him; but,&rdquo; he continued
    with slow and deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;that you are prepared to deliver
    into his hands the person of the man Leatherface, since you happen to know
    his whereabouts in the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment he could not continue, loud and vehement protestations against
    this monstrous proposal arose from every side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you, seigniors, to remember,&rdquo; he continued with deep
    earnestness as soon as the tumult had subsided, &ldquo;that a certain amount
    of mystery hath hung&mdash;not through mine own seeking, believe me&mdash;around
    my person. Next to our Prince himself, there are few in this unfortunate
    country whose death would be more welcome to our Spanish tyrants than that
    of the miscreant Leatherface; and my belief is that if you offered to give
    him up to the Lieutenant-Governor you might obtain from that cruel despot
    a small measure of mercy for our city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had long since finished speaking, but now there were no longer any protestations
    or murmurs; an awesome silence hung about the vaulted room. No one had stirred;
    no one spoke; not one man dared to look his neighbour in the face. Every
    man stared straight before him at that slim figure, which suddenly appeared
    to them all, to be unearthly as it stood there, beneath the canopy, like
    the very personification of simple self-sacrifice, offering up his life so
    willingly, and above all, so cheerfully to save his fellow-men.</p>
  <p>In these days of cruel oppression and of sublime virtues, such an act of
    abnegation was probably not rare; men were accustomed to suffer death and
    worse for an ideal, and for the sake of others who were weaker than themselves;
    but there was something so engaging, so light-hearted in that stranger there
    that every man who heard him felt that by sacrificing such a man he would
    be sending a brother, a son, or dear friend to the gallows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, seigniors,&rdquo; said Leatherface, &ldquo;I still await your
    decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You speak glibly, friend,&rdquo; murmured the Procurator-General
    sombrely, &ldquo;but if the tyrant hath you in his power, it will not only
    mean death for you, remember, it will not mean the axe or the gallows, it
    will mean the torture-chamber of the Inquisition first and the stake afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; retorted the other simply. &ldquo;Better men
    than I have gone through it all for faith and freedom. I am young, &rsquo;tis
    true&mdash;but I have no ties of interest or affection that bind me to this
    earth. Few men will go to their Maker so little regretted by kith or kin
    as I shall be. So I pray you do not think of me. Rather turn your thoughts,
    I entreat, to the details of the plan, the composition of the deputation
    that would be prepared to meet the Duke of Alva to-morrow. Those posts, too,
    will be full of danger, and the negotiations, too, might fail&mdash;what
    is the life of one man worth when weighed in the balance with an entire city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And which of us would you entrust with the abominable errand?&rdquo; queried
    Laurence van Rycke abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not you, of a certainty,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Your mother
    will have need of comfort and protection, since she refused to place herself
    in safety. Messire the Procurator-General should, I think, lead the deputation,
    he hath never been suspected of heresy or rebellion, and the proposal would
    thus come quite naturally from him; if Messire van Overbeque will join him
    and you, Seigneur van Groobendock, meseems that we could not choose better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! I cannot do it,&rdquo; interposed the Vice-Bailiff vehemently. &ldquo;I
    would sooner cut off my right hand now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you sooner sacrifice this city, all the women and children,
    your own wife, Messire, and daughters, rather than one man whose identity
    you need never know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was indeed a terrible puzzle, one which even these brave men found it
    hard to solve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you, seigniors,&rdquo; continued Leatherface earnestly, &ldquo;to
    do what I ask. Nay!&rdquo; he added resolutely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do more.
    Just now you chose me as your leader. Then I command you to act in accordance
    with my will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are quite determined, then?&rdquo; asked the Vice-Bailiff.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you counsel me to waver?&rdquo; retorted the other.  &ldquo;Ah,
    seigniors!&rdquo; he added, with that ringing note in his voice which was
    so inspiring to them all, &ldquo;I entreat you do not grieve for me. Rather
    grieve for yourselves and gather courage for your errand. So help me God,
    yours will be no easy task. You will have to fawn and to cringe before the
    tyrant whom you hate. You will have to bear his arrogance and the insolence
    of his menials. You will have to swallow your wrath and to bend your pride.
    Your sacrifice indeed will be far harder to make than mine. I only offer
    mine own unworthy life; you will offer up to-morrow your dignity, your manhood,
    all that you and your fathers hold so dear. Nay! I would not change places
    with you for ten such worthless lives as mine. See, what a coward I am&mdash;I
    send you to do this abominable errand, while I sit at home in comfort and
    dream of the happiness of giving my life for Ghent and for her children!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God help us all!&rdquo; murmured Messire Deynoot, the Procurator-General.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, He alone can do that,&rdquo; rejoined Leatherface, &ldquo;for
    grave fears assail me that our proposal will be rejected; is it likely that
    it would appeal to such a blood-thirsty tyrant as the Duke of Alva? My one
    hope&mdash;and that alas! is a slender one&mdash;is that he hath it not in
    his mind to destroy our beautiful city, and might be glad of an excuse of
    exercising mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A groan of execration greeted this suggestion. Was it likely that any thought
    of mercy could ever enter the mind of such a man?&mdash;more cruel than any
    beast of prey, for he killed for the mere sake of killing, inflicted inhuman
    tortures on innocent victims for the sake of gloating over their sufferings,
    and rejoiced in bloodshed and outrage and desecration for their own sakes,
    without any thought of benefiting himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then if these negotiations fail, seigniors,&rdquo;  concluded Leatherface
    finally, &ldquo;nothing will be left for us but a bitter struggle which may
    end in defeat, but which will leave us proud and unconquered still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen to that,&rdquo; said the Procurator-General fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then let us go quietly to our homes to-night. Let us keep from those
    who are weak and anxious all knowledge of that which we have resolved; let
    our women pray while we prepare to act. Flemish women have hearts of steel;
    they will not waver when the hour comes. They will help us with their prayers
    now, and load our arquebuses for us when we need them. For them we will fight
    and for our children, and if defeat stares us in the face at the last, then
    will we save them by one supreme act from falling into the hands of the tyrant.
    Until then and after, seigniors, allow me to keep this mask upon my face.
    When you go to meet the Duke of Alva to-morrow, you will offer him a paltry
    chattel, a man whom you do not know, who hath no name, no identity, the spy
    of the Prince of Orange&mdash;just him whom you call Leatherface.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God reward you,&rdquo; they murmured fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps He will,&rdquo; whispered the man with the mask, under his
    breath, &ldquo;and with a speedy death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as the hour is late, let us disperse.
    To-morrow, here, and at this hour, we meet again. Messire Deynoot will give
    you a report of his audience with the tyrant, and I may be lucky enough to
    be allowed to give my life for this city which I love. Farewell, seigniors,
    may God guard you until then. If Alva will have none of me, then I will have
    the honour of leading you&mdash;to victory, I hope&mdash;to death if God
    wills!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One by one they rose from the benches where they had been sitting, and all
    took what they believed to be a last farewell of that strange man whose identity
    was still unknown to them, yet whom they had all learned to love as a leader
    and as a friend. Indeed, their noble hearts were torn asunder by the awful
    alternative which he himself had placed for them. It was a case of grim determination,
    of smothering every call of Sentiment which might prove insistent against
    thus sacrificing a brave man to the cruel lust of an abominable tyrant. It
    had to be, and these men were fine and great enough in themselves to understand
    that in offering up his life to save his fellow-citizens, Leatherface had
    certainly chosen the better part.</p>
  <p>And having looked their last on him, they went out through the postern gate
    of the convent of St. Agneten in groups of twos and threes. They crossed
    the two bridges that span the Leye at this point. The night was dark, and
    this was an isolated part of the city, situate far from the Stadthuis and
    the Kouter. From the St. Baafs and St. Nikolas quarters of the city came
    faintly echoing across the river the sound of riotous merriment proceeding
    from those buildings and houses wherein the Walloon soldiery had installed
    themselves. But the men who had just pledged themselves to fight a losing
    battle against overwhelming odds paid no heed to what went on around them.
    They glided noiselessly through the dark and narrow streets; some went to
    right, some to left, some to north and others to south, and quietly regained
    their homes.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>But in the vast refectory two men had remained behind after every one else
    had gone: they were the man with the mask, and Laurence van Rycke.</p>
  <p>The latter had waited in silence whilst the whole of the assembly filed
    out by the door, but when Leatherface in his turn prepared to go, Laurence
    threw him such a look of appeal, that after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation,
    he too decided to wait.</p>
  <p>Then when the last of the assembly had gone, Laurence tried to speak, but
    the words died in his throat ere they reached his quivering lips. There was
    still that look of mute appeal in his eyes, and of well-nigh unendurable
    mental torment in every line of his haggard face, and suddenly he gave a
    cry like some wounded creature in mortal pain; he fell on his knees against
    the table, and burying his face in his hands, he sobbed like a child. The
    other waited patiently and silently until the paroxysm was over: his mouth
    beneath the mask looked set but kindly, and his eyes through the holes in
    the leather were fixed upon the stricken man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is safe from the vengeance of our people,&rdquo; he said, as
    soon as he saw that Laurence had momentarily regained his self-control. &ldquo;Is
    that what troubles you, Messire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurence&mdash;already ashamed of his tears&mdash;had struggled to his feet.
    He passed his hand across his moist forehead and through his unruly hair,
    and tried to look Leatherface valiantly between the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Partly that,&rdquo; he said resolutely. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not
    speak of her. It was she then who betrayed us all?&rdquo; he added with another
    heartbroken cry.</p>
  <p>To this Leatherface made no answer, and Laurence continued more calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was of the lists I wish to speak. The papers which His Highness
    entrusted to my care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went to look for them after ... after she left the house, and found
    that they had gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew that we were betrayed ... then ... there ... at once ... and
    by her ... an exquisite woman, Messire, whom I ... Oh! it was horrible!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed, and even now a look that was almost like death came over his wan
    cheeks and hollow eyes.</p>
  <p>Then once more he resumed quietly: &ldquo;For a few moments the blow of
    this awful discovery completely stunned me. I could neither think nor act.
    My first coherent thought was to consult with my mother as to what had best
    be done. How to find His Highness until evening I knew not, or how to obtain
    duplicate lists, so that I could run round the town and warn all our followers
    of the terrible danger that threatened them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not think of flight? ... for your mother, I mean?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreated my mother to leave the city at once, but she refused
    to go, and we were standing face to face with one another and the terrible
    calamity that had befallen us all when Pierre came in with a letter, which&mdash;he
    said&mdash;was given to him in the open street by a man whom he did not know.
    The letter, I take it, came from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;I was afraid that you might
    do something rash, and raise the alarm before it was necessary. The lists,&rdquo; he
    added, &ldquo;are quite safe. I was able after His Highness left the High-Bailiff&rsquo;s
    house last night to extract them from the bureau, where I did not feel that
    they were over safe; in their place I put a packet containing fictitious
    lists of men who do not exist, and places of abode which are not to be found
    in this city. It is these which have been sent to se&ntilde;or de Vargas.
    I had just time to scribble these and to place them in a conspicuous place
    in the bureau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You used a false key then?&rdquo; queried Laurence in bewilderment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not a spy of the Prince of Orange?&rdquo; retorted the other
    with a quaint little laugh, &ldquo;and are not all spies provided with means
    of forcing secret locks? Here are the lists,&rdquo; he added, as from inside
    his doublet he half drew the packets of papers. &ldquo;When you are called
    to account for them, you can return them without fear. No one will know that
    they ever left your care ... that is, if you have not spoken of it before
    now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I had not the heart. We all knew that we were betrayed. You warned
    us all and took measures to convene us here to-night; but until the hour
    when your letter warned me that for the moment all was well, I endured mental
    torments such as surely the lost souls in hell have never suffered. I saw
    those lists in the hands of our tyrants&mdash;placed there by the instrumentality
    of a woman who is to me the embodiment of all that is pure and good; I saw&mdash;in
    my mind&mdash;the spies of Alva going the round, this very night, and arresting
    our brave followers one by one ... Oh God! you do not know what I suffered....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not think of that any more, Messire,&rdquo; rejoined Leatherface
    quietly. &ldquo;As you see, the lists are now safe in my care. Alas! it is
    too late to beg you to take your mother out of the city. Guard and protect
    her well and God help us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He once more now prepared to go, and Laurence was ready to follow him, but
    just at the last an impulse caused the latter to detain the mysterious stranger
    once more. There was still one question which hovered on his lips, the answer
    to which would perhaps ease that awful burden of sorrow which Lenora&rsquo;s
    betrayal had placed upon his soul:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; he said appealingly, &ldquo;what of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray for her, Messire,&rdquo; replied Leatherface quietly, &ldquo;she
    suffers more than you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must we all curse her then? or else be traitors to our own people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! you can pity her! What she did, she did from her own sense of
    patriotism and of justice. She hates us all, Messire, as the enemies of her
    people. She hates and despises me as the assassin of the man she loved. Pray
    for her, Messire, but in pity pray also for the man who whilst striving to
    win her heart, only succeeded in breaking his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>An hour later in the house in the Nieuwstraat, Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke
    was still awake. She sat in her favourite tall chair beside the hearth, and
    Laurence her son was kneeling beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is too late now, mother,&rdquo; he was saying gloomily. &ldquo;No
    power on earth can save you. Would to God you had let me take you to Br&uuml;gge
    this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And desert my post like a coward,&rdquo; retorted Cl&eacute;mence
    hotly. &ldquo;I can do little, &rsquo;tis true; but when the hour comes I
    can tend the sick and the dying, and pray for the dead; and if you are taken
    from me, Laurence, I can be laid beside you.... But,&rdquo; she added, with
    such an intensity of bitterness and hatred that her voice nearly choked her
    as she spoke, &ldquo;I would not owe my safety to that execrable traitress...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, mother, in the name of Heaven...&rdquo; broke in Laurence with
    a heart-broken sob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you, too, going to defend her?&rdquo; retorted the mother fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was compelled to act as she did,&rdquo; murmured Laurence; &ldquo;she
    acted in ignorance and innocence. I&rsquo;d stake my life that she is pure
    and good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pure and good!&rdquo; exclaimed Cl&eacute;mence with a strident laugh. &ldquo;A
    spawn of the devil, without virtue and without mercy. Oh! that my lips should
    ever have touched her lying face&mdash;that white forehead which concealed
    thoughts of falsehood and treachery! Do not defend her, Laurence, or you
    will break my heart. Leave her defence to your brother Mark, who cares nothing
    for his country and for his kindred, who will smile and drink whilst the
    walls of Ghent fall about his ears, who hath allowed his weak and cowardly
    heart to be captured by that murderess! Leave him to defend her, I say. Lenora
    de Vargas is worthy of Mark van Rycke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; cried Laurence with uncontrolled vehemence as he threw
    his arms round his mother&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;In the name of God stop,
    for you almost blaspheme. Speak not of Mark save with a blessing on your
    lips. Pray for him this night, as you have never prayed before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence,&rdquo; cried the mother, &ldquo;are you mad? What do you
    mean? What has happened to Mark? Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In his bed, no doubt, at this moment, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping whilst we all weep and pray!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping in peace whilst giving up life, and more than life, to try
    and save us all!&rdquo; retorted Laurence, as he slowly rose to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurence! you are mad! Mark is...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark is the friend and saviour of the Prince of Orange, mother dear,&rdquo; said
    the young man quietly, &ldquo;and we have all known him hitherto as Leatherface.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; cried Cl&eacute;mence vehemently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear by God that it is true,&rdquo; proclaimed Laurence, fervently.</p>
  <p>The exclamation which she would have uttered froze upon Cl&eacute;mence
    van Rycke&rsquo;s lips; for a moment she remained quite still, leaning slightly
    forward with hands resting upon the arms of the chair. Then a pitiable moan
    escaped her, and slowly she rose and then fell upon her knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh God! forgive me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if this be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true, mother,&rdquo; said Laurence firmly. &ldquo;For close
    on two hours to-night I sat close to him whilst he spoke. In the absence
    of the Prince of Orange we have chosen him as our leader; if the Duke of
    Alva refuses the proposals which we are going to put before him, Mark will
    lead us to fight or to death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The proposal! What proposal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Leatherface be given up to the tyrant as the price of the safety
    of the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;his brother&mdash;agreed to this infamous suggestion?&rdquo; murmured
    Cl&eacute;mence hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must not leave a stone unturned or a man alive to save the women
    and children,&rdquo; replied Laurence sombrely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then may God have mercy on us all!&rdquo; cried Cl&eacute;mence,
    and she fell back heart-broken against the cushions of her chair.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    The Tyrants</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The next morning, at the tenth hour, five reverend seigniors presented themselves
    before the Duke of Alva, Lieutenant-Governor of the Low Countries and Captain-General
    of the Forces, in the apartments which he occupied in Het Spanjaards Kasteel.</p>
  <p>They were Messire Pierre van Overbeque, Vice-Bailiff of Ghent; Messire Deynoot,
    Procurator-General, and Messire Jan van Migrode, Chief Sheriff of the Keure;
    then there was Messire Lievin van Deynse, the brewer at the sign of the &ldquo;Star
    of the North,&rdquo; and Baron van Groobendock, chief financial adviser on
    the Town Council.</p>
  <p>They had waited on His Highness at a very early hour, but had been kept
    waiting in the guard-room for two hours, without a chair to sit on, and with
    a crowd of rough soldiers around them, some of whom were lounging about on
    the benches, others playing at cards or dice, whilst all of them improved
    the occasion and whiled away the time by indulging in insolent jests at the
    expense of the reverend burghers, who&mdash;humiliated beyond forbearance
    and vainly endeavouring to swallow their wrath&mdash;did not dare to complain
    to the officer in command, lest worse insults be heaped upon them.</p>
  <p>At one hour before noon the seigniors were at last told very peremptorily
    that they might present themselves before His Highness. They were marched
    between a detachment of soldiers through the castle yard to the magnificent
    apartments in the Meeste-Toren, which at one time were occupied by the Counts
    of Flanders. Now the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s soldiery and his attendants were
    in every corridor and every ante-room. They stared with undisguised insolence
    at the grave seigniors who belonged to the despised race.</p>
  <p>The Lieutenant-Governor was graciously pleased to receive the burghers in
    his council-chamber where, seated upon a velvet-covered chair upon an elevated
    platform and beneath a crimson dais, he looked down upon these free citizens
    of an independent State as if he were indeed possessed of divine rights over
    them all. The officer in command of the small detachment which had escorted
    the deputation into the dreaded presence, now ordered the five seigniors
    to kneel, and they, who had a petition to present and an act of mercy to
    entreat, obeyed with that proud humility wherewith their fathers had knelt
    thirty-two years ago in sackcloth and ashes before the throne of the Emperor
    Charles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your desire, seigniors?&rdquo; queried the Duke curtly.</p>
  <p>Some of the members of his abominable Grand Council sat around him, on benches
    placed well below the level of the platform. Alberic del Rio was there&mdash;bland
    and submissive; President Viglius, General de Noircarmes, and President Hessels&mdash;men
    who were as bitter against Orange and his followers as was Alva himself&mdash;and,
    sitting a little apart from the others, don Juan de Vargas, but recently
    arrived from Brussels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your desire, seigniors?&rdquo; the Duke had questioned peremptorily,
    and after a few moments Messire Deynoot, the Procurator-General, who was
    spokesman of the deputation, began timidly at first&mdash;then gradually
    more resolutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is with profound grief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we became
    aware last night that your Highness&rsquo; visit to our city was not one
    of goodwill and amity. Your Highness&rsquo; severe restrictions upon our
    citizens and stern measures taken against them hath filled our hearts with
    sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your abominable treachery hath filled our heart with wrath,&rdquo; retorted
    the Duke roughly, &ldquo;and nothing but the clemency enjoined upon us by
    our suzerain Lord and King prevented us from reducing this accursed city
    to ashes and putting every one of her citizens to the sword, without giving
    them a single chance of retrieving their hellish conduct by surrendering
    themselves unconditionally to our will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is with the utmost confidence,&rdquo; rejoined the Procurator-General
    humbly, &ldquo;that we rely upon the well-known clemency of our suzerain
    Lord the King, and place the future of our beautiful city unconditionally
    in your Highness&rsquo; hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The future of the city is in my hands, Messire,&rdquo;  said the
    Duke dryly, &ldquo;by the power of our suzerain Lord and with the help of
    the troops at my command. I told you last night under what condition I will
    spare your town from total destruction. I am not in the habit of changing
    my mind during the course of one night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas, your Highness! but the city is quite unable to fulfil the one
    condition which would appease the wrath of our suzerain Lord and your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; retorted Alva haughtily, &ldquo;why waste my time and
    your own in bandying words which must remain purposeless? Either William
    of Orange is delivered into my hands, or my soldiers burn your city down
    at sunset to-morrow. By our Lady! is that not clear enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clear enough, alas!&rdquo; rejoined the Procurator-General, and suddenly
    in his mind there rose a picture of the tall man last night beneath the dais,
    of his inspiring words, his whole-hearted sacrifice: his ringing voice seemed
    to echo through this narrow room, and some of the words which he spoke knocked
    at the gates of the grave seignior&rsquo;s memory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yours will be the harder task,&rdquo; he had said gaily; &ldquo;you
    will have to fawn and to cringe, to swallow your wrath and to bend your pride!&rdquo; Well!
    God knew that they had done all that: they had swallowed their wrath and
    bent their pride before an insolent soldiery, and now they were fawning and
    cringing to a tyrant whom they abhorred.</p>
  <p>Ghent! beloved city! once the home of the free! what must thy citizens endure
    for thy sake?</p>
  <p>And the Procurator-General&mdash;the descendant of an hundred free men&mdash;had
    to lick the dust before Alva&rsquo;s throne. He forced his voice to tones
    of humility, he looked up at the tyrant with eyes full of unspoken devotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; he said timidly, &ldquo;to prove our loyalty?
    I entreat your Magnificence to look down on our helplessness. Orange is no
    longer in Ghent, and we do not know where to find him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A pretty tale, indeed,&rdquo; interposed de Vargas suddenly, with
    a strident laugh which was echoed obsequiously by the other members round
    the council board, &ldquo;a pretty, likely tale, which I trust your Highness
    will not think to believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I neither believe nor disbelieve any tale which these grave seigniors
    choose to tell me,&rdquo; rejoined the Duke. &ldquo;I want Orange&mdash;or
    we burn this city down till not a stone in it be left upon stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Messire Deynoot, whose entire soul rose in revolt against that rough
    dictate of a hellish tyrant, had perforce to subdue his passionate wrath
    and to speak with affected humility and unconcern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had hoped,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that we might offer
    to your Highness such a proof of our loyalty that you would no longer wish
    to cast aside a city that hath always hitherto proved staunch and true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What mean you, sirrah? What proofs can you give me now of this accursed
    city&rsquo;s loyalty, when you harbour a veritable army of traitors within
    your walls?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We would wish to prove to your Magnificence that the city itself
    takes no part in the vagaries and plottings of a few hot-headed malcontents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hot-headed malcontents, forsooth!&rdquo; exclaimed the Duke fiercely. &ldquo;Two
    thousand men prepared to take up arms against our Suzerain Lord the King!
    ... arms concealed in churches and cemeteries! money poured into the lap
    of Orange and all his rebels!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are more than two thousand men who are prepared to fight and
    die for their country and their King,&rdquo; said the Fleming suavely, &ldquo;and
    who are equally ready to pour money into the coffers of their Liege Lord,
    as represented by His Highness Ferdinand Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva,
    and by the reverend members of his Council.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This he had said very slowly and with marked emphasis, and even while he
    spoke he had the satisfaction of seeing more than one pair of eyes round
    that Council board gloating with delight at the vision of treasure and wealth
    which his words had called forth. He and his colleagues had long after the
    assembly of last night discussed between them this one proposal, which might,
    they hoped, tempt the cupidity of the Spaniards, which they knew to be boundless.
    They were wealthy men all of them&mdash;the town was wealthy beyond the dreams
    of Alva&rsquo;s avarice, and the five men who had been deputed to offer up
    a brave man&rsquo;s life as the price of a city&rsquo;s safety, had resolved
    to sacrifice their last stiver, and keep the hero in their midst.</p>
  <p>But Alva, with a sneer, had already destroyed all the fond hopes which had
    been built upon that resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you offered me every treasure&mdash;to the last gulden&mdash;contained
    in your city,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis no less strongly marked than
    had been the other man&rsquo;s offer, &ldquo;I would not deny myself the
    pleasure of razing this abominable nest of rebels to the ground. Why should
    I,&rdquo; he added with a cynical shrug of the shoulders, &ldquo;take from
    you as a bribe what my soldiers can get for me by the might of fire and sword?
    Orange alone would tempt me, for I would wish to have him alive&mdash;we
    might kill him by accident when we destroy the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can collect two million gulden in gold,&rdquo; said Messire Deynoot
    insinuatingly, &ldquo;and lay that sum at the feet of your Magnificence to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said the Duke blandly, &ldquo;then I am greatly relieved
    that so much money can be got voluntarily out of this city. Your words, Messire,
    are honey to mine ears; they prove, beyond a doubt, that if you can raise
    two million gulden in forty-eight hours my soldiers can put up ten times
    that amount in a two days&rsquo; sacking of this town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The money voluntarily offered, Monseigneur,&rdquo; here interposed
    the Vice-Bailiff, &ldquo;would shame neither the giver nor the receiver.
    The destruction of a free and loyal city would be an eternal disgrace upon
    the might of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spare me thy heroics, sirrah!&rdquo; quoth Alva fiercely, &ldquo;or
    I&rsquo;ll have that impudent tongue of thine cut out before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And once more the burghers had to bend their pride before the appalling
    arrogance of their tyrant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begone now!&rdquo; added the Lieutenant-Governor peremptorily, seeing
    that the Flemings were silent for the moment. &ldquo;The business of the
    State cannot be held up by such profitless talk. And if you have nothing
    better to offer to our Gracious King than money which is already his, why,
    then, you are wasting my time, and had best go back to those who sent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one sent us, Monseigneur,&rdquo; resumed the Procurator-General,
    with as much dignity as he could command, even though his back ached and
    his knees were painfully cramped. &ldquo;We are free burghers of the city
    of Ghent, which, alas! hath earned your Highness&rsquo; displeasure. We have
    offered of our treasure so as to testify to our loyalty ... but this offer
    your Magnificence hath thought fit to refuse. At the same time we are not
    at the end of our resources or of our protestations of loyalty. We have yet
    another offer to place before your Highness which, perhaps, may be more agreeable
    in your sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is that offer, sirrah? Be quick about it, as my patience,
    of a truth, is at the end of its resources.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Procurator-General did not make immediate reply. Truly he was screwing
    up his determination for the terrible ordeal which was before him. He hung
    his head, and, despite his fortitude&mdash;probably because of weakness following
    on fatigue&mdash;he felt that tears gathered in his eyes, and he feared that
    his voice now as he spoke would become unsteady. The others, too, kept their
    eyes fixed to the ground. They could not bear to look on one another, at
    this moment when they were about to offer up so brave and gallant a life
    in sacrifice for their city and for all the townsfolk. Indeed, Messire Deynoot
    ere he spoke forced his mind to dwell upon all the horrors of Mons and Valenciennes
    and Mechlin, upon all the women and children, the feeble and the old, his
    own wife, his daughters and his mother, so as to gather courage for the task
    which had been imposed upon him.</p>
  <p>Thus there was silence for a minute or so in this narrow room, wherein the
    close velvet draperies made the air heavy, so that the number of men here
    assembled&mdash;Spaniards and Flemings and soldiers&mdash;felt as if an awful
    load was weighing their senses down. Councillor Hessels, as was his wont,
    had fallen asleep. He woke up in the oppressive silence in order to murmur
    drowsily: &ldquo;To the gallows with them all!&rdquo; Alva sat sullen and
    wrathful, looking down with contempt and scorn on the kneeling burghers before
    him. De Vargas, now and again, turned anxious, furtive eyes to where a rich
    porti&egrave;re of damask-velvet hid a door in the panelling of the wall.
    Even now it seemed as if that portiere stirred&mdash;as if an unseen hand
    was grasping it with a febrile nervous clutch&mdash;it seemed, in fact, as
    if some one lived and breathed there behind the curtain, and as if all that
    was said and would be said in the room would find its echo in a palpitating
    heart.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Anon the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s impatience broke its bounds: &ldquo;An you&rsquo;ll
    not speak, sirrah,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;get you gone! Get you gone, I
    say, ere I order my lacqueys to throw you out of my house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your pardon, Monseigneur,&rdquo; said Messire Deynoot with sudden
    resolution, &ldquo;I but paused in order to choose the words which might
    best please your ears. The offer which I am about to make to your Highness
    is in the name of all the citizens of Ghent, and I feel confident that your
    Highness will gladly acknowledge that no greater mark of loyalty could be
    offered by any town to our suzerain Lord the King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; commanded Alva.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next to the Prince of Orange himself,&rdquo; said the Procurator-General
    timidly, &ldquo;is there not a man who hath gravely incurred your Highness&rsquo; displeasure,
    but who hath hitherto evaded the punishment which your Highness would no
    doubt mete out to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; there is!&rdquo; replied the Duke curtly. &ldquo;A man who chooses
    to wrap himself up in a mantle of mystery; a spy of Orange&mdash;a rebel
    and traitor to the King. There is such a man, sirrah! He hath several times
    thwarted my projects with regard to Orange. If, as you say, Orange is not
    in Ghent then hath that man had a hand in helping him to get away. Well!
    what of that man, sirrah? I want him. He is called Leatherface by my soldiers.
    What of him, I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leatherface is in Ghent, Monseigneur,&rdquo; murmured Deynoot, scarce
    above his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come! that&rsquo;s good! Then will our booty be even richer than
    we thought.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leatherface is in Ghent, Monseigneur,&rdquo; continued Deynoot, more
    steadily. &ldquo;But he is an elusive creature. Mysterious agencies are at
    work, so they say, to enable him to escape the many traps that are set for
    him. He swims like a fish, and climbs like an ape. He entered the city last
    night, an hour after all the gates had been closed. In the terrible confusion
    which will attend the destruction of our city, he would escape again....
    But just now he is in Ghent, and...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will deliver him over to me,&rdquo; broke in Alva with a
    harsh laugh, &ldquo;if I will spare your city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Procurator-General nodded his head in reply. His lips refused him service
    for that awful, that irreparable &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The five men now no longer
    hung their heads. White as the linen ruffles round their throats, they were
    gazing straight into the face of the tyrant, trying to read the innermost
    thoughts of that inhuman devil, who held the destiny of their city&mdash;or
    of a brave man&mdash;in the hollow of his claw-like hands.</p>
  <p>Alva pondered; and while he did so his prominent, heavy-lidded eyes sought
    those of his colleagues no less inhuman, more devilish mayhap, than himself.
    And from behind the heavy porti&egrave;re there seemed to come a long drawn-out
    sigh, like some poor creature in pain. De Vargas frowned, and a muttered
    curse escaped his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long has she been there?&rdquo; asked Alva quickly, in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the time,&rdquo; replied de Vargas, also under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But this is not for women&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! your Highness does not know my daughter. It was the man Leatherface
    who killed her first lover. She would be happy to see him hang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she shall, too. She hath deserved well of us. We owe our present
    triumph to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned once more to the burghers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I like your offer,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;and, in a measure,
    I accept it.... Nay!&rdquo; he added with that cruel and strident laugh of
    his, seeing that at his words a certain look of relief overspread the five
    pale faces before him, &ldquo;do not rejoice too soon. I would not give up
    the delight of punishing an entire city for the mere pleasure of seeing one
    man hang. True! I would like to hold him. Next to Orange himself, I would
    sooner see that mysterious Leatherface dangling on a gibbet than any other
    heretic or rebel in this abominable country. But to give up my purpose over
    Ghent, that is another matter! Once and for all, seigniors,&rdquo; he added
    with fierce and irrevocable determination, &ldquo;Ghent shall burn, since
    Orange has escaped again. But I have said that I accept your offer, and I
    do. I take it as an expression of tardy loyalty, and will reward you in accordance
    with its value. We will burn your city, seigniors; but if when your flaming
    walls begin to crumble about your ears; when my soldiery have taken their
    fill of your money and your treasures, and human lives begin to pay the toll
    of your rebellion and treachery, then, if you deliver to me the person of
    Leatherface alive, I will, in return, stay my soldiers&rsquo; hands, and
    order that in every homestead one son and one daughter, aye, and the head
    of the house, too, be spared. Otherwise&mdash;and remember that this is my
    last word&mdash;not one stone shall remain upon stone within the city&mdash;not
    one inhabitant, man, woman, or child, shall be left to perpetuate rebellion
    inside these walls. I have spoken, and now go&mdash;go and tell Leatherface
    that I await him. He hath not aided Orange&rsquo;s escape in vain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose, and with a peremptory gesture pointed to the door. The five burghers
    were silent. What could they say? To beg, to implore, to remonstrate would,
    indeed, have been in vain. As well implore the fierce torrent not to uproot
    the tree that impedes its course, or beg the wolf not to devour its prey.
    Painfully they struggled to their feet, roughly urged along by the soldiers.
    They were indeed cramped and stiff, as well mentally as physically; they
    had done their heart-breaking errand&mdash;they had swallowed their wrath
    and humbled their pride&mdash;they had cringed, and they had fawned and licked
    the dust beneath the feet of the tyrant who was in sheer, lustful wantonness
    sending them and their kith and kin&mdash;guilty and innocent alike&mdash;to
    an abominable death.... And they had failed&mdash;miserably failed either
    to bribe, to cajole, or to shame that human fiend into some semblance of
    mercy. Now a deathlike sorrow weighed upon their souls. They were like five
    very old men sent tottering to their own graves.</p>
  <p>Some could hardly see because of the veil of tears before their eyes.</p>
  <p>But, even as one by one they filed out of the presence of the tyrant, they
    still prayed ... prayed to God to help them and their fellow-citizens in
    this the darkest hour of their lives. Truly, if these valiant people of Flanders
    had lost their faith and trust in God then they would have gone absolutely
    and irretrievably under into the awful vortex of oppression which threatened
    to crush the very existence of their nation, and would have hurled them into
    the bottomless abyss of self-destruction.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    Two Pictures</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>These stand out clearly among the mass of documents, details, dissertations
    and chronicles of the time&mdash;so clearly indeed that only a brief mention
    of them will suffice here.</p>
  <p>First: Lenora in the small room which adjoined the council chamber within
    Het Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel in Ghent. She had stood for close upon an hour
    under the lintel of the open door, her hand clinging to the heavy velvet
    porti&egrave;re; not one sound which came from the council chamber failed
    to strike her ear: every phase of that awesome interview between the supplicants
    and their vengeful tyrant struck at her heart, until at last unable to keep
    still, she uttered a moan of pain.</p>
  <p>All this was his work! Not hers! Before God and her own conscience she felt
    that she could not have acted differently; that if it had all to be done
    again, she would again obey the still, insistent voice which had prompted
    her to keep her oath and to serve her King and country in the only way that
    lay in her power.</p>
  <p>It was his work! not hers! His, whose whole life seemed to be given over
    to murder, to rebellion and to secret plottings, and who had tried to throw
    dust in her eyes and to cajole her into becoming a traitor too to all that
    she held dear.</p>
  <p>It was his work, and the terrible reprisals which the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s
    retributive justice would mete out to this rebellious city lay at the door
    of those who had conspired against the State, and not at hers who had only
    been an humble tool in Almighty hands.</p>
  <p>But in spite of her inner conviction that she had done right, in spite of
    her father&rsquo;s praise and approval which he had lavished on her all the
    way from Dendermonde to Ghent, she could not rid herself of a terrible sense
    of utter desolation and utter misery, and of a feeling of pity for all these
    poor people which caused her unendurable&mdash;almost physically unendurable&mdash;agony.</p>
  <p>When anon the Lieutenant-Governor dismissed the burghers and after a few
    words with her father and se&ntilde;or del Rio left the council chamber,
    Lenora had a feeling as if the ground was opening before her, as if an awful
    chasm yawned at her feet into which she must inevitably fall if she dared
    look into it. And yet she looked and looked, as if fascinated by the hideousness
    of what she saw&mdash;pictures of cruelty and of evil far more horrible than
    any which had ever been limned of hell. And in the overwhelming horror which
    faced her now, she felt herself screaming aloud, with appealing defiance:  &ldquo;It
    is his work! not mine! Let the blood of his kinsfolk fall upon him&mdash;not
    me!&rdquo;  ere she tottered and fell back.</p>
  <p>When full consciousness returned to her, her father was by her side. He
    looked pale and sullen and instinctively she drew away from him, whereat
    he smiled, showing his large teeth which looked like the fangs of a wolf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ought never to have allowed you to come here, Lenora,&rdquo; he
    said roughly. &ldquo;As His Highness said, it was not at all fit for women&rsquo;s
    ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Highness,&rdquo; she retorted coldly, &ldquo;also said that to
    be here was my right ... your triumph to-day being all due to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he added lightly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis you wanted to come,
    remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I wanted to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would have sent you to Brussels with Inez and a good escort. It
    is not too late. You can still go. Ghent will not be a fitting place for
    women during the next few days,&rdquo; he added, whilst a glow of evil satisfaction
    suddenly lit up his sallow face. &ldquo;Would you prefer to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, father, I thank you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I would wish
    to stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a brave daughter, and a true Spaniard,&rdquo;  he
    cried, &ldquo;and I promise you that you shall be satisfied with what you
    see. Ramon, your cousin, will be avenged more completely than even you could
    have dared to hope, and that assassin Leatherface will suffer: you shall
    see him dangling on a gibbet, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A slight shudder went right through her. Her face was as white as her gown;
    and as she made no reply, her father continued blandly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You little thought that your marriage would bring such a magnificent
    harvest of reprisals quite so soon! The city of Ghent and the man Leatherface!
    The destruction of the one and the death of the other are your work, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She closed her eyes; for she saw that awful chasm once more yawning at her
    feet, and once more she felt herself falling ... falling ... with no one
    to cling to but her father who kept asking her whether she was satisfied
    with what she had done.... His voice came to her as through a shroud ...
    he talked and talked incessantly ... of Ghent ... of rebels ... of murder
    and pillage and gibbets and torture-chambers ... of women and children and
    fathers of families ... of sons and of daughters ... and of one&mdash;Leatherface
    ... of the High-Bailiff of Ghent ... of Laurence and of Mark ... her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where that fool is now,&rdquo; she could hear her father
    saying through a muffler which seemed to envelop his mouth. &ldquo;On the
    high road to Brussels mayhap with a message from you to me ... did you say
    you had sent him on from Dendermonde or straight away from Ghent? I am half
    sorry I gave in to your whim and brought you here with me ... but &rsquo;tis
    you wanted to come ... eh, my girl? ... you were so obstinate ... I was weak
    enough to give in ... but I ought not to have let you listen to those mealy-mouthed
    Flemings! ... ah! you are my true daughter ... you wanted to see these traitors
    punished, what? and Ramon&rsquo;s murder avenged! Well! you shall see it
    all, my dear, I promise you.... But I wish you could tell me what has become
    of that fool of a husband of yours ... we shall have to know presently if
    you are still wife or widow....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He said this quite gaily and laughed at his own jest, and Lenora, pale and
    wild-eyed, echoed his laugh. She laughed as she had done two nights ago at
    Dendermonde when a face made up of lighted windows grinned at and mocked
    her across the Grand&rsquo; Place. She laughed until the whole room began
    to dance a wild galliarde around her, until her father&rsquo;s face appeared
    like one huge, mocking grin.</p>
  <p>Then she just glided from the couch down on to the floor. And there she
    lay, white and inert, whilst se&ntilde;or de Vargas, cursing the megrims
    of women, went calmly in search of help.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The second picture has for background the refectory in the convent of St.
    Agneten at the same hour as when last night the newly chosen, mysterious
    leader had roused boundless enthusiasm in the hearts of all his hearers.
    There is no lack of enthusiasm now either, but tempers are more subdued&mdash;gloom
    hangs over the assembly, for Messire the Procurator-General has just given
    a graphic account of his mission to the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
  <p>When he has finished speaking, the man with the mask who sits at the head
    of the table at the top of the long, low room, asks quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he refused?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the five men who this morning had knelt humbly before the tyrant, exchange
    silent glances, after which Messire Deynoot says firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He refused.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing will save our city,&rdquo; insisted Leatherface solemnly, &ldquo;except
    if we track the Prince of Orange and bring him bound and a prisoner to the
    feet of Alva?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing! save Orange&rsquo;s person will move Alva from his resolve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leatherface sits for a moment quite still, with his head buried in his hands:
    and the vast crowd now assembled in the room waits in breathless silence
    for his next word. There are far more than two thousand men here this night;
    the number has indeed been more than doubled. The deadly danger which threatens
    the city has already brought over three thousand new recruits to the standard.</p>
  <p>Suddenly with a resolute gesture Leatherface draws his mask away and rises
    to his feet in full view of all the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark van Rycke!&rdquo; comes as one cry from several hundred throats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; he says with a light laugh, &ldquo;your ne&rsquo;er-do-well
    and frequenter of taverns was just the watch-dog of our noble Prince. Unknown
    I was able to render him some small service. Now that you are no longer called
    upon to throw me as a bait to the snarling lion, I&rsquo;ll resume mine own
    identity, and hereby ask you, if&mdash;knowing me for what I am&mdash;you
    still trust me to lead you to victory or to death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To victory!&rdquo; shout the younger men enthusiastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To die like men,&rdquo; murmur the older ones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow we fight, seigniors!&rdquo; says Mark earnestly, &ldquo;to-morrow
    we defend our homes, our wives, our daughters, with scarce a hope of success.
    To-morrow we show to the rulers of the world how those of the down-trodden
    race can die whilst fighting for God and liberty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; they all assent with unbounded enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>The ardour of a noble cause is in their veins. Not one of them here hesitates
    for one second in order to count the cost. And yet every one of them know
    that theirs is a forlorn cause. How can a handful of burghers and apprentices
    stand up before the might of Spain? But they are men at bay! they&mdash;the
    sober burghers of a fog-ridden land, steady, wise of counsel, without an
    ounce of impetuosity or hot-headedness in their blood; and yet they are ready
    to go into this desperate adventure without another thought save that of
    selling their lives and the honour of their women folk as dearly as they
    can.</p>
  <p>For leader they have a man! for help they have only God! For incentive they
    have their own dignity, their pride, their valour ... for weapon they have
    the justice of their cause, and the right to die like men.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    The Right To Die</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>And after the lapse of three hundred and more years the imagination projects
    itself into that past so full of heroic deeds, so full of valour and of glory,
    and stands still wondering before the glowing pictures which the insurrection
    of Ghent reveals.</p>
  <p>Memory&mdash;the stern handmaiden of unruly imagination&mdash;goes back
    to that 21st day in October 1572 and recalls the sounds and sights which
    from early dawn filled the beautiful city with a presage of desolation to
    come; the church bells&rsquo; melancholy appeal, the deserted streets, the
    barred and shuttered houses, the crowds of women and children and old men
    sitting at prayer in their own halls, the peaceful folk of a prosperous city
    quietly preparing for death.</p>
  <p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the Duke of Alva rides out of the
    Kasteel with his staff and his bodyguard, which consists of three squadrons
    of cavalry, one bandera of Spanish infantry&mdash;halberdiers and pikemen&mdash;and
    five companies of harquebusiers, The Bandes d&rsquo;Ordonnance&mdash;the
    local mounted gendarmerie&mdash;are on duty in the Vridachmart, and thither
    the Duke repairs in slow and stately majesty through silent streets, in which
    every window is shuttered, and where not one idler or gaffer stands to see
    him pass by. A cruel, ironical smile curls his thin lips beneath the drooping
    moustache as he notes the deserted aspect of the place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Terror,&rdquo; he mutters to himself, &ldquo;or sulkiness. But they
    cannot eat their money or their treasures: and there must be a vast deal
    of it behind those walls!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the Vridachmart he halts with his armed escort grouped around him, the
    Bandes d&rsquo;Ordonnance lining the market place, his standard unfurled
    behind him, his drummers in the front. Not a soul out upon the mart&mdash;not
    a head at any of the windows in the houses round! It seems as if Don Frederic
    Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, Lieutenant-Governor of the Netherlands and
    Captain-General of the Forces, was about to read a proclamation to a city
    of the dead.</p>
  <p>A prolonged roll of drums commands silence for His Highness&mdash;silence
    which already is absolute&mdash;and then the Duke, in his usual loud and
    peremptory voice, demands the immediate surrender of the Prince of Orange
    now an outlaw in the town. And suddenly from every house around the huge
    market comes the answering cry: &ldquo;Come and take him!&rdquo; And from
    every doorway, from every adjoining street men come rushing along&mdash;with
    pikes and halberds and muskets, and from end to end of the town the defiant
    cry arises: &ldquo;Come and take him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Bandes d&rsquo;Ordonnance, hastily summoned by the Duke to keep back
    the rabble, turn their arms against the Spanish halberdiers. Taking up the
    cry of &ldquo;Come and take him!&rdquo; they go over in a body to the side
    of the insurgents.</p>
  <p>At once the Walloon arquebusiers are ordered to fire. The rebels respond
    this time with their own battle cry of &ldquo;Orange and Liberty!&rdquo; and
    a death-dealing volley of musketry. Whereupon the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e becomes
    general; the cavalry charges into the now serried ranks of the Orangists
    who are forced momentarily to retreat. They are pushed back across the mart
    as far as the cemetery of St. Jakab. Here they unfurl their standard, and
    their musketeers hold their ground with unshakable valour, firing from behind
    the low encircling wall with marvellous precision and quickness whilst two
    bodies of halbertmen and pikemen pour out in numbers from inside the church,
    and their artillerymen with five culverins and three falconets emerge out
    of the Guild House of the Tanners which is close by, and take up a position
    in front of the cemetery.</p>
  <p>Alva&rsquo;s troops soon begin to lose their nerve. They were wholly unprepared
    for attack, and suddenly they feel themselves both outnumbered and hard-pressed.
    The Duke himself had been unprepared and had appeared upon the Vridachmart
    with less than two thousand men, whilst the other companies stationed in
    different portions of the city had not even been warned to hold themselves
    in readiness.</p>
  <p>And just when the Spanish cavalry upon the Market Square is beginning to
    give ground the cry of &ldquo;<i>Sauve qui peut</i>&rdquo; is raised somewhere
    in the distance.</p>
  <p>The Spanish and Walloon soldiery quartered in the various guild-houses,
    the open markets or private homesteads were just as unprepared for attack
    as was the garrison of the Kasteel. They had been promised that as soon as
    the evening Angelus had ceased to ring they could run wild throughout the
    city, loot and pillage as much as they desired, and that until that hour
    they could do no better than fill their heads with ale so as to be ready
    for the glorious sacking and destruction of the richest town in the Netherlands.
    Therefore, a goodly number of them&mdash;fresh from Mechlin&mdash;have spent
    the afternoon in recalling some of the pleasurable adventures there&mdash;the
    trophies gained, the treasure, the money, the jewels all lying ready to their
    hand. Others have listened open-mouthed and agape, longing to get to work
    on the rich city and its wealthy burghers, and all have imbibed a great quantity
    of very heady ale which has fuddled their brain and made them more and more
    drowsy as the afternoon wears on. Their captains too have spent most of the
    day in the taverns, drinking and playing hazard in anticipation of loot,
    and thus the men are not at the moment in touch with their commanders or
    with their comrades, and all have laid aside their arms.</p>
  <p>And simultaneously with the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e in the Vridachmart, the insurgents
    have made a general attack upon every guild-house, every market, every tavern
    where soldiers are quartered and congregated. With much shouting and to-do
    so as to give an exaggerated idea of their numbers they fall upon the unsuspecting
    soldiers&mdash;Walloons for the most part&mdash;and overpower and capture
    them before these have fully roused themselves from their afternoon torpor;
    their provosts and captains oft surrender without striking a blow. In almost
    every instance&mdash;so the chroniclers of the time aver&mdash;fifty and
    sixty men were captured by a dozen or twenty, and within half an hour all
    the guild-houses are in the hands of the Orangists, and close on fifteen
    hundred Walloons are prisoners in the cellars below; whilst all the arms
    stowed in the open markets go to swell the stores of the brave Orange men.</p>
  <p>But some of the Walloons and Spaniards contrive to escape this general rounding
    up and it was they who first raised the cry of &ldquo;<i>Sauve qui peut!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now it is repeated and repeated again and again: it echoes from street to
    street; it gains in volume and in power until from end to end of the city
    it seems to converge toward the Vridachmart in one huge, all dominating wave
    of sound: &ldquo;<i>Sauve qui peut!</i>&rdquo; and the tramp of running feet,
    the calls and cries drown the clash of lance and pike.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the bowmen of the Orangists scale the low cemetery wall as one
    man and their defence is turned into a vigorous onslaught: the cavalry is
    forced back upon the market square, they catch up the cry: &ldquo;<i>Sauve
    qui peut</i>! They are on us! <i>Sauve qui peut!</i>&rdquo; They break their
    ranks&mdash;a panic hath seized them&mdash;their retreat becomes a rout.
    The Orangists are all over the cemetery wall now: they charge with halberd
    and pike and force the Spaniards and Walloons back and back into the narrow
    streets which debouch upon the Schelde. Some are able to escape over the
    Ketel Br&uuml;ghe, but two entire companies of Spanish infantry and a whole
    squadron of cavalry are&mdash;so Messire Vaernewyck avers&mdash;pushed into
    the river where they perish to the last man.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>At this hour all is confusion. The picture which the mind conjures up of
    the stricken city is a blurred mass of pikes and lances, of muskets and crossbows,
    of Spaniards and Walloons and Flemings, of ragged doublets and plumed hats&mdash;a
    medley of sounds: of arrows whizzing with a long whistling sound through
    the air, of the crash of muskets and clash of lance against lance, the appeal
    of those who are afraid and the groans of those who are dying&mdash;of falling
    timber and sizzling woodwork, and crumbling masonry, and through it all the
    awful cry of &ldquo;<i>Sauve qui peut!</i>&rdquo; and the sound of the tocsin
    weirdly calling through the fast gathering night.</p>
  <p>And amidst this helter-skelter and confusion, the Duke of Alva upon his
    black charger&mdash;untiring, grim, terrible&mdash;tries by commands, cajoleries,
    threats, to rally those who flee. But the voice which erstwhile had the power
    to make the stoutest heart quake had none over the poltroon. He shouts and
    admonishes and threatens in vain. They run and run&mdash;cavalry, infantry,
    halbertmen and lancers&mdash;the flower of the Spanish force sent to subdue
    the Netherlands&mdash;they run; and in the general vortex of fleeing cavalry
    the Duke is engulfed too, and he is carried along as far as the Ketel Br&uuml;ghe,
    where he tries to make a stand.</p>
  <p>His doublet and hose are covered with mud and grime; his mantle is torn,
    his hat has fallen off his head and his white hair floats around his face
    which is as pale as death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cowards!&rdquo; he cries with fierce and maddened rage:  &ldquo;would
    you fly before such rabble?&rdquo; But his voice has lost its magic; they
    do not heed him&mdash;they fly&mdash;past him and over the bridge to the
    safety of Het Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel.</p>
  <p>Then prudence dictates the only possible course, or capture might become
    inevitable. Cursing savagely and vowing more bitter revenge than ever before,
    the Duke at last wheels his horse round and he too hastens back to the stronghold&mdash;there
    to work out a plan of campaign against the desperate resistance of that handful
    of Flemish louts whom His Highness and all Spanish grandees and officials
    so heartily despise.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Half an hour later, and we see courier after courier sent flying from Het
    Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel to every corner of the city.</p>
  <p>The city gates&mdash;thank the God of the Spaniards!&mdash;have been well
    garrisoned and well supplied with culverins and balls, it is from there that
    help must come, for&mdash;strange to tell&mdash;those louts have actually
    invested the Kasteel and have the pretension to lay a regular siege to the
    stronghold.</p>
  <p>Was there ever such a farce? A couple of thousand of an undisciplined rabble&mdash;they
    surely cannot be more&mdash;daring to pit themselves against a picked guard!
    Courier to the Waalpoort where Lodrono is in command! courier to the Braepoort!&mdash;Serbelloni
    is there with two culverins of the newest pattern and two hundred musketeers,
    the like of whom are not known outside the Spanish army!</p>
  <p>The only pity is that the bulk of the forces inside the city are Walloons!
    such poltroons as they have already proved themselves, surrendering in their
    hundreds to those confounded rebels! they have been scattered like flies
    out of a honey-pot, and the entire centre of the city is in the hands of
    the Orangists. But, anyway, the whole affair is only a question of time;
    for the moment the evening is closing in fast and the position cannot therefore
    be improved before nightfall; but in the morning a general closing-in movement,
    from the gates toward the centre would hold the rebels as in a claw and break
    their resistance within an hour. In the meanwhile the morale of the troops
    must be restored. Attend to that, ye captains at the city gates!</p>
  <p>Courier follows courier out of the gate-house of the Kasteel: naked men,
    ready to crawl, to swim, or to dive, to escape the vigilance of the Orangist
    lines. Impossible! Not one is able to cross the open ground beyond the castle
    moat; the houses on the further bank of the Schelde are filled with Orangists;
    bows and muskets are levelled from every window. The culverins are down below,
    covered by the angles of the cross-streets; the messengers either fall ere
    they reach the Schelde or are sent back the way they came.</p>
  <p>Attend to the morale of your men, ye captains at the city gates! The Duke
    of Alva, with some three or four thousand men, is inside the Kasteel, and
    no orders or communication can be got from him now before morning. And just
    like the flies when driven out of the honey, fly, scared, to the edges of
    the pot, so the Walloon soldiers, those who have escaped from the guild-houses,
    go and seek refuge in the shadow of the guard-houses at the gates. But the
    tactics of the Orangists have worked upon their nerves. At first there had
    appeared but a rabble upon the Vridachmart, but since then the numbers are
    swelling visibly; insurgents seem to be issuing out of every doorway, from
    under every arch in the city ... they rush out with muskets and crossbows,
    with pikes and halberds; and to the Walloons&mdash;already unnerved and fatigued&mdash;their
    numbers appear to be endless and their arms of a wonderful precision. Their
    muskets are of the newest pattern such as are made in Germany, and these
    they use with marvellous skill, discharging as many as ten shots in one quarter
    of an hour, and none but the picked French musketeers have ever been known
    to do that.</p>
  <p>And they are led by a man who seems to know neither fatigue nor fear. Here,
    there and everywhere he appears to the Walloon and Spanish soldiers like
    a mysterious being from another world. He wears no armour, but just a suit
    of leather which envelopes him from head to foot, and his face is hidden
    by a leather mask. His voice rings from end to end of the market place one
    moment; the next he appears inside the enclosure of the cemetery. Now he
    is at St. Phara&iuml;lde and anon back at St. Jakab. Three of Alva&rsquo;s
    couriers hastily despatched to the commandants at the various gate-houses
    fall to his pistol, which is the only weapon he carries, and it is he who
    leads the last attack on the Ketel Br&uuml;ghe which results in the flight
    of Alva and all his cavalry to the safe precincts of the Kasteel.</p>
  <p>Before the evening Angelus has ceased to ring, the whole of the centre of
    the city is swept clear of Alva&rsquo;s troops, and the insurgents have completely
    surrounded the Kasteel. Darkness finds the Orangists bivouacking in the open
    markets and along the banks of the Schelde and the Leye with their artillery
    still thundering against Alva&rsquo;s stronghold and the gate-houses of the
    city, like bursts of thunder-clouds in a storm. The mantle of night has fallen
    over a vast hecatomb of dead and dying, of Walloons and Flemings and Spaniards,
    of brothers who have died side by side, with muskets raised in fratricide
    one against the other, and of women and children who have died of terror
    and of grief.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>And memory conjures up the vision of the tyrant, the author of all this
    desolation, riding slowly through the portal of the gate-house into the yard
    of Het Spanjaard&rsquo;s Kasteel a quarter of an hour or so ere the darkness
    of the night will finally cover all the abomination and the crimes, the murder,
    the misery and the bloodshed which the insatiable tyranny of this one man
    has called down upon a peaceable and liberty-loving people.</p>
  <p>He rides with head erect, although fatigue and care are writ plainly on
    his ashen cheeks and the wearied stoop of his shoulders. His horse has received
    a wound in the flank from which the blood oozes and stains its rider&rsquo;s
    boots. Here in the castle-yard, some semblance of order has been brought
    about through the activity of the captains. The horses have been stabled
    in the vaulted cellars, the men have found quarters in different parts of
    the Kasteel; the musketeers and arquebusiers are up on the walls, the artillery
    well-screened behind the parapets.</p>
  <p>The night has called a halt to men, even in the midst of barren victories
    and of unlooked-for defeat, and their sorrow and their hurts, their last
    sigh of agony or cry of triumph have all been equally silenced in her embrace;
    but over the city the sky is lurid and glowing crimson through a veil of
    smoke; the artillery and musketry have ceased their thundering; but still
    from out the gloom there come weird and hideous noises of hoarse shouts and
    cries of &ldquo;Mercy&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Help,&rdquo; and from time to
    time the sudden crash of crumbling masonry or of charred beams falling in.</p>
  <p>But Alva pays no heed to what goes on around him. He swings himself wearily
    out of the saddle and gives a few brief orders to the captains who press
    close beside his stirrup, anxious for a word or a look of encouragement or
    of praise. Then he curtly asks for water.</p>
  <p>Don Sancho de Avila, captain of the castle guard, hands him the leather
    bottle and he drinks greedily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are in a tight corner, Monseigneur,&rdquo; whispers de Avila under
    his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold thy tongue, fool!&rdquo; is Alva&rsquo;s rough retort.</p>
  <p>Whereupon the captain stands aside more convinced than before that disaster
    is in the air.</p>
  <p>The Duke had been the last to turn his back on the Ketel Br&uuml;ghe and
    to retire into the stronghold of the Kasteel. The banks of the Schelde by
    now are lined with the ranks of the insurgents, and it was a musket shot
    fired from the Vleeshhuis that wounded his horse&mdash;close to the saddle-bow.
    His quivering lips, and the ashen hue of his face testify to his consciousness
    of danger.</p>
  <p>But his brow clears perceptibly when he sees Juan de Vargas coming out to
    meet him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is thy daughter?&rdquo; he asks as soon as the other is within
    earshot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In chapel, I imagine,&rdquo; replies de Vargas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No woman should be abroad this night,&rdquo; says Alva dryly. &ldquo;Send
    for her and order her to remain within her apartments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has been tending the wounded, and will wish to do so again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! let her keep to the castle-yard then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not anxious, Monseigneur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Not anxious,&rdquo; replies Alva with a fierce oath, &ldquo;we
    can subdue these rebels of course. But I would I had brought Spanish soldiers
    with me, rather than these Walloon louts. They let themselves be massacred
    like sheep or else run like poltroons. Vitelli declares he has lost over
    a thousand men and at least a thousand more are prisoners in the various
    guild-houses&mdash;probably more. We ought never to have lost ground as we
    did,&rdquo; he adds sullenly, &ldquo;but who would have thought that these
    louts meant to fight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who, indeed?&rdquo; retorts de Vargas with a sneer, &ldquo;and yet
    here we are besieged in our own citadel, and by a handful of undisciplined
    peasants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! their triumph will be short-lived,&rdquo; exclaims Alva savagely. &ldquo;We
    have over two thousand men inside the Kasteel and surely they cannot be more
    than three thousand all told unless...&rdquo; He broke off abruptly, then
    continued more calmly: &ldquo;Darkness closed in on us ere reprisals could
    commence ... if I had more Spaniards with me, I would try a sortie in the
    night and catch these oafs in their sleep ... but these Walloons are such
    damnable fools and such abominable cowards.... But we&rsquo;ll fight our
    way through in the morning, never fear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile cannot we send to Dendermonde for reinforcements?
    The garrison there is all Spanish and...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can we send?&rdquo; Alva breaks in savagely. &ldquo;The way is
    barred by the artillery of those bandits&mdash;save upon the north and north-east,
    where that awful morass nearly half a league in length and width is quite
    impassable in autumn. No! we cannot get reinforcements unless we fight our
    way through first&mdash;unless one of the commandants at the gates has realised
    the gravity of the situation. Lodrono at the Waalpoort has intelligence,&rdquo; he
    continues more calmly, &ldquo;and Serbelloni hath initiative&mdash;and by
    the Mass! if one of them doth not get us quickly out of this sorry place,
    I will have them all hanged at dawn upon their gates!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Duke of Alva&rsquo;s fierce wrath is but a result of his anxiety. He
    holds the Netherlanders in bitter contempt &rsquo;tis true! He knows that
    to-morrow perhaps he can send to Dendermonde for reinforcements and can then
    crush that handful of rebels as he would a fly beneath his iron heel. He
    would have his revenge&mdash;he knew that&mdash;but he also knew that that
    revenge would cost him dear. He has fought those Flemish louts, as he calls
    them, too often and too long not to know that when the day breaks once more
    he will have to encounter stubborn resistance, dogged determination and incalculable
    losses ere he can subdue and punish these men who have nothing now to lose
    but their lives&mdash;and those lives his own tyranny has anyhow made forfeit.</p>
  <h3 align="center">5</h3>
  <p>De Vargas makes no further comment on his chief&rsquo;s last tirade: remembering
    his daughter, he goes to transmit to her the order formulated by the Duke.
    Lenora is in the chapel, and, obedient to her father&rsquo;s commands, she
    rises from her knees and returns, silent and heavy-footed, to her apartments.</p>
  <p>The hours drag on like unto centuries; she has even lost count of time;
    it is forty-eight hours now since she held Mark&rsquo;s wounded arm in her
    hand and discovered the awful, the hideous truth. Since then she has not
    really lived, she has just glided through the utter desolation of life, hoping
    and praying that it might finish soon and put an end to her misery.</p>
  <p>She had acted, as she believed, in accordance with God&rsquo;s will! but
    she felt that her heart within her was broken, that nothing ever again would
    bring solace to her soul. That long, miserable day yesterday in Dendermonde
    whilst she was waiting for a reply from her father had been like an eternity
    of torment, and she had then thought that nothing on earth or in hell could
    be more terrible to bear. And then to-day she realised that there was yet
    more misery to endure, and more and more each day until the end of time,
    for of a truth there would be no rest or surcease from sorrow for her, even
    in her grave.</p>
  <p>The one little crumb of comfort in her misery has been the companionship
    of Grete; the child was silent and self-contained, and had obviously suffered
    much in her young life, and therefore understood the sorrows of others&mdash;knew
    how to sympathise, when to offer words of comfort, and when to be silent.</p>
  <p>Though Inez was a pattern of devotion, her chattering soon grated on Lenora&rsquo;s
    nerves; and anon when don Juan de Vargas agreed to allow his daughter to
    come with him to Ghent, Lenora arranged that Grete be made to accompany her
    and that Inez be sent straight on to Brussels. The girl&mdash;with the blind
    submission peculiar to the ignorant and the down-trodden&mdash;had consented;
    she had already learned to love the beautiful and noble lady, whose pale
    face bore such terrible lines of sorrow, and her sister Katrine and her aunt
    both believed that the child would be quite safe under the immediate protection
    of don Juan de Vargas. Inez was sent off to Brussels, and Lenora and Grete
    are now the only two women inside the Kasteel.</p>
  <p>Together they flit like sweet, pale ghosts amongst the litters of straw
    whereon men lie groaning, wounded, often cursing&mdash;they bandage the wounds,
    bring water to parched lips, pass tender, soothing hands across feverish
    foreheads. Then, at times, Lenora takes Grete&rsquo;s rough little hand in
    hers, and together the women wander out upon the ramparts. The sentries and
    the guard know them and they are not challenged, and they go slowly along
    the edge of the walls, close to the parapets and look down upon the waters
    of the moat. Here the dead lie in their hundreds, cradled upon the turgid
    waters, washed hither through the narrow canals by the more turbulent Schelde&mdash;their
    pale, still faces turned upwards to the grey evening light. And Lenora wonders
    if anon she will perceive a pair of grey eyes&mdash;that were wont to be
    so merry&mdash;turning sightless orbs to the dull, bleak sky. She scans each
    pale face, with eyes seared and tearless, and not finding him whom she seeks,
    she goes back with Grete to her work of mercy among the wounded only to return
    again and seek again with her heart torn between the desire to know whether
    the one man whom she hates with a bitter passion that fills her entire soul
    hath indeed paid the blood-toll for the dastardly murder of Ramon, or whether
    God will punish her for that irresistible longing which possesses her to
    hold that same cowardly enemy&mdash;wounded or dying&mdash;assassin though
    he be&mdash;for one unforgettable moment in her arms.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>But it is not desolation that reigns in the refectory of the convent of
    St. Agneten, for here the leaders of the rebellion have assembled, as soon
    as the guns have ceased to roar. The numbers of their followers since last
    night have increased by hundreds, and still the recruits come pouring in.
    Those men who but four days ago had received the Prince of Orange&rsquo;s
    overtures with vague promises and obvious indifference, rushed to arms after
    the first musket shot had been fired. Ever since the attack in the Vridachmart
    men have loudly clamoured for halberts or pikes or muskets, and the captains
    at the various secret depots, as well as the guild of armourers, had much
    ado to satisfy all those who longed to shed their blood with glory rather
    than be massacred like insentient cattle. They are men who have fought at
    Gravelines and St. Quentin, and have not forgotten how to shoulder musket
    or crossbow or how to handle a culverin. Since then, fifteen years of oppression,
    of brow-beating, of terrorising, fifteen years under the yoke of the Inquisition
    and of Spanish tyranny have worn down the edge of their enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>When Orange begged for money and men that he might continue the fight for
    liberty, the goodly burghers of Ghent forgot their glorious traditions and
    preferred to bend their neck to the yoke rather than risk the fate of Mons
    and of Mechlin. But now that danger is within their doors, now that they
    and their wives and daughters are at the mercy of the same brutal soldiery
    whom Alva and de Vargas take pleasure in driving to bestial excesses and
    inhuman cruelties, now that they realise that the fate of Mechlin is already
    inevitably theirs&mdash;their dormant courage rises once more to its most
    sublime altitude. Die they must&mdash;that they know!&mdash;how can they,
    within the enclosure of their own city walls, stand up against the armies
    of Spain, which can at any moment be brought up in their thousands to reinforce
    the tyrant&rsquo;s troops? But at least they will die with muskets or pikes
    in their hands, and their wives and daughters will be spared the supreme
    outrage which they count worse than death.</p>
  <p>Thus close on five thousand volunteers file past their leaders this night
    in the refectory of St. Agneten and tender their oath of allegiance to fight
    to the last man for Orange and liberty. On the faces of those leaders&mdash;of
    Messire van Beveren, of Lievin van Deynse, of Laurence van Rycke and Jan
    van Migrode, there is plainly writ the determination to keep up the fight
    to the end, and the knowledge that the end can only be death for them all.</p>
  <p>But in Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s deep-set eyes there is something more than
    mere determination. There is a latent belief that God will intervene&mdash;there
    is a curious exultation in their merry depths&mdash;a kind of triumphant
    hope: and those who stand before him and swear that they will fight for Orange
    and liberty with the last drop of their blood look him straight in the face
    for a moment and then turn away feeling less grim and more courageous with
    a courage not altogether born of despair.</p>
  <p>The angel of liberty has unsheathed his sword and infused his holy breath
    into these men&mdash;easy-going burghers for the most part, untrained soldiers
    or even undisciplined rabble&mdash;who have dared to defy the might of Alva.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>And when the first streak of dawn folds the night in its embrace and lifts
    from off the stricken city the veil of oblivion and of sleep, we see some
    five thousand Orangists prepared to stand up before Alva&rsquo;s forces which
    still number close on eight. The streets are littered with dead, with pikes
    and lances hastily cast aside, with muskets and plumed bonnets, with broken
    rubbish and wheelless wagons, and scraps of cloth or shoes or leather belts.</p>
  <p>And in the cemetery of St. Jakab the flag of liberty still flaunts its blazing
    orange in the pale morning light and around it men still rally, defiant and
    unconquered. The Guild House of the Tanners close by is in flames, and the
    tower of St. Jakab a crumbling ruin; the hostel of St. Juan ten Dullen is
    a charred mass of debris, and the houses that front on the Vridachmart a
    fast crumbling heap of masonry and glass.</p>
  <p>The situation of the insurgents is more desperate than even Alva knows.
    Of their three captains, Pierre van Overbeque is dead, Jan van Migrode severely
    wounded, and Laurence van Rycke exhausted. Of their company of halberdiers,
    all the provosts except two have fallen. The investing lines around the Kasteel
    have five officers killed and twenty of their artillerymen have fallen. Six
    hundred of their wounded encumber the Vridachmart. The narrow streets which
    debouch upon the gates are deserted save by the dead.</p>
  <p>But as soon as the rising day hath touched the ruined tower of St. Jakab
    with its pale silvery light, Mark van Rycke, their commander, intrepid and
    undaunted, wakes the sleeping echoes with his cry: &ldquo;Burghers of Ghent!
    to arms! we are not vanquished yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A volley of arrows from the crossbowmen upon the Waalpoort answers the defiant
    cry: one arrow pierces a loose corner of Mark&rsquo;s doublet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Rycke!&rdquo; cries the provost who stands nearest to him, &ldquo;spare
    thyself in the name of God! What shall we do if you fall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Mark, unmoved, the fire of enthusiasm unquenched in his eyes, cries
    loudly in response:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do? What alone can burghers of Ghent do in face of what lies before
    them if they give in? Do? Why, die like heroes&mdash;to the last man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His doublet hangs from him in rags, his hose is torn, his head bare, his
    face black with powder. He grasps musket or crossbow, halberd, lance or pike,
    whichever is readiest to his hand, whichever company hath need of a leader;
    a beam from the burning building has fallen within a yard of him and singed
    his hair: &ldquo;Heroes of Ghent!&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;which of you will
    think of giving in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The morning Angelus begins to ring. For a few minutes while the pure clear
    tones of the church bells reverberate above the din of waking men and clash
    of arms, Spaniards and Walloons and Flemings pause in their hate and their
    fight in order to pray.</p>
  <p>Up in the council chamber of the Kasteel, Alva and de Vargas and del Rio
    on their knees mock the very God whom they invoke, and when the last &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; has
    left their lips, Alva struggles to his feet and murmurs fiercely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now for revenge!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Through the wide open windows, he gazes upon the spires and roofs of the
    beautiful city which he hath sworn to destroy. Already many of these are
    crumbling ruins, and from far away near the church of St. Jakab a column
    of black smoke rises upwards to the sky. The windows give upon an iron balcony
    which runs along the entire width of the Meeste-Toren: from this balcony
    an open staircase leads down into the castle-yard. The yard and vaulted cellars
    opposite are filled with horses, and the corridors of the palace swarm with
    men. And as the Duke, anon, steps out upon the balcony he sees before him
    the five breaches in the castle-walls which testify to the power of the insurgents&rsquo; culverins.
    He hears the groans of the wounded who lie all round the walls upon the litters
    of straw, he sees the faces of innumerable dead, floating wide-eyed upon
    the waters of the moat, and the carcasses of horses in the yard which add
    to the horror of the scene by their pathetic hideousness.</p>
  <p>And seeing all this, he hath not a thought of pity for all the innocent
    whom he vows to punish along with the guilty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now for revenge!&rdquo; he reiterates fiercely and shakes a clenched
    fist toward the tower of St. Jakab, &ldquo;and if only I had my Spaniards
    with me, we would have burned the town down before now.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>8</b></h3>
  <p>The day drags on in the weary monotony of incessant firing, incessant fighting&mdash;constant
    attacks to be repulsed, numbers of wounded to be added to those who already
    encumber the yard&mdash;numbers of dead to be added to those who encumber
    the waters of the moat.</p>
  <p>The finest general the victorious Spanish armies have ever known is besieged
    in his stronghold by a few hundred undisciplined, untaught, unseasoned rebel
    troops. What is happening beyond the wide tract of open ground which lies
    all round the Kasteel the Duke cannot get to know. The Orangist lines are
    all round him screened by the buildings which face the further bank of the
    Schelde; and though his culverins have turned the magnificent Vleeshhuis
    into a smoking ruin, those of the Orangists have made serious havoc in the
    castle walls.</p>
  <p>The last onslaught delivered a couple of hours after noonday resulted in
    the crumbling together of three of the widest breaches already existing,
    making one huge yawning cavity, which has to be strongly and persistently
    defended&mdash;a defence which exacts an enormous toll of wounded and dead
    every time the Orangist artillery and musketry return to the attack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot hold out till nightfall!&rdquo; Captain de Avila cries
    despairingly. &ldquo;We have lost two hundred men in less than two hundred
    minutes. If we get no help we are undone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cries Alva fiercely, &ldquo;where are we to get help
    from if those oafs at the city gates do not find us some?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the north-east side of the Kasteel lies the open way to Dendermonde&mdash;where
    Captain Gonzalo de Bracamonte is quartered with a garrison of five thousand
    men, and between that open way of salvation, and those who hold the Kasteel,
    there lies a league of spongy morass. The way through it is free from the
    Orangist musketry. Nature alone bars it, and does so effectually.</p>
  <p>Three times to-day has Alva tried to send runners through that way. Stripped
    to the skin they are lowered by ropes from the parapet, and at first find
    firm foothold at the base of the walls. From up above Alva and his captains
    watch the naked men who walk on boldly, proud of their achievement; their
    skins shine like metal beneath the grey, autumnal sky on which the smouldering
    ruins of a devastated city have painted a crimson tint. Alva watches them
    until they appear as mere black dots upon the low horizon&mdash;tiny black
    specks that move for a while, slowly along, with arms swinging as the mud
    gets deeper and walking heavier. Then suddenly the speck ceases to move ...
    the arms are thrown up with frantic wheelings and beatings of the air ...
    sometimes the speck will turn and move back slowly toward the castle, but
    more often than not it grows shorter and shorter still, till even the tall
    arms disappear&mdash;engulfed in the morass.</p>
  <p>Three times have men been sent out on this errand of death ... three or
    four at a time ... twice has one man come back from those hideous, yawning
    jaws of a loathsome death&mdash;livid, covered with green slime, trembling
    in every limb as if stricken with ague. After that, men refuse to go ...
    Alva commands and threatens ... another batch go off ... another spectre
    returns from the shores of another world.... Then the men are obstinate ...
    to insist, to command, to threaten further would provoke mutiny, and the
    stronghold once more lapses into utter isolation.</p>
  <p>The din of musketry from end to end of the city drowns every other sound,
    smoke from smouldering ruins obscures the view beyond the Schelde. What has
    happened in the centre of the city during all these hours, whilst the high
    and mighty Lieutenant-Governor and Captain-General of the Force of Occupation
    is a virtual prisoner in the hands of the rebels, he himself cannot possibly
    tell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rebels have lost more heavily than we have,&rdquo;  says de Avila,
    whilst he snatches a brief rest during the afternoon, &ldquo;and they must
    be getting short of powder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; says Alva grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely Captain Lodrono has come in touch with Captain Serbelloni
    by now. It is inconceivable that the garrisons at the gate-houses can do
    nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those Netherlanders are fighting like devils,&rdquo;  says de Vargas
    with his evil sneer, &ldquo;they have nothing to lose ... they know that
    they are doomed, every man, woman and child of them ... aye! if I had my
    way, every man who speaks the Flemish tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; retorts Alva with a curse, &ldquo;but in the meanwhile,
    if Serbelloni or Lodrono have not sent a runner to Dendermonde, those Flemish
    louts will carry this castle by storm, and when I am a prisoner in their
    hands, they&rsquo;ll either slaughter us all or dictate their own terms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says Avila quietly, &ldquo;they have not got the Kasteel
    yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long can we hold out?&rdquo; queries de Vargas, who at Alva&rsquo;s
    grimly prophetic words, had become livid with fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless those rebels have lost more heavily than we hope, we cannot
    hold out more than another few hours. We still have three thousand men and
    a goodly stock of powder.... The breach we can defend with stones of which
    there is a large store; we killed or wounded over a hundred of those louts
    at their last assault ... we can go on like this until nightfall. But if
    at dawn they attack us again in full force&mdash;and we lose many more men
    to-day ... why...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold thy tongue,&rdquo; cried Alva fiercely, for at the senior captain&rsquo;s
    words, many of the younger ones have exchanged quick, significant glances. &ldquo;Shall
    I have to hang some of my captains so as to discourage the men from playing
    the coward too?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>9</b></h3>
  <p>The evening Angelus has just ceased to ring, and a man is ushered into the
    presence of the Captain-General; he is naked, and his body is covered with
    sticky mud and dripping with slime; his face is hardly recognisable through
    a thick mask of sweat and grime.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come from Braepoort, Magnificence,&rdquo; he says in a low, quaking
    voice, for obviously he is all but exhausted. &ldquo;I ran round the town,
    and struck into the morass ... I am a man of Ghent ... I know a track ...
    that&rsquo;s why Captain Serbelloni sent me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With what news?&rdquo; queries Alva impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None too good, Magnificence,&rdquo; replies the man. &ldquo;The commandants
    at the gates are sorely pressed ... I hailed the guard at the Br&uuml;gge
    and Waalpoorts as I passed ... they are isolated ... every one of them ...
    and each separately attacked by bands of rebels who fight desperately....
    The Braepoort cannot hold out much longer ... Captain Serbelloni asks for
    help even before nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help?&rdquo; vociferates Alva savagely, &ldquo;how can I send them
    help? We are besieged in this accursed place; we cannot fight our way through
    the rabble, unless some of those oafs at the city gates come to our assistance.
    Help? &rsquo;Tis I want help here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gates are being bravely defended, Magnificence. But the rebels
    still hold the centre of the city. They have seized &lsquo;Sgravensteen.
    Two thousand Walloons have surrendered to them...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two thousand!&rdquo; exclaims Alva with a fierce oath, &ldquo;the
    miserable poltroons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At least three thousand rebels threaten the Kasteel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that well enough,&rdquo; retorts Alva roughly. &ldquo;They
    have made five breaches in our wall! ... the bandits! Help! &rsquo;tis I
    want help!&rdquo;  he reiterates with a loud curse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Serbelloni bade me tell your Highness that he hath sent to
    Dendermonde for immediate reinforcements. He hoped your Highness would forgive
    him if he hath done wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alva&rsquo;s eyes flash a look of satisfaction, but he makes no immediate
    comment. Not even his colleagues&mdash;not even de Vargas his intimate&mdash;should
    see how immense is his relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he send a mounted man,&rdquo; he asks after a while, &ldquo;or
    two? Two would be better in case a man gets hurt on the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Captain sent three men, Magnificence. But they had to go on foot.
    We have no horses at the gates. The insurgents rounded them all in long before
    nightfall. But the men hope to pick up one or more on their way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alva, as is his wont, smothers a savage curse. The small body of Spanish
    cavalry which he had with him in the town had been the first to run helter-skelter
    over the Ketel Br&uuml;ghe into the Kasteel, whilst a whole squadron perished
    in the Schelde. One of those horses down there in the yard would mean reinforcements
    within a few hours.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When did the messenger start for Dendermonde?&rdquo; he asks again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When the Angelus began to ring at noon, Magnificence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The captain was undecided. He thought that every moment would bring
    help or orders from your Highness. He also tried to send messengers to Captain
    Lodrono at the Waalpoort, but the messengers must all have been intercepted
    and killed, for no help came from anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost know if the message which thy captain sent to Dendermonde was
    couched in urgent terms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe so, Magnificence. The se&ntilde;or captain was growing
    very anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more the Duke is silent; his brows contract in an anxious frown. His
    active brain is busy in making a mental calculation as to how soon those
    reinforcements can arrive. &ldquo;The men will have to walk to Dendermonde,&rdquo; he
    muses, &ldquo;and cannot get there before nightfall.... the commandant may
    start at night ... but he may tarry till the morrow.... It will be the end
    of the day before he and his men are here ... and in the meanwhile...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the Braepoort?&rdquo; he queries curtly, &ldquo;how many of the
    guard have been killed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had a hundred and twenty killed when I left, Magnificence, and
    over three hundred lay wounded on the bridge. We have suffered heavily,&rdquo; adds
    the man after a slight moment of hesitation&mdash;the hesitation of the bearer
    of evil tidings who dreads his listener&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
  <p>Alva remains silent for a moment or two, then he says abruptly: &ldquo;Dost
    know that I have half a mind to kill thee, for all the evil news which thou
    hast brought?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he laughs loudly and long because the man, with a quick cry of terror
    has made a sudden dash for the open window, and is brought back by the lance
    of the provost on guard upon the balcony. The pleasure of striking terror
    into the hearts of people has not yet palled upon his Magnificence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I had a whole mind to kill thee,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;thou
    wouldst have no chance of escape. So cease thy trembling and ask the provost
    there to give thee water to cleanse thyself, food to put inside thy belly
    and clothing wherewith to hide thy nakedness. Then come back before me. I&rsquo;ll
    give thee a chance to save thy life by doing a service to thy King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He makes a sign to one of the provosts, who seizes the man roughly by the
    shoulders and incontinently bundles him out of the room.</p>
  <p>In the council chamber no one dares to speak. His Highness has become moody,
    and has sunk upon his high-backed chair where he remains inert and silent,
    wrapped in gloomy meditations, and when he is in one of those sullen moods
    no one dares to break in on his thoughts&mdash;no one except se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas, and he too is as preoccupied as his chief.</p>
  <h3 align="center">10</h3>
  <p>&ldquo;De Vargas!&rdquo; says Alva abruptly after a while, &ldquo;dost mind
    that to-morrow is not only Sunday, but the feast of the Blessed Redeemer
    and a holy day of obligation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied de Vargas unctuously, &ldquo;I am
    minded that if we do not go to Mass to-morrow, those of us who die unabsolved
    of the sin will go to hell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The men are grumbling already,&rdquo; breaks in don Sancho de Avila,
    captain of the bodyguard. &ldquo;They say they will not fight to-morrow if
    they cannot go to Mass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those Walloons...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not only the Walloons, Monseigneur,&rdquo; rejoins de Avila, &ldquo;the
    Spaniards are better Catholics than all these Netherlanders. They fear to
    die with a mortal sin upon their soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing more is said just then; the grey day is already yielding to dusk;
    the fire of artillery and musketry is less incessant, the clash of pike and
    halberd can be heard more distinctly, and also the cries of the women and
    the groans of the wounded and the dying.</p>
  <p>A few moments later a tall, lean man in the borrowed dress of a Spanish
    halberdier is ushered into the presence of the council. Water, food and clothes
    have effected a transformation which Alva surveys critically, and not without
    approval. The man&mdash;lean of visage and clean of limb&mdash;looks intelligent
    and capable; the Duke orders him to advance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis good for thee,&rdquo; he says dryly, &ldquo;that thy death
    is more unprofitable to me than thy life. I want a messenger ... art afraid
    to go to the miserable wretch who dares to lead a rebel horde against our
    Sovereign King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid of nothing, Magnificence,&rdquo; replies the man quietly, &ldquo;save
    your Highness&rsquo;s wrath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dost know where to find the rebel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where musket-balls fly thickest, your Highness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell him,&rdquo; says Alva curtly, &ldquo;that as soon as the
    night has fallen and the fire of culverins and muskets has ceased, I will
    have the drawbridge at the south-east of this castle lowered, and I will
    come forward to meet him, accompanied by my captains and the members of my
    council. Tell him to walk forward and meet me until we are within earshot
    of one another: and to order his torch-bearers to throw the light of their
    torches upon his face: then will I put forward a proposal which hath regard
    to the eternal salvation of every man, woman and child inside this city.
    Tell him to guard his person as he thinks fit, but tell him also that from
    the ramparts of this Kasteel three hundred muskets will be aimed at his head,
    and at the slightest suspicion of treachery the order will be given to fire.
    Dost understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every word, your Highness,&rdquo; says the man simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go in peace,&rdquo; concludes Alva, and the man is dismissed.</p>
  <h3 align="center">11</h3>
  <p>An hour later the drawbridge at the south-east gate of the Kasteel was lowered.
    Twilight had now faded into night; the dull, grey day had yielded to black,
    impenetrable night. Here and there far away in the heart of the city lurid
    lights shot through the darkness, and every now and then a column of vivid
    flame would strike up to the dense black sky, and for a while illumine the
    ruined towers, the shattered roofs and broken chimneys around ere it fell
    again, sizzling in the damp atmosphere.</p>
  <p>The Duke of Alva rode out in the gloom; he was seated upon his black charger,
    and was preceded by his torch-bearers and by his bodyguard of archers. Behind
    him walked his captains and the members of his council. The procession slowly
    wended its way under the portal of the gate-house and then over the bridge.
    At the farthest end of the bridge the Duke reined in his horse, and his bodyguard,
    his captains and the members of his council all stood behind him so that
    he immediately faced the tract of open ground beyond which were the Orangist
    lines.</p>
  <p>The flickering light of resin torches illumined the commanding figure of
    the Duke, dressed in sombre clothes and silk-lined mantle, and wearing breast
    and back plates of armour, with huge tassets over his wide breeches and open
    steel morion on his head. To right and left far away, toward the open country,
    the bivouac fires of the insurgents gleamed weirdly in the night.</p>
  <p>All noise of fighting had ceased, and a strange silence had fallen over
    the city&mdash;a silence which hid many secrets of horror and of despair.</p>
  <p>Suddenly something began to move, something that at first appeared darker
    than the darkness of the night; a few moments later it appeared as a speck
    of ruddy light which moved quickly&mdash;now toward the castle bridge; anon
    it was distinguishable as a group of men&mdash;a dozen or so&mdash;with a
    couple of torchbearers on in front, the light from whose torches fell full
    upon a tall figure which stood out boldly amongst the others. Now the group
    came to a halt less than fifty paces away, and those upon the bridge could
    see that tall figure quite clearly; a man in ragged doublet and hose, with
    grimy hands and face blackened with powder; he held his head very erect and
    wore neither helmet nor armour.</p>
  <p>At sight of him, de Vargas gave a cry of rage and surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark van Rycke!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What hath he to do with
    it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy daughter&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; said Alva coolly. &ldquo;Nay,
    then we&rsquo;ll soon make her a widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But to the Orangists he called peremptorily: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis with the
    rebel whom ye call Leatherface that I wish to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been known as Leatherface hitherto,&rdquo;  retorts Mark van
    Rycke coolly. &ldquo;Speak without fear. I listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vargas&rsquo; cry of rage was echoed by more than one Spanish captain present.
    They remembered Mark van Rycke, the ne&rsquo;er-do-well with whom they had
    oft drunk and jested in the taverns of Ghent and Brussels, aye! and before
    whom they had oft talked openly of their plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spy as well as rebel!&rdquo; they cried out to him wrathfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pity he cannot hang more than once,&rdquo; added de Vargas with bitter
    spite.</p>
  <p>But to Alva the personality of the rebel was of no consequence. What cared
    he if the man was called van Rycke and was the husband of his friend&rsquo;s
    daughter? There stood an abominable rebel who had gained by treachery and
    stealth a momentary advantage over the forces of his suzerain Lord the King,
    and who would presently suffer along with the whole of this insurgent city
    the utmost rigour of Alva&rsquo;s laws! In the meanwhile he deigned to parley
    with the lout, for he was sore pressed inside the Kasteel, and the messengers
    who were speeding to Dendermonde for reinforcements could not possibly bring
    help for at least another four-and-twenty hours.</p>
  <p>Therefore, now he&mdash;the Lieutenant-Governor of the Netherlands and Captain-General
    of His Majesty&rsquo;s forces&mdash;demanded attention in the name of the
    King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do ye come as traitors?&rdquo; he asked in a loud voice, &ldquo;or
    as loyal men? If as traitors ye shall die ere ye advance another step. But
    if ye are loyal men, then listen, for I will speak with you in amity and
    peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou knowest best, Magnificence,&rdquo; came Mark&rsquo;s clear voice
    out of the group, &ldquo;if we are loyal men or no. Thou didst send an emissary
    to us; he goeth back to thee unhurt: thou standest before our bowmen even
    now and not an arrow hath touched thine armour. We are loyal men and are
    prepared to listen to what ye have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen then,&rdquo; resumed the Duke curtly, &ldquo;but let no false
    hopes lure ye the while. Ye are rebels and are under the ban of the law.
    Nothing but unconditional surrender can win mercy for your city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing but humility can save thee from the wrath of God,&rdquo; retorted
    Mark boldly. &ldquo;We are unconquered, Magnificence! and &rsquo;tis thou
    who askest to parley&mdash;not we.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not ask,&rdquo; retorted Alva loudly, &ldquo;I demand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then since &rsquo;tis the vanquished who demand, let us hear what
    they wish to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow is Sunday, rebel, hadst forgotten that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, tyrant, I had not. God hath forbidden us to work on that day,
    but not to fight against oppression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hath also enjoined us to attend Mass on His day. Are ye heretics
    that ye care naught for that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We care for the Lord&rsquo;s Day as much as Spaniards do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet will ye prevent His people from praying in peace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pray for those whom thy tyranny keeps locked up within
    thy castle walls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; exclaims Alva, &ldquo;my men are free to go: they
    will attend Mass in the churches of this city. Will you butcher them whilst
    they are at prayer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no immediate reply to this taunt, but from the insurgents&rsquo; ranks
    there came a loud, warning call:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not heed him, van Rycke! Remember Egmont and Horne! Do not fall
    into the tyrant&rsquo;s trap! There&rsquo;s treachery in every word he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alva waited in silence until the tumult had subsided. He knew what he wanted
    and why he wanted it. A few hours&rsquo; respite would mean salvation for
    him ... a few hours! ... and the garrison of Dendermonde would be on its
    way to Ghent. He wanted to stay the hand of time for those few hours and
    had invented this treacherous means to gain that end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no wonder,&rdquo; he said quietly as soon as the clamour
    on the Orangist side was stilled, &ldquo;that ye who are traitors should
    seek treachery everywhere. What I propose is loyal and just and in accordance
    with God&rsquo;s own decrees. If ye refuse, ye do so at the peril of thousands
    of immortal souls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We know not yet what it is ye ask,&rdquo; said van Rycke quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We demand a truce until the evening Angelus to-morrow&mdash;the Lord&rsquo;s
    Day which is also the feast of the Holy Redeemer. We demand the right to
    attend Mass in peace ... and in exchange we&rsquo;ll agree not to molest
    you whilst ye pray and whilst ye bury your dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce until the evening Angelus,&rdquo; broke in Mark hotly, &ldquo;so
    that ye may send for reinforcements to the nearest garrison town. We refuse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; retorted Alva. &ldquo;For two days and a night
    ye have raised your arms against your lawful King. If you fight to-morrow
    you will add sacrilege to your other crimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And thou, treachery to thine!&rdquo; said van Rycke boldly. &ldquo;Whence
    this desire to keep holy the Sabbath day, tyrant? Wouldst thou have ceased
    to destroy, to pillage or to outrage this day if we had not raised our arms
    in our own defence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, van Rycke!&rdquo; cried the Orangists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The immortal souls which your obstinacy would send to hell,&rdquo; said
    the Duke of Alva, &ldquo;will return and haunt you till they drag you back
    with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you not pray in your Kasteel?&rdquo; retorted Mark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have no priest to say Mass for us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will send you one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have no consecrated chapel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The priest will say Mass in your castle-yard, beneath the consecrated
    dome of heaven. The Walloon prisoners whom we have taken are receiving the
    ministry of our priests in the guild-houses where they are held.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! but such makeshift would not satisfy the children of Spain who
    are also the chosen children of the Church. But,&rdquo;  continued Alva with
    a sudden assumption of indifference, &ldquo;I have made my proposal. Take
    it or not as ye list. But remember this: the dead who lie unburied in your
    streets will have their revenge. Pestilence and disease will sweep your city
    of your children, as soon as we have vanquished your men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; cried some of the Orangists, &ldquo;do not heed
    him, van Rycke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But of a truth the cry was not repeated quite so insistently this time.
    Alva&rsquo;s last argument was an unanswerable one. Pestilence these days
    was a more formidable foe than the finest artillery wielded by a powerful
    enemy: there were over two thousand dead lying unburied in the city at this
    hour: as the tyrant said very truly, these would take a terrible revenge.
    And there was something too in the sanctity of the Lord&rsquo;s Day which
    touched the hearts of these men who were deeply religious and devout and
    had a profound respect for the dictates of the Church. Most of them were
    Catholics&mdash;the importance of attending Mass on the Lord&rsquo;s Day
    on pain of committing a deadly sin weighed hard upon their conscience. Alva
    was quick to note the advantage which he had already gained, and when the
    first dissentient voice among the Orangists was heard to say: &ldquo;A truce
    can do no harm and &rsquo;twere sacrilege to fight on the Lord&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; he
    broke in quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay! &rsquo;tis not fighting ye would do, but murder. Aye! murder
    on the Day of the Holy Redeemer who died that ye should live.... My men are
    Catholic to a man! not one of them but would far rather let himself be butchered
    than commit a deadly sin. Rebels, who have outraged your King, to-morrow
    morning the church bells will be calling the faithful to the Holy Sacrifice:
    the truce which you refuse to hold with us we will grant you of our own free
    will. We will not fight you on the day of the feast of the Holy Redeemer.
    But to-morrow every Spaniard and every Walloon in our armies will go unarmed
    and present himself at your church doors. I&mdash;even I&mdash;with my captains
    and the members of the King&rsquo;s Council will attend Mass at the church
    of St. Baafs and we will be unarmed, for we shall have placed ourselves under
    the care of the Holy Redeemer Himself. And now tell thy soldiers, rebel,
    tell them that Spaniards and Walloons will be in the churches of Ghent in
    their thousands and that they will be defenceless save for the armour of
    prayer which will encompass them as they kneel before the altar of God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile,&rdquo; retorted van Rycke, &ldquo;ye will be
    sending to Dendermonde and Alost and Antwerpen: and when after the evening
    Angelus we take up arms once more against your tyranny, there will be five
    thousand more Spaniards at our gates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the Holy Redeemer whom I herewith invoke,&rdquo;  said Alva solemnly
    and raised his hand above his head with a gesture of invocation, &ldquo;I
    swear that no messenger of mine shall leave the city before ye once more
    take up arms against your King. I swear that no messenger of mine hath left
    this city for the purpose of getting help from any garrison town, and may
    my soul be eternally damned if I do not speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those who were present at this memorable interview declare that when Alva
    registered this false and blasphemous oath a curious crimson light suddenly
    appeared in the East&mdash;so strong and lurid was it that the perjurer himself
    put up his hand for a second or two as if blinded by the light. Philip de
    Lannoy, seigneur de Beauvoir, assures us that the light was absolutely dazzling
    and of the colour of blood, but that he took it as a warning from God against
    the sacrilege of fighting on this holy day, and that it caused him to add
    the weight of his influence with Mark van Rycke to grant the truce which
    the Spaniards desired.</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly, the solemn oath spoken by the tyrant who was such a devout
    and bigoted Catholic greatly worked upon the feelings of the Orangists: never
    for a moment did the suspicion of the oath being a false one enter their
    loyal heads: nor must they be blamed for their childish confidence in a man
    who had lied to them and deceived them so continuously for the past five
    years. They were so loyal themselves, such a trap as Alva was setting for
    them now was so far from their ken, that it was impossible for them to imagine
    such appalling treachery: as for the sanctity of an oath, they would as soon
    have thought of doubting the evidence of their own eyes.</p>
  <p>Mark van Rycke, it is true, held out to the last. He knew these Spaniards
    better than those simple burghers did: not in vain had he spent his best
    years in the uncongenial task of worming out their secret plans&mdash;their
    treacherous devices&mdash;over tankards of ale and games of hazard in Flemish
    taverns. He mistrusted them all, he mistrusted Alva above all! he had no
    belief in that execrable monster&rsquo;s oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God is on our side!&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll bury
    our dead when we can, and pray when God wills. He&rsquo;ll forgive the breaking
    of His Sabbath for the justice of our cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are weary of the fight,&rdquo; he added obstinately, &ldquo;we
    are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But already every one of his friends was urging him to grant the truce:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the sake of our women and children,&rdquo; said van Deynse who
    voiced the majority, &ldquo;let there be no fighting to-morrow. The tyrant
    has pledged his immortal soul that he will not play us false. No man would
    dare to do that unless he meant to be true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rebel!&rdquo; now shouted Alva impatiently, &ldquo;I await thine
    answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Accept, van Rycke, accept,&rdquo; cried the Orangists unanimously
    now, &ldquo;it is God&rsquo;s will that we accept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I await thine answer, rebel,&rdquo; reiterated Alva.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What answer can I give?&rdquo; retorted van Rycke. &ldquo;You say
    your men will go to our churches unarmed. We are not butchers as ye would
    have been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will let them pray in peace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As thou desirest. You who were prepared to destroy our city and to
    murder our women and our children will have nothing to fear from us while
    ye are unarmed and at prayer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until the evening Angelus ceases to ring?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And until that hour we remain as we are. Our guard at the gates....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our prisoners in our hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And may God guard thee,&rdquo; concluded Alva unctuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May God have mercy on thy soul if thou hast lied to us,&rdquo; said
    Mark van Rycke quietly.</p>
  <p>To this Alva made no reply, but his grim face looked in no way troubled.
    Special absolution even for speaking a false oath could easily be obtained,
    alas! these days by any Duke of Alva or other tyrant powerful enough to demand
    it; and no doubt the Lieutenant-Governor, sent to subdue the rebellious Low
    Countries, was well provided with every kind of dispensation which embodied
    the principle that &ldquo;the end justifies the means!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wheeled his horse round and, wholly callous and unconcerned, he rode
    back slowly over the bridge.</p>
  <p>As soon as the last of the Spaniards had filed under the gate-house of the
    Kasteel and the drawbridge was once more raised, Mark van Rycke turned with
    unwonted peremptoriness to his friends who were crowding round him, eagerly
    approving of what he had done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Deynse,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;to-morrow at dawn, see
    that your musketeers are massed inside the ruins of the Tanners&rsquo; Guild
    House, and you, Laurence, place three hundred of your picked archers under
    the cover of the Vish Mart. Lannoy, your pikemen beneath the arcades of the
    Abbey opposite St. Baafs, and you, Groobendock, yours in the doorways of
    the houses opposite St. Phara&iuml;lde, and every one of you under arms.
    Let the Spaniards pray in peace if they have not lied. But at the first sign
    of treachery, remember your wives and your daughters and do not spare the
    murderers of your children or the desecrators of your homes.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    Truth And Perfidy</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The cathedral bells of St. Baafs were the first to ring on that unforgettable
    23rd day of October which was the feast of the Holy Redeemer: the appealing,
    sweet, melancholy sound came clearly through the humid air. Lenora, who was
    in her room with Grete, stood quite still for a moment and listened. The
    bells of St. Phara&iuml;lde took up the call, then those of St. Jakab and
    St. Agneten until the clang of bells echoed from end to end of the city and
    drowned every other sound&mdash;of strife or of misery. The roar of the artillery
    now was mute, the clash of pikes and lances was no longer heard&mdash;only
    that curious medley of weird and terrible sounds still lingered in the air&mdash;a
    medley made up of sighs and groans, of men falling down exhausted with pain,
    of masonry still crumbling and woodwork still sizzling&mdash;a medley to
    which now was added the roll of drums which on either side called to the
    men to lay aside their strife and to go and pray in peace.</p>
  <p>On the walls of the castle-yard the Duke&rsquo;s proclamation of the Lord&rsquo;s
    Day truce was posted up and he himself was giving a few brief orders to his
    captains:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let the men understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that they are free
    to go to Mass in the various churches of the city, and that they can do so
    without the slightest fear. But they must all be back inside the Kasteel
    precincts by two hours after noon. Let the couriers go to the gate-houses
    at the six Poorts and issue the same orders there, and have the proclamation
    posted up. Make it known here as well as at the Poorts that if any man fails
    to respect the truce, if there is any brawling in the streets or in the taverns,
    I shall proceed with merciless severity against the culprits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned to the captain of the castle-guard, don Sancho de Avila: &ldquo;Yours
    will be the duty to see that runners are sent out in secret on the Dendermonde
    road with orders that any troops which may be on the way, make all possible
    speed. You had best remain in command here while I go to Mass: keep your
    picked guard and the musketeers under arms, for, the moment that the Dendermonde
    banderas are in sight, we must be ready to co-operate with them by a sortie <i>en
    masse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I quite understand, Magnificence,&rdquo; replied the captain.</p>
  <p>A few moments later the bridge was lowered and some three thousand men filed
    out across it in orderly lines as for parade&mdash;but unarmed. The Spanish
    halberdiers formed the van and the rear-guard, the Walloon pikemen and archers
    were massed in the centre, and in the midst of them walked the Duke of Alva
    with his immediate cort&egrave;ge: de Vargas who had his daughter on his
    arm and Grete close beside her, don Alberic del Rio, Councillor Hessels and
    two or three other members of the Council. Behind them came the standard-bearers
    with standards unfurled and the drummers.</p>
  <p>In silence they reached the lines of the Orangists, which they had to cross
    in a double file, each man holding up his hands to show that he was unarmed.
    The Orangist leaders stood by in a group, and when the Duke and the members
    of the Council had to file through the lines in their turn, they stepped
    forward in order to greet them in amity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God guard ye!&rdquo; they said as the Duke walked by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll aid Him in that,&rdquo; retorted the Spaniards cynically.</p>
  <p>Mark van Rycke was in the forefront of the group at the moment that Lenora
    went by leaning on her father&rsquo;s arm. She looked up just then and saw
    him. He held his head erect as he always did, but she could not fail to see
    how completely he had changed in those few hours since last she saw him at
    Dendermonde. The hours seemed to have gone over him like years: gone was
    that quaint, gentle, appealing way to which she had so nearly yielded. His
    attitude now was one of lofty defiance, sublime in its unshakable determination
    and in its pride. Well! perhaps it was better so! Was he not the embodiment
    of everything that Lenora had been taught to hate and despise since her tenderest
    childhood&mdash;the despised race that dared to assert itself, the beneficiary
    who turned on the hand that loaded him with gifts and, above all, the assassin
    who cowered in the dark, the slave who struck his master whom he dared not
    defy? Yes! Mark van Rycke, her husband, the murderer of Ramon, stood for
    all that, and Lenora despised herself for every tender feeling which had
    gripped her soul in the past two days whenever she thought of him as wounded,
    helpless, or mayhap dead.</p>
  <p>And yet now when his eyes met hers, they suddenly took on a wonderful softness,
    that quaint look&mdash;half-whimsical, half appealing&mdash;came back to
    them and with it too a look of infinite pity and of unswerving love; and
    as she caught the glance&mdash;she who felt so lonely and so desolate&mdash;there
    came to her mind the remembrance of the sweet and pathetic story of the primeval
    woman who was driven forth by God&rsquo;s angel from the gates of Paradise.
    Somehow she felt that once&mdash;not so very long ago&mdash;she too had wandered
    for a brief while within the peaceful glades of a Paradise of her own, and
    that now an angel with a flaming sword stood at its gates and would not allow
    her to return, but forced her to wander out through life in utter loneliness
    and with the unbearable load of agonising remorse.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Of all the episodes which the historical records of the time present to
    the imagination, not one perhaps is quite so moving and so inspiring as that
    of the solemn Mass which was offered up in every church of the stricken city
    on this Sunday morning&mdash;the feast of the Holy Redeemer&mdash;when the
    Duke of Alva and the members of his odious Blood Council knelt side by side
    with the heroic men who were making their last desperate stand for justice,
    for liberty and the sanctity of their homes.</p>
  <p>The Lieutenant-Governor and the Spanish high dignitaries, both civil and
    military, are present in the Cathedral of St. Baafs, as are also the Orangist
    leaders. The Spaniards occupy one side of the aisle, the Flemings, with the
    women and children, are on the other, and crowd every corner of the stately
    edifice. Up at the high altar, Father van der Schlicht is officiating with
    others of the cathedral clergy, and the pure voices of the choir boys resound
    through the building like the call of the angels of peace.</p>
  <p>The fabric of the exquisite building bears traces of that awful fate which
    an abominable tyranny was reserving for the entire city. The walls themselves
    stand, but in places they are torn by large fissures, which look like gaping
    wounds in the flesh of a giant. Reverend hands have hastily swept aside the
    debris of glass and masonry, the fragments of stone statues and scraps of
    iron and wood; but here and there the head of an angel, the clasped hands
    of a saint or palm of a martyr, still litter the floor; the slender columns
    of the aisle have taken on a curious rusty tint, and over the screen the
    apostles of carved wood are black with smoke.</p>
  <p>There are two large holes in the roof, through which the bleak October breeze
    comes sighing in, and the sweet smell of stale incense which usually hangs
    about the place of worship has yielded to the pungent odour of charred wood
    and of singed draperies.</p>
  <p>On the Flemish side a dull tone of colour prevails, browns and russets and
    dull reds&mdash;many women have wrapped black hoods over their heads, and
    long, black mantles hang from their shoulders; but on the other side the
    fantastic garb of the Spanish halberdiers throws a note of trenchant yellow
    right through the sombre tint of the picture: and the white ruffs round the
    men&rsquo;s necks gleam like pale stars upon the canvas. And over it all
    the light through the broken window falls crude and grey. Only the chancel
    glows with a warm light, and Father van der Schlicht&rsquo;s vestments of
    crimson silk, the gilt candlesticks upon the high altar, the flickering yellow
    flames of the candles, the red cassocks of the young servers, all form a
    kaleidoscope of brilliant colours which is almost dazzling, whilst up above,
    the banners and coats-of-arms of the Knights of the Golden Fleece still flaunt
    their rich heraldic tints against the dark vaulting of the roof, and above
    the high altar the figure of the Redeemer with arms stretched out to bless,
    seems to mock by its exquisite pathos and peace the hideous strifes of men.</p>
  <p>The church is crowded from end to end: Flemings and Walloons and Spaniards,
    the tyrants and the oppressed, all kneel together, while Father van der Schlicht
    up at the altar softly murmurs the Confiteor: some have rough linen bandages
    round their head or arm; some have ugly stains upon their doublet or hose;
    others&mdash;unable to stand or lean&mdash;lie half prone upon the ground,
    supported by their comrades. The Duke of Alva holds his head erect, and se&ntilde;or
    de Vargas bows his down until it well-nigh touches the ground: most of the
    women are crying, some of them faint and have to be carried away. The Spaniards
    are more demonstrative in their devotions than are the Netherlanders, they
    strike their breasts at the Confiteor, with wide, ostentatious gestures,
    and need much elbow room when they make the sign of the Cross.</p>
  <p>At the reading of the Gospel every one stands, and men, women and children
    solemnly make profession of that Faith of Love and Goodwill which the events
    of the past two days have so wantonly outraged.</p>
  <p>Lenora from where she stands can see her husband&rsquo;s head&mdash;with
    its closely-cropped brown hair&mdash;towering above the rest of the crowd.
    He does not look to right or left of him, but gazes fixedly upon the altar;
    Lenora can see his lips moving as he recites the Creed, and to her straining
    senses it seems as if right through the murmurings of all these people she
    can distinguish his voice amongst all the others, and that it strikes against
    her heart with sweet persistence of unforgettable memories.</p>
  <p>And suddenly the high altar with the figure of the Redeemer fades from her
    sight; the crowds vanish, the priest disappears, the voices of the choir
    boys are stilled. She is back once more in the small <i>tapperij</i> of the
    inn at Dendermonde, sitting beside the hearth with Mark&mdash;her husband&mdash;half
    kneeling, half sitting close to her&mdash;she lives again those few moments
    of dreamlike peace and joy when he lulled her with gentle words and tender
    glances which had shown her the first glimpse of what human happiness might
    be&mdash;and she lives again the moment when she stood in that same room
    with his wounded arm in her hand, and realised that he was the cowardly assassin
    who had struck Ramon down in the dark.</p>
  <p>God in Heaven! was not her hatred of him justified? Even at the foot of
    this altar, where all should be peace and goodwill, had she not the right
    to hate this one man who had murdered Ramon, who had fooled and cajoled her,
    and used her as an insentient tool for his own ends, his own amusement? Her
    father had told her that she would see him hanged, and that his death would
    be her work under the guidance of God. Not one moment of the past would she
    undo, and she regretted nothing save the moments of weakness which came over
    her whenever she met his glance. He was the leader of these abominable rebels&mdash;a
    leader every inch of him, that she could see&mdash;but yet a murderer for
    all that, and the deadly enemy of her country and her King.</p>
  <p>God had had His will with her, and now He was dealing punishment with equal
    justice to all; and Lenora standing there, shivering under the cold draught
    which came on her from the shattered roof, yet inwardly burning with a fever
    of regret and of longing, marvelled, if among the thousands that would suffer
    through God&rsquo;s retributive justice, any one would endure the martyrdom
    which she was suffering now.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Later on, during the noonday rest, Lenora sat in her room in the Meeste-Toren
    and tried to visualise once more all that she had lived through in the past
    hour&mdash;her meeting with Mark when she went through the Orangist lines
    with her father&mdash;the crowded church, the sombre colours, the pathetic
    aspect of broken statuary and holy images charred and shattered&mdash;the
    return to the Kasteel in silence&mdash;the outline of Mark&rsquo;s profile
    above the crowd&mdash;Mark! always Mark! If only she could forget!</p>
  <p>The air in the narrow room felt stuffy and oppressive: she ordered Grete
    to open the window. It gave on the same iron balcony to which the council
    chamber and the apartments of the Duke of Alva had access; but as it was
    high up in the wall and very small, she could sit quite close beside it and
    yet not be seen by any one who might be walking on the balcony. Lenora&rsquo;s
    head ached intolerably, and Grete, always kind and anxious, took down the
    wavy masses of fair hair and brushed them gently, so as to soothe the quivering
    nerves.</p>
  <p>A strange hush hung in the air&mdash;the hush of a Sunday afternoon when
    a big and peaceful city is at rest&mdash;a hush in strange and almost weird
    contrast to the din which had shaken up the very atmosphere during the past
    two days. Only from the castle-yard down below there comes the sad sound
    of groans and sighs of pain, and an occasional call for &ldquo;donna Lenora!&rdquo;  with
    the cool, soft hands and the gentle voice, the ministering angel of goodness
    and consolation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete,&rdquo; queried Lenora abruptly, &ldquo;dost love me truly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With my whole heart, noble lady,&rdquo; replied the child simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, if thou lovest me, didst pray at Mass this morning for the
    success of our cause and the confusion of those abominable rebels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grete made no reply, and anon a low, suppressed sob caused Lenora to say,
    not unkindly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thy heart is with the rebels, Grete.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know most of their leaders, noble lady,&rdquo;  murmured the girl,
    through her tears. &ldquo;They are brave, fine men. When I think of those
    who surely must die after this, I feel as if my heart must break with sorrow
    and with pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst know them well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, noble lady. They used to come to the &lsquo;Three Weavers.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Three Weavers,&rsquo; Grete?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! my father kept the tavern, here in Ghent.... The noble seigniors
    of the city and the Spanish officers of the garrison all used to come to
    us in the afternoons.... Messire Jan van Migrode, the Chief Sheriff, Messire
    Lievin van Deynse and the seigneur de Beauvoir, they all came regularly.
    And ... and Messire Mark van Rycke,&rdquo; she added under her breath, &ldquo;him
    they call Leatherface.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband, Grete,&rdquo; murmured Lenora.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know it, noble lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst know then that Messire Mark van Rycke was Leatherface?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not till yesterday, noble lady ... not till the men spoke of it and
    said that the mysterious Leatherface was the leader of the rebels ... and
    that he was the son of the High-Bailiff of Ghent, Messire Mark van Rycke....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou didst know him, too, then as Leatherface?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, noble lady,&rdquo; said Grete quietly, &ldquo;he saved my life
    and my sister&rsquo;s. I would give mine to save him now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saved thy life? How? When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only a few days ago, noble lady,&rdquo; murmured the child, speaking
    with a great effort at self-control. The recollection of that awful night
    brought fresh terror to her heart.</p>
  <p>But Lenora&rsquo;s brows contracted now in puzzlement. A few days ago? Mark
    was courting her then....</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; she said impatiently, &ldquo;a few days
    ago Leatherface ... Messire Mark van Rycke ... was in Ghent ... I was betrothed
    to him on the seventh day of this month....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis on that night he saved my life ... and Katrine&rsquo;s
    ... aye! and saved us from worse than death....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused abruptly; her round, young cheeks lost their last vestige of
    colour, her eyes their clear, childlike look. She cast a quick, furtive glance
    on Lenora as if she were, afraid. But Lenora was unconscious of this change
    in the girl&rsquo;s manner, her very senses seemed to be on the alert, hanging
    upon the peasant girl&rsquo;s lips.... The night of her betrothal was the
    night on which Ramon was murdered ... the tavern of the &ldquo;Three Weavers&rdquo; was
    the place where he was found. This girl then knew something of that awesome
    occurrence, which, despite outside assurances, had remained vaguely puzzling
    to Lenora&rsquo;s mind. Now she would hear and know, and her very heart seemed
    to stand still as her mind appeared to be waiting upon the threshold of a
    mystery which was interwoven with her whole life, and with her every hope
    of peace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; she queried with agonised impatience. &ldquo;Speak,
    girl! Canst not see that I only live to hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our father was taken,&rdquo; said Grete quietly, &ldquo;he was hanged
    eight days ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hanged?&rdquo; exclaimed Lenora, horror-struck. &ldquo;Why? What
    had he done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was of the Protestant faith ... and...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lenora made no comment, and the girl wiped her eyes, which had filled with
    tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou and Katrine were spared?&rdquo; asked Lenora, after awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were spared at the time,&rdquo; said Grete, &ldquo;but I suppose,&rdquo; she
    added with quaint philosophy, &ldquo;we remained objects of suspicion. The
    soldiers would often be very rough with us, and upon the seventh day of October
    the commanding Spanish officer in Ghent...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more she paused timidly, fear of having said too much, fighting with
    the childish love to retail her woes, and pour her interesting story into
    sympathetic ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried Lenora, more impatiently, &ldquo;go on, child.
    What did the commanding Spanish officer in Ghent do to thee on the seventh
    day of October?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at this Grete burst into a flood of tears. The events were so recent,
    and the shock of horror and of fear had been so terrible at the time, that
    the recollection of it all still had the power to unnerve her. Lenora, whose
    own nerves were cruelly on the rack at this moment, had much ado to keep
    her impatience in check. After a few moments Grete became more calm, and
    dried her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a big to-do at the Town House,&rdquo; she said more quietly, &ldquo;and
    the whole city was gaily decorated. The apprentices had a holiday in the
    evening. They were very hilarious, and so were the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The soldiers came to the &lsquo;Three Weavers.&rsquo; They had been
    drinking heavily, and were very rough. The commanding Spanish officer came
    in late in the evening.... He encouraged the soldiers to drink, and to ...
    to make fun of us ... of Katrine and of me.... We were all alone in the house,
    and we were very frightened. The Spanish officer ordered Katrine to wait
    on the soldiers, then he made me go with him to a private room....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tears were once more very near the surface, and a hot blush of shame
    for all that she had had to endure overspread Grete&rsquo;s face and neck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, child,&rdquo; queried Lenora. &ldquo;What happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Spanish officer was very cruel to me, noble lady. I think he
    would have killed me, and I am sure the soldiers were very cruel to Katrine....
    Oh! it was horrible! horrible!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and we were quite
    alone and helpless....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I know that,&rdquo; said Lenora, and even to herself her own
    voice sounded curiously dull and toneless; &ldquo;but tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was crouching in a corner of the room, noble lady. My back ached
    terribly, for I had been thrown across the table, and I thought my spine
    must be broken&mdash;my wrists, too, were very painful where the noble officer
    had held them so tightly. I was half wild with terror, for I did not know
    what would become of me. Then the door opened, and a man came in. Oh! I was
    dreadfully frightened. He was very tall and very thin, like a dark wraith,
    and over his face he had a mask. And he spoke kindly to me&mdash;and after
    awhile I was less frightened&mdash;and then he told me just what to do, how
    to find Katrine, to take some money and run away to our kinswoman who lives
    in Dendermonde. I thought then that he was no wraith...&rdquo; continued
    Grete in an awestruck whisper, &ldquo;but just one of the archangels. For
    they do appear in curious disguises sometimes ... he saved my life and Katrine&rsquo;s,
    and more than life, noble lady,&rdquo; added the girl with a note of dignity
    in her tone, which sat quaintly upon her timid little person, &ldquo;do you
    not think that it was God who sent him to protect two innocent girls from
    the cruelty of those wicked men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I think so, child,&rdquo; said Lenora quietly. &ldquo;But, tell
    me, dost know what happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, lady, I do not. I went to look for Katrine, just as the stranger
    ordered me to do. But,&rdquo; she added under her breath, and still under
    the spell of past terrors, &ldquo;we heard afterwards through Pierre Beauters,
    the butcher, that the noble seignior commandant was found killed that same
    night in the tavern of the &lsquo;Three Weavers.&rsquo; The provost found
    him lying dead in the same room where the archangel had appeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed, child, didst thou say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, noble lady. The provost told Pierre Beauters that the noble Spanish
    commandant had been felled by mighty hands in a hand-to-hand fight; he had
    no wound on him, only the marks of powerful fingers round his throat. But
    his own dagger, they say, was covered in blood. Pierre Beauters helped to
    place the body in the coffin, and he said that the noble Spanish commandant
    had been killed in fair fight&mdash;a fight with fists, and not with swords.
    He also said that the stranger who killed him was the mysterious Leatherface,
    of whom we hear so much, and that, mayhap, we should never hear of him again,
    for the Spanish commandant must have wounded him to death ... the dagger
    was covered with blood almost to the hilt. But,&rdquo; concluded Grete, with
    a knowing little nod of the head, &ldquo;this I did not believe at the time,
    and now I know that it was not so; the stranger may not have been one of
    the archangels, but truly he was a messenger of God. When the noble lady
    brought me back with her to Ghent I heard the men talking about the mysterious
    Leatherface. Then the day before yesterday when the cavalrymen flew helter-skelter
    into the castle-yard, they still talked loudly of Leatherface; but I guessed
    then that he was not a real archangel, but just a brave man who protects
    the weak, and fights for justice, and...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, terrified at what she had said. Ignorant as she was, she knew
    well enough that the few last words which she had uttered had caused men
    and women to be burned at the stake before now. Wide-eyed and full of fear
    she looked on the noble Spanish lady, expecting every moment to see a commanding
    finger pointed on her, and orders given for her immediate arrest.</p>
  <p>Instead of which she saw before her a pale, slim girl scarce older than
    herself, and infinitely more pathetic, just a young and beautiful woman with
    pale face and eyes swimming in tears, whose whole attitude just expressed
    an immense and overwhelming grief.</p>
  <p>The veil of mystery which had hung over Ramon&rsquo;s death had indeed been
    lifted at last by the rough, uncouth hands of the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter.
    Lenora as yet hardly dared to look into the vista which it opened up before
    her: boundless remorse, utter hopelessness, the dreary sense of the irreparable&mdash;all
    that lay beyond the present stunning blow of this terrible revelation.</p>
  <p>God in Heaven! she cried out mutely in her misery, how could she ever have
    thought&mdash;even for a moment&mdash;that those grey eyes, so merry and
    yet so tender&mdash;could mask a treacherous and cowardly soul? How could
    she think that those lips which so earnestly pleaded for a kiss could ever
    have been framed to hide a lying tongue? Would to God that she could still
    persuade herself that all this new revelation was a dream; that Grete&mdash;the
    unsophisticated child&mdash;had lied and concocted the whole story to further
    some hidden schemes of her own! Would to God she could still believe that
    Mark was vile and false&mdash;an assassin and a perjurer&mdash;and that she
    could hate him still!</p>
  <p>She met Grete&rsquo;s eyes fixed so fearfully upon hers&mdash;she met them
    at the moment when she was about to give herself over to the transient happiness
    of a brief day-dream ... dreams of two unforgettable hours when he sat beside
    her with his hand shading his face ... his eyes resting upon her ... dreams
    of his voice when he said: &ldquo;When I look at you, Madonna, I invariably
    think of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>But Grete recalled her to herself, and to the awful present. Despite her
    great respect for the noble Spanish lady, she suddenly put her arms round
    her shoulders, and tried to draw her away from the open window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Highness!&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly, &ldquo;he will see
    us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What matters, child,&rdquo; murmured Lenora, &ldquo;he will not harm
    us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively, however, she did yield to Grete&rsquo;s insistence and drew
    back slightly from the window. From the balcony down below there came the
    sound of measured tramping. Two or three men were walking there slowly up
    and down and talking confidentially together while they walked. Whenever
    they were close to the window their voices came up quite distinctly, but
    it was impossible to hear all that they said, but one or two disjointed sentences
    gave a faint clue to the subject of their conversation. Lenora now leaned
    closer to the window-frame trying to hear, for she had recognised her father&rsquo;s
    voice as well as that of the Duke of Alva, and they were speaking of their
    future plans against the rebels and against the city, and Lenora felt that
    she would give her life to know what those plans were.</p>
  <p>After a moment or two she heard the voice of Captain de Avila; he was apparently
    coming up the iron stairs from the yard and was speaking hurriedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A runner, your Highness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;straight from Dendermonde.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; queried the Duke, and his voice sounded almost
    choked as if with fierce impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of Captain Lodrono&rsquo;s messengers reached Dendermonde last
    night,&rdquo; replied de Avila, &ldquo;he was lucky enough to get a horse
    almost at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well...? and...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This man came running straight back to bring us the news! Captain
    Bracamonte started at break of day: he should be well on his way with the
    reinforcements by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a hoarse exclamation of satisfaction and a confused murmur of
    voices for a moment or two. Then de Vargas spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a bold venture, Monseigneur,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This truce, you mean?&rdquo; retorted Alva. &ldquo;Well! not quite
    so bold as it appeared. Those Netherlanders are such mighty fools that it
    is always easy to make them believe anything that we choose to tell them:
    do they not always fall into our traps? I had only to swear by my immortal
    soul that we had not sent for reinforcements and the last of their resistance
    was overcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lenora could hear her father&rsquo;s harsh laugh after this and then del
    Rio said blandly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Rycke did not believe in that oath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not at first,&rdquo; Alva said, &ldquo;but it was so finely
    worded and spoken with such solemnity, it was bound to carry conviction in
    the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were not afraid, Monseigneur,&rdquo; queried de Vargas, &ldquo;this
    morning ... in the crowd ... after Mass ... that the rebels would break the
    truce and fall upon our men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Duke curtly, &ldquo;were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There came no answer from de Vargas, and to the listeners it seemed as if
    by his silence he was admitting that he did not believe the Orangists capable
    of such abominable treachery. A fine tribute that&mdash;Lenora thought&mdash;from
    her father who hated and despised the Netherlanders! But he and Alva would
    even now call such loyalty and truth the mere stupidity of uncultured clowns.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow it was worth the risk,&rdquo; de Vargas resumed after awhile,
    with that cold cynicism which will sacrifice friends, adherents, kindred
    for the furtherance of political aims.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well worth the risk,&rdquo; asserted Alva, &ldquo;we have gained
    the whole of to-day. If these rebels had rushed the Kasteel this morning,
    I verily believe that we could not have held it: I might have fallen into
    their hands and&mdash;with me as their hostage&mdash;they would by now have
    been in a position to dictate their own terms before reinforcements reached
    us&mdash;always supposing that they did not murder us all. Yes,&rdquo; he
    reiterated with obvious satisfaction, &ldquo;even if treachery had been in
    the air it was still well worth the risk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile...&rdquo; suggested del Rio.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile Bracamonte is on his way here.... He must have started
    well before noon ... he might be here before nightfall....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With at least five thousand men, I hope,&rdquo; added de Vargas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Night may see us masters of this city once more, seigniors,&rdquo; rejoined
    Alva, &ldquo;and by God we&rsquo;ll punish those rebels for the fright they
    have given us. Ghent will be envying Mons and Mechlin....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The three men walked slowly away after that, and their voices were lost
    in the distance. The listeners could no longer distinguish what was said,
    but anon a harsh laugh struck their ear, and leaning out of the window Lenora
    could see the Duke and her father standing just outside the council-chamber.
    The Duke had thrown back his head and was laughing heartily, de Vargas too
    looked highly amused. Not one single word of remorse or regret had been spoken
    by either of them for the blasphemous oath which had finally overcome the
    resistance of the Orangists: of a truth it did not weigh on the conscience
    of the man who had so wantonly outraged his Maker less than an hour before
    he knelt at the foot of His Altar, and de Vargas and his kind were only too
    ready to benefit by the perjury.</p>
  <p>The sack of Ghent&mdash;jeopardised for a few hours&mdash;was once more
    looming ahead as a coveted prize. What was a false oath or so&mdash;one crime
    the more&mdash;when weighed in the balance with all the money and treasure
    which the unexpected resistance of a few Flemish clowns had so nearly wrenched
    from these noble Spaniards&rsquo; grasp?</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst hear?&rdquo; came in a smothered whisper from Lenora. She had
    turned suddenly and now faced Grete, who stood wide-eyed and terrified in
    the centre of the room. Her arms were behind her, and she clung to the window-ledge:
    her fair hair&mdash;all loose&mdash;streamed round her shoulders; pale, with
    glowing eyes and quivering lips, she looked like some beautiful feline creature
    at bay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didst hear?&rdquo; she reiterated hoarsely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every word, most noble lady,&rdquo; came the whispered response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What didst make of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That His Highness sent to Dendermonde for help, and that troops are
    on their way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But His Highness swore most solemnly that he would respect the truce
    which he himself asked for, and that both sides would resume the fight ...
    this evening ... just as they were before ... without fresh help or reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard the men say last night, noble lady, that reinforcements had
    already been sent for from Dendermonde ... the Duke feared that the Netherlanders
    were getting the upper hand ... he asked for the truce only to gain time....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then ... if Captain Bracamonte arrives from Dendermonde with fresh
    troops the Netherlanders are lost!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God guard them,&rdquo; said Grete fervently. &ldquo;He alone can
    save them now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Lenora with sudden passionate bitterness, &ldquo;how
    can men conceive such abominable treachery? How can God allow them to triumph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grete said nothing. Her eyes were full of tears. Lenora stared straight
    out before her into the dark corner of the room: there was a frown of deep
    thought between her brows, and her fresh young mouth became hard and set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;is it not horrible to think
    that those we care for are liars and traitors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Grete made no reply, she continued with the same passionate vehemence: &ldquo;Is
    it not horrible to think that brave men must be butchered like cattle, because
    they trusted in the oath of a perjurer? ... Oh! that all the baseness, all
    the lying should be on one side and all the heroism on the other! and that
    God should allow those monsters to triumph!...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and suddenly her whole expression changed&mdash;the vehemence,
    the passion went out of it ... her lips ceased to quiver, a curious pallor
    overspread her cheeks and the lines of her mouth became hard and set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;art afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of what, noble lady?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! of everything ... of insults and violence and death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, noble lady,&rdquo; said Grete simply. &ldquo;I trust to God to
    protect me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then wilt come with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whither, noble lady?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into the city ... alone with me ... we&rsquo;ll pretend that we go
    to Benediction....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into the city...?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Art afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then put up my hair and get hood and cloak and give me mine....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grete did as she was ordered. She pinned up Lenora&rsquo;s fair hair and
    brought her a mantle and hood and wrapped them round her: then she fastened
    on her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Lenora curtly.</p>
  <p>She took the girl by the hand and together the two women went out of the
    room. Their way led them through endless corridors and down a long, winding
    staircase; hand in hand they ran like furtive little animals on the watch
    for the human enemy. Down below the big flagged hall was full of soldiers:
    the two women only realised this when they reached the last landing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will they let us pass?&rdquo; murmured Grete.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walk beside me and hold thy head boldly,&rdquo; said Lenora, &ldquo;they
    must not think that we are afraid of being challenged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She walked down the last flight of the stairs with slow majestic steps:
    her arms folded beneath her cloak, looking straight ahead of her with that
    air of calm detachment and contempt of others which the Spanish <i>noblesse</i> knew
    so well how to assume.</p>
  <p>Captain de Avila was below: at sight of donna Lenora he came forward and
    said with absolute respect:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La se&ntilde;ora desires to go out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; she replied haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not further than the precincts of the Kasteel, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that to you, whither I go?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My orders...&rdquo; he stammered, somewhat taken aback by this grand
    manner on the part of the se&ntilde;ora who had always been so meek and silent
    hitherto.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What orders have you had, seigneur capitaine?&rdquo;  she queried, &ldquo;which
    warrant your interference with my movements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ... truly...&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;se&ntilde;or de Vargas...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father, I presume, has not given you the right to question my
    freedom to go and come as I please,&rdquo; she retorted, still with the same
    uncompromising hauteur.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No ... but...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you let me pass.... I hear the bells of St. Phara&iuml;lde
    ... I shall be late for Benediction....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She swept past him, leaving him not a little bewildered and completely abashed.
    He watched her tall, graceful figure as she sailed through the portico and
    thence across the castle-yard, then he shrugged his shoulders as if to cast
    aside any feeling of responsibility which threatened to worry him, and returned
    to the guard-room and to his game of hazard. It was only then that he recollected
    that it lacked another two hours to Benediction yet.</p>
  <p>In the yard Lenora had more serious misgivings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the guard at the gate-house,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Keep
    up thy look of unconcern, Grete. We can only win if we are bold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she anticipated the provost at the gate-house challenged her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I go to St. Phara&iuml;lde,&rdquo; she said calmly, &ldquo;my father
    is with me. He hath stopped to speak with Captain de Avila. Lower the bridge,
    provost, and let us pass. We are late enough for Benediction as it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The provost hesitated for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The seigneur capitaine sent me orders just now that no one was to
    leave the Kasteel,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I under the seigneur capitaine&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;or
    the daughter of se&ntilde;or de Vargas, who will punish thee, sirrah, for
    thine insolence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The provost, much disturbed in his mind, had not the courage to run counter
    to the noble lady&rsquo;s wish. He had had no orders with regard to her,
    and as she very rightly said, she was not under the orders of the seigneur
    capitaine.</p>
  <p>He ordered the bridge to be lowered for her, vaguely intending not to let
    her pass until he assured himself that se&ntilde;or de Vargas was nigh: but
    Lenora gave him no time for reflection: she waited until the bridge was down,
    then suddenly she seized Grete&rsquo;s hand and quick as a young hare she
    darted past the provost and the guard before they thought of laying hands
    on her, and she was across the bridge before they had recovered from their
    surprise.</p>
  <p>Once on the open ground Lenora drew breath. The provost and the guard could
    not very well run after her, and for the moment she was safe from pursuit.
    On ahead lay the sharp bend of the Lower Schelde, beyond it the ruined mass
    of the Vleeshhuis, and the row of houses, now all shattered to pieces, where
    the Orangists held their watch. Her heart was beating furiously, and she
    felt Grete&rsquo;s rough little hand quivering in hers. She felt such a tiny
    atom, a mere speck in this wide open space. In front of her was the city,
    which seemed even in the silence of this Sunday afternoon to be quivering
    in the throes of oncoming death: to right and left of her the great tract
    of flat country, this land of Belgium which she had not yet learned to love
    but for which she now felt a wonderful pity.</p>
  <p>It was a rude lesson which she had been made to learn within the last hour:
    the lesson that the idols of her childhood and girlhood had not only feet
    of clay but that they were steeped to the neck in the mire of falsehoods
    and treachery: she had also learned that the man whom she had once hated
    with such passionate bitterness was worthy of a pure woman&rsquo;s love:
    that happiness had knocked at the gateway of her own heart and been refused
    admittance: and that God was not wont to give very obvious guidance in the
    terrible perplexities which at times beset His creatures.</p>
  <p>Therefore now she no longer lured herself with the belief that she was acting
    at this moment under the direct will of God, she knew that she was guided
    by an overmastering and blind instinct which told her that she must see Mark&mdash;at
    once&mdash;and warn him that the perfidy of the Duke of Alva had set a deathly
    trap for him and for his friends.</p>
  <p>A few more minutes and she and Grete were over the Ketel Br&uuml;ghe and
    under the shadow of the tall houses on the river embankment beyond.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take me!&rdquo; she said to Grete peremptorily, &ldquo;to the house
    of the High-Bailiff of Ghent.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    The Last Stand</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The word has gone round, we must all assemble in the cathedral church&mdash;every
    burgher, every artisan, every apprentice who belongs by blood to Ghent must
    for the nonce cast aside pick and shovel: the dead can wait! the living claim
    attention.</p>
  <p>Quite a different crowd from that which knelt at prayer this morning! It
    is just two o&rsquo;clock and the sacred edifice is thronged: up in the galleries,
    the aisles, the chancel, the organ loft, the pulpit, everywhere there are
    men&mdash;young and old&mdash;men who for two days now have been face to
    face with death and who wear on their grim faces the traces of the past fierce
    struggle and of the coming cataclysm. There are no women present. They have
    nobly taken on the task of the men, and the dainty burghers&rsquo; wives
    who used to spend their time at music or needlework, wield the spade to-day
    with as much power as their strength allows.</p>
  <p>Perfect order reigns despite the magnitude of the crowd: those who found
    no place inside the building, throng the cemetery and the precincts. Behind
    the high altar the Orangist standard is unfurled, and in front of the altar
    rails stand the men who have fought in the forefront of the insurgents&rsquo; ranks,
    who have led every assault, affronted every danger, braved musket fire and
    arrow-shot and burning buildings and crumbling ruins, the men who have endured
    and encouraged and cheered: Mark van Rycke the popular leader, Laurence his
    brother, Pierre Deynoot, Lievin van Deynse, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric van Beveren
    and Jan van Migrode, who is seriously wounded but who has risen from his
    sick bed and crawled hither in order to add the weight of his counsel and
    of his enthusiasm to what he knows van Rycke will propose.</p>
  <p>Yes! they are there, all those that are left! and with them are the older
    burghers, the civic dignitaries of their city, the Sheriffs of the Keure,
    the aldermen, the vroedschappen, the magistrates, and the High-Bailiff himself&mdash;he
    who is known to be such a hot adherent of Alva.</p>
  <p>It is he who has convened this meeting&mdash;a general rally of the citizens
    of Ghent. He called them together by roll of drums and by word of mouth transmitted
    by volunteer messengers who have flown all over the town. This morning we
    spent in prayer&mdash;to-day is a day of peace&mdash;let us meet and talk
    things over, for if wisdom waits upon enthusiasm, all is not lost yet. The
    proposal has come from the High-Bailiff, at the hour of noon when men only
    thought of the grim work of burying the dead, and women wandered through
    the streets to search for the loved one who has been missing since yesterday.</p>
  <p>But at the word of the High-Bailiff the men laid aside their picks and spades.
    If all is not lost, why then there&rsquo;s something still to do and&mdash;the
    dead must wait.</p>
  <p>And every man goes to the cathedral church to hear what the High-Bailiff
    has to say: the church and precincts are crowded. In silence every one listens
    whilst he speaks. He has always been a faithful subject of King Philip, an
    obedient servant of the Regent and the Lieutenant-Governor: his influence
    and well-known adherence to the King has saved the city many a time from
    serious reprisals against incipient revolt and from many of the horrors of
    the Inquisition. Now, while up there in the Kasteel Alva impatiently awaits
    the arrival of fresh troops which will help to crush the rebellious city,
    the High-Bailiff pleads for submission.</p>
  <p>He has faith in the human tiger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us throw ourselves at his feet,&rdquo; he urges, &ldquo;he is
    a brave soldier, a great warrior. He will respect your valorous resistance
    if he sees that in the hour when you have the advantage over him you are
    prepared to give in, and to throw yourselves upon his mercy. Let us go&mdash;we
    who are older and wiser&mdash;let those who have led this unfortunate revolt
    keep out of the way&mdash;I will find the right words I know to melt the
    heart of our Lieutenant-Governor now turned in wrath against us&mdash;let
    us go and cry for mercy and, by God, I believe that we shall get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Like the waves upon the sea, the crowd in the church moves and oscillates:
    murmurs of assent and dissent mingle from end to end, from side to side: &ldquo;No!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;&rsquo;Twere
    shameful!&mdash;&rsquo;Twere wise!&mdash;There are the women to think of!&mdash;And
    the children!&mdash;He will not listen!&mdash;Why this purposeless abasement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Van Rycke and the other leaders make no comment upon the High-Bailiff&rsquo;s
    appeal&mdash;even though their whole soul revolts at the thought of this
    fresh humiliation to be endured by the burghers of Ghent, once so proud and
    so independent! But they won&rsquo;t speak! Mark knows that with one word
    he can sway the whole of this crowd. They are heroes all&mdash;every one
    of these men. At one word from him they will cast aside every thought save
    that of the renewed fight&mdash;the final fight to the death&mdash;they are
    seething with enthusiasm, their blood is up and prudence and wisdom have
    to be drilled into them now that they have tasted of the martyr&rsquo;s cup.</p>
  <p>You can hear Father van der Schlicht&rsquo;s voice now. He too is for humility
    and an appeal for mercy on this the festival day of the Holy Redeemer. The
    Lieutenant-Governor is a pious man and a good Catholic. The appeal is sure
    to please his ears. Oh! the virtues that adorn the Duke of Alva in the estimation
    of his adherents! He is pious and he is brave! a good Catholic and a fine
    soldier! mercy in him is allied to wisdom! he will easily perceive that to
    gain the gratitude of the citizens of Ghent would be more profitable to him
    than the destruction of a prosperous city. See this truce which he himself
    suggested: was it not the product of a merciful and a religious mind? To
    pray in peace, to obey the dictates of the Church, to give the enemy the
    chance of burying the dead!&mdash;were these not the sentiments of a good
    and pious man?</p>
  <p>Messire Henri de Buck, senior Schepen and Judge of the High Court, has many
    tales to tell of the kindness and generosity of the Duke. Oh! they are very
    eloquent, these wealthy burghers who have so much more to lose by this revolt
    than mere honour and mere life!</p>
  <p>And the others listen! Oh yes! they listen! need a stone be left unturned?
    and since Messire the High-Bailiff hath belief in his own eloquence, why!
    let him exercise it of course. Not that there is one whit less determination
    in any single man in the crowd! If the High-Bailiff fails in his mission,
    they will fight to the last man still, but ... oh! who can shut his heart
    altogether against hope? And there are the women and the children ... and
    all those who are old and feeble.</p>
  <p>God speed to you then, my Lord High-Bailiff&mdash;Charles van Rycke, the
    pusillanimous father of a gallant son! God speed to all of you who go to
    plead with a tiger to spare the prey which he already holds between his claws!
    The High-Bailiff will go and with him Father van der Schlicht and Father
    Laurent Toch from St. Agneten, and Messire de Buck and Fran&ccedil;ois de
    Wetteren: all the men who two days ago were kneeling in the mud at the tyrant&rsquo;s
    feet, and presented him so humbly with the gates of the city which he had
    sworn to destroy. There is no cheering as they detach themselves from the
    group of the rebel leaders who still stand somewhat apart, leaving the crowd
    to have its will.</p>
  <p>No cheering, it is all done in silence! Men do not cheer on the eve of being
    butchered; they only look on their standard up above the high altar behind
    the carved figure of the Redeemer, and though they have given silent consent
    for this deputation to the tyrant they still murmur in their hearts: &ldquo;For
    Orange and Liberty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jan van Migrode, weak and ill from his wound, has had the last word. He
    begs that every one should wait&mdash;here&mdash;just as they are ... in
    silence and patience ... until the High-Bailiff and his friends come back
    with the news ... good or bad! peace or renewed fighting&mdash;life or death!&mdash;whichever
    it is they must all be together in order to decide.</p>
  <p>Just at the last the High-Bailiff turns to his son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not approve of our going, Mark?&rdquo; he asks with some diffidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that it is purposeless,&rdquo; replies Mark; &ldquo;you cannot
    extract blood out of a stone, or mercy out of the heart of a brute!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>They go, the once proud burghers of the city of Ghent, they go to throw
    themselves for the last time at the feet of that monster of tyranny and cruelty
    who even at this hour is gloating over the thought of the most deadly reprisals
    he hath ever dealt to these down-trodden people.</p>
  <p>They go with grave yet hopeful faces, in their dark robes which are the
    outward sign of the humility, the loyalty which dwell in their hearts. The
    crowd have wished them God speed! and as they file out of the stately cathedral
    and through the close, the men stand respectfully aside and eye them with
    a trustful regard which is infinitely pathetic. Their leaders have remained
    beside the altar rails, grouped together, talking quietly among themselves:
    Mark van Rycke, however, goes to mingle with the crowd, to speak with all
    those who desire a word with him, with the men whose heart is sore at the
    humiliation which they are forced to swallow, who would sooner have died
    than see the dignitaries of their city go once again as suppliants before
    that execrable tyrant whom they loathe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is thine idea, van Rycke?&rdquo; most of the men ask him as
    they crowd around him, anxious to hear one word of encouragement or of hope. &ldquo;Dost
    think the tyrant will relent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not unless we hold him as he holds us&mdash;not unless we have him
    at our mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what can we do? what can we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he reiterates for the hundredth time to-day,  &ldquo;do?
    Fight to the last man, die to the last man, until God, wearied of the tyrant&rsquo;s
    obstinacy, will crush him and give us grace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we cannot win in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! but we can die as we have lived, clean, undaunted, unconquered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But our wives, our daughters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask them,&rdquo; he retorts boldly. &ldquo;It is not the women who
    would lick the tyrant&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hour drags wearily on. In imagination every one inside and around the
    cathedral follows the burghers on their weary pilgrimage. Half an hour to
    walk to the Kasteel, half an hour for the audience with the Duke, half an
    hour to return ... unforeseen delay in obtaining admittance ... it may be
    two hours before they return. Great many of the men have returned to the
    gloomy task of burying the dead, others to that of clearing the streets from
    the litter which encumbers them: but even those who work the hardest keep
    their attention fixed upon the cathedral and its approach.</p>
  <p>Van Rycke had suggested that the great bell be rung when the burghers came
    back with the Duke&rsquo;s answer, so that all who wished could come and
    hear.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>And now the answer has come.</p>
  <p>The High-Bailiff has returned with Fathers van der Schlicht and Laurent
    Toch, with Aldermen de Buck and de Wetteren and with the others. They have
    walked back from the Kasteel bareheaded and shoeless with their hands tied
    behind their back, and a rope around their neck.</p>
  <p>That was the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s answer to the deputation of Flemish patricians
    and burghers who had presented themselves before him in order to sue for
    his mercy. They had not even been admitted into his presence. The provost
    at the gate-house had curtly demanded their business, had then taken their
    message to the Duke, and returned five minutes later with orders to &ldquo;send
    back the beggars whence they came, bareheaded and shoeless and with a rope
    around their necks in token of the only mercy which they might expect from
    him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bridge had been lowered for them when they arrived, but they were kept
    parleying with a provost at the gate-house: not a single officer&mdash;even
    of lower rank&mdash;deigned to come out to speak with them; the yard was
    filled with soldiers who insulted and jeered at them: the High-Bailiff was
    hit on the cheek by a stone which had been aimed at him, and Father Laurent
    Toch&rsquo;s soutane was almost torn off his back. Every one of them had
    suffered violence at the hands of the soldiery whilst the Duke&rsquo;s abominable
    orders were being carried out with appalling brutality: every one of them
    was bleeding from a cut or a blow dealt by that infamous crowd who were not
    ashamed thus to maltreat defenceless and elderly men.</p>
  <p>When they crossed the open tract of country between the castle moat and
    the Schelde a shower of caked mud was hurled after them from the ramparts;
    not a single insult was spared them, not a sting to their pride, not a crown
    to their humiliation. It was only when they reached the shelter of the streets
    that they found some peace. In silence they made their way toward the cathedral.
    The crowds of men and women at work amongst the dead and the wounded made
    way for them to allow them to pass, but no one questioned them: the abject
    condition in which they returned told its own pitiable tale.</p>
  <p>The cathedral bell had tolled, and from everywhere the men came back to
    hear the full account of the miserable mission. The crowd was dense and not
    every one had a view of the burghers as they stood beside the altar rail
    in all their humiliation, but those who were nearest told their neighbours
    and soon every one knew what had happened.</p>
  <p>The younger leaders ground their heels into the floor, and Jan van Migrode,
    sick and weak as he was, was the first to stand up and to ask the citizens
    of Ghent if the events of to-day had shaken them in their resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know now what to expect from that fiend. Will you still die like
    heroes, or be slaughtered like cattle?&rdquo; he called out loudly ere he
    fell back exhausted and faint.</p>
  <p>Horror had kept every one dumb until then, and grim resolve did not break
    into loud enthusiasm now, but on the fringe of the crowd there were a number
    of young men&mdash;artisans and apprentices&mdash;who at first sight of the
    returned messengers had loudly murmured and cursed. Now one of them lifted
    up his voice. It raised strange echoes in the mutilated church.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are ready enough to die,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll
    fight to the end, never fear. But before the last of us is killed, before
    that execrable tyrant has his triumph over us, lads of Ghent, I ask you are
    we not to have our revenge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; came from a number of voices, still from the fringe
    of the crowd where the young artisans were massed together, &ldquo;well spoken,
    Peter Balde! let us have revenge first!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenge! Revenge!&rdquo; echoed from those same ranks.</p>
  <p>Every word echoed from pillar to pillar in the great, bare, crowded church;
    and now it was from the altar rails that Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s voice rang
    out clear and firm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What revenge dost propose to take, Peter Balde?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>
  <p>The other, thus directly challenged by the man whose influence was paramount
    in Ghent just now, looked round at his friends for approval. Seeing nothing
    but eager, flushed faces and eyes that glowed in response to his suggestion,
    the pride of leadership entered his soul. He was a fine, tall lad who yesterday
    had done prodigies of valour against the Spanish cavalry. Now he had been
    gesticulating with both arms above his head so that he was easily distinguishable
    in the crowd by those who had a clear view, and in order to emphasize his
    spokesmanship his friends hoisted him upon their shoulders and bearing him
    aloft they forged their way through the throng until they reached the centre
    of the main aisle. Here they paused, and Peter Balde could sweep the entire
    crowd with his enthusiastic glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I revenge would take?&rdquo; he said boldly. &ldquo;Nay! let
    me rather ask: what revenge <i>must</i> we take, citizens of Ghent? The tyrant even
    now has abused the most sacred laws of humanity which bid every man to respect
    the messengers of peace. He is disloyal and ignoble and false. Why should
    we be honourable and just? He neither appreciates our loyalty nor respects
    our valour&mdash;let us then act in the only way which he can understand.
    Citizens, we have two thousand prisoners in the cellars of our guildhouses&mdash;two
    thousand Walloons who under the banner of our common tyrant have fought against
    us ... their nearest kindred. I propose that we kill those two thousand prisoners
    and send their heads to the tyrant as a direct answer to this last outrage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! Well said!&rdquo; came from every side, from the younger
    artisans and the apprentices, the hot-headed faction amongst all these brave
    men&mdash;brave themselves but writhing under the terrible humiliation which
    they had just endured and thirsting for anything that savoured of revenge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! the axe for them! send their heads to the tyrant! Well
    spoken, Peter Balde,&rdquo; they cried.</p>
  <p>The others remained silent. Many even amongst the older men perhaps would
    have echoed the younger ones&rsquo; call: cruelty breeds cruelty and oppression
    breeds callous thoughts of revenge. Individually there was hardly a man there
    who was capable of such an act of atrocious barbarism as the murder of a
    defenceless prisoner, but for years now these people had groaned under such
    abominable tyranny, had seen such acts of wanton outrage perpetrated against
    them and all those they held dear, that&mdash;collectively&mdash;their sense
    of rightful retribution had been warped and they had imbibed some of the
    lessons of reprisals from their execrable masters.</p>
  <p>At the foot of the altar rails the group of leaders who stood as a phalanx
    around Mark van Rycke their chief, waited quietly whilst the wave of enthusiasm
    for Balde&rsquo;s proposal rose and swelled and mounted higher and higher
    until it seemed to pervade the whole of the sacred edifice, and then gradually
    subsided into more restrained if not less enthusiastic determination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will do it,&rdquo; said one of Balde&rsquo;s most fervent adherents. &ldquo;It
    is only justice, and it is the only law which the tyrant understands&mdash;the
    law of might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the law which he himself has taught us,&rdquo;  said another, &ldquo;the
    law of retributive justice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The law of treachery, of rapine, and of outrage,&rdquo;  now broke
    in Mark&rsquo;s firm, clear voice once more; it rose above the tumult, above
    the hubbub which centred round the person of Peter Balde; it rang against
    the pillars and echoed from end to end of the aisle. &ldquo;Are we miserable
    rabble that we even dream of murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not of murder,&rdquo; cried Balde in challenge, &ldquo;only of vengeance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your vengeance!&rdquo; thundered Mark, &ldquo;do you dare speak of
    it in the house of Him who says &lsquo;I will repay!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God is on our side, He will forgive!&rdquo; cried some of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything, except outrage! ... what you propose is a deed worthy
    only of hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! Balde is right! Magnanimity has had its day! But for this
    truce to-day who knows? we might have been masters of the Kasteel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will the murdering of helpless prisoners aid your cause, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will at least satisfy our craving for revenge!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, right, Balde!&rdquo; they all exclaimed, &ldquo;do not heed
    what van Rycke says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will fight to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Die to-morrow!&rdquo; they cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And blacken your souls to-day!&rdquo; retorted Mark.</p>
  <p>The tumult grew more wild. Dissension had begun to sow its ugly seed among
    these men whom a common danger, united heroism, and courage had knit so closely
    together. The grim, silent, majestic determination of a while ago was giving
    place slowly to rabid, frenzied calls of hatred, to ugly oaths, glowing eyes
    and faces heated with passion. The presence of the dozen elderly patricians
    and burghers still bare-headed and shoeless, still with the rope around their
    necks, helped to fan up the passions which their misfortunes had aroused.
    For the moment, however, the hot-headed malcontents were still greatly in
    the minority, but the danger of dissent, of mutiny was there, and the set
    expression on the faces of the leaders, the stern look in Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s
    eyes testified that they were conscious of its presence.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Then it was that right through this tumult which had spread from the building
    itself to the precincts and even beyond, a woman&rsquo;s cry rang out with
    appalling clearness. It was not a cry of terror, rather one of command, but
    so piercing was it that for the moment every other cry was stilled: Peter
    Balde&rsquo;s adherents were silenced, and suddenly over this vast assembly,
    wherein but a few seconds ago passions ran riot, there fell a hush&mdash;a
    tension of every nerve, a momentary lull of every heart-beat as with the
    prescience of something momentous to which that woman&rsquo;s cry was only
    the presage.</p>
  <p>And in the midst of that sudden hush the cry was heard again&mdash;more
    clearly this time and closer to the cathedral porch, so that the words came
    quite distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me get to him ... take me to your leader ... I must speak with
    him at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And like distant thunder, the clamour rose again: men and women shouted
    and called; the words: &ldquo;Spaniard!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spy!&rdquo; were
    easily distinguishable: the crowd could be seen to sway, to be moving like
    a huge wave, all in one direction toward the porch: hundreds of faces showed
    plainly in the dull grey light as necks were craned to catch a glimpse of
    the woman who had screamed.</p>
  <p>But evidently with but rare exceptions the crowd was not hostile: those
    who had cried out the word &ldquo;Spy!&rdquo; were obviously in the minority.
    With death looming so near, with deadly danger to every woman in the city
    within sight, every instinct of chivalry toward the weak was at its greatest
    height. Those inside the cathedral could see that the crowd was parting in
    order to let two women move along, and that the men in the forefront elbowed
    a way for them so that they should not be hindered on their way. It was the
    taller of the two women who had uttered the piteous yet commanding appeal: &ldquo;Let
    me go to him!&mdash;take me to your leader!&mdash;I must speak with him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reiterated that appeal now&mdash;at the south porch to which she had
    been literally carried by the crowd outside: and here suddenly three stalwart
    men belonging to one of the city guilds took, as it were, possession of her
    and her companion and with vigorous play of elbows and of staves forged a
    way for them both right up to the altar rails. Even whilst in the west end
    of the church the enthusiastic tumult around Peter Balde which this fresh
    incident had momentarily stilled, arose with renewed vigour, and the young
    artisans and apprentices once more took up their cry: &ldquo;Revenge! Death
    to all the prisoners!&rdquo; the woman, who was wrapped up in a long black
    mantle and hood, fell&mdash;panting, exhausted, breathless&mdash;almost at
    Mark van Rycke&rsquo;s feet and murmured hoarsely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand troops are on their way to Ghent ... they will be here
    within two hours ... save yourselves if you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice hardly rose above a whisper. Mark alone heard every word she said;
    he stooped and placing two fingers under her chin, with a quick and firm
    gesture he lifted up the woman&rsquo;s head, so that her hood fell back and
    the light from the east window struck full upon her face and her golden hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come straight from the Kasteel,&rdquo; she said, more clearly now,
    for she was gradually recovering her breath, &ldquo;let your friends kill
    me if they will ... the Duke of Alva swore a false oath ... a messenger left
    even last night for Dendermonde....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; queried Mark quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grete and I heard the Duke speak of it all with my father just now,&rdquo; she
    replied. &ldquo;He asked for the truce in order to gain time.... He hopes
    that the troops from Dendermonde will be here before nightfall ... the guards
    at the gate-houses are under arms, and three thousand men are inside the
    Kasteel ready to rush out the moment the troops are in sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was impossible to doubt her story. Those who stood nearest to her passed
    it on to their neighbours, and the news travelled like wild-fire from end
    to end of the church: &ldquo;They are on us! Five thousand Spaniards from
    Dendermonde to annihilate us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God have mercy on our souls!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God have mercy on our women and children!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Panic seized a great many there; they pushed and scrambled out of the building,
    running blindly like sheep, and spread the terrible news through the streets,
    calling loudly to God to save them all: the panic very naturally spread to
    the women and children who thronged the streets at this hour, and to the
    silent workers who had quietly continued their work of burial. Soon all the
    market squares were filled with shrieking men, women and children who ran
    about aimlessly with wild gestures and cries of lamentation. Those who had
    kept indoors all to-day&mdash;either fearing the crowds or piously preparing
    for death&mdash;came rushing out to see what new calamity was threatening
    them, or whether the supreme hour had indeed struck for them all.</p>
  <p>Inside the cathedral the cries of revenge were stilled; dulled was the lust
    to kill. The immense danger which had been forgotten for a moment in that
    frantic thirst for revenge made its deathly presence felt once more. Pallid
    faces and wide-open, terror-filled eyes were turned toward the one man whose
    personality seemed still to radiate the one great ray of hope.</p>
  <p>But just for a moment Mark van Rycke seemed quite oblivious of that wave
    of sighs and fears which tended toward him now and swept all thought of mutiny
    away.</p>
  <p>He was supporting Lenora who was gradually regaining strength and consciousness:
    just for a few seconds he allowed tumult and terror to seethe unheeded around
    him: just for those few seconds he forgot death and danger, his friends,
    the world, everything save that Lenora had come to him at the hour when his
    heart yearned for her more passionately than ever before, and that she was
    looking up into his face with eyes that told so plainly the whole extent
    of her love for him.</p>
  <p>Only a few seconds, then he handed her over to the gentle care of Father
    van der Schlicht, but as with infinite gentleness he finally released himself
    from her clinging arms he murmured in her ear: &ldquo;God reward you, Madonna!
    With your love as my shield, I feel that I could conquer the universe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he faced the terror-stricken crowd once more.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Burghers and artisans of Ghent,&rdquo; he called loudly, &ldquo;we
    have two hours before us. The perjured tyrant is bringing five thousand fresh
    troops against us. If by nightfall we have not conquered, our city is doomed
    and all of us who have survived, and all our women and children will be slaughtered
    like sheep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; cried the leaders: Jan van Migrode and Lievin van
    Deynse, Pierre Deynoot and the others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; was echoed by a goodly number of the crowd.</p>
  <p>But a great many were silent&mdash;despair had gripped them with its icy
    talon&mdash;the hopelessness of it all had damped their enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand fresh troops,&rdquo; they murmured, &ldquo;and there
    are less than four thousand of us all told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot conquer,&rdquo; came from Peter Balde&rsquo;s friends at
    the west end of the church, &ldquo;let us at least take our revenge!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! Revenge! Death to the Walloons!&rdquo; they cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Revenge! yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Mark van Rycke. &ldquo;Let us be revenged
    on the liar, the tyrant, the perjurer, let us show him no mercy and extort
    from him by brute force that which he has refused us all these years&mdash;civil
    and religious freedom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Rycke, thou art raving!&rdquo; broke in the men who stood nearest
    to him&mdash;some of them his most ardent supporters. &ldquo;Alva by nightfall
    will have three times the numbers we have. The gates will be opened to his
    fresh troops.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must seize the Kasteel and the gates before then!&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can we? We made several assaults yesterday. We have not enough
    men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have half an hour wherein to increase their numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art raving,&rdquo; they cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not one able-bodied man but was fighting yesterday&mdash;not half
    their number knew how to handle pike or lance, musket or crossbow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we must find two thousand men who are trained soldiers and know
    all that there is to know about fighting. That would make it a two to one
    fight. Burghers of Ghent, which one of you cannot account for two Spaniards
    when the lives of your women and your children depend on the strength of
    your arm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two thousand men?&rdquo; The cry came from everywhere&mdash;cry of
    doubt, of hope, of irony or of defiance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are we to get them? Where can we get them from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come with me and I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo; retorts Mark and he
    immediately makes for the door.</p>
  <p>The other leaders stick close to him as one man, as do all those who have
    been standing near the altar rails and those who saw him even when first
    he turned to them all, with eyes glowing with the fire of the most ardent
    patriotism, with the determination to die if need be, but by God! to try
    and conquer first!</p>
  <p>It was only those who were in the rear of the crowd or in the side aisles
    who did not come immediately under the spell of that magnetic personality,
    of that burning enthusiasm which from its lexicon had erased the word &ldquo;Failure!&rdquo; but
    even they were carried off their feet by the human wave which now swept out
    of the cathedral&mdash;by the south door&mdash;bearing upon it the group
    of rebel leaders with Mark&rsquo;s broad shoulders and closely cropped head
    towering above the others.</p>
  <p>The throng was soon swelled to huge proportions by all those who had been
    hanging about in the precincts all the afternoon unable to push their way
    into the crowded edifice. The tumult and the clamour which they made&mdash;added
    to the cries of those who were running in terror through the streets&mdash;made
    a pandemonium of sounds which was almost hellish in its awful suggestion
    of terror, of confusion and of misery.</p>
  <p>But those who still believed in the help of God, those in whom faith in
    the justice of their cause was allied with the sublime determination of martyrs
    were content to follow their hero blindly&mdash;vaguely marvelling what his
    purpose could be&mdash;whilst the malcontents in the rear, rallying round
    Peter Balde once more began to murmur of death and of revenge!</p>
  <p>Mark led the crowd across the wide cathedral square to the guild-house of
    the armourers&mdash;the fine building with the tall, crow-step gables and
    the magnificent carved portico to which a double flight of fifteen stone
    steps and wrought-iron balustrade gave access. He ran up the steps and stood
    with his back to the portico fronting the crowd. Every one could see him
    now, from the remotest corners of the square&mdash;many had invaded the houses
    round, and heads appeared at all the windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burghers of Ghent,&rdquo; he called aloud, &ldquo;we have to conquer
    or we must die. There are less than four thousand of us at this moment fit
    to bear arms against Alva&rsquo;s hordes which still number seven. Five thousand
    more of them are on their way to complete the destruction of our city, to
    murder our wives and our children, and to desecrate our homes. We want two
    thousand well-trained soldiers to oppose them and inflict on the tyrant such
    a defeat as will force him to grant us all that we fight for: Liberty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How wilt do that, friend of the leather mask?&rdquo;  queried some
    of the men ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How wilt find two thousand well-trained soldiers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Follow me, and I will show you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned and went into the building, the whole crowd following him as one
    man. The huge vaulted hall of the guild-house was filled in every corner
    with Walloon prisoners&mdash;the fruit of the first day&rsquo;s victory.
    They were lying or sitting about the floor, some of them playing hazard with
    scraps of leather cut from their belts; others watched them, or merely stared
    straight in front of them, with a sullen look of hopelessness: they were
    the ones who had wives and children at home, or merely who had served some
    time under Alva&rsquo;s banner and had learned from him how prisoners should
    be treated. When the leaders of the insurrection with Mark van Rycke at their
    head made irruption into the hall followed by a tumultuous throng, the Walloons,
    as if moved by a blind instinct, threw aside their games and all retreated
    to the furthest end of the hall, like a phalanx of frightened men who have
    not even the power to sell their lives. Many of those who had rushed in,
    in Mark&rsquo;s wake, were the malcontents whose temper Peter Balde&rsquo;s
    hot-headed words had inflamed. Awed by the presence of their leaders they
    still held themselves in check, but the Walloons, from their place of retreat,
    crowded together and terrified, saw many a glowing face, distorted by the
    passion to kill, many an eye fixed upon them with glowering hatred and an
    obvious longing for revenge.</p>
  <p>Then Mark called out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, friends: in two hours&rsquo; time the tyrant will have
    twelve thousand troops massed against us. We have two thousand well-trained
    soldiers within our guild-houses who are idle at this moment. Here are five
    hundred of them&mdash;the others are close by! with their help we can crush
    the tyrant&mdash;fight him till we conquer, and treat him as he would have
    treated us. Here is your revenge for his insults! Get your brothers to forswear
    their allegiance and to fight by your side!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A gasp went right through the hall which now was packed closely with men&mdash;the
    five hundred Walloon prisoners huddled together at one end, and some four
    thousand men of Ghent filling every corner of the vast arcaded hall. In the
    very midst of them all Mark van Rycke hoisted up on the shoulders of his
    friends&mdash;with gleaming eyes and quivering voice&mdash;awaited their
    reply.</p>
  <p>The malcontents were the first to make their voices heard:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These traitors,&rdquo; they shouted, &ldquo;the paid mercenaries
    of Alva! Art crazy, van Rycke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Spanish woman hath cajoled thee!&rdquo; some of them exclaimed
    with a curse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or offered thee a bribe from the tyrant,&rdquo; cried others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hang thee along with the prisoners if thou darest to
    turn against us,&rdquo; added Peter Balde spitefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang me then, friends, an ye list,&rdquo; he said with a loud laugh, &ldquo;but
    let me speak while ye get the gallows ready. Walloons,&rdquo; he added, turning
    to the prisoners who were regarding him with utter bewilderment, in which
    past terror still held sway, &ldquo;ye are our kith and kin. Together we
    have groaned under the most execrable tyrant the world has even known. To-day
    I offer you the power to strike one blow at the tyrant&mdash;a blow from
    which he will never recover&mdash;a blow which will help you to win that
    which every Netherlander craves for: Liberty! Will ye help us to strike that
    blow and cover yourselves with glory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye!&rdquo; came from the Walloons with one stupendous cry of
    hope and of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you fight with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Die with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the freedom of the Netherlands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For Liberty!&rdquo; they cried.</p>
  <p>But all the while murmurings were going on among the Flemings. Their hatred
    of the Walloons who had borne arms against their own native land and for
    its subjugation under the heel of an alien master was greater almost than
    their hatred against the Spaniards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Walloons? Horror!&rdquo; they shouted, even whilst Mark was infusing
    some of his own ardent enthusiasm into the veins of those five hundred prisoners. &ldquo;Shame
    on thee, van Rycke!&rdquo; whilst one man who has remained nameless to history
    cried out loudly: &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! traitor thou!&rdquo; retorted van Rycke, &ldquo;who wouldst
    prefer the lust of killing to that of victory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Burghers of Ghent,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in the name of our
    sacred Motherland, I entreat you release these men; let me have them as soldiers
    under our banner ... let me have them as brothers to fight by our side ...
    you would shed their blood and steep your souls in crime, let them shed theirs
    for Liberty, and cover themselves with glory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; came from the leaders and from the phalanx of fighting
    men who stood closest to their hero.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! release them! Let them fight for us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The call was taken back and echoed and re-echoed until the high-vaulted
    roof rang with the enthusiastic shouts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Walloons, will you fight with us?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the death!&rdquo; replied the prisoners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One country, one people, one kindred,&rdquo; rejoined Mark with solemn
    earnestness, &ldquo;henceforth there will be neither Flemings nor Walloons,
    just Netherlanders standing shoulder to shoulder to crush the tyrant of us
    all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Netherlanders! Orange and Liberty!&rdquo; cried Walloons and Flemings
    in unison.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give them back their own arms, provosts,&rdquo;  commanded Mark, &ldquo;our
    untrained men have not known how to use them! and follow me, friends! We
    have not gathered our reinforcements together yet. In half an hour we shall
    have two thousand brothers under our flag!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Long live Leatherface! To arms, brothers!&rdquo; were the last shouts
    which rang through the hall, ere Mark van Rycke led his followers away to
    the nearest guild-house and then to the next, where two thousand Walloon
    prisoners were by the magic of his patriotism and his enthusiasm transformed
    into two thousand friends.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>Once more the roar of artillery and of musketry fills the air. It is long
    before the evening Angelus has begun to ring, but from far away the news
    has come to every captain at the city gates that reinforcements are on the
    way from Dendermonde. No one can respect a truce which hid the blackest perfidy
    ever perpetrated by a tyrannical master against a brave people. As soon as
    the news has filtrated into the heart of the city the Orangists rush to their
    arms, reinforced by two thousand trained troops; their battle cry becomes
    triumphant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Netherlands! Orange! and Liberty!&rdquo; resounds defiantly from
    end to end of the city.</p>
  <p>The besieging force rush the Kasteel! they sow the open tract of ground
    around the moat with their heroic dead; again and again they rush for the
    breach: culverins and falconets upon the ramparts are useless after a while:
    and a shower of heavy stones falls upon the plucky assailants. There are
    five hundred Walloon bowmen now who know how to shoot straight, and some
    musketeers who vie with the Spaniards for precision. They cover the advance
    of the halberdiers and the pikemen, who return to the charge with the enthusiasm
    born of renewed hope.</p>
  <p>The Br&uuml;gge gate has fallen, the Waalpoort is in the insurgents&rsquo; hands:
    Captain Serbelloni at the Braepoort is hard pressed, and up in the Meeste
    Toren of the Kasteel Alva paces up and down like a caged tiger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bracamonte or nightfall!&rdquo; he cries with desperate rage, for
    he cannot understand why the Dendermonde troops are detained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely that rabble has not seized all the gates!&rdquo;  Twice he
    has ordered a sortie! twice the moat has received a fresh shower of dead.
    The breach has become wider: the Orangist halberdiers are fighting foot by
    foot up the walls. They have succeeded in throwing their bridge made of pikes
    and lances across the moat, and soon they are crossing in their hundreds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavens above, how come they to be so numerous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Captain de Avila has been severely wounded: three younger captains have
    been killed. The Orangist falconets&mdash;a light piece of artillery and
    not easy to use&mdash;works incessantly upon the breach. Alva himself is
    everywhere. His doublet and hose are torn, too, his breast-plate and tassets
    are riddled with arrow-shot; he bleeds profusely from the hand. His face
    is unrecognisable beneath a covering of smoke and grime. Rage and fear have
    made him hideous&mdash;not fear of personal danger, for to this he is wholly
    indifferent, but fear of defeat, of humiliation, of the heavy reprisals which
    that contemptible rabble will exact.</p>
  <p>He insults his soldiers and threatens them in turn; he snatches musket or
    crossbow, directs, leads, commands ... and sees his wildest hopes shattered
    one by one.</p>
  <p>The din and confusion from the city itself is hardly heard above the awful
    pandemonium which reigns in and around the besieged Kasteel. The Vleeshhuis
    on the Schelde is a mass of flames; the roof suddenly falls in with a terrific
    crash which seems to shake the very earth to its depths: there is not a single
    window left in the Meeste-Toren, and the rooms, as well as the yard below,
    are littered with broken glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have no more balls left, Magnificence,&rdquo; reports the captain
    in charge of the artillery. &ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; cries the Duke of Alva fiercely. &ldquo;Throw yourselves
    into the moat or get the musketeers to turn their muskets against you; for
    of a certainty you will be massacred within the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Inside the city it is hell let loose. Fighting&mdash;hand to hand, pike
    to pike&mdash;goes on in every street, on every bridge, under every doorway,
    aye! even beneath the cathedral porch. The doors of the houses have all been
    broken open and men who are wounded and exhausted crawl under them for shelter
    and safety. The women and children had all been ordered to go inside their
    own homes before the first battle cry of the Orangists rang out; a goodly
    number of them, however, took refuge in the churches, and there were defended
    by companies of Walloons posted at the doors.</p>
  <p>The bridges are fought for inch by inch; when at last they fell into the
    hands of the Orangists they are destroyed one by one.</p>
  <p>Hell let loose indeed! Desperate men fighting for freedom against a tyrant
    who has never known defeat. The evening Angelus was never rung on that Lord&rsquo;s
    Day&mdash;the feast of the Holy Redeemer&mdash;but at the hour when day first
    fades into evening Mark van Rycke&mdash;superb, undaunted and glowing now
    with the ardour of victory&mdash;leads the final assault on the Kasteel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Netherlanders! For Liberty!&rdquo; he cries.</p>
  <p>A stone has hit his shoulder, there is a huge cut across his face, the sleeve
    has been torn right out of his doublet, his bare arm and the hand which wields
    an unconquered sword gleam like metal in the fast gathering twilight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the breach!&rdquo; he calls, and is the first to scramble down
    the declivity of the moat and on to the heap of masonry which fills the moat
    here to the top of the bank.</p>
  <p>An arrow aimed at his head pierces his right arm, a stone hurled from above
    falls at his feet and raises a cloud of dust which blinds him, a heavy fragment
    hits him on the head; he stumbles and falls backwards, down to the brink
    of the moat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind me,&rdquo; he calls, &ldquo;for Liberty, Netherlanders!
    The Kasteel is yours! hold on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He has managed to hold on for dear life to the rough stones on the declivity,
    crawling along the top of the bank to escape being trampled on by the pikemen.
    The latter have a hot time at the breach: the Spanish musketeers, under the
    Duke of Alva&rsquo;s own eyes, are firing with remarkable accuracy and extraordinary
    rapidity, whilst from the ramparts the shower of heavy stones makes deadly
    havoc: twice the Walloons have given ground&mdash;they are led by Laurence
    van Rycke now&mdash;who twice returns to the charge.</p>
  <p>Mark struggles to his feet: &ldquo;Hold on, Walloons! the Kasteel is ours,&rdquo; he
    cries.</p>
  <p>And while the Walloons continue the desperate fighting at the breach, he
    gathers together a company of Flemish swordsmen, the pick of his little army,
    those who have stuck closely to him throughout the past two days, who have
    fought every minute, who have been decimated, lost their provosts and their
    captains, but have never once cried &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; and never thought
    of giving in.</p>
  <p>A hundred or so of them are all that is left: they carry their sword in
    their right hand and a pistol in their left. They follow Mark round the walls
    to where the moat melts into the wide tract of morass which surrounds the
    north-east side of the Kasteel.</p>
  <p>The shadow from the high walls falls across the marshy ground, the men move
    round silently whilst behind them at the breach and on the bridge the noise
    of musketry and falling masonry drowns every other sound.</p>
  <p>Now the men halt, and still in silence they strip to their skins; then with
    their pistols in their right hand and their sword between their teeth they
    plunge ankle deep into the mud. They are men of Ghent every one of them&mdash;men
    of the Low Countries who know their morasses as mariners know the sea: they
    know how to keep their foothold in these slimy tracks, where strangers would
    inevitably be sucked into a hideous grave.</p>
  <p>They make their way to the foot of the wall, they move like ghosts now,
    and are well-nigh waist deep in the mud. Night closes in rapidly round them:
    behind them the sky is suffused with the crimson reflection of an autumnal
    sunset. Their arms, chests and backs are shiny with sweat, their hot breath
    comes and goes rapidly with excitement and the scent of danger which hovers
    behind them in that yawning morass and ahead of them on the parapet of those
    walls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Victory waits for you, my men,&rdquo; says Mark in a commanding voice, &ldquo;up
    on yonder wall. Whoever is for Orange and for Liberty, follow me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he starts to climb, and one by one the men follow. What atoms they
    look up on those high walls, crawling, creeping, scrambling, with hands and
    knees and feet clinging to the unevenness in the masonry, or scraps of coarse
    grass that give them foothold: like ants crawling up a heap&mdash;on they
    go&mdash;their bare backs reflect the crimson glow of the sun. Mark, their
    hero, leads the way, his torn arm and lacerated shoulder leave a trail of
    blood upon the stones.</p>
  <p>At the breach the Walloons must be hard pressed, for cries of triumph follow
    each volley from the Spanish musketry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On, on, Netherlanders! for Orange and Liberty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now Mark has reached the top: his arm is over the parapet, then his knee.
    The look-out man has seen him: he shoulders his musket to give the alarm,
    but before he can fire Mark is on him, and three more Flemings now have scrambled
    over the wall. This portion of the Kasteel is never seriously guarded: the
    morass is thought to be impassable, and forms the only guard on the northeast
    wall; but these men of Ghent have conquered the morass and they are on the
    walls, and have overpowered the look-out men ere these have had time to scream.</p>
  <p>Naked, sweating, bleeding at hands and knees, they look like wraiths from
    some inferno down below. They rush down helter-skelter into the castle yard.
    The Spanish musketeers caught in their rear whence they never expected attack,
    down their weapons and run with a mad <i>Sauve qui peut</i> to the shelter
    of the Meeste-Toren. The Walloons&mdash;not understanding what has happened&mdash;see
    the Spaniards running and seize the lucky moment. Laurence van Rycke leads
    them through the breach, and they rush into the yard with pikes and halberds
    fixed and fill it suddenly with their cry of triumph: then they fight their
    way round to the gatehouse and lower the bridge, and the Flemings in their
    turn come pouring into the Kasteel.</p>
  <p>Within ten minutes every Spaniard inside the Kasteel has laid down his arms:
    the stronghold is in the hands of the Orangists, and Mark van Rycke up on
    the iron balcony outside the Duke of Alva&rsquo;s council chamber, surrounded
    by his naked stalwarts, demands the surrender of the Lieutenant-Governor
    of the Netherlands in the name of Orange and of Liberty.</p>
  <p>Then without a sigh or a groan he throws up his arms, and those who are
    nearest to him are only just in time to catch him ere he falls.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
    The Hour Of Victory</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>To the women and children shut up in the different churches and in the houses
    throughout the city, during those terrible hours whilst their husbands, brothers,
    sons were making their last desperate stand, it was indeed hell let loose;
    for while the men were doing, they could only wait and pray. It was impossible
    for them even to wander out to try and help the wounded or to seek amongst
    the dead for the one dear face, the mirror of all joy and happiness. They
    all sat or knelt huddled up together, their children closely held in their
    arms, murmuring those vague words of comfort, of surmise, of hope and of
    fear which come mechanically to the lips when every sense is lulled into
    a kind of torpor with the terrible imminence of the danger and the overwhelming
    power of grief.</p>
  <p>The danger in the houses was greater than in the churches, for everywhere
    the horrible concussion of artillery and the crash of falling masonry broke
    the windows and shook the floors. But many women have that same instinct
    which causes the beasts of the forests to hide within their lair; they feel
    that they would rather see their home fall in about their heads, than watch
    its destruction from a safer distance. Cl&eacute;mence van Rycke refused
    to leave her house when first Laurence received Lenora&rsquo;s warning of
    the impending catastrophe; she refused to leave it now when her sons were
    face to face with death and any moment a stray cannon ball might bring the
    walls down with a crash.</p>
  <p>She sat in the high-backed chair in the small withdrawing-room where, less
    than a week ago, the first card was played in that desperate game for human
    lives which was finding its climax at this hour; she sat quite still&mdash;staring
    into the empty hearth with that stolidity peculiar to these women of the
    North&mdash;and which is only another, calmer, form of courage. The High-Bailiff,
    sullen and silent, sat close to the table with his head buried in his hands.
    Since his return from his humiliating errand this afternoon he had not spoken
    a word to anyone&mdash;he believed that the Orangist cause was doomed, and
    both his sons certain of death. What happened to him after that he really
    did not care.</p>
  <p>Pierre and Jeanne sat in the hall together, quietly telling their beads.
    The din outside was deafening, and the evening hour was slowly creeping on&mdash;day
    yielded to twilight; a brilliant sunset lit up for a while the desolation
    of an entire city, then sank into a blood-hued horizon, adding its own lurid
    light to the crimson glow of burning buildings.</p>
  <p>And as the veils of night fell more heavily over the city, gradually the
    dismal sounds of cannon and musketry were stilled. Pierre came in after a
    while carrying a lamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Firing has ceased,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;men are running down the
    streets shouting that the Kasteel is in our hands and that the Duke of Alva
    has surrendered to Leatherface!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put the lamp down and prepared to go, for Cl&eacute;mence and the High-Bailiff
    have made no comment on the joyful news&mdash;perhaps it has failed to reach
    their dulled senses, perhaps they do not believe it. At any rate, what is
    victory to them if two brave sons have fallen for its sake?</p>
  <p>But already the cries through the streets become more insistent and more
    sure; men and women run hither and thither up and down the Nieuwe Straat,
    and as Pierre stands by the open door, peering curiously out into the gloom,
    people shout to him as they rush by:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Van Rycke has seized the Kasteel! The Duke of Alva is a prisoner
    in our hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence hears the cries. She can no longer doubt her ears. &ldquo;Mark?
    Laurence?&rdquo; she calls out. &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The High-Bailiff rouses himself from his apathy. &ldquo;I will go to the
    Town House,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and will be back with news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News of Mark&mdash;and of Laurence,&rdquo; cries the mother.</p>
  <p>The High-Bailiff goes, and she remains alone in the narrow room, with just
    the feeble light of the lamp upon her pale face and trembling hands. Now
    and then still, right through the night, a terrific crash shakes the house
    to its foundations, or a sudden lurid light flares upwards to the sky&mdash;roofs
    are still falling in, crumbling ruins still burst into flames, but firing
    and clash of steel have ceased, and from the various churches the peals of
    bells send their triumphant call through the night.</p>
  <p>The hours go by. It is nigh on ten o&rsquo;clock now. The High-Bailiff has
    not yet returned, but Laurence has just come back&mdash;wounded and exhausted
    but full of the glorious victory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Mark?&rdquo; queries the mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark is hurt ... but he will be here anon,&rdquo; says the boy, &ldquo;the
    men have made a stretcher for him&mdash;he would not be tended at the Kasteel&mdash;he
    begged to be brought home&mdash;oh! mother dear, how we must love him after
    this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence hastily gives orders that Messire Mark&rsquo;s room be made
    ready for him at once. Jeanne, buxom and capable, is rendered supremely happy
    by this task.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother dear,&rdquo; whispers Laurence, &ldquo;next to Mark himself,
    we all owe our salvation to Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He has no time to say more, even though Cl&eacute;mence&rsquo;s face has
    hardened at mention of that name which she abhors; for Pierre has just come
    running in breathless and trembling with excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mevrouw,&rdquo; he stammers, &ldquo;it is the noble lady ... the
    Spanish lady ... it is...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before Laurence could further question him, he has uttered a cry of surprise,
    which is echoed by one of horror from Cl&eacute;mence. Lenora was standing
    under the lintel of the door. Cl&eacute;mence rose from her chair as if moved
    by a spring and stood up, rigid, and with arm raised, pointing straight to
    the door:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she commanded sternly.</p>
  <p>But Lenora advanced slowly into the room. She was whiter than the ruff at
    her throat, her black mantle hung round her in heavy folds, but the hood
    had fallen back from her head, and her golden hair with the yellow light
    of the lamp falling full upon it looked like a gleaming aureole which made
    her eyes appear wonderfully dark by contrast and her beauty more ethereal
    than it had been before. Laurence gazed on her in speechless wonder, but
    Cl&eacute;mence, full of hatred for the woman whom she believed to be the
    author of all the misery of the past few days, still pointed to the door,
    and sternly, relentlessly, in a voice which quivered with the passion of
    intense hatred, she reiterated her command:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are bringing Mark home,&rdquo; said Lenora quietly; &ldquo;he
    is wounded ... perhaps to death ... I could not get to hear ... but when
    he opens his eyes he will ask for me. I cannot go unless he sends me away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are bringing Mark home,&rdquo; assented the mother, &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis
    I who will tend him. Never shall thy treacherous hand touch my son...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; broke in Laurence firmly, &ldquo;she is Mark&rsquo;s
    wife and she has saved us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cl&eacute;mence gave a loud sob and fell back in her chair. Laurence tried
    in vain to comfort her. But Lenora waited quietly until the worst of Cl&eacute;mence&rsquo;s
    paroxysm of tears had passed away, then she said with the same patience and
    gentleness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, mevrouw, that from the first I was an intruder in your house.
    I, too, have oft in the last few miserable days longed in vain that Mark
    and I had never met. But do you not think, mevrouw, that our destinies are
    beyond our ken? that God ordains our Fate, and merely chooses His tools where
    He desires?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Satan, too, chooses his tools,&rdquo; murmured Cl&eacute;mence
    through her tears. &ldquo;Oh go! go! I beg of you to go,&rdquo; she added
    with sudden passionate appeal; &ldquo;cannot you see that the sight of you
    must be torture to us all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me stay until I have seen Mark?&rdquo;  said Lenora
    calmly, &ldquo;and then I will go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not let you see him,&rdquo; protested Cl&eacute;mence with
    the obstinacy of the weak. &ldquo;I would not allow a spy like you to come
    near him ... aye! a spy ... an assassin mayhap ... how do I know that you
    are not an emissary of our tyrants? how do I know that beneath your cloak
    you do not hold a dagger?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurence was trying his best to pacify his mother and throwing pathetic
    looks of appeal to Lenora the while, whilst the girl herself was bravely
    trying to hold herself in check. But at this last cruel taunt she uttered
    a cry of pain, like a poor wild creature that has been hurt to death. In
    a moment she was across the room, down on her knees beside the old woman
    and holding Cl&eacute;mence&rsquo;s trembling hands imprisoned in her own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush!&rdquo; she implored wildly, &ldquo;you must not say that
    ... you must not ... Heavens above, have you not realised that when I acted
    as I did, I did so because I believed God Himself had shown me the way? You
    call me base and vile ... I swear to you by all that I hold most sacred that
    I would gladly die a thousand deaths to undo the work of the past few days
    ... you speak of an assassin&rsquo;s dagger ... I believed that my cousin
    Ramon was murdered ... foully and in the dark ... by the man who was known
    as Leatherface ... my father made me swear that I would avenge Ramon&rsquo;s
    death ... what could I do? what could I do? I believed that God was guiding
    me ... I spied upon you, I know ... I found out your secrets and gave them
    to my father ... but he had commanded me and I had no one else in the world
    ... no one ... only my father ... and I believed in him as I believe in God....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke in a sob, her head fell forward upon her hands and those
    of the older woman, and a pitiable moan of pain came from her overburdened
    heart. Laurence, with his head buried in his hands, would have given his
    life to spare her all this misery. But Cl&eacute;mence said nothing&mdash;she
    did not repulse the girl nor did she draw her to her heart; whether she still
    mistrusted her or not it were impossible to say, certain it is that she listened,
    and that words of hatred no longer rose to her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will not let me see Mark,&rdquo; continued Lenora, trying to
    speak more calmly, &ldquo;you are afraid that I would go to him as an enemy
    ... a spy ... an assassin.... Ah! you have chosen the weapon well wherewith
    to punish me! An enemy, ye gods!&mdash;I who would give the last drop of
    blood in my veins to help him at this hour, I who love him with every fibre
    of my heart, with every aspiration of my soul! ... Don&rsquo;t you understand?
    cannot you understand that he has forced his way right into my very being,
    that I have left my people, my father, to come to him ... to warn him, to
    help him ... to be with him in the hour of danger.... Let me stay.... Let
    me be with him! ... Cannot you see that Love for him is all that I live for
    now?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had ceased speaking, and over the high, oak-panelled room there fell
    a silence which soon became oppressive. A few moments ago while Lenora was
    pouring out her heart in wild words of passionate longing, Cl&eacute;mence
    and Laurence had suddenly uttered a cry&mdash;half of horror and half of
    joy&mdash;a cry which was quickly suppressed and which the girl did not hear.
    Now the tension on her nerves was suddenly relaxed and she broke down utterly&mdash;physically
    and mentally she felt like one who has received a blow with a pole-axe and
    is only just alive&mdash;no longer sentient, hardly suffering. She was crouching
    on the ground with her head on the older woman&rsquo;s knee, a pathetic picture
    of hopelessness. She felt indeed as if this earth could hold no greater suffering
    than what she endured now&mdash;to have dreamed for one brief while that
    she had helped the man she loved in the hour of his greatest danger, and
    then to be made to feel that she was still an enemy in the sight of all his
    people.</p>
  <p>She lost count of time, it might have been but a few seconds that she knelt
    there broken-hearted; it might have been a cycle of years; the din from the
    streets outside, the bustle inside the house only reached her ears like sounds
    that come in a dream. A kind of torpor had fallen over the broken-hearted
    girl&rsquo;s senses and mercifully saved her from further pain. She closed
    her eyes and semi-consciousness wrapped her in a kindly embrace. Semi-consciousness
    or a happy dream. She could not tell. All that she knew was that suddenly
    all misery and all suffering fell away from her; that an invisible presence
    was in the room which was like that of the angel of peace, and that strong,
    kind arms held her closely, so that she no longer felt that an awful chasm
    yawned before her and that she was falling into a hideous abyss where there
    was neither hope nor pardon. Of course it must have been a dream&mdash;such
    dreams as come to the dying who have suffered much and see the end of all
    their woe in a prescient glimpse of heaven&mdash;for it seemed to her that
    the kind grey eyes which she loved were looking on her now, that they smiled
    on her with infinite tenderness and infinite understanding, and that the
    lips which she had longed to kiss whispered gentle, endearing words in her
    ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is your love, Madonna, which led me to victory. Did I not say
    that with it as my shield I could conquer the universe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you are hurt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much, dear heart,&rdquo; he replied with that quaint laugh of
    his which suddenly turned this delicious dream into exquisite reality, &ldquo;kind
    hands have tended me and gave me some clean clothing. I would have had you
    in my arms ere now, but was too dirty an object to appear before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the laughter died out from his eyes, they became intent, searching,
    desperately anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he whispered&mdash;and he who for three days had
    faced every kind of danger, trembled now with apprehension&mdash;&ldquo;what
    you said to my mother&mdash;a moment ago&mdash;did you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your love, Mark,&rdquo; she murmured in reply, &ldquo;is all that
    I live for now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he folded her in his arms once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must love her too. My whole
    happiness hangs upon her kiss.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</b></h2>
  <p>Many there are who hold to the belief that the death of Alva would have
    saved the unfortunate Netherlanders many more months of woe and oppression
    at his hands, and that mayhap it would have deterred the royal despot over
    in Madrid from further acts of perfidious tyranny.</p>
  <p>Therefore Mark van Rycke&mdash;the responsible leader of the successful
    insurrection of Ghent&mdash;has often been blamed for his leniency to a man
    who&mdash;if he had been victorious&mdash;would not have spared a single
    woman or child in the city.</p>
  <p>With the right and wrongs of that contention this chronicle hath no concern.
    Mark van Rycke led the men of Ghent to victory, and having done that he fell
    sick from wounds and exhaustion, and after being hastily tended by his friends,
    he was taken home where for many days he hovered between life and death.</p>
  <p>It was the civic dignitaries&mdash;the High-Bailiff, the Aldermen and Sheriffs
    of the Keure who assumed the responsibility of dealing with the tyrant, and
    they remained true apparently to their principles of conciliation and of
    loyalty, for within two days of their heroic and desperate stand for liberty
    and while the ruins of their beautiful city were still smouldering, the men
    of Ghent had the mortification of seeing the Duke of Alva ride&mdash;humiliated
    but unscathed&mdash;out of the town.</p>
  <p>Just as fifty years ago the town of Br&uuml;ges held the Archduke Maximilian,
    King of the Romans, a prisoner till he ordered the withdrawal of all foreign
    troops from their gates, so did the men of Ghent now exact the same undertaking
    from the Duke of Alva.</p>
  <p>For the moment Ghent was freed from the immediate danger of annihilation,
    and the departure of Alva from Belgium less than a year later saved her perhaps
    altogether from the fate of many of her sister cities; certain it is that
    the High-Bailiff and the older burghers extracted from their prisoners&mdash;among
    whom was se&ntilde;or de Vargas and several members of the Blood Council&mdash;concessions
    and privileges for which they had clamoured in vain for half a century; but
    beyond that the tyrant was allowed to go free, and against this decision
    of their magistrates and their Griet Mannen the heroes of the insurrection
    did not raise a protest. Perhaps they had suffered too much to thirst for
    active revenge. </p>
