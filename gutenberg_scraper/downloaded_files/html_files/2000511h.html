    The Masters Of France</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Among the many petitions presented that year by &eacute;migr&eacute;s desirous
    of returning to France under the conditional amnesty granted to them by the
    newly-crowned Emperor, was one signed by Mme. la Marquise de Mortain and
    by her son Laurent, then aged twenty-one years, and one signed by M. le Comte
    de Courson for himself and his daughter Fernande. Gaillard says in his memoirs
    of Fouch&eacute; that the latter was greatly averse to the petition being
    granted; but that Napoleon, then on the point of starting for his campaign
    in Prussia, was inclined to leniency in this matter&mdash;leniency which
    roused the ire and contempt of the Minister of Police&mdash;the man who,
    of a truth, and above the Emperor himself, was virtual dictator of France
    these days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A brood of plotters and intriguers,&rdquo; he said scornfully. &ldquo;I
    should have thought your Majesty had had enough of those <i>soi-disant</i> great
    ladies and gentlemen of Normandy and Brittany. I wouldn&rsquo;t have them
    inside these dominions if I had my way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It seems that this phrase: &ldquo;If I had my way,&rdquo; highly amused
    the Emperor. Was it not a well-known fact that in all matters pertaining
    to the internal organization of the new Empire of France, Fouch&eacute; ruled
    far more absolutely than did Napoleon? He knew more. He suspected more. Minister
    of Police and Minister of the Interior at this time, Fouch&eacute; had made
    himself feared even&mdash;so it was said&mdash;by his imperial and capricious
    master.</p>
  <p>And so&mdash;the obscure secretary who was present at this interview tells
    us&mdash;the Emperor laughed, and for once Fouch&eacute; did not have his
    way. On the eve of the campaign which was to culminate in the humiliation
    of Prussia and the Peace of Tilsit, the soldier-Emperor had a throe of compassion,
    of mercy, a shrugging of the shoulders which meant immunity from exile for
    hundreds of men and women&mdash;a home for countless wanderers in foreign
    lands.</p>
  <p>Fouch&eacute;  argued. &ldquo;The Fouvielles I don&rsquo;t mind, nor yet
    Joubert, nor those Fumels. They won&rsquo;t do much harm. We might allow
    the Liancourts to return, though their property has been sold by the State,
    which always leads to trouble. But the Mortains!!! and the Coursons!!...
    Why! I would as lief grant the shades of Fox and Pitt a free permit to wander
    through France at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But we may take it that for once his arguments were of no avail. Napoleon&rsquo;s
    clemency was extended to the Mortains, as it was to the Coursons&mdash;this
    we know, seeing that both the young Marquis and the Comte de Courson, his
    maternal uncle, figured so prominently in the events which this true chronicle
    sets forth to record. As to the cause of this clemency, or, rather, as to
    the cause of Fouch&eacute; not getting his way this once ... well, &rsquo;tis
    our turn to shrug our shoulders.</p>
  <p>Had Fouch&eacute; really desired to keep the Mortains and the Coursons out
    of France, Fouch&eacute; would have had his way. Of this there can be no
    doubt, seeing that Napoleon left the country at the head of his army soon
    after the day when he had that interview with his Minister of Police, leaving
    the latter more absolutely master of France than he had ever been before;
    so why should Fouch&eacute;  not have had his way with the Mortains and with
    Baudouin de Courson and his daughter Fernande?</p>
  <p>Have we not cause for shrugging our shoulders? and for giving credence to
    the rumours which were current throughout France at this time&mdash;namely,
    that the dreaded Minister of Police had at this time begun to coquet with
    the Royalist party, as well as with the Jacobins and the English agents,
    with Talleyrand and with the Comte d&rsquo;Artois&mdash;with any and every
    party in fact, who plotted against the master whom in his heart he had already
    betrayed.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The aforesaid obscure secretary who hath so aptly described the interview
    between the Emperor and Fouch&eacute;, tells us that the latter, after he
    had bowed himself out of the Presence, returned to his private chamber in
    the ministry, and promptly sent for M. Dubois&mdash;then Chief Pr&eacute;fet
    of Police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. Dubois,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;I want the dossier of the
    Mortains and also of the de Coursons now at once. The Emperor is inclined
    to grant them leave to return ... but I don&rsquo;t know ... I must consider....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you all about the Mortains and the Coursons without referring
    to their dossier,&rdquo; retorted Dubois gruffly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The ci-devant Marquise de Mortain....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not ci-devant any longer, M. Dubois,&rdquo; broke in Fouch&eacute; with
    a suave smile. &ldquo;The lady is Mme. la Marquise now ... you yourself are &lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; are
    you not? We have left the &lsquo;citizen&rsquo; and &lsquo;citizeness&rsquo; of
    our revolutionary era well behind us, remember, since our illustrious Master
    placed the crown of Imperial France upon his own head. France is an Empire
    now, Monsieur Dubois. There are no ci-devants any more, and quite a number
    of aristocrats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dubois gave a growl of understanding. It was not easy for his rough, uncultured
    mind to grasp all the various subtleties of Fouch&eacute;&rsquo;s irony.
    He hated Napoleon&rsquo;s all-powerful Minister, hated him all the more that
    Fouch&eacute;&rsquo;s astute and tortuous mentality was beyond his comprehension
    and that he never knew whether the great man was laughing at him or not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said finally, with a shrug of his wide shoulders, &ldquo;Marquise
    or ci-devant I care not; but, anyhow, she is not a woman I would care to
    trust, and the Emperor is very ill-advised....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Emperor, my dear M. Dubois,&rdquo; once more broke in the Minister
    urbanely, &ldquo;takes advice from no one. He starts next week for Prussia
    at the head of his army; he will return anon, having won fresh laurels for
    France and further undying glory for himself ... to-day he is inclined to
    clemency. Mme. la Marquise de Mortain and her son will be allowed to return
    to France, so will M. le Comte de Courson and his daughter Fernande; they
    will be allowed to retake possession of their ch&acirc;teau and of such of
    their lands as have not been sold by the State....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The lands have all been sold,&rdquo; rejoined the pr&eacute;fet curtly, &ldquo;to
    worthy farmers whom it were a scandal to dispossess....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we dispossessing any one, my dear M. Dubois?&rdquo; queried Fouch&eacute;,
    with an indulgent smile directed at the other&rsquo;s Republican ardour&mdash;&ldquo;any
    one, I mean, who happens to have bought confiscated land?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; muttered the other under his breath; &ldquo;but....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you were saying, M. le Pr&eacute;fet?...&rdquo; here interposed
    the Minister more haughtily,  &ldquo;Mme. la Marquise de Mortain is a widow,
    I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. For the second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was first the wife of Bertrand de Maurel....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who would have been a good patriot had he lived.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must imagine so,&rdquo; said Fouch&eacute;, with a smile.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He died in &rsquo;82&mdash;separated from his wife whom he hated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there was a child of that marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Ronnay de Maurel, a loyal patriot ... a fine Republican....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we say a fine Bonapartist, my good M. Dubois?&rdquo; said the
    Minister of Police significantly. &ldquo;I like and trust Ronnay de Maurel.
    I would not like to see him tarred with the worn-out brush of the past decade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well ... Republican or Bonapartist&mdash;&rsquo;tis all the same&mdash;what?
    I was one of those who voted for the proclamation and Ronnay de Maurel was
    another. First Consul for life, with all the splendours of past monarchies,
    or frankly Emperor of the French, there was not much to choose. You were
    an ardent Republican, too, at one time&mdash;eh, M. le Ministre?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;quite so. But we were not speaking of mine unworthy
    self, but of Mme. la Marquise de Mortain and of her son Ronnay de Maurel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Son, indeed!&rdquo; retorted Dubois, with a gruff laugh. &ldquo;M.
    de Maurel has been taught to execrate his mother. He was only four years
    old when his father died, but an uncle brought him up&mdash;old Gaston de
    Maurel&mdash;a magnificent patriot if ever there was one. Nothing of the
    whilom aristo about him ... eats peas with his knife and wears sabots and
    a blouse ... he voted for the death of the King ... just as you did&mdash;eh,
    M. le Ministre?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as I did, my dear friend&mdash;and I am proud of it. Gaston
    de Maurel and I sat in the Assembly of the Convention as representatives
    of the people of France, and in the name of the people we decreed that the
    tyrant Louis Capet, known to the world as Louis XVI., King of France, should
    die upon the scaffold as a traitor to the nation which he had set out to
    govern. Gaston de Maurel may eat peas with a knife, but he rendered the Republic
    and the Directorate infinite services in quelling the so-called Royalist
    risings in his own province of Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now he is old. Some say that he has not many months to live. Ronnay
    de Maurel dwells with him in his Ch&acirc;teau de la Vieuville, near Villemor.
    They both live like peasants in a couple of rooms in the sumptuous ch&acirc;teau.
    The old man is a miser: he has accumulated immense wealth in these past twenty
    years. Ronnay de Maurel, on the other hand, owns the sumptuous demesnes of
    La Frontenay, which he inherited from his father, together with the foundries,
    where he employs five thousand men and manufactures war material for the
    Grand Army. He is already one of the richest men in France&mdash;and he is
    his uncle&rsquo;s sole heir; when old Gaston dies the de Maurel riches will
    be uncountable....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he, too, eats peas with his knife,&rdquo; concluded Fouch&eacute;,
    with a sardonic smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And hardly knows how to read and write,&rdquo; assented the pr&eacute;fet
    of police. &ldquo;A succession of tutors at La Vieuville testify to the rough
    temper and the obstinate savagery of this descendant of aristos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so I have been told,&rdquo; mused Fouch&eacute;. &ldquo;I understand
    that a de Maurel fought in the First Crusade, that another was Captain of
    Musketeers under Louis XIII.; but the present holder of the historic name
    is an ardent Bonapartist, as you say. He fought like a lion against the Royalists
    in Vend&eacute;e; he crossed the Alps with Napoleon, and was wounded at Marengo
    and at Hohenlinden. At Austerlitz, where he accomplished prodigies of valour,
    an Austrian bullet lamed him for life. He is a Grand Eagle of the Legion
    of Honour. His religion is Bonaparte ... he knows no science save that of
    arms&mdash;reads no books and does not know the Carmagnole from the Marseillaise&mdash;he
    is illiterate, uncultured, almost a savage.... These are all facts, are they
    not, M. Dubois?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! Ronnay de Maurel is all that and more. He lives at La Vieuville,
    not ten kilom&egrave;tres from Courson, where Mme. la Marquise, his mother,
    will now be taking up her abode. Oh!&rdquo; added the pr&eacute;fet of police
    with a malevolent grin, &ldquo;how those two will execrate one another!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And watch over one another,&rdquo; commented Fouch&eacute; with his
    enigmatic smile. &ldquo;Ronnay de Maurel will act as a check on the intrigues
    which might be hatching presently in Mme. de Mortain&rsquo;s fertile brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;and no one can act as a check on that woman&rsquo;s
    love of intrigue,&rdquo; growled Dubois surlily. &ldquo;She and her son Laurent
    will give us all plenty to do until....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made a significant gesture with his hand against his neck. Fouch&eacute; smiled. &ldquo;We
    can always give them plenty of rope,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How old is Laurent
    de Mortain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twenty-one or two ... but he has fought against his own country since
    he was sixteen. Mme. de Mortain favours a marriage for him with Fernande
    de Courson, his cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The daughter of Baudouin de Courson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. His only daughter. He is Mme. de Mortain&rsquo;s only brother.
    Their properties adjoin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know. He, too, has been granted leave by the Emperor to return
    to France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A whole pack of those confounded &eacute;migr&eacute;s,&rdquo; once
    more growled the pr&eacute;fet of police&mdash;this time with a savage oath, &ldquo;settled
    down in the most disaffected province of France. Joseph de Puisaye still
    at large ... the department seething with discontent ... everything ready
    for rebellion ... the Emperor away.... Ah! we shall have a fine time down
    there, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  quoth Fouch&eacute; lightly, &ldquo;they are not very
    dangerous now. For one thing, the Mortains, the Coursons and the whole pack
    of them are as poor as church mice. Their lands and farms have all been sold;
    the Mortains have not even a ch&acirc;teau in which to live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Ch&acirc;teau of Courson stands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A dilapidated barrack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;but large enough to harbour every rebel who chooses
    to hatch a plot against the safety of the Empire. The Mortains and Coursons
    will herd together there: Joseph de Puisaye, Fran&ccedil;ois Prigent and
    D&rsquo;Ach&eacute; will use it as their headquarters. From there their bands
    of brigands will be let loose upon both departments&mdash;highway robbery,
    intimidation, pillage and arson&mdash;those Chouans stick at nothing nowadays.
    England no longer supplies them with money for their so-called Royalist cause,
    and they must get money somehow. You remember their criminal outrage upon
    old M. de Ris, and their theft in his ch&acirc;teau of money, valuables and
    jewellery. You remember the murder of Andrein, the Constitutional Bishop
    of Quimper, and the abduction of the Bishop of Vannes&mdash;all for purposes
    of robbery.... Well, in my opinion, those exploits will sink into insignificance
    beside the ones which will be invented and organized in Courson under the
    presidency of Mme. la Marquise and her precious son and brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. Dubois, pr&eacute;fet of police, had, while he spoke, worked himself
    up into a passion of fury. He gesticulated wildly with both arms, shrugged
    his wide shoulders, and banged his fist from time to time upon the desk in
    front of him, so that the inkstand and the papers rattled unceasingly and
    M. le Ministre&rsquo;s nerves were irritated beyond endurance. Now M. Dubois
    had perforce to pause for want of breath. He drew his large coloured handkerchief
    from his pocket and mopped his forehead, which was streaming.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You exaggerate, my good M. Dubois,&rdquo; said Fouch&eacute; soothingly. &ldquo;You
    have an excellent colleague at Caen in the person of M. Vincent....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  ejaculated Dubois contemptuously. &ldquo;He is hand
    in glove with the Royalists.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s M. Caffarello, the pr&eacute;fet....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again an expressive shrug of the shoulders from M. Dubois, who apparently
    had not much faith in the capabilities of his subordinates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And in Ronnay de Maurel you will have a valuable adjunct,&rdquo; added
    the Minister, &ldquo;unless....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, then continued with seeming irrelevance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is Fernande de Courson pretty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has a reputation for beauty,&rdquo; replied Dubois. &ldquo;Why
    do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing ... nothing ... a passing thought ... a dart shot at random....
    You will have to keep your eyes very wide open, my good M. Dubois.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may trust me to do that, M. le Ministre,&rdquo; rejoined Dubois,
    with a leer of comprehension; there was no subtlety about the suggestion,
    and he had understood it well enough this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much of the lady-killer about Ronnay de Maurel,&rdquo; he
    added, laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; rejoined Fouch&eacute; dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And he may rejoin the army, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He cannot do that. The Emperor won&rsquo;t let him. He is far
    too useful in Normandy just now to be mere food for Prussian cannon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause. The pr&eacute;fet of police was tacitly dismissed. M.
    le Ministre drew some papers close to him, and his delicate, blue-veined
    hand toyed with the pen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me any more?&rdquo; queried Dubois abruptly.
    He was always thankful to shake the dust of the ministerial chamber from
    his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well ... unless you have anything else to report, my good M. Dubois,&rdquo; rejoined
    Fouch&eacute; pleasantly, &ldquo;or any further information to impart to
    me about those Mortains&mdash;or the Coursons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else. But I wish to God that the Emperor would
    reconsider his decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Emperor seldom reconsiders any decision, my dear Dubois ... once
    it is a decision. The Mortains and the Coursons have probably landed in France
    by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May they break their necks on the gangway,&rdquo; growled Dubois.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amen to that,&rdquo; quoth Fouch&eacute; lightly. &ldquo;In the meanwhile,
    will you see M. de R&eacute;al on that subject and send special recommendations
    to the pr&eacute;fet and the commissary of police at Caen?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to Ronnay de Maurel, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  interposed the Minister peremptorily, &ldquo;leave de
    Maurel alone. I will write to him myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Such in substance was the interview between the Minister of Police and the
    chief pr&eacute;fet. The secretary, among whose papers was found the above
    account, goes on to say that M. Dubois, having taken his leave, the great
    man was busy for the next half-hour writing a letter with his own hand. With
    his own hand also he folded it, sealed it and addressed it. Then he handed
    it to his secretary with the express order that it should be sent to its
    destination by the next ministerial courier.</p>
  <p>The letter was addressed to M. le Comte Ronnay de Maurel, at his Ch&acirc;teau
    de la Vieuville, near Villemor, D&eacute;partement de l&rsquo;Orne.</p>

    The Return Of The Natives</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;What devastation! What wanton devastation! Oh, those fiends! those
    cruel, callous fiends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise de Mortain, for once in her life, was thoroughly unnerved.
    She was ready to cry ... but tears had not come to her eyes for the past
    twenty years; their well-spring had run dry under the influence of an unconquerable
    energy and of a glowing enthusiasm for a cause which, at any rate, for the
    moment was doomed. Mme. la Marquise did not shed tears when she first arrived
    on a cold, showery night early in May to what had been the luxurious home
    of her childhood. She did not cry when she wandered half aimlessly through
    the salons and apartments of the Ch&acirc;teau de Courson&mdash;all that
    was left to her brother of his once splendid patrimony&mdash;a mere barrack
    now where most windows were cracked, where the paper hung in strips from
    the walls and the ceilings painted by Boucher were stained with smoke and
    damp.</p>
  <p>It was just fourteen years now that the ch&acirc;teau had been standing
    empty and desolate&mdash;fourteen years during which snow, rain and tempest
    had worked their cruel way with shutters and window frames, with stucco,
    plaster and roofs. It was only the fabric itself&mdash;the fine solid stone
    walls of sixteenth century architecture which had remained intact&mdash;the
    monumental staircase, with its marble balustrade, the terraces and fa&ccedil;ades.
    True, the stone was stained by damp and mildew, and the ivy, which fourteen
    years ago had been a pretty and romantic feature of the copings, was now
    a danger to them through the vigour and rankness of its growth; but these
    were matters which could easily be remedied, and which in themselves enhanced
    rather than detracted from the picturesqueness of the stately pile.</p>
  <p>It was the aspect of the interior of the ch&acirc;teau which had wrung from
    Mme. la Marquise de Mortain that cry of bitter sorrow. Fourteen years!!!
    She herself had been staying at Courson when her brother was at last compelled
    to dismiss all his servants, and to flee from the country, as many an aristocrat
    had done already in order to save not so much himself as his family&mdash;his
    young children&mdash;from the terrible doom which daily appeared more inevitable.
    Baudouin de Courson was then a widower, his daughter Fernande was a mere
    baby. He himself intended and did join the army of the Princes at Coblentz,
    together with Arnould de Mortain, his brother-in-law; Mme. la Marquise, with
    her son Laurent and with little Fernande de Courson, found refuge and hospitality
    in England, as many fugitive Royalists had already done; and the Ch&acirc;teau
    de Courson remained for a while under the care of old Matthieu Renard and
    of his wife Annette&mdash;faithful servants of the family.</p>
  <p>M. de Courson had left some money with them to cover the strictly necessary
    expenses of upkeep, and he promised to send them more from time to time.
    He was so sure that this abominable Revolution would not last. God and the
    Allied Powers would soon avenge the murder of King Louis, and sweep the country
    clean from all these assassins and cut-throats. He would restore the Dauphin
    to the throne of his fathers and the loyal adherents of their King to their
    lands!</p>
  <p>Fourteen years had gone by since then. Military autocracy had succeeded
    the excesses of tyrannical democracy; the Directorate had supplanted the
    Republic; the Consulate had followed, and now Napoleon Bonaparte, the son
    of an obscure Corsican citizen, was Emperor of the French&mdash;conqueror
    of half Europe, master of the world&mdash;and the cause of the Bourbons appeared
    more hopeless than it had ever been before. Even the truculent Vendeans&mdash;the
    Royalists of Brittany and Normandy&mdash;had been pacified. It was no use
    fighting any longer. Cadoudal, the invincible champion of a lost cause, had
    perished on the scaffold, and his scattered followers were having recourse
    to robbery, arson and pillage, in order to collect funds for their needs,
    since England had ceased to pour money and treasure into their bottomless
    coffers.</p>
  <p>Matthieu Renard and Annette, his wife, had long since been forced to abandon
    the ch&acirc;teau. No money was forthcoming from Coblentz or from England.
    Food was dear and Matthieu still vigorous. He took up work with the farmers
    and cultivators who had supplanted his aristocratic masters on the domain
    of Courson. The decree of the National Convention of the 1st of February, &rsquo;92,
    had finally dispossessed of their lands those &eacute;migr&eacute;s who did
    not choose to return to France; the land and farms were sold for the benefit
    of the State. Worthy bourgeois and peasants settled down on them and planted
    their cabbages in the former well-preserved enclosures of M. le Comte&rsquo;s
    pleasure grounds. Alone, the vast ch&acirc;teau, with its reception-rooms
    in <i>enfilade</i>, its numerous state-bedrooms, elaborate servants&rsquo; quarters,
    stablings and coach-houses, proved unsaleable. It remained the property of
    the nation until the day when the soldier-Emperor with a stroke of his pen
    restored it to its original owners.</p>
  <p>It was little more now than an empty husk&mdash;swept clean by ruthless,
    thieving hands of every relic from the past&mdash;stripped of every object
    of value. When M. le Comte arrived, the tricolour flag was still waving on
    its staff up aloft, and across the stone fa&ccedil;ade was writ in large
    letters the great Republican device: &ldquo;Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;,
    Fraternit&eacute;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise de Mortain, who accompanied her brother on his return to
    his home, as she had done in exile, had the flag torn down and the device
    erased; but it would take months of labour and a mint of money to restore
    the ch&acirc;teau to its former splendour; and labour was scarce these days
    when the Grand Army, fighting half Europe risen in coalition against the
    Corsican usurper, was taking heavy toll of the manhood of the country and
    winning undying laurels at Marengo and Austerlitz, in Italy and in Prussia.
    And even labour was less scarce than money.</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise, wandering through the dismantled salons and through the
    dank apartments eaten into by rust and damp, did not cry, nor did she wring
    her hands, but the hatred which had burned in her heart for fourteen years
    against the persecutors of her caste and the murderers of her King stirred
    within her with renewed violence, and she registered an oath that all the
    energy, the strength and the cunning which she possessed would more than
    ever be devoted to the undoing of the usurper and the triumph of the cause
    of her King.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And for this,&rdquo; she said to M. le Comte de Courson, who had
    viewed his devastated patrimony in moodiness and silence, &ldquo;for this
    the ch&acirc;teau is admirably situated. The country round seems more lonely
    than it ever was before, the woods are more dense, the moors more inaccessible.
    The spies of that infamous Bonaparte can never penetrate to our villages.
    We are within easy reach of Brest and of the English agents, and the whole
    country is seething with revolt against the tyranny of militarism, the dearness
    of food, the excessive taxation. We have not come here, Baudouin,&rdquo; she
    continued vehemently, &ldquo;in order to lament and to sit still under crying
    injustice and the rule of a base-born usurper. We have come in order to do
    and to fight. It is going to be war to the knife in Normandy once again,
    and let the Corsican and his crowd look to themselves. Cadoudal&rsquo;s bomb
    failed&mdash;daggers, poisons have failed.... Bonaparte is surrounded and
    guarded by the most astute and the most unscrupulous police the world has
    ever known. Well, we&rsquo;ll bribe his guard and outwit his police. Never
    for one single hour of the day or night shall the usurper feel that his life
    is safe from lurking executioners! Daggers? poisons? We&rsquo;ll try them
    all again in turn. He has stuck at nothing&mdash;we&rsquo;ll stick at nothing;
    an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth; we&rsquo;ll meet murder with murder
    and pillage with pillage. And, in the meanwhile, we&rsquo;ll fight&mdash;fight
    to the last man&mdash;fight with every resource at our command. Money we
    must have ... we&rsquo;ll loot and we&rsquo;ll rob and we&rsquo;ll burn....
    They are all bandits, those revolutionary cut-throats; well, we&rsquo;ll
    be bandits, too, and cut-throats and assassins if need be, and we&rsquo;ll
    not cry &lsquo;peace&rsquo; or &lsquo;halt&rsquo; until Louis XVIII., by
    the grace of God, has come into his own again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later in the day, fired by her own enthusiasm, lashed into fury by the sight
    of her ruined childhood&rsquo;s home, Mme. la Marquise was still making wild
    plans for the coming guerrilla campaign against the Corsican and his army.
    M. de Courson tried to pacify her with a few counsels of prudence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, for the moment, my dear Denise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we
    must not brusque matters. We must let Joseph de Puisaye and Prigent make
    their plans quietly. Enough that for the moment they know that this house
    is at their disposal....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough?&rdquo;  retorted Madame vehemently. &ldquo;Nothing will be
    enough, save the death of that abominable Bonaparte. Oh!&rdquo; she added,
    with a sigh of desperate impatience as she stretched out her arms in longing, &ldquo;how
    I long to be even with that usurper and his crowd of vulgar sycophants! How
    I long to see him fawn for mercy and cringe at Versailles at the foot of
    King Louis&rsquo; throne, whilst....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are not there yet, my dear Denise,&rdquo; quoth the Comte gently, &ldquo;and
    you must remember that our party has become very scattered and very weak.
    Bonaparte has an enormous following at this moment. His victories have caused
    this blind and stupid nation to deify him. Indeed, the people of France look
    on him as nothing less than a god. His popularity is immense, his power unlimited.
    The loyal adherents of our rightful King are a mere handful now&mdash;a few
    of us of the old r&eacute;gime have remained true&mdash;a few unruly peasants
    have rallied to the fleur-de-lys. What can a few hundred of our men do against
    some thousands of Bonaparte&rsquo;s trained troops? And he has threatened
    to send a hundred thousand against our Chouans, if they should ever rise
    in a mass again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  exclaimed Madame exultantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll oppose
    him with ten thousand whose ardour will outweigh his numbers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has threatened to burn down our cities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take refuge in our villages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll burn our villages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll seek shelter in the woods. Nay, my good Baudouin,&rdquo; added
    Mme. la Marquise firmly, &ldquo;counsels of prudence come ill from you. You
    and Laurent will lead our brave peasants to victory&mdash;of this I am as
    convinced as that I am alive. And if we cannot fight in the open we&rsquo;ll
    fight in the dark; we&rsquo;ll oppose force with ruse and power with cunning.
    The brutal Corsican may, in the meanwhile, destroy the homes of peaceable
    citizens, or ruin the properties of worthy bourgeois who have nothing to
    do with this war; but as for us, he shall only find us when our brave little
    army is ready for him&mdash;and not before; and then we&rsquo;ll destroy
    him and his battalions one by one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was impossible to resist for long the power and influence of Madame&rsquo;s
    wonderful enthusiasm. For her there was no lost cause&mdash;no hopelessness.
    Louis, the eighteenth of his name, was effectively King of France in her
    sight, whether the Corsican usurper chose to place an imperial crown on his
    own head or not; and God was bound by the decrees of His own laws to see
    that King Louis&mdash;King by divine right&mdash;did eventually sit upon
    the throne of his forbears after this unexplainable period of exile and of
    stress.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>In the evening when, in the small boudoir which had been made habitable,
    the lamps were lit and a fire burned in the tall hearth, when the shutters
    were closed and chairs drawn nearer to one another, the place looked a trifle
    less desolate. Matthieu Renard and his wife Annette had thrown up their work
    under the farmers and cultivators whom they despised, and returned to serve
    the masters, whom even in their poverty they recognized as alone worthy of
    their services. Annette had cooked a good dinner, Matthieu had unearthed
    a bottle of wine from a disused cellar, which had almost miraculously escaped
    perquisition. The world did not appear so callous or so inimical as it had
    done earlier in the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about Ronnay?&rdquo; M. de Courson had asked as soon as Matthieu
    and Annette had gone and the doors were closed on the intimate family circle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; retorted Mme. la Marquise. The sound of her
    eldest son&rsquo;s name grated unpleasantly on her ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does he know you have arrived?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I have written to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no object in wasting time. He and I will have to meet within
    the next few days. I want to get that first meeting over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have asked him to come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that he will come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He cannot refuse to pay his respects to his mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. de Courson shrugged his shoulders and stared moodily into the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything fresh about Ronnay de Maurel, Baudouin?&rdquo; queried
    Mme. la Marquise sharply. &ldquo;Anything that I ought to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only what is common talk round the neighbourhood, my dear,&rdquo; he
    replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that is?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Gaston de Maurel has brought up his nephew&mdash;your son, my
    dear Denise&mdash;as little better than the workmen in his factories. Ronnay,
    it seems, is quite illiterate, and his manners are those of a peasant. The
    most violent democratic principles have been inculcated into him from childhood....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever since the law freed me from his father&rsquo;s brutalities ...&rdquo; broke
    in Madame coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  assented M. de Courson, in an obviously conciliatory
    spirit, &ldquo;when your husband died, my dear, his brother Gaston took up
    his work with the boy. You know the type of man Gaston de Maurel always was&mdash;the
    Revolution suited his temperament exactly. Cruel, vindictive, jealous, violent,
    he voted for the September massacres and for the execution of the King. Had
    Ronnay been old enough he, too, would have been a regicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise shuddered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And even you, Baudouin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have oft rebuked
    me for my hatred to the boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your son, Denise, your own flesh and blood. Aye!&rdquo; he added
    more emphatically, &ldquo;so much your own flesh and blood; that he has your
    character in a great measure&mdash;your energy, your enthusiasm.... Unfortunately
    he misapplies both....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To crime and disloyalty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; there is the pity of it. He is a dangerous man, Denise,&rdquo; continued
    M. de Courson earnestly. &ldquo;It were best to keep him at arm&rsquo;s-length.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At arm&rsquo;s length,&rdquo; retorted Madame hotly. &ldquo;My dear
    Baudouin, are you serious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have never been so serious in my life. I think that it is a boundless
    pity that you have already made overtures in the direction of the de Maurels.
    I would have left the whole pack of those revolutionary brigands severely
    alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He spoke with unwonted energy, for in all matters of argument M. de Courson
    invariably gave in to his more energetic sister. But he felt strongly on
    the subject, and looked as if he were determined to assert his will this
    time, at any rate. But Mme. la Marquise was not prepared to give in, and
    she broke in once more, in her authoritative way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall not leave the revolutionary brigands alone, my good Baudouin,&rdquo; she
    said. &ldquo;I mean to try and win my son Ronnay over to our cause....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad, Denise!&rdquo; exclaimed M. le Comte.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you deny that he would be invaluable to us if he were on our
    side?&rdquo; she argued.</p>
  <p>Then as M. le Comte remained silent, with frowning eyes fixed in deep puzzlement
    before him, she added with ever-growing energy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember that Ronnay is passing rich, and that old Gaston cannot
    last long, so they say. I hear that he is dying. When he dies all his accumulated
    wealth, which is immense, will also go to Ronnay, who will certainly then
    be one of the richest men in France. Moreover, he already disposes of five
    thousand skilled men, and of the means of making engines and munitions of
    war. The men, so I am told, are devoted to him&mdash;except for a few malcontents.
    They look upon him as one of themselves; they would as soon follow him on
    our side as on that of Bonaparte. Think what that means, my dear Baudouin!
    Men and money to our cause! and we need both sadly. It means conciliating
    an ogre who no doubt is too stupid, too illiterate to have any rooted convictions
    of his own. Tell me!&rdquo; she concluded, with a note of triumph at her
    own unanswerable argument, &ldquo;were it not passing wise to make friends
    with such a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! if you could do that, Denise...!&rdquo; quoth M. de Courson,
    with an impatient sigh and a dubious shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;But if
    your son Ronnay hath aught of the de Maurels in him, you will fail. Bertrand
    de Maurel was not amenable, remember, and you tried hard in those days to
    win him over to our side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise was silent for a moment or two. It was her turn now to
    stare moodily into the fire. Memory had carried her back to those early years
    of her marriage, when Bertrand de Maurel&rsquo;s dictatorial ways and crude
    love-making had caused her ever-rebellious spirit to chafe under his tyranny.
    Brought up under the strict r&eacute;gime of the time which made of the <i>jeune
    fille</i> little more than a puppet to dance to the piping of her parents,
    Denise de Courson had hoped to find emancipation in marriage. Bertrand de
    Maurel, however, soon taught her that a husband&rsquo;s yoke can be more
    irksome than a father&rsquo;s. Where Denise hoped to find independence of
    thought and of action she found a tyrant whose democratic ideals amounted
    to bigotry; where she hoped to lead a free and intellectual life of her own,
    she found herself a slave to a system of philanthropy which was repugnant
    alike to her aristocratic sense and to her love of her own comforts. Bertrand
    de Maurel had mapped out for his young wife a life of usefulness and of sound
    influence among his dependents, and Denise loathed the very propinquity of
    those whom she was wont to call &ldquo;the great unwashed.&rdquo; Bertrand
    had schemes for improving the conditions of labour, the housing of his peasantry,
    the production of the land. They were crude, embryotic ideas, perhaps, but
    they sprang from a mind attuned to the growing discontent of one class against
    the glaring injustice imposed upon it by the other; they sprang from a heart
    that was warm and sympathetic, if not always logical. He was at first only
    feeling his way toward a better understanding with his dependents, scenting
    the approaching danger of those horrible reprisals which were destined to
    remain a perpetual stain upon the history of the nation, and which a little
    conciliation, a little goodwill, a few more men like Bertrand and Gaston
    de Maurel might perhaps have averted.</p>
  <p>But with none of her husband&rsquo;s aims or his ideals had Denise the slightest
    sympathy. It was a case of hopeless incompatibility of tempers, further aggravated
    by irascible and imperious characters on both sides. Bertrand de Maurel had
    no more understanding of his wife&rsquo;s nature than she had of his; no
    more sympathy with her ideals and her train of thought. Perpetual bickering
    led to outbursts of passionate recrimination; an impassable abyss of divergent
    political views did the rest. Revolutionary and democratic ideals had already
    eaten into the soul of Bertrand de Maurel and of his brother Gaston; and
    with Denise, belief in the divine right of kings was an integral part of
    her religion. After five years of miserable and acrimonious conflicts separation
    appeared the only solution of an impossible situation. Denise shook the dust
    of La Frontenay from her aristocratic feet, leaving all her illusions behind
    her, together with the child born of this unfortunate marriage&mdash;a boy
    not yet three years old, whom she had already learned to hate.</p>
  <p>Ronnay had never been her child. As a tiny baby he was already the image
    of his father&mdash;with the same wilful and tyrannical temper, the same
    outbursts of passionate wrath, the same characteristic toss of the head that
    shook recalcitrant curls from the low, square forehead. Ronnay had his father&rsquo;s
    auburn hair, his father&rsquo;s deep-set eyes, which at times were almost
    black, at others of a deep violet-blue; he had his father&rsquo;s massive
    limbs and square-set jaw. Oh, yes! Ronnay was a true de Maurel. Not all the
    upbringing in the world, not all a mother&rsquo;s influence, would have trained
    the lad to walk in the footsteps of his aristocratic forbears. The word &ldquo;democrat&rdquo; was
    already writ plainly upon the sturdy form of the tiny child, as he toddled,
    unaided, through the sheds of his father&rsquo;s foundries, scorning the
    delicate feminine hands of nurse or governess, who would have guided his
    footsteps, clinging to the overseers and the roughly-clad workmen, who placed
    their tools in his little hands and showed him the way to use them. The spirit
    of democracy shone out of the lad&rsquo;s blue eyes when, standing between
    his Uncle Gaston&rsquo;s knees, he listened spellbound to marvellous tales
    of the tyranny of kings and of the heroic stand which was even then being
    made in the New World over the ocean far away by a nation which was resolved
    to be free.</p>
  <p>Yes, Ronnay de Maurel was, indeed, a true son of his father&mdash;a worthy
    nephew of Gaston de Maurel and the godson of La Fayette; he had nothing of
    the de Coursons in him. And in the years that ensued, when Gaston had voted
    for the death of his King and Ronnay had won his first laurels under the
    base-born Corsican adventurer fighting against his own kith and kin and against
    the King&rsquo;s most holy Majesty, Denise de Mortain&mdash;as she now was&mdash;often
    wished that some beneficent Fate had smothered her first-born at birth.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise roused herself from her meditations. There had been silence
    between her and her brother for some time, while her mind took this sudden
    incursion into the past; but at the further end of the room Fernande de Courson
    and Laurent de Mortain were whispering and laughing together. Madame turned
    and looked over her shoulder at the two young people; then she said abruptly
    and with seeming irrelevance to her brother:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande is getting too old for all that childishness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Childishness, my dear,&rdquo; said the Comte, somewhat bewildered
    at this sudden change in his sister&rsquo;s train of thought. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    understand....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t wish her to become the butt of all the gossips in
    the village ... which she will do if you allow this childish philandering
    to go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean Laurent?&rdquo; he queried blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;of course. Fernande is seventeen&mdash;Laurent has not
    a sou to bless himself with....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the moment,&rdquo; interposed the Comte. &ldquo;When King Louis
    comes into his own again, Laurent will retake possession of his heritage....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise shook her head impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confiscated lands will never be restored,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;not
    even by King Louis. The process would be too dangerous; it would kindle a
    fresh revolution. Those of us whose lands have been sold by that execrable
    Revolutionary government will remain poor and dispossessed to the end of
    our days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Baudouin de Courson looked keenly at his sister, still not understanding
    her sudden new mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does that mean,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;does that mean that the project
    of marriage between our children is not to come to pass?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Madame broke in hurriedly; &ldquo;I did not mean that,
    of course. You know, dear, that I could not have meant that.... You misunderstood
    me ... or I, mayhap, expressed myself clumsily. Pessimism led me too far
    ... no wonder&mdash;eh, my dear Baudouin? The spectacle of our ruined home
    has grated harshly on my nerves. No, no! I did not mean that. King Louis,&mdash;may
    God guard him!&mdash;will richly reward those of us who have given up everything
    for his sake. There will be money compensation for you and money compensation
    for Laurent ... and, please God, the past splendours of Mortain will one
    day be revived ... but it will all take time ... years perhaps ... and, in
    the meanwhile, I think you should talk seriously to Fernande. She ought to
    be a little more circumspect, and not proclaim her affection for Laurent
    quite so openly as she has done hitherto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would it not be best, in that case,&rdquo; rejoined M. de Courson
    coldly, &ldquo;if Fernande and I took up our abode elsewhere and left you
    in possession of Courson? We might go to Caen, perhaps, or to Brest.... We
    should still be in touch with you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, my good Baudouin,&rdquo; interposed Madame decisively. &ldquo;You
    must remain here while our army is being organized; this place is most central&mdash;it
    shall be our headquarters. Already we have arranged that it shall be the
    meeting-place whenever any of our leaders wish to communicate with us. No,
    no, there can be no question of your going! Moreover....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;  he queried, seeing that she had paused, obviously hesitating
    whether to go on or not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should not tell you of my project, my dear
    Baudouin,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I propose to take up my abode at
    La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;La Frontenay? I don&rsquo;t understand....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that old Gaston de Maurel is dying. Ronnay is his
    heir. La Vieuville will then become his home.... Why should not La Frontenay
    become mine? It was my husband&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But ...&rdquo; stammered the Comte, reluctant to put into words the
    thought that was uppermost in his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; broke in the Marquise coldly, &ldquo;you mean that
    Ronnay de Maurel has been taught to hate me as bitterly as did his father
    to the day of his death, as bitterly as does old Gaston de Maurel to this
    day. I know that; but, remember, my dear Baudouin, that there is nothing
    in the world which I would not do for the sake of our cause, and that, as
    I told you just now, it would be of immense help to us if Ronnay and I became
    good friends and I could take up my abode at La Frontenay. I should get the
    control of his house ... of his money, too, to a great extent. The ch&acirc;teau
    is vast ... three times the size of Courson; it has extensive cellars, which
    would be immeasurably useful for the storing of arms. Even if Ronnay desired
    to live there after Gaston&rsquo;s death rather than at La Vieuville, he
    still would probably be absent from time to time, and then the ch&acirc;teau
    would be entirely at our disposal.... Oh!&rdquo; she added more warmly, &ldquo;the
    advantages of my residing at La Frontenay are too numerous to name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it, but I fear me that you will find it difficult
    to get over your son&rsquo;s dislike ... and over his mistrust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Difficult, I know. But not impossible. I must play my cards well
    ... that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must also remember, my dear Denise, that &mdash;even if you succeed
    in your designs, which I take leave to doubt&mdash;you will, first of all,
    have to make sure that Ronnay de Maurel has no thought of marriage. If you
    take up your residence at La Frontenay&mdash;if we are to make use of the
    ch&acirc;teau for our campaign&mdash;we ought to be certain that a young
    bride won&rsquo;t turn us out within the first few months if she found La
    Vieuville not sufficiently to her liking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame mused for a second or two in silence, then she said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had thought of marriage in connection with Ronnay.... I must confess,
    in fact, that such an eventuality has very much entered into my calculations,
    but....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you my project later on, my good Baudouin&mdash;not
    just now. But be assured that if my son Ronnay marries, it will be a wife
    of my choice. For the moment there is no danger of his turning his thoughts
    to courtship. If rumour has spoken correctly, he is little better than a
    savage, and if he has turned his sentimental thoughts to some village wench&mdash;as
    illiterate and rough-mannered as himself&mdash;why, she must be got out of
    the way, that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Baudouin de Courson said nothing more. He stared back into the fire, and
    to his mind also there came back some memories of the past. While his sister
    spoke with that air of authority which became her proud beauty and majestic
    figure so well, his thoughts had flown back to the dead husband&mdash;to
    Bertrand de Maurel, dictatorial and authoritative, too, the martinet who
    tried to drill this imperious woman into submission. No wonder that husband
    and wife had quarrelled! No wonder that the passion of a brief and romantic
    courtship had so soon changed to invincible hate!</p>
  <p>M. de Courson sighed. He loved and admired his sister, whose aims and ideals
    were akin to his own, whose stern virtues guided her every action; but all
    that he had heard about Ronnay de Maurel did not lead him to think for a
    moment that he would be amenable to his mother&rsquo;s tyranny. Rumour had
    described him as rude of manner, abrupt of speech and turbulent in his ways;
    nor had this description of his nephew altogether displeased M. de Courson.
    A wild creature is more easily tamed than one which is crafty and subtle,
    and where passions are most tumultuous there gentleness and love have easier
    access. But gentleness and love only&mdash;not tyranny. Ronnay de Maurel
    as an enemy might prove as dangerous as he was undoubtedly powerful. His
    active sympathy or even passive indifference would be of inestimable value
    to the Royalist cause; this M. de Courson was bound to admit. But he was
    equally convinced that it would require all a woman&rsquo;s tenderness and
    tact to win Ronnay over, and, even so, success was more than doubtful and
    the task a risky one at best. A spark of motherly love, a touch of womanly
    sympathy might succeed; peremptory ways, a harsh, authoritative manner was
    inevitably doomed to failure.</p>
  <p>What his sister&rsquo;s plans were with regard to this delicate matter Baudouin
    de Courson did not attempt to guess. Like all men of action, he was wholly
    unversed in that subtle knowledge of the feminine heart which no man has
    ever completely fathomed. Perhaps if at this moment he could have read what
    was going on in Denise&rsquo;s fertile brain, he might have been spared all
    the heartburnings which lay in wait for him in the near future; he and those
    he cared for might have been spared the coming bitter conflict &rsquo;twixt
    warring ideals; they might have been spared more than one abiding sorrow.</p>
  <p>But Mme. la Marquise did not choose to take her brother into her confidence
    then, and he did not try to penetrate her secrets. And thus were the Fates
    left to weave unmolested the threads of five people&rsquo;s destinies.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter &nbsp;3<br>
    The Hermits Of La Vieuville</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>At the self-same hour, whilst Denise de Mortain and her brother, the Comte
    de Courson, were discussing their future plans for rousing the country-side
    once more into open revolt, Gaston de Maurel and his nephew Ronnay were poring
    over a letter which was written in a bold and firm hand, and which a village
    courier had brought over from Courson an hour ago.</p>
  <p>The letter by now was little more than a rag, stained with finger marks,
    with corners torn off and contents blurred by constant crushing of the paper
    in hot, impatient hands.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Maurel sat in a huge arm-chair, his head leaning against a number
    of pillows which had been piled up behind his back; his eyes&mdash;the deep-set
    eyes of the Maurels&mdash;were fixed inquiringly, almost appealingly, upon
    the bowed head of his nephew, who, with elbows resting upon the table, was
    effectually shielding his face from the searching gaze of the invalid.</p>
  <p>The room in which the two men sat was one of the kitchens of the small old-fashioned
    Ch&acirc;teau of La Vieuville&mdash;the appanage of the younger sons of the
    house&mdash;granted to them in perpetual fief by the head of the family in
    the days when the de Maurels were Dukes of Montauban and held their lands
    direct from the King. Bertrand de Maurel, the last holder of the title, fired
    by democratic ideals, had cast aside what he termed an empty bauble, long
    before the wave of social equality had swept over the land. His younger brother
    Gaston had followed in his footsteps. A passionate and uncompromising Republican,
    he had voted for the death of the King&mdash;dispassionately and from a firm
    conviction that such a course was vital for the welfare of the nation; and
    thenceforward he divested himself voluntarily of every appurtenance and privilege
    of rank. He lived up to his convictions from the first day that he gave expression
    to them in the National Assembly; and from that time forth not one single
    contradiction, not one single concession to past traditions or past love
    of ease and luxury, marred the Spartan-like purity of his life. He mixed
    with the proletariat, lived with the proletariat; and the boy Ronnay, whom
    his dead brother Bertrand had committed to his care and wholly to his discretion,
    he brought up in the same thoughts, the same feelings, the same ideals as
    his own.</p>
  <p>Bertrand de Maurel had left his boy an immense fortune; Gaston administered
    it by turning the celebrated iron foundries of La Frontenay into a gigantic
    factory for the manufacture of munitions of war. That was the time when the
    people of France were called to arms by the Revolutionary Government against
    the whole of Europe. France demanded of all her children that they should
    give the best of what they had in order to help her to fight all the foreign
    nations who had banded themselves in coalition against her. Gaston de Maurel
    was in the forefront of those who gave their all. An incurable affection
    of the heart prevented his taking up arms for the Republic which he had helped
    to create; but he had talent, brains, money, influence, a genius for organizing
    and an inexhaustible fund of patriotism and self-sacrifice. At once he marshalled
    up for the benefit of the State all the vast industrial forces over which
    his brother&rsquo;s will had given him absolute control, until the day when
    Ronnay chose to take up the reins of government himself.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He toiled side by side with the workmen in the factory. To each man he assigned
    his part, so that each man was able to do his best. He sorted, sifted, arrayed
    the manpower at his disposal, so that every individual in his turn was able
    to give of his best. And his own eye was everywhere. He methodized everything;
    he supervised everything.</p>
  <p>And&mdash;almost despite himself&mdash;he accumulated immense wealth, not
    only for his nephew, but also for himself. He, too, had inherited quite a
    substantial fortune from his mother, who was the sister and co-heiress of
    the Marquis de Rouverdain. His capital he lent to the State at interest,
    and he kept up the fabric of his Ch&acirc;teau of La Vieuville; but beyond
    that he spent nothing on himself. He only looked upon himself as the administrator
    of his nephew&rsquo;s patrimony&mdash;as the chief overseer of the Maurel
    foundries. People called him a miser, and he was that in a sense, for money
    in his hands perpetually begat money.</p>
  <p>The gossip of the village had it that Ronnay de Maurel hardly knew how to
    read and write. That, of course, was mischievous. The days of the Terror
    and the Revolution did not allow of grand tours abroad, of courses at the
    Sorbonne, or of dancing and deportment classes; but old Gaston taught Ronnay
    all that he knew himself, even though he brought him up as a peasant. The
    lad wore a peasant&rsquo;s blouse and sabots on his feet; he was ten years
    old before he tasted any meat, twelve before he opened a book. But when,
    at fifteen years of age, he joined the army of the Republic, he fought like
    a hero until that Austrian bullet disabled him; then he retired&mdash;a Grand-Eagle
    of the Legion of Honour, one of the twenty men in the whole of France whom
    the newly-crowned Emperor thus honoured and trusted most.</p>
  <p>It was at Austerlitz that Ronnay de Maurel got the wound which had lamed
    him for life. Napoleon sent him home to look after the de Maurel munitions
    factory, and, incidentally, to keep an eye on the hot-headed Royalists of
    Normandy, who were still brewing mischief against the new Empire and trafficking
    with the foreigners against their own country. Ronnay de Maurel returned
    to La Frontenay covered with honours, but eleven years&rsquo; campaigning
    in Italy and on the Danube, under General Bonaparte, did not tend to the
    softening of manners or the acquisition of social graces. In the early days
    of the Republic and the Directorate&mdash;and even of the Consulate&mdash;campaigning
    meant fighting often on an empty stomach, nearly always with insufficient
    clothing; it meant tramping shoeless through the snows of the Alps or sleeping
    shelterless on the sodden bog-lands of Belgium. It meant living in comradeship
    with all the scum of humanity which the Republican Government had scraped
    together, in order to compose an army numerous enough to stand up against
    the overwhelmingly superior forces arraigned against France. It meant all
    that and more for many years; and when de Maurel obtained at twenty-six the
    grade of general of division&mdash;for promotion was over-quick then under
    the eye of the greatest war-lord the world has ever known&mdash;and donned
    the gorgeous uniform of an officer of high rank in the Imperial army, he
    knew neither how to enter a drawing-room, nor how to kiss a lady&rsquo;s
    hand. He knew less than did the sons of the more prominent overseers of his
    own factory; his manners were more uncouth&mdash;his speech more rude.</p>
  <p>Having laid aside his fine uniform as general of division, he once more
    took up the peasant&rsquo;s blouse and the sabots which his Uncle Gaston&mdash;on
    his part&mdash;had never laid aside.</p>
  <p>The days of democracy were at an end; the Imperial Court vied in brilliancy
    with the royal courts of long ago, but Ronnay de Maurel saw nothing of it.
    He had never been to Paris, and when he had stood face to face with his Emperor,
    both were covered with the grime and smoke of battle, both had their clothes
    half torn off their backs, both had muddy boots and unwashed hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fight our enemies with both hands, General,&rdquo; Napoleon had
    said to de Maurel on that occasion; &ldquo;with one you wield a sword, with
    the other you make our cannon balls. In you France has two citizens&mdash;our
    beloved country two sons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes! the days of democracy were at an end, nor had old Gaston de Maurel
    ever aught to do with the new days of splendour. He had continued to live
    in two rooms of his beautiful ch&acirc;teau, both on the ground-floor and
    away from the main fa&ccedil;ade; to these rooms one of the small back doors
    gave access; he lived like a workman, he fed and dressed and toiled like
    a workman.</p>
  <p>One evening there was a knock at the back door. Gaston went to open it,
    for he only had an old woman from the village to cook his dinner for him
    and to make his bed, and she had gone back home an hour ago. On the threshold
    stood a man in a tattered uniform covered with tarnished gold lace; on his
    breast was the highest insignia of the newly-created order. Uncle and nephew
    shook one another silently by the hand. No warmer greeting passed between
    them. That evening Ronnay de Maurel shared his uncle&rsquo;s frugal supper,
    and the next morning saw him at the factory, having already taken over the
    command of the gigantic undertaking of which henceforth he became sole master.</p>
  <p>And from that same day onwards a tall, massive figure, with head erect and
    deep-set, violet eyes fixed upon the horizon far away, could be seen every
    morning at break of day wending its way across the fields from the ch&acirc;teau
    to the factory, a matter of three kilometres, in all weathers&mdash;wet or
    fine, snow or rain, in the teeth of a gale or of blinding sleet&mdash;a woollen
    cap upon his head, his bare feet thrust into sabots. The country-folk, as
    he passed them by, would nudge one another and murmur &ldquo;The General!&rdquo; and
    would point to his left leg, which he dragged slightly as he trudged across
    a newly-ploughed field.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;If you go, my lad, mark my words, you&rsquo;ll rue it to your dying
    day. That woman is dangerous, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sick man spoke as forcibly, as emphatically as his growing weakness
    would allow; he brought his emaciated hand down upon the table with extraordinary
    vigour; his eyes, hollow and circled, were fixed upon his nephew, who still
    held his head persistently buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not one to turn my back on danger,&rdquo; said de Maurel after
    a while, &ldquo;and I must obey the Minister&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Minister of Police does not know your mother, Ronnay,&rdquo; rejoined
    the invalid insistently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is because he does know her&mdash;or, at any rate, because he
    suspects her&mdash;that he wants me to keep an eye on her and her doings.
    I cannot do that very well if we are to persist in this open enmity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! in open enmity!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, whilst a look
    of bitter rancour crept into his hollow eyes. &ldquo;Open enmity,&rdquo; he
    reiterated firmly, &ldquo;that is the only correlation possible between us
    and a de Courson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Minister thinks otherwise,&rdquo; responded Ronnay dryly. &ldquo;And
    from what he says, so did the Emperor. My mother apparently thinks otherwise,
    too, else she had not sent for me so soon. She says that she desires speech
    with me. I&rsquo;d better, in any case, hear what she hath to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can tell you that, my boy, without your troubling to go all
    the way to Courson to hear it. Your mother, my good Ronnay, has realized
    that you are passing rich; she has heard that I am dying, and that after
    my death your wealth and influence will vie with that of any man in France.
    She wants to see if she can cozen you into placing it at her service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not easily cozened,&rdquo; muttered de Maurel stubbornly, &ldquo;and
    fear of her wiles is not like to make me disobey the Minister&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will do as you like, my lad,&rdquo; rejoined the invalid dryly; &ldquo;you
    are as self-willed and as obstinate as your father was before you. And I
    can do nothing save to warn you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Warn me of what?&rdquo; queried Ronnay impatiently. &ldquo;Am I a
    child that I cannot be trusted to look after myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a child in many ways, my dear General. A child in this, that
    you are no match for the pin-pricks which your lady-mother knows so well
    how to deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I care nothing for women&rsquo;s pin-pricks. My hide is tough and
    smooth-tongued stabs will glide off me like water off a duck&rsquo;s back.
    If my lady-mother is disagreeable, I can be disagreeable, too. If she refuses
    to be friends, I need never set foot inside her doors again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she will not refuse to be friends with you, my lad! Have I not
    said that Mme. la Marquise de Mortain knows her eldest son to be wealthy
    and influential? She will not refuse to be friends with a man who might prove
    useful to her in her many and varied intrigues. Your lady-mother, my good
    Ronnay, will pour honey and sugar on you, I have no doubt of that. &rsquo;Twas
    not against an open enmity on her part that I desired to warn you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against what, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against her protestations of goodwill and of love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo;  commented de Maurel, with a shrug of his broad shoulders. &ldquo;I
    am not like to listen to protestations of love. But what use is there to
    argue the matter at such length, Uncle Gaston?&rdquo; he added, with obvious
    exasperation. &ldquo;Have I not read you the Minister&rsquo;s letter and
    told you that my mind was made up? How could I act otherwise when&mdash;as
    the Minister tells me&mdash;the Emperor himself, ere he left for Prussia,
    desired me to try and make friends with the de Coursons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo;  ejaculated the invalid, and a sardonic grin almost
    distorted for the moment his thin, pale face. &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he continued more calmly: &ldquo;There is no friendship possible, my
    lad, between us and the de Coursons. I know that I may as well be talking
    to that bedstead over there as to you. You say your mind is made up, and
    you have all your father&rsquo;s obstinacy and more. You will go to Courson,
    in spite of what I say. You&rsquo;ll go and you&rsquo;ll weep bitter tears
    of repentance for the rest of your life; of that I am as convinced as that
    I have one foot in the grave and am dragging the other one in as fast as
    may be. I am sick and weak; some will tell you that old Gaston de Maurel
    is already in his dotage; but you are the one being in the world whom I care
    for now, and I am not going to let my weakness get the better of me, and
    allow you to run your stupid head against a stone wall which will bruise,
    if it will not crush you, without raising my feeble voice in protest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You but waste your precious breath, Uncle Gaston,&rdquo; rejoined
    de Maurel more gently. &ldquo;I am nothing if not a soldier, and I&rsquo;d
    as soon think of cutting off my right hand as to ignore my Emperor&rsquo;s
    wishes. When he pinned the Grand-Eagle of the Legion of Honour upon my breast,
    he gave me the highest proof possible of his belief and trust in me. I cannot
    fight for him for the present, with this accursed maimed leg of mine; but
    I should be a coward and a cur were I to disobey his responsible Minister
    in so small a matter. Be assured, Uncle Gaston, that no harm will come to
    me. No harm can come to any man through friendship with his mother, even
    if she be a de Courson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho! you think so, my lad, do you?&rdquo; retorted the invalid, with
    a cynical laugh. &ldquo;All the harm in the world, which not an ocean of
    tears could ever wash away, came to your father, because he fell in love
    with Denise de Courson. My brother Bertrand worshipped that woman!&rdquo; continued
    old Gaston, and from his enfeebled frame he seemed to gather force as he
    spoke, with white, marble-like finger uplifted, and eyes which already had
    looked closely on death fixed upon the bronzed face of his nephew. &ldquo;He
    poured out the full measure of his lavish heart at her feet, the full measure
    of his keen intellect. His dream&mdash;God forgive him for a blundering fool&mdash;his
    dream was to associate her in all the schemes which he had devised for the
    welfare of his dependents. She scorned his ideals, she ran counter to his
    aims. She was an aristocrat&mdash;in the worst acceptance of the word&mdash;to
    her finger-tips. She hated&mdash;yes, hated&mdash;everything that was poor
    and dependent and ignorant. She hated the people for whom your father schemed
    and toiled; she poured ridicule on all his efforts; with a flick of her be-ringed
    fingers she would have destroyed the whole edifice of his often misguided
    but always generous philanthropy. Whatever he did, she immediately opposed&mdash;on
    principle&mdash;her principle&mdash;the principle that humanity began with
    the chevaliers, with the privileged few who had a handle to their name. For
    her the proletariat, the bourgeoisie, the toilers and the workers were all
    so much scum, whose very touch would pollute the hem of her gown. The life
    and welfare of one of her husband&rsquo;s peasantry was of less account to
    her than the health of her pet dog. Oh, there were women like that in the
    old r&eacute;gime&mdash;and men, too, my boy! Else, think you that so bloody
    a revolution as the one which the people of France have made would ever have
    swept an entire caste off the face of the land? There were women and men
    in those days&mdash;before the Revolution&mdash;who would see, and did see,
    their fellow-creatures starving at their doors, who saw them half naked with
    hardly a roof above their heads, and would not raise a finger to help them.
    There were men and women like that&mdash;&rsquo;tis no use denying it. And
    they made the Revolution&mdash;not we. The death of their King upon the scaffold,
    the outrage to their Queen, was their making&mdash;not ours. The Bourbons
    stood for all that was callous and purse-proud and disdainful. They had to
    go, so had those on whom a people bubbling over with wrath and thirsting
    for revenge succeeded in laying a hand. Your mother was one of those who
    escaped. She has since married another aristocrat&mdash;de Mortain&mdash;a
    fool and a fop, and has brought up a son who no doubt would like to carry
    on her principles through another generation. But that woman broke your father&rsquo;s
    heart as surely as the guillotine ought to have broken her aristocratic neck.
    True, Bertrand was obstinate and self-willed and passionate. Would he have
    loved his wife as he did had he not been passionate? Would he have toiled
    for the welfare of his dependents through scorn, opposition and ridicule
    had he not been self-willed? True, that one day, exasperated beyond his powers
    of self-control, he struck that cruel, callous creature who deserved neither
    his consideration nor his chivalry. True, he did that, and earned for ever
    after the contumely of his aristocratic connections; but he also earned his
    freedom, for Denise left him after that, and thereby rendered him the one
    service she ever did in her life. Now that woman has returned to France&mdash;returned
    in order to work mischief in this peaceful corner of Normandy. On this I
    would stake my life. And she wants to get you into her toils&mdash;you and
    your influence and your wealth. She will smile on you, my boy, as she once
    smiled on your father; but in her heart she will hate you because you are
    his son; she will despise you for your rough ways and inelegant speech; she
    will laugh at you behind your back, she will vilify you and cover you with
    ridicule. And in the end, she will either break your heart if you remain
    strong, or tarnish your honour if you show the least sign of weakness. Avoid
    her, my lad, as you would the plague. There is no peace, no happiness where
    Denise de Courson holds sway....&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The invalid fell back against the pillows. The long, sustained effort had
    well-nigh snapped the last feeble thread of life on which he hung. Ronnay
    had not interrupted him. He knew that the old man was passing weak&mdash;that
    he was well-nigh spent, yet he let him talk on. Old Gaston had spoken in
    short, jerky sentences, interrupted by the indrawing of his breath or short
    attacks of coughing. He had never before this spoken to Ronnay about his
    mother&mdash;never before had he allowed himself to be carried away by the
    flood of his own rhetoric. But he looked upon the threatened reconciliation
    as a calamity for the nephew, whom in his own rough way he loved better than
    anything else on earth; and out of that love&mdash;which had always remained
    unspoken&mdash;he had drawn the strength which had enabled him to speak this
    last forceful and deliberate warning.</p>
  <p>But Ronnay had often been proclaimed before now the true son of his father,
    and old Gaston, in the course of his panegyric upon his dead brother, had
    owned that Bertrand de Maurel had been obstinate and self-willed. Perhaps
    the invalid had spoken so passionately and lengthily because he knew&mdash;with
    that keen knowledge which so often comes to the sick&mdash;that he was making
    no impression upon Ronnay&rsquo;s fixed determination, and while he spoke
    there had crept into his dim eyes a look that was almost one of appeal. Ronnay
    had listened in silence; it would have been cruel to have refused to listen
    to a sick man&rsquo;s impassioned entreaty. But the obstinacy which had helped
    to wreck his father&rsquo;s life had been transmitted in a full measure to
    himself; and Fouch&eacute;&mdash;clever, astute Fouch&eacute;&mdash;had used
    the one argument which was unanswerable, when he appealed to de Maurel&rsquo;s
    loyalty.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Go to Courson, my dear General,&rdquo; the Minister had writ with
    his own hand, &ldquo;go as soon as your mother bids you come. You would be
    rendering the State an inestimable service if you would keep an eye on the
    doings of all these repatriated  &eacute;migr&eacute;s in your department.
    That they are up to some mischief I need not perhaps impress upon you. They
    have been raising money in their own lawless fashion in that part of Normandy
    for some time now. Pillage, highway robbery, arson and intimidation are rife.
    I believe that the Royalists are trying to raise another army which might
    give us an infinity of trouble&mdash;and, in any case, will cause the shedding
    of a deal of innocent blood. The Ch&acirc;teau de Courson is so admirably
    situated and adapted for the headquarters of those sort of intrigues. I entreat
    you, therefore, during the absence of our Imperial Master in Prussia and
    at his own earnest desire, which I herewith transmit to you, to keep in touch
    with your relatives there, so that you may, by your influence and presence,
    avert the mischief which I feel to be brewing in those quarters. I know that
    by asking you to do this, I am imposing an uncongenial task upon so gallant
    a soldier as yourself, and demanding of you a heavy sacrifice; but I understand
    from His Majesty that you require some rest for another six months at least,
    after the serious wound which that Austrian bullet dealt you at Austerlitz;
    but that after those six months you will be able to resume your command and
    to join him in Poland in the winter. Until then, my dear General, may I claim
    your priceless services against a foe no less insidious and hardly less powerful
    than the one you so gallantly helped our Imperial Master to subjugate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the letter which had taken the Minister of Police over half an
    hour to prepare. Oh, clever and astute Fouch&eacute;! How thoroughly you
    understood the science of making men the engines of your will! Here was Ronnay
    de Maurel, who had earned for himself undying laurels on fields where every
    man was brave and worthy of distinction, ready&mdash;at your bidding&mdash;to
    throw himself into a maze of intrigue where his uncultured mind was bound
    to be at once at a hopeless disadvantage. But Fouch&eacute; had made appeal
    in the name of France, and the democrats of this age, who had emerged chastened
    and purified from out the withering fire of a sanguinary Revolution, had
    in their hearts a boundless store of love for their country who had suffered
    so much.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Maurel had spent much of his reserve of strength in trying to
    counteract the effect of Fouch&eacute;&rsquo;s letter in his nephew&rsquo;s
    mind. Long before he had said all that he meant, he knew that he had failed.
    When&mdash;some time after he had finished speaking&mdash;Ronnay still remained
    silent, the invalid, half prostrate after the exertion, threw back his head
    and broke into a strident laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might have saved my wind&mdash;eh, Ronnay?&rdquo; he asked, panting.</p>
  <p>Ronnay made no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go to-morrow?&rdquo; continued old Gaston.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied the younger man curtly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
    to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you are now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I am now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again the invalid laughed, but the laughter was choked in a spasm of coughing.
    Without another word Ronnay de Maurel rose and readjusted the pillows behind
    the sick man&rsquo;s head. Gaston was still chuckling inwardly to himself;
    his dim eyes, feebly glittering now with a glance of mockery, wandered restlessly
    over the massive and uncouth figure of this soldier of Napoleon. Ronnay de
    Maurel&mdash;General of Division in the most marvellous army the world has
    ever known&mdash;looked at this moment very like an overgrown, over-developed
    product of industrial Normandy. Ungainly in his movements, with that dragging
    gait which always appeared more accentuated whenever he laboured under fatigue
    or excitement, untutored of speech, unversed in every one of the gentle arts
    which mark the preux chevalier, or the squire of dames, Ronnay was not like
    to find favour in his mother&rsquo;s eyes. His linen blouse was stained with
    the grime and smoke of his foundries, his hair was wont to rebel against
    the conventional tie at the nape of the neck, his hands were rough, his nails
    unpolished. How the fine, if impecunious, entourage of Mme. la Marquise de
    Mortain would sneer at this handiwork of democratic France!</p>
  <p>Ronnay felt the invalid&rsquo;s mocking glance, but he was far too indifferent
    to all that it implied even to wince under it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I may put on a clean blouse,&rdquo; he said, with a smile which suddenly
    lit up his face like sunshine after a storm.</p>
  <p>Gaston de Maurel gave a curious little sigh, and&mdash;if the whole countryside
    had not known him for a hard, unemotional man&mdash;one might almost have
    said that a look of tenderness had suddenly crept into his sunken eyes as
    their glance embraced the ungainly figure of his nephew. Ronnay was so singularly
    unfitted to cope with the difficulties which were about to beset him. He
    was so little versed in the arts and graces wherewith his mother of a certainty
    had already set out to cajole him. His untrained mind was not up to the intrigues
    which were as the breath of life to these aristocratic ladies, who had thrown
    themselves into the whirlpool of their tottering cause. Ronnay was just a
    soldier&mdash;untaught, unenlightened. Since the age of fifteen he had known
    no life save that of camps, learned no lessons save those taught on battlefields
    and in the face of the enemy. He had learned neither self-control nor dissimulation.
    His untamed spirit would rebel against all the pin-pricks which his mother
    and her associates would know so well how to deal him.</p>
  <p>Poor Ronnay! The invalid sighed again, this time somewhat less bitterly.
    The smile which still lingered round his nephew&rsquo;s rugged face had told
    him much. It told him that out of the maelstrom of a checkered and turbulent
    life Ronnay had rescued one priceless gift which had remained his own&mdash;a
    subtle sense of humour, which mayhap would cause him to suffer many things
    less acutely than he otherwise would have done.</p>
  <p>There was silence after that between the two men. Each was busy with his
    own thoughts, and when anon they talked together again, the subject uppermost
    in both their minds was not broached by either of them again. Matters of
    business, of the factory, of the new dwellings on the estate, absorbed the
    conversation, and half an hour later the invalid was ready for bed. And,
    more tenderly than any mother could have gathered her baby to her breast,
    Ronnay de Maurel picked up the invalid out of his chair and carried him in
    his powerful arms gently into the next room, where he laid him on his bed,
    undressed him and washed him&mdash;an office of mercy which he had performed
    for the old man every evening since he came home from Austria and laid aside
    his fine uniform for the peasant&rsquo;s blouse.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter &nbsp;4<br>
    Kindred</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The very atmosphere of the old Ch&acirc;teau de Courson had become electrical&mdash;excitement
    was in the air. Even Mme. la Marquise, that perfect pattern of aristocratic
    sang-froid, had been unable to sit still all morning.</p>
  <p>She wandered restlessly from room to room; she held long conversations with
    her son, with her brother, with Fernande&mdash;even with old Matthieu Renard
    and with Annette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I expect my son, M. de Maurel,&rdquo; she said to the worthy couple,
    who, of a truth, could not understand why it was not the most natural thing
    in the world for a mother to receive her son. &ldquo;He may come over at
    about noon and may stay to have dinner with us. Watch over your cooking,
    my good Annette&mdash;see that everything is very plain but thoroughly good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Bien, bien</i>, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; nodded Annette, who,
    womanlike, was more ready to become impregnated with that fever of excitement
    which pervaded the ch&acirc;teau than was sober old Matthieu. &ldquo;You
    may be sure that I will do my best. I saw the General when first he came
    home from the war....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not General, my good woman,&rdquo; interposed Madame la Marquise
    haughtily; &ldquo;my son is no General in the army of a parvenu. He is Comte
    de Maurel, Duc de Montauban, and bears no other grade or title; and all the
    democratic governments in the world cannot strip him of his rank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now that Ronnay had so quickly&mdash;if somewhat coldly&mdash;acceded to
    her request for an interview, Mme. la Marquise&rsquo;s imagination went galloping
    on the wings of fancy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll convert him yet,&rdquo; she said to her brother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    see, my dear Baudouin! I&rsquo;ll make that unrelenting democrat dance to
    my piping before long. Once I have succeeded in drawing him away from that
    old fiend Gaston&rsquo;s influence, I&rsquo;ll twirl him round my little
    finger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. de Courson gave a slight shrug. He was doubtful as to that. Madame promptly
    turned to her son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent, you are prepared to make friends with your brother, are
    you not?&rdquo; she said, in a tone almost of entreaty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he will meet me half-way,&rdquo; retorted Laurent, not too genially.
    He had been taught from his babyhood to hate his elder brother, not only
    for the latter&rsquo;s political convictions, but because of the wealth which
    an indiscriminating Fate had chosen to pour down at his feet. It was difficult
    for a young and impetuous creature like Laurent de Mortain to adapt himself
    quite so readily to his mother&rsquo;s new mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate, promise me that you will not quarrel!&rdquo; added Mme.
    la Marquise with unwonted earnestness.</p>
  <p>At ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon Madame decided that she would receive
    her son in the noble&mdash;if somewhat dilapidated&mdash;reception-room where
    a few gilt-legged fauteuils and the satin-wood parquet floor bore mute testimony
    to past dignity and grandeur. Half an hour later she wandered out upon the
    terrace, from whence, she thought, the aspect of the neglected and overgrown
    garden would of a certainty touch the heart of the visitor and incline him
    to generosity.</p>
  <p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock she thought that the small boudoir&mdash;the only
    living room which she and her family had in use at the present moment&mdash;would
    shame the wealthy son by its air of poverty and of simplicity. At half-past,
    she was once more inclined to favour the reception-room, and at noon she
    was back in the boudoir, discussing the question with her brother and with
    her son, when a heavy and halting footstep was heard in the corridor outside,
    and the next moment the door was thrown open and Ronnay de Maurel appeared
    upon the threshold.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>He had certainly put on a clean linen blouse, but a blouse it was&mdash;just
    the same as those which his own employ&eacute;s wore at their work&mdash;of
    a faded shade of blue, with wide sleeves and low, turned-down collar, out
    of which rose his straight, firm neck, strong as a bull&rsquo;s, and crowned
    by the square, massive head, which he threw up as he entered, with a gesture
    that implied defiance. He certainly had discarded sabots; a pair of heavy
    jack-boots reached just below his knees, and dark cloth breeches encased
    his powerful thighs. His thick brown hair was held in at the nape of the
    neck with a black ribbon, hastily tied. And&mdash;pinned to his blouse&mdash;he
    wore the ribbon of Grand-Eagle of the Legion of Honour, the highest distinction
    the new Empire could confer.</p>
  <p>Madame&rsquo;s first sensation on seeing her son was one of horror. She
    had heard tales of Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s uncouthness, of his rough clothes
    and his bad manners, but in her mind she had&mdash;almost involuntarily&mdash;associated
    all these rumoured rude ways of his with a certain picturesqueness, a rough
    grandeur which she thought would appeal to her.</p>
  <p>But there was nothing either picturesque or grand about this ugly apparition
    which had so summarily thrust itself into her presence. With a genuine sinking
    of the heart Mme. la Marquise took in at a glance Ronnay&rsquo;s uncomely
    appearance, the well-nigh repellent scowl which disfigured his face, the
    heavy frown across his brow, his hands discoloured by toil and by inclement
    weather&mdash;in fact, the whole of the inelegant, not to say forbidding,
    aspect of this man whom a while ago she had hoped to win over to her side.</p>
  <p>And that this coarse, boorish creature was her son she could, alas! not
    doubt for a moment. He appeared before her as the living image of the man
    whom she had hated so bitterly throughout his life, and whom she had never
    wholly succeeded in eradicating from her memory. In Ronnay she saw the Bertrand
    of long ago, the heavy figure, the leonine head, the firm neck, and obstinate
    jaw; she saw the unruly hair which rebelled against comb or tie, she saw
    the eyes beneath the square, straight brow, which appeared of a violet-blue
    in repose and flashed dark, almost black, in anger. And in Ronnay de Maurel,
    too, she saw at this moment the man who in the past had tyrannized over her,
    had contradicted her at every turn, had struck her ... that once ... on that
    unforgettable day, when at last she was able to regain her freedom.</p>
  <p>And all the hatred which she had felt for Bertrand throughout all these
    years, and which for a few brief hours she had tried to forget, was suddenly
    reawakened at sight of the man whose whole demeanour as he faced her at this
    moment seemed to proclaim the triumph of the proletariat which she had never
    ceased to despise.</p>
  <p>She made no sign to welcome him. Her eyes scanned him from top to toe with
    what she intended to be a withering glance&mdash;a mute reproach at his total
    lack of respect towards her, which his rough clothes and neglected hands
    implied. But Ronnay de Maurel seemed quite unconscious both of his own appearance
    and of the effect it had upon his lady mother. He advanced further into the
    room and quite unceremoniously slammed the door to behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You sent for me, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; he said quietly and unconcernedly, &ldquo;and
    I have come at your bidding. Will you tell me as briefly as you can what
    it is you desire to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s indifference, his callous attitude, put the final touch
    to Madame&rsquo;s exasperation. The look in her eyes became more trenchant,
    more withering than before. She drew herself up to her full height, which
    was considerable, and folded her arms over her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When M. le Comte de Maurel, Duc de Montauban,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has
    learned how to present himself before his mother, I will speak to him and
    not before. Baudouin,&rdquo; she added loftily, turning to her brother, &ldquo;I
    think that I may rely on you to teach this ... to teach my son the first
    lesson of respect which he owes to me. Laurent, the door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent hastened to obey. He held open the door, through which Mme. la Marquise
    de Mortain now passed out, holding herself very erect&mdash;the personification
    of outraged dignity.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>De Maurel had taken refuge in a distant corner of the room. He was gazing
    in utter bewilderment at the retreating figure of his mother. Her tirade
    had evidently puzzled rather than angered him, for his deep-set eyes were
    full of vague questionings as they wandered from the face of his uncle to
    that of his young step-brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our lady-mother,&rdquo; he said at last, when Laurent had once more
    closed the door, and the frou-frou of Madame&rsquo;s skirts no longer could
    be heard swishing softly down the corridor, &ldquo;our lady-mother seems
    somewhat wayward in her moods. Yesterday she sent for me post-haste&mdash;to-day
    she turns her back on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you wonder?&rdquo; broke in Laurent hotly. &ldquo;Your conduct
    is outrageous....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My conduct?&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel. &ldquo;Why? What have I done?
    I scarce opened my mouth....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An exclamation of wrath and of contempt escaped Laurent&rsquo;s quivering
    lips ... a hot retort was obviously on the tip of his tongue. M. de Courson
    was only just in time to avert an avalanche of wrathful words which may have
    led to a sudden, irretrievable quarrel. He interposed between the two men
    with the perfect courtesy and tact of a high-born gentleman receiving an
    honoured guest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good de Maurel,&rdquo; he said, holding out his slender, aristocratic
    hand to his nephew, &ldquo;it is close on a quarter of a century since we
    have met, and it is a pleasure to me to welcome you at Courson. Do you know
    that I am your godfather, an honour which I share, if I remember rightly,
    with M. le Marquis de la Fayette? I hope that you will always think of me
    in that capacity and accept my help and counsel in all matters where the
    experience of a man of the world may be useful to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somewhat tentatively&mdash;more like a naughty child who is being coaxed
    into good humour&mdash;Ronnay de Maurel took that thin, white hand which
    was being held out to him. He could have crushed it in his own toil-worn
    one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;I am too old now for help
    or counsel, and my life has been spent in fighting for my country. I have
    no use for the experiences of a man of the world, by which, I suppose, you
    mean a dandy of drawing-rooms, a courtier or a sycophant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no, I did not mean that,&rdquo; rejoined M. de Courson conciliatingly. &ldquo;It
    is not necessary to be a dandy, nor yet a sycophant, in order to win the
    regard of one&rsquo;s own kindred&mdash;those of one&rsquo;s own caste. Unfortunately,
    it had not occurred to me to give you a word of warning ere you came to meet
    your mother ... in this guise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In this guise!&rdquo; echoed de Maurel roughly. &ldquo;What hath
    my guise to do with my coming here? My mother sent for me. Surely she did
    not do that in order to look at my clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God, man!&rdquo; here interposed Laurent sharply, &ldquo;is
    this bland simplicity of yours a pose or what? Do you really pretend not
    to know that a workman&rsquo;s attire is not a suitable one wherein to present
    yourself in the salons of the Marquise de Mortain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Marquise de Mortain was once Mme. de Maurel. I did not come here
    in order to present myself in her salon, but to speak with my mother and
    at her wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might have washed your hands and slipped on a decent coat in
    order to do that,&rdquo;  rejoined Laurent, who, forgetting his mother&rsquo;s
    entreaties of a while ago, was letting his ebullient temper gradually overmaster
    his prudence.</p>
  <p>But de Maurel, too, seemed to have come to the end of his small stock of
    patience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have done, boy, with that nonsense,&rdquo; he retorted roughly, &ldquo;I
    am not a man of patience. I owe nothing to the lady, remember, who has long
    since forfeited the name of &lsquo;mother&rsquo; as far as I am concerned.
    I came at her bidding, and against my better judgment&mdash;the son of my
    father can have nothing in common with the Marquise de Mortain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you turn to insult ...&rdquo; exclaimed Laurent hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no insult in an unvarnished fact. Mme. la Marquise de Mortain
    cares less about me than I do about an ill-conditioned cur. And if she desires
    to see my clothes, I can send her a suit fashioned by a tailor and stay at
    home myself the while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Pardieu</i>, de Maurel,&rdquo; quoth M. de Courson with a laugh, &ldquo;I
    had heard tales of your tenacity and of your self-will, but none of a certainty
    that do justice to the truth. Come, man! you surely will not allow petty
    obstinacy in so trifling a matter to interfere with the amity which should
    exist between your mother and yourself and towards which she hath, you must
    admit, met you already more than half way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, <i>nom de Dieu</i>!&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel gruffly, &ldquo;what
    do want me to do <i>enfin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me take a message to Mme. la Marquise from you,&rdquo; replied
    M. le Comte, &ldquo;craving her pardon for your want of respect to her this
    forenoon.... There is no shame in humbling one&rsquo;s pride before a woman
    and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then, as de Maurel, moody and wrathful, made no immediate rejoinder to the
    proposal, M. de Courson added more lightly: &ldquo;Well, what say you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;ve neither mind nor leisure to lend myself to Mme. la
    Marquise&rsquo;s whims and fancies,&rdquo; retorted de Maurel, whose obstinacy
    was growing in proportion with the impatience and arrogance of his kinsmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor decent clothes to wear, I warrant,&rdquo; broke in Laurent, as
    he felt his temper flaring up into fury against this ill-bred creature, who
    seemed wholly unconscious of his enormities. &ldquo;Uncle Baudouin,&rdquo; he
    added, with a sneer, &ldquo;do not, I pray you, waste your time in trying
    to instil some semblance of good manners into this oaf. One would think he
    had sprung out of the gutter....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, boy!&rdquo; interposed de Maurel, with a sudden hoarseness
    in his voice, and a clenching of his mighty fist till the knuckles shone
    like ivory through the flesh. &ldquo;Have I not said that I am not a man
    of patience...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I who am not a man of patience,&rdquo; retorted Laurent. &ldquo;Think
    you I can bear much longer the studied insult to us all which your attitude
    implies? Think you that because we are poor you can treat us as you would
    hesitate to treat the meanest peasant on your land? Is your apparel a pose
    or what? You cannot be as ignorant of the usages of good society as you pretend
    to be. After all, we have all been in exile&mdash;we have lived apart from
    those of our own breeding, of our own caste, but, in spite of our misfortunes
    we have kept up in our hearts the traditions of courtesy and gentle manners
    which were handed down to us all by our fathers&mdash;aye, to us all!&rdquo; he
    added vehemently, &ldquo;to you as well as to us. You bear one of the noblest
    names in France, and you pretend to have forgotten the most ordinary elements
    of respect due to the sex which hath every claim on our chivalry. Where,
    in Heaven&rsquo;s name have you been, man? Where have you spent your life
    that you could so far forget the traditions of your race?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Maurel had proclaimed himself to be a man devoid of patience. Yet he
    had listened attentively to every word that his young brother said. He had
    acquired throughout a hard, self-denying life the supreme virtue of silence;
    he knew&mdash;no one better&mdash;how to listen. Therefore he did not break
    in on Laurent&rsquo;s tirade. He listened to it to the end, and did not even
    wince at the sneers which his younger brother hurled very freely at him.
    But now that the latter had finished speaking, Ronnay came a step or two
    nearer to him, and drawing himself to his full height, he said, with perfect,
    outward calm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where I spent my life, brother mine? Will you let me tell you, since
    you do not know? My childhood I spent in the old Ch&acirc;teau of La Vieuville,
    where my uncle Gaston took care of me since my father died and my mother
    had abandoned me in order to pursue her own aims in life, which were not
    those of the man to whom she had sworn fealty at the altar....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, man!&rdquo; interposed Laurent excitedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    not have you vilify my mother, whom....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vilify no one,&rdquo; riposted de Maurel quietly. &ldquo;You have
    taunted me with the query as to how I have spent my life, and you <i>must</i> listen
    to my explanation. My uncle Gaston brought me up as best he could. His life
    was spent in the service of his country; he had but little time to devote
    to my education. Our country then, my good brother, required the services
    of all her children, since those of our kindred and of our caste were inciting
    half Europe to take up arms against her. My boyhood I spent helping with
    my feeble might in the work of defending France against the invasion of alien
    enemies who were bent on destroying her, because forsooth they disagreed
    with her political ideals, and had no sympathy with the aims of an entire
    people, goaded into rebellion by centuries of tyranny. I was twelve years
    old when my uncle Gaston de Maurel converted my father&rsquo;s iron foundries
    into huge factories for the manufacture of steel and of gunpowder, wherewith
    to fight the foreign foe abroad and the traitor at home ... aye! twelve years
    old, my dear brother, when my hands ceased to be white and slender and aristocratic
    in shape and colour, and became stained and rough ... unwashed you called
    them just now. At the age when boys of my caste learn how to dance and to
    strum on a spinet, to point their toes and kiss the ladies&rsquo; hands,
    I learned how to fashion saltpetre out of grit and how to transmute church
    bells into cannon balls. At fifteen I knew how to wield a sword and how to
    handle a gun. My manhood has been spent in camps, in the armies of the finest
    military leader that hath ever led men to glory and to victory. When France
    was attacked from the north and the south, from the east and from the west
    by Austria and Prussia, by Italy and England and Russia and Spain, a young
    general of artillery, not yet twenty-three years of age, led her triumphantly
    from victory to victory till the sacred soil of our beautiful country was
    swept clean of every foe. I followed that young leader wherever he went.
    I fought under him at Toulon, I followed him to Austria. I crossed the Alps
    in his train. I fought and bled under his eye for the honour of France and
    the glory of her flag. I starved with him in Egypt; I froze with him in Poland;
    I stood by his side at Austerlitz when the Austrian sued for peace. At first
    we marched and fought in wooden shoes, or with hay-ropes tied round our feet;
    at dead of winter we fought half naked with bast-mats slung round our shoulders.
    But we fought like men and kept whole Europe at bay. No, my good Laurent,
    I did not learn how to enter a salon, or how to turn a pretty compliment
    before ladies, but I know how to dispose an army corps when the enemy is
    in sight. I do not know how to wave a scented handkerchief in the air, but
    I do know how to meet a resolute foe in a hand-to-hand combat. My life has
    been spent in ridding France of foreigners, and of traitors, of idlers and
    slackers and useless good-for-nothing sybarites, and in the process my hands
    have remained rough and stained. I am a cripple now&mdash;not for always,
    I hope&mdash;and I wear a workman&rsquo;s blouse, because I have become a
    workman since I no longer can be a soldier. As soon as I can walk straight
    again I&rsquo;ll be back to fight under the Tricolour flag of France&mdash;to
    fight against the foreign enemy&mdash;to fight against treachery at home&mdash;to
    fight for the rights of manhood and citizenship, with unquenchable spirit
    and dogged determination, and continue to spend my life, as I have done up
    to now, until, please God, mine will be the glory to shed my last drop of
    blood for France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused&mdash;for want of breath mayhap&mdash;for, indeed, his rugged
    eloquence was carrying him away on the wings of his fervour and his burning
    patriotism. M. de Courson and Laurent de Mortain had listened to him in sullen
    silence. Once or twice Laurent had made an effort to interrupt, but de Maurel
    spoke very loudly and forcibly, and the other perforce had to remain silent.
    Once or twice he affected to smother a yawn, and he would have given much
    to be able to turn his back on this ranting demagogue&mdash;as he inwardly
    termed him&mdash;and to leave him to continue his ravings in solitude. But,
    in spite of himself, something held him back. There was a certain forcefulness,
    a certain directness as well as pride in Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s impassioned
    harangue which compelled attention, even if it did not call for respect.
    Laurent de Mortain&mdash;and M. le Comte de Courson also, for that matter&mdash;were
    soldiers and patriots, too. There was much in them which was every whit as
    fine and brave as the soul of de Maurel which was finding expression in his
    eloquent words. It was only the divergence of ideals which stood between
    these Royalists and the man who they considered had been a traitor to his
    caste.</p>
  <p>There was the pity of it! The miserable, irretrievable pity! The children
    of France were at deadly enmity with one another; their different political
    aims had caused an abyss to form between them, which nothing now could bridge
    over. There was a total lack of understanding, and, alas! the many outrages
    perpetrated on both sides had rendered the breach for ever impassable. M.
    de Courson and Laurent de Mortain saw in de Maurel the product of the spirit
    of regicide, of the sanguinary revolution which had committed the most brutal
    excesses the civilized world had ever seen; and Ronnay de Maurel saw in his
    kinsmen only the incarnation of that spirit which had not been content to
    fight for the cause of its traditions, but had treacherously sold the country
    to the foreign foe, had brought foreign armies within the sacred boundaries
    of France, had sought the aid of foreigners to gain victory for its arms.</p>
  <p>And these three men, in whom flowed the same blood of kinship, stood now
    confronting one another with something like deadly hatred flashing in their
    eyes. The two brothers, indeed, presented a strange contrast: Laurent, slender
    and graceful, with smoothly-dressed dark hair crowning a face full of charm
    and delicacy, with hands white and soft, with clothes that fitted his elegant
    young figure to perfection; and Ronnay de Maurel, tall and ungainly, in rough
    blouse and heavy boots, with rugged face bronzed by campaigning in all weathers
    and furrowed long before its time, with eyes of a deep blue, that appeared
    almost black beneath the straight, square brow and firm mouth set in hard,
    obstinate lines. Indeed, it was not six years that lay between them in age,
    but a whole century&mdash;a century of thoughtlessness, of easy-going tyranny,
    of selfishness on the one hand, and one of rebellion and self-will on the
    other, and there was a century of suffering and of wrongs to be avenged on
    either side.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>It seemed, indeed, as if nothing now could avert an immediate quarrel between
    the two brothers. The breach between them had been widened by bitter words
    on both sides, and if at this juncture it came to open enmity between them,
    that breach mayhap would never be patched up again. M. de Courson, as usual,
    tried to play his part of peace-maker. In his heart of hearts he could not
    help but give a certain measure of admiration to de Maurel&rsquo;s fearless
    expos&eacute; of the situation. He himself being innately loyal, recognized
    and appreciated loyalty in others. He did not want to see a quarrel between
    the brothers now. His sober judgment still clung to the desire for conciliation,
    and he still clung to the hope that this semi-educated boor could be tamed
    into something that was not only presentable, but also useful to the cause
    which he and his kindred had so much at heart.</p>
  <p>Therefore he made one more effort to interpose in a conciliatory spirit
    between these two smouldering tempers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not your brother&rsquo;s intention, my good de Maurel,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;nor, I vow, was it mine to cast aspersions upon your manhood
    or your valour. Your tirade&mdash;an you will permit me to say so without
    offence&mdash;was, therefore, quite superfluous, since it had no bearing
    upon the subject which we were discussing....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Namely, your want of respect to our mother,&rdquo; concluded Laurent
    wrathfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo;  retorted de Maurel curtly. &ldquo;Methought that we
    were chiefly engaged in discussing my clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until you chose to cast aspersions on Mme. la Marquise de Mortain,
    which I for one will not tolerate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I have said aught to offend Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; said Ronnay
    curtly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll crave her pardon.... I had no intention to offend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet you do, man, you do,&rdquo; riposted Laurent hotly; &ldquo;not
    only with your words, not only with your clothes, but by flaunting before
    her eyes that badge of infamy which you wear upon your breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent!&rdquo;  interposed M. de Courson quickly, for unobservant
    and obtuse though he was, he had not failed to note that de Maurel&rsquo;s
    face had suddenly become extraordinarily livid in hue, and that the breath
    came and went through his tightly clenched teeth with a curious, hissing
    sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he broke in slowly after a while, &ldquo;I
    pray you do not try and stem the flow of my brother&rsquo;s eloquence. Meseems
    that the next few moments will clear the somewhat close atmosphere of Courson
    from a veritable fog of misunderstandings. I was under the impression that
    my linen blouse and muddy boots had alone offended Mme. la Marquise&rsquo;s
    aristocratic glance; it seems that there&rsquo;s something more about my
    person which hath not found favour in her sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent, at these words, uttered in a husky voice as if the man were choking,
    broke into a strident laugh, and with uplifted hand he pointed to the crimson
    ribbon on Ronnay&rsquo;s blouse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eminently suitable in colour,&rdquo; he said with a sneer, which
    suddenly sent the hot blood rushing back to the other&rsquo;s pale cheeks, &ldquo;and
    well chosen by a baseborn adventurer to commemorate all the innocent blood
    which his treachery and vanity have helped to shed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There came a quick flash in de Maurel&rsquo;s eyes, which the younger man
    would have been wise to heed. &ldquo;Hold on, man! hold on!&rdquo; he said,
    still speaking slowly and with seeming calm, &ldquo;ere your profane mouth
    utter a sacrilege! This ribbon was pinned upon my breast on the glorious
    field of Austerlitz by the man whose valour and glory have won undying laurels
    for France&mdash;by the patriot who swept the soil of our beautiful country
    clean from foreign foes ... and whom an adoring nation hath proclaimed its
    Lord and Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent threw back his head, whilst a glance of withering scorn shot from
    his fine eyes and swept the uncouth figure of his soldier brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord and Emperor!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Hark at the miserable
    besotted fool! at the traitor! the regicide! Lord and Emperor forsooth! the
    base-born son of a vulgar father&mdash;a Corsican adventurer and knight of
    industry, who is clever enough to gull a wretched nation into kissing the
    rod which God hath devised for its punishment....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  thundered de Maurel, and with a quick movement forward
    he gripped Laurent by the wrist. &ldquo;Silence, you dolt! you fool! Another
    word and I force you down on your knees to crave pardon in your stupid heart
    for the impious nonsense which your insentient tongue hath uttered. Silence,
    I say!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  retorted Laurent, who by now had lost complete control
    over his nerves and whose voice sounded shrill and cracked. &ldquo;Nay! why
    should I be silent, when the whole of Europe cries anathema against the usurper?
    Shame on you, my brother, shame! for parading your own dishonour upon your
    breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dishonour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, dishonour! What else is it, I pray, but the livery of traitors,
    of regicides and of murderers? Legion of Honour the Corsican has dared to
    call it&mdash;and you, it seems, are one of his Grand-Eagles ... but we who
    are loyal to France and to our King, we proclaim it the Legion of Dishonour,
    and you and such as you a herd of devouring vultures. Shed your livery of
    shame, my brother, ere I smite you with it in the face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Maurel up to now had been perhaps more bewildered than infuriated by
    the ravings of this young madman; but now, ere he had time to realize what
    Laurent was doing, and before M. de Courson could interfere, the young Marquis
    had, with a quick and almost savage gesture, gripped the crimson ribbon on
    his brother&rsquo;s breast and torn it violently from the blouse. The next
    moment he threw it with an exclamation of loathing upon the floor. A cry
    as of an enraged bull came from de Maurel&rsquo;s throat, and his two hands&mdash;the
    hard, strong hands of the toiler&mdash;fastened themselves like clamps of
    steel upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On your knees, on your knees, you blasphemous malapert,&rdquo; he
    said, as with well-nigh brutal strength he gradually forced Laurent down. &ldquo;On
    your knees! You shall lick the dust for this monstrous sacrilege.... Your
    unhallowed hands shall not touch that sacred badge ... with your lips you
    shall pick it out of the dust ... you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; cried Laurent hoarsely. &ldquo;Uncle Baudouin, <i>&agrave; moi</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On your knees!&rdquo; reiterated de Maurel fiercely.</p>
  <p>He was possessed of immense strength. Laurent, despite his every effort
    to free himself and to remain defiant, felt his knees giving way under him.
    The pain in his shoulders and his back, caused by that iron grip, turned
    him sick and faint, whilst M. le Comte&rsquo;s attempts at interference were
    obviously of no avail. Insults and protests died upon his lips; he saw the
    stern, dark face which was bending over him as through a veil of mist ...
    that mist soon became of a crimson hue ... like blood. Laurent felt all the
    tumultuous blood of his race rushing through his veins; his head was swimming,
    his ears buzzing, and he saw red ... a sea of red in front of his eyes. His
    hand with a last convulsive gesture wandered to his hip, and was buried for
    a moment under his coat. The next moment it reappeared with a hunting-knife
    in its grasp.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent, in the name of Heaven, think of what you are doing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The call, soft as that of a frightened bird, came from the door immediately
    behind Laurent. He was down on one knee at that moment, with one hand he
    was steadying himself against the floor, the other, holding the large hunting-knife,
    was raised ready to strike. For one second only; the next the grip on his
    shoulders was relaxed, the dark face, distorted with wrath and contempt,
    seemed to fade away into the dim distance, and he fell back half swooning
    against a heavy chair close by.</p>
  <p>At the sound of that agonized woman&rsquo;s cry de Maurel&rsquo;s grip on
    his brother&rsquo;s shoulders had suddenly relaxed. He looked up, and for
    a moment it seemed to him as if he were gazing on something unreal; there
    was a veil in front of his eyes, and he could see nothing clearly, not even
    the apparition in the doorway ... a slender apparition clad all in white
    ... the exquisite form of a woman&mdash;a mere child&mdash;dressed in a white
    gown cut low round the shoulders, in accordance with the prevailing mode;
    her neck, shoulders and arms were bare; her tiny head was crowned with a
    wealth of fair hair, which clustered in unruly curls round the perfect oval
    of her face; her eyes, with large pupils dilated now with fear and horror,
    were of an unfathomable blue. She had been carrying a sheaf of bluebells
    in her arm, the spoils of the woodland round Courson; but at the awful sight
    which greeted her as she pushed open the door of the boudoir, the flowers
    fell from her hands and now lay scattered in a delicious tangled mass of
    blue&mdash;like the colour of her eyes&mdash;at her feet.</p>
  <p>As Ronnay de Maurel slowly straightened out his herculean figure, the details
    of the exquisite picture before him reached his perceptions one by one. He
    saw the delicate hands stretched out toward him with a feminine gesture of
    protection; he saw the dainty feet encased in sandals, which looked as if
    they scarce would touch the ground; he saw the full, red lips still parted
    with that cry of horror which she had uttered, and the eyes of that unfathomable
    blue like the sea in the Bay of Genoa, fixed upon him with puzzlement not
    unmixed with awe.</p>
  <p>The vision cleared and he became conscious that it was reality. He heard
    M. de Courson saying with a sigh of relief: &ldquo;Fernande, thank God! you
    came just in time.&rdquo; He saw the exquisite apparition hurrying to Laurent
    and helping him to rise. Never in all his life had he seen anything so ethereal
    and so pure&mdash;and suddenly he became conscious of himself&mdash;of his
    rough clothes and his stained hands; he could have called to the inanimate
    objects in the room to close in upon him and to bury him out of sight. Like
    a wild animal at bay, he gave a rapid furtive glance around; his eye alighted
    on the bit of red ribbon which a boy&rsquo;s impious hand had torn from his
    breast. This he picked up, swiftly, stealthily; then holding it tightly in
    his clenched hand, he turned without another word, without another look,
    and fled precipitately from the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter &nbsp;5<br>
    The Springtime Of The Year</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>An hour later Mme. la Marquise de Mortain had been put in possession of
    all the facts which related to Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s quarrel with his
    brother and of his hasty exit from the ch&acirc;teau. Laurent had recovered
    from his sudden access of madness, and was not a little ashamed that Fernande
    had seen him at the very height of his outburst of fury against his brother,
    when fratricide was in his eye and in his uplifted hand. M. de Courson preserved
    a non-committal attitude. He was bound to maintain that de Maurel had been
    unduly provoked, yet owned that he was guilty of a grave social solecism
    in wearing the badge of the usurper in the house of his kinsfolk who were
    loyal adherents of the King. He thought the whole episode a grave pity, since
    it had undoubtedly jeopardized, if not entirely upset, every plan for ultimate
    conciliation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You promised me, Laurent,&rdquo; said Madame, with a frown of impatience, &ldquo;that
    you would not quarrel with your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He exasperated me beyond endurance,&rdquo; retorted Laurent moodily, &ldquo;and
    I consider that the manner in which he appeared here in Courson was an insult
    to us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It became very noticeable after a while that Fernande offered no opinion
    upon the brooding catastrophe which her timely interference alone had averted.
    At the midday meal, whilst every phase of the momentous interview with de
    Maurel was being discussed by the others, she remained strangely self-absorbed
    and silent. She was eating her dinner with a childish and hearty appetite,
    but whenever she sipped her wine, she looked over her glass and through the
    window opposite with eyes that seemed to dance with inward merriment and
    with elfish mischief, and whilst her father and her aunt talked and argued
    and conjectured, a whimsical smile played round the corners of her full,
    red lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something seems to have tickled your fancy, Fernande,&rdquo; said
    Laurent at last with some irritation, when on two separate occasions the
    young girl failed to reply to a direct question addressed to her by him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something has,&rdquo; Fernande replied demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May we know what it is?&rdquo; queried Mme. la Marquise. &ldquo;The
    situation,&rdquo; she added tartly, &ldquo;has become so grave for us all
    that, personally, I fail to detect any humour in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande gaily. &ldquo;You
    fail to detect any humour in to-day&rsquo;s occurrence, so does father&mdash;so
    does Laurent. That is just what seems to me so ludicrous. The situation may
    be grave, but it is also very funny, and whilst you were all lamenting over
    it I was turning it over in my mind how best we can utilize it to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are far too young, Fernande,&rdquo; interposed M. le Comte dryly, &ldquo;to
    turn over any grave situation in your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us allow, then, that I have said nothing,&rdquo; retorted Fernande,
    with the same demure casting down of her eyes, which implied that a fund
    of worldly knowledge was concealed behind her smooth, white brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear Baudouin,&rdquo; rejoined Mme. la Marquise sharply, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    like a father to belittle his own child&rsquo;s wisdom. I for one am over-ready
    to listen to advice wherever it may come from. I feel so guilty about the
    whole affair, for I fear me that we have gravely compromised the interests
    of His Majesty by quarrelling hopelessly with my son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had made such firm resolutions,&rdquo; she added with a sigh, &ldquo;to
    conciliate him, to make friends with him if possible. His help&mdash;or,
    failing that, his neutrality&mdash;would have been of such immense value
    to our cause. I had dreams of establishing myself at La Frontenay, of using
    the place as an arsenal&mdash;as headquarters for our leaders ... of suborning
    or winning over the workmen at the factory.... I am heart-broken at the thought
    that my own foolishness hath all in a moment destroyed my best laid schemes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; here broke in the young girl, with an
    elfish toss of her dainty head, &ldquo;your schemes have not yet gone agley,
    that I can see. My cousin Ronnay&mdash;he is my cousin, is he not?&mdash;has
    of a truth departed hence in high dudgeon&mdash;but surely he can be brought
    back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  asserted M. de Courson emphatically.</p>
  <p>And Mme. la Marquise shook her head. &ldquo;No one can gauge the obstinate
    temper of a de Maurel&mdash;and Ronnay is the living image of his father.
    It was a delicate business to get him to come here at all. I declare that
    I am at my wits&rsquo; ends how to bring him back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two Fernande de Courson was silent; a gentle glow suffused
    her cheeks, her eyes danced with mischief, her whole face was lit up with
    inward merriment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me try?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, Fernande?&rdquo; exclaimed Mme. la Marquise. &ldquo;What in
    the world can you do in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite a great deal, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; replied Fernande with
    that demure little air, which sat so quaintly upon her laughter-loving face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ronnay de Maurel,&rdquo; here interposed M. de Courson, &ldquo;is
    not bait for a feminine fisher. If you have thoughts of casting your nets
    in that direction, my child....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I for one would protest,&rdquo; broke in Laurent hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Protest against what?&rdquo; queried the girl, and she turned wide,
    inquiring eyes on the young man, eyes in which injured innocence, unfettered
    mischief and provoking coquetry were alike expressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against your sowing seeds of hope of ... of ...&rdquo; stammered
    Laurent with a scowl; &ldquo;against your exercising your arts on that lout,
    who no doubt is filled with self-conceit, and might imagine things which....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande leaned back in her chair, and her rippling childlike laugh roused
    the echoes of the ancient walls around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you funny, jealous old Laurent!&rdquo; she said breathlessly.
    Then seeing that the young man still looked morose and wrathful, she went
    on, with a quick turn to seriousness: &ldquo;You are childish, my dear cousin.
    Let me begin by reminding you that your jealousy is not only unjustifiable
    but singularly out of place. The interests of His Majesty being at stake,
    it behoves us all to sharpen our wits by mature reflection, rather than to
    dull them by senseless outbursts of temper. <i>Ma tante</i> declared just
    now that M. de Maurel&rsquo;s wealth and influence would be of inestimable
    value to His Majesty, and yet owned that she was at her wits&rsquo; ends
    how to bring him back repentant or reconciled to Courson. Well, where <i>ma
    tante</i> owns to having failed, I still believe in success; and though father
    says that I am too young to turn a grave situation over in my mind, I am
    convinced that I can turn the present one to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how, my dear child?&rdquo; sighed Madame dejectedly, &ldquo;how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande, &ldquo;but I would
    dearly love to try.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To try and do what?&rdquo; queried Laurent, who was by no means mollified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make the bear dance to my piping,&rdquo; replied Fernande archly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is what I could never allow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If <i>ma tante</i> grant me leave,&rdquo; quoth Fernande dryly, &ldquo;you,
    my dear cousin, will not be asked to give your consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;  exclaimed the young man, in a tone of passionate
    reproach.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;do not look so glum.
    It was you, remember, who talked of sowing seeds of hope in the impressionable
    field of M. de Maurel&rsquo;s fancy.... Father and <i>tante</i> Denise spoke
    of the necessity of making friends with that untamed bear, and I....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes? You, Fernande?&rdquo; queried Laurent, his glowering eyes fixed
    moodily upon the exquisite face that smiled so tantalizingly upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo;  she said lightly, &ldquo;have no other wish save to bring
    back that same untamed bear to heel, and to make him pay his respects to <i>ma
    tante</i>; to bring him back to Courson, not once but often and willingly,
    until we are all the best of friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as her sally was greeted by a shrug of the shoulders from her father,
    a sigh of despondency from her aunt and a further scowl from Laurent, she
    continued more earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, if M. de Maurel&rsquo;s friendship is so important to the
    interests of His Majesty as <i>ma tante</i> and father think, it is worth
    while making an effort to gain it. No harm can come in trying. If I fail
    we shall be no worse off than we are now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will fail, my dear,&rdquo; concluded Mme. la Marquise, with her
    usual authoritative decision. &ldquo;You will fail. No de Maurel has yet
    succumbed to a woman&rsquo;s charm unless interest or obstinacy prepared
    him for the fall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, in this case obstinacy mayhap will prepare M. de Maurel for
    the fall. Laurent,&rdquo;  added the young girl, turning once more to her
    cousin with merry, glowing blue eyes, &ldquo;will you take me in a level
    bet that this day month Ronnay de Maurel will dance to my piping like a tamed
    bear? He will at my suggestion ask you and <i>ma tante</i> to take up your
    quarters at La Frontenay, he will close his eyes to everything that we don&rsquo;t
    wish him to see. His money and his influence will be at our disposal. With
    his help we&rsquo;ll dethrone that impudent Bonaparte whom at present he
    worships and who has dared to seat himself upon the throne of France, and
    we&rsquo;ll bring His Majesty King Louis XVIII. back to his own heritage
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose to her feet, and with mock solemnity she held up her glass. &ldquo;Long
    live Ronnay de Maurel!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;by the grace of God and the
    machinations of Fernande de Courson the most loyal adherent His Majesty has
    ever had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she placed her small white hand on Laurent&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I entreat you not to look so glum, dear cousin,&rdquo; she said,
    with that tender earnestness which at times lent to her dainty face an additional
    and contrasting charm. &ldquo;Your own courage and loyalty will have their
    due; the courage and loyalty of all those who have sacrificed everything
    for King and country will have their just reward. But, remember, that the
    prospects of the cause which we all have so much at heart are none too rosy
    just now. We may despise Bonaparte for an usurper and impudent knight of
    industry, but we must grant that he is passing clever, and that he holds
    the allegiance of the nation at this moment in the hollow of his hand. We
    cannot go with flying banners through the villages and towns of Normandy
    and rally enthusiastic recruits to our armies; we shall have to go very warily
    to work and meet cunning with cunning ere we succeed. We want M. de Maurel&rsquo;s
    wealth, we want his influence. You knew that this morning, dear Laurent; <i>ma
    tante</i> knew it and desired it passionately. Yet you both quarrelled with
    him within half an hour of his arrival here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He insulted my mother,&rdquo; broke in Laurent hotly. &ldquo;He....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know he did,&rdquo; she rejoined quietly. &ldquo;He is a bear&mdash;one
    with a sore head and an ill temper. But even flies must needs be caught with
    honey. You all think me very babyish and stupid, I know! Father says that
    I am too young even to weigh a serious situation in my mind. Well, that may
    be so, I don&rsquo;t know. But childish instinct hath oft been a guiding
    star, where hoary-headed wisdom has groped in the dark, and in any case,
    there is no one in the whole of France who has the cause of our King more
    at heart than I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all know that, my child,&rdquo; said the Comte gravely; &ldquo;it
    was far from me to impugn your loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only my wisdom&mdash;eh, father mine? But &rsquo;tis not wisdom that
    is required now. Wisdom has quarrelled with Ronnay de Maurel&mdash;guilelessness
    shall bring about the reconciliation. M. de Maurel&rsquo;s wealth shall be
    placed at the service of the King on the faith of Fernande de Courson!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God hear you, my child!&rdquo; concluded Mme. la Marquise fervently.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>After that the conversation drifted to other subjects. Laurent remained
    morose until the end of dinner and Fernande made no effort to cheer him up.
    In the late afternoon she wandered out into the open. The garden was a mere
    tangle of weeds and overgrown shrubs; there were neither lawns nor parterres,
    but it smelled good of fresh earth and spring rains, of wet young leaves
    and opening blossom.</p>
  <p>Fernande had slipped a coarse gardening apron over her white gown and, gardening
    tools in hand, she set to work to disentangle a fragrant hedge of hawthorn
    and lilac from a mass of encroaching weeds. Despite the sorrowful outlook
    in her young life, despite the cares and heavy thoughts which weighed upon
    her father and her friends and kindred&mdash;almost despite herself&mdash;she
    felt singularly gay and elated. It was not the fashion to be merry in the
    circles of these &eacute;migr&eacute;s who had just returned to their devastated
    homes, through the clemency of the Corsican usurper; tempers had to be sober
    and looks demure. The cause of the King had to be fought again; thoughts
    of danger, of conspiracy and self-sacrifice&mdash;aye! even of crime&mdash;all
    in a just cause&mdash;were in the air. Women, men, young girls and boys were
    prepared to shed the last drop of their blood in order to restore the Bourbons
    to their heritage, even though the nation had ceased to want them, and to
    oust from his self-constituted throne the soldier of fortune&mdash;the Emperor,
    who to many was still the little corporal, and who was the idol of France.</p>
  <p>These aims were so high and so serious, that levity appeared out of place.
    Mme. la Marquise never smiled, M. de Courson was a pattern of seriousness,
    Laurent was ofttimes self-absorbed and always thoughtful, and Fernande&mdash;when
    her natural gaiety, her youth and healthful spirits caused inward laughter
    to bubble up and a song to rise to her throat&mdash;would take refuge in
    the tangled garden and share her joy in life with the birds.</p>
  <p>She was fond of the solitude, the quietude of those avenues of limes, wherein
    the call of mating birds alone disturbed the silence that reigned around.
    Fernande was very young still&mdash;little more than a child, scarce out
    of the school-room, wherein the only lesson of life which she had learned
    was that of loyalty to a degenerate cause, of sacrifice to ideals and political
    aims which she really was far too inexperienced thoroughly to understand.
    Her heart was full of the aspirations of a healthy young being who sees life
    lying a rose-coloured dream stretched out before her, of a desire for a happiness
    at which she could only vaguely guess, for joy and gaiety, for poetry and
    for beauty. And it was full, too, of that vague longing for love which stirs
    the sensibilities of every woman the moment she steps across the threshold
    of childhood. But of this Fernande de Courson was no more conscious than
    is the rose-bud when it opens its sweet-scented corolla to the kiss of the
    sun. Ever since her fair curls had been dressed to the top of her head she
    had looked on Laurent de Mortain as her future husband. Never in so many
    words had she plighted her troth to him, but she knew that she loved him
    with a tenderness that no other emotion in her could surpass. He was so handsome,
    and his voice had a delicious tremor in it when he spoke her name. No other
    man had touched her heart as he did, no words of love spoken by other lips&mdash;and
    she had heard many&mdash;had caused the same delicious blush to rise to her
    cheeks. She was never so gay as when, hand in hand, with Laurent, she could
    wander through the peaceful lanes of Devonshire in far-off England, even
    though the shadow of poverty and of exile had already darkened her young
    life. She was never so happy as when Laurent sat or knelt beside her, and
    in impassioned tones spoke to her of the future, when the sombre cloud of
    anarchy and rebellion would be lifted from fair France, and he and she together
    would enjoy the delights of repatriation, of home and comfort and peace.</p>
  <p>Yet in spite of all this, in spite of her deep love for Laurent and her
    delight in his company, Fernande on this late afternoon of early May was
    conscious of a slight feeling of impatience when she suddenly spied him coming
    towards her from the terrace. Her head was so full of exciting and riotous
    thoughts that she longed for solitude so that she might co-ordinate them.
    The project which she had so boldly formulated a while ago of bringing Ronnay
    de Maurel back to heel like a repentant cur, had of a certainty been the
    result of impulse, but not of a thoughtless one. It had its origin in the
    flash from his dark eyes as they met hers for one second across the uplifted
    arm of a would-be fratricide. During that one second Fernande, with that
    swift intuition which some women possess, had read each varying emotion as
    it became reflected in their depths: wrath, puzzlement, bewilderment&mdash;then
    that gradual softening of the sinister scowl, the changing hue of the orb
    from black to a deep violet, the look of self-consciousness and of shame.
    Fernande had seen the pathetic and furtive glance cast on the stained blouse
    and the toil-worn hands; she had seen the stealthy grasp of that bit of crimson
    ribbon, the one brief flash of pride wherewith the outraged soldier clasped
    the insignia of glory to his breast.</p>
  <p>And from out that one peep into a man&rsquo;s troubled soul Fernande had
    woven her project of winning him to the cause which was so dear to her heart.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The project being still immature, Fernande had wandered out into the garden
    with the intention of thinking out its preliminary details; she was not attuned
    to Laurent&rsquo;s society just then. In her heart she knew that he disapproved
    of her plan; that his jealousy&mdash;which at all times was on the qui-vive&mdash;would
    flare up at the first bond of harmony which she would succeed in effecting
    with Ronnay de Maurel. Indeed, she would have need of all her sharp wits
    and her feminine wiles to bring the two brothers together again and yet to
    avert a quarrel more deadly than the first.</p>
  <p>For the moment she was intent on her work, and not prepared to listen to
    Laurent&rsquo;s tender reproaches. The weeds were many, and despite the earliness
    of the year had already become rank. She had been humming a little ditty
    quietly to herself: &ldquo;Et ron et ron! petit Pataplon! Il &eacute;tait
    une berg&egrave;re!&rdquo; But now, when she heard Laurent&rsquo;s footsteps
    on the path behind her, the song died upon her lips. She made pretence not
    to hear his coming, nor did she turn her head in his direction until he called
    her name:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Even then she appeared too busy to do more than respond quite calmly: &ldquo;Yes,
    Laurent. Is that you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as he remained silent, and seemed to have come to a halt immediately
    beside her, she continued serenely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry if you want me to come for a walk just now. I must finish
    clearing this piece of hedge. Will you go and get a hoe and lend me a helping
    hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will in a moment,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but not just yet. I
    must speak to you, Fernande&mdash;just for a few minutes.... Will you turn
    to me and put down those tools a while? Upon my soul, it is passing serious
    ... Fernande!&rdquo; he reiterated more earnestly, seeing that with strange
    obstinacy the young girl still kept her head resolutely bent to her work.</p>
  <p>But at his insistence she threw down her tools and straightened her young
    figure. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she queried as she faced him, with a mocking
    glance in her blue eyes.</p>
  <p>He took her hand, which for just the space of a second she tried to free
    from his grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  he said in a tender tone of appeal, &ldquo;you
    are not angry with me, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angry? You foolish Laurent!&rdquo; she retorted gently. &ldquo;Why
    should I be angry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not mean all that you said at table?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You implied by your words that ... that it was not within my rights
    to control your actions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she asked, holding her tiny head a little to one side,
    and giving him an arch look of coquetry from beneath her long lashes, &ldquo;is
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  he entreated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how you hurt me, when you speak so flippantly.
    If you only knew how every word from your dear lips sinks into my heart!
    The cruel words make it ache so that I could cry out with the pain ... and
    one sweet word from you makes me so happy that I would not exchange this
    earth for the most glorious corner of paradise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear, foolish Laurent!&rdquo; she sighed. Indeed, her heart was,
    as usual, inexpressibly touched by his ardour. She could see that his eyes
    were moist with unshed tears. She allowed him to take both her hands and
    to draw her nearer to him; she did not protest when anon his arm stole round
    her waist, and he buried his face against her shoulder. Indeed, she felt
    a wonderful fondness at this moment for the companion of her youth, the playmate
    of her childhood in the far-off days in England, when they were all poor
    and wretched together and had only each other to cling to, to trust, to look
    to for solace and for sympathy. She felt his burning kiss upon her neck,
    and with her small hand she stroked his hair and patted his cheek with a
    tender, almost maternal gesture.</p>
  <p>The day was fast drawing in. The softness of the night&mdash;of a spring
    night laden with the fragrance of opening buds and ripening blossom&mdash;wrapped
    the sweet tangle of young growth in its embrace. The lilac and the hawthorn
    were weighted with April rain, overhead the branches of a young lime quivered
    in the evening breeze ere it sent down a shower of scented drops upon the
    two young people who were clinging to one another in the pure embrace of
    budding love. The mating birds in the branches of the old elms had already
    gone to rest; from far away came the monotonous croaking of frogs and the
    soft call of the wood-pigeons from the tangled woodland close by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  reiterated Laurent with growing intensity, &ldquo;you
    do love me, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And nothing could have been more tender, nothing more serene than her reply,
    and the kiss wherewith she just touched his hair:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I love you, dear Laurent. You have so often asked me that.
    Why do you ask again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I want to make sure of you, Fernande,&rdquo; he retorted
    vehemently, as both his arms closed round her now. &ldquo;I want to make
    sure,&rdquo; he reiterated passionately. &ldquo;I would give my soul to know
    what goes on behind that exquisite, white forehead of yours. Oh, of course
    you are a child: you don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you cannot&mdash;the torture
    which the serenity of your blue eyes inflicts on me at moments like this,
    when I long to kiss you and yet feel that your sweet lips will not answer
    to mine with the same thrill of passion which has gone nigh to searing my
    soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Laurent,&rdquo; murmured Fernande with tender indulgence. She
    disengaged herself quite gently from his arms, and then coolly divested herself
    of her gardening apron.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  she said gaily, &ldquo;it is too dark to go on weeding.
    We&rsquo;ll go for a walk, dear cousin, an you have a mind. Dear, foolish
    Laurent! I believe you are ready to cry! Why, on such a lovely spring evening
    as this I feel as if I could run singing and shouting through the woods!
    Come with me to the lake. I feel sure the fairy pigeons will be cooing to-night,
    and the white dove rise from its watery prison, never to be captured again.
    You know the legend, dear cousin, do you not? Old Matthieu told it me in
    his quaint, halting way. Come to the lake and I&rsquo;ll tell it you. Perhaps
    we&rsquo;ll see the white pigeon. If we do, it means that we have found lasting
    happiness....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More like we&rsquo;ll only hear the grey ones,&rdquo; he rejoined
    with a sigh. &ldquo;Yes, I know the legend of the fairy pigeons&mdash;but
    they are not like to foretell happiness for any of us just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father is very anxious,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So are we all. We are arming the countryside as fast as we can, but
    we have so little money ... so few opportunities for drilling the raw village
    lads in the use of arms, so little place wherein to keep our stores. Fouch&eacute;&rsquo;s
    spies are everywhere. One does not know whom one can trust. Oh, if we had
    La Frontenay and Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s wealth at our disposal, King Louis
    would be back in France ere the leaves which are now unfolding have fallen
    from the trees.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall have both. That is to be my affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo;  she broke in a little impatiently; &ldquo;but methought
    you had the cause of our King at heart. Are you going to allow petty jealousy
    to stand in the way of success?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would give my life for our cause, Fernande,&rdquo; he retorted
    firmly. &ldquo;You know that. But,&rdquo; he added, with one of those sudden
    waves of passion which had the power through their very might to raise a
    responsive thrill in the young girl&rsquo;s heart, &ldquo;God help me! I
    do believe that if I had to choose &rsquo;twixt my duty to my King and my
    love for you, I would forget everything for the sake of my love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darkness was closing in around them, and they wandered together through
    the broken-down monumental gates of the park, in the stone ornaments of which
    thrushes and finches had built their nests. An intoxicating scent of lilac
    was in the air; Laurent&rsquo;s arm was round his beloved, and she leaned
    against his shoulder. The gathering gloom lent him courage; he poured into
    Fernande&rsquo;s shell-like ear the full phial of his impassioned eloquence,
    and for once it seemed to him as if she responded with all the fervour of
    her young soul. The danger which encompassed him, the duty which he set out
    to fulfil, the spirit of self-sacrifice which caused him to give up a life
    of ease and of pleasure for stern adherence to his ideals&mdash;all helped
    to render him dear to Fernande; and when, leaving the park behind them, they
    wandered in the woods, where at their feet the dead leaves of yester year
    made a soft carpet whereon they walked, and where overhead soft, almost imperceptible
    twitter of birds proclaimed the spring of the year, Laurent suddenly raised
    her face to his and mutely asked for that first kiss which would transform
    a girl&rsquo;s tenderness into a woman&rsquo;s love.</p>
  <p>She looked up into his eyes and thought him handsome and brave, and when
    his lips at last sought hers, she gave caress for caress with all the selflessness
    born of springtime, of youth, of a passionate yearning for happiness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter &nbsp;6<br>
    The Legend Of St. Front</b></h2>
  <p>It all occurred when the world was very young indeed, and when knowledge
    and civilization had not yet penetrated to this far-off corner of romantic
    Normandy. In those days&mdash;oh, it was long before the house of Capet had
    ceased to reign in France&mdash;long before St. Louis had taught his subjects
    that spiritual power came from God alone&mdash;it was long before the noble
    lord Archbishop of Caen preached the First Crusade against the Turks&mdash;in
    those days then, there lived in what was then the hamlet of Villemor a man
    who was deeply versed in the sculptor&rsquo;s art. The tales of the country-side
    have it that he could fashion men and beasts out of stone with such marvellous
    skill, that none could distinguish God&rsquo;s own living work from that
    accomplished by this, one of His most humble creatures.</p>
  <p>So clever, indeed, did he become in his art, that the priests and monks
    of the district became alarmed, fearing that this man&rsquo;s skill was instigated
    by the devil, and that unless something was done to exorcise Satan, that
    Spirit of Evil might take up his permanent abode in the hamlet of Villemor.
    One day the good Jean Front&mdash;such was the sculptor&rsquo;s name&mdash;carved
    from out a block of stone a group of pigeons; the birds were grouped around
    a fountain, and on the ground below could be seen the grains of maize wherewith
    an unseen hand had apparently been feeding them. So exquisite was this work,
    that those who were privileged to see it could almost have sworn that the
    birds moved along on their tiny feet, that they arched their graceful necks,
    pecked at the grains of maize and drank at the water of the fountain. Indeed,
    the pigeons appeared so alive, that many declared that they could hear them
    coo, and all vowed that they were ready to fly away.</p>
  <p>Now the goodly Abbot of Villemor had no liking for such devilish arts; but
    he also was troubled by the sin of curiosity. Assembling the most learned
    monks of his order around him, he declared his intention of going forth into
    the hamlet, and of seeking out that mysterious artificer, whose fame was
    spreading beyond the confines of the fief. In state then, his gold-broidered
    mitre on his head, his staff in his hand, my lord Abbot sallied forth on
    a fine June morning to betake himself to the hamlet of Villemor. Behind him
    walked the Prior and other dignitaries of the Abbey, singing canticles and
    swinging censers, for, of a truth, the devils hate the smell of incense,
    which is the emblem of prayer when it rises straight up to God.</p>
  <p>The legend goes on to say that my lord the Abbot was greatly shocked at
    sight of the sculptor&rsquo;s handiwork. There were the pigeons of a truth&mdash;feathers,
    feet, beaks, eyes and all&mdash;just the same as the Creator Himself would
    have fashioned them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So! Ho! Thou impious malapert!&rdquo; or words to that effect, we
    are told, did the holy man hurl at the unfortunate craftsman. &ldquo;Darest
    thou to fancy thyself the equal of thy Maker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon poor Jean Front seems vigorously to have protested that such sacrilegious
    thoughts had never entered his head, and that, on the contrary, his only
    desire was to dedicate his skill to the service of God.</p>
  <p>But this humility wholly failed to satisfy the learned Abbot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such skill as thou hast,&rdquo; he thundered in his holy wrath, &ldquo;thou
    couldst not of thyself acquire. &rsquo;Tis the devil hath taught thee ... &rsquo;tis
    the devil hath given thee the strength to defy God by arrogating unto thyself
    the power to multiply the creatures of His hand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There appears to have ensued a somewhat lengthy argument between the noble
    Abbot and the humble artificer as to the provenance of that power which of
    a certainty passed comprehension. The Abbot maintained that such power could
    only come from the devil, seeing that it was, as it were, in direct competition
    with God, whilst the unfortunate sculptor maintained that God Himself had
    blessed his work and given him the skill to accomplish it. I imagine from
    the ancient story&mdash;which is far too long to set down here in its entirety&mdash;that
    the learned Abbot was distinctly getting the worst of the argument, when
    a brilliant idea occurred to him, wherewith he hoped, once for all, to confute
    the vainglory of this skilful braggart and save himself from the humiliation
    of being worsted in the wordy warfare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prove to me,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;that the devil hath had
    no hand in thy work. If God is on thy side, He will surely stand by thee
    in thy need, for, of a truth, if thou hast consorted with the devil, it will
    be my duty to see thy body burned at the stake in order that thy immortal
    soul may be saved from the fires of Hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was obviously a quandary for the poor village sculptor. But, according
    to the old legend, he seems to have been possessed of that faith which moveth
    mountains&mdash;or, rather, pigeons; for he then and there dropped on his
    knees and prayed fervently to God to give some sign that these stone pigeons
    had been fashioned for His glory. Whereupon we are told that the air, which
    up to now had been still, became stirred with a breath which was as the most
    balmy, most sweet-scented breeze from Heaven, and for miles around, though
    even the leaves of the aspen did not quiver, there was a sound as of myriads
    of wings, and all of a sudden the stone-pigeons fashioned by Jean Front the
    artificer spread out their wings and flew upwards from their stone pedestal.
    For a moment they circled round and round the head of their maker, then they
    rose up to the blue ether above, and took flight in the direction of the
    woods beyond La Frontenay.</p>
  <p>The air became still once more. But the holy Abbot and all his monks had
    been vastly frightened by this manifestation. They declared more emphatically
    than ever before that this was devil&rsquo;s work, and then and there they
    seized upon the unfortunate sculptor, and having anathematized him and exorcised
    the devil out of him, they built up a stake in the market square and burned
    him to death.</p>
  <p>But it is a recorded fact&mdash;one vouched for by many eye-witnesses, and
    who, indeed, would care to doubt it?&mdash;that at the very moment that poor
    Jean Front was put to torment, the pigeons, which up to now had been seen
    hovering above the trees, gliding through the summer air, their wings outspread,
    their feathers gleaming in the sunshine&mdash;suddenly fell, as if turned
    back to stone, with vertiginous rapidity into the silent pool which lies
    hidden in the woods of La Frontenay. And it is equally a fact, vouched for
    by equally reliable witnesses, that at the precise moment when poor Jean
    Front&rsquo;s soul fled from his martyred body, a snow-white pigeon flew
    out of his mouth, and spreading its wings, it, too, flew above the woods
    of La Frontenay and then fell straight into the pool.</p>
  <p>So true is this, that the great Abbot and his monks returned to their monastery
    greatly perturbed, and that within the year the Abbot lay dying, his soul
    tortured with remorse at the wrong which he had done. So true is it, that
    ere he died that same holy man made a pilgrimage to Rome, and laid before
    His Holiness the Pope his testimony of the miracle performed by Jean Front,
    the sculptor of Villemor; so true, in fact, that the humble artificer became
    a canonized saint and performed many miracles every whit as marvellous as
    that of making pigeons which took unto themselves wings on that memorable
    day in June.</p>
  <p>But ever after it was averred that all those who were threatened by some
    dire calamity, by grief or by death, would hear beside the silent pool of
    La Frontenay the pigeons of St. Front cooing softly from out the depths.
    It is also averred that if God, in His goodness, purposed to send lasting
    happiness to tread on the heels of sorrow, the white pigeon would rise from
    out the pool; it would spread its wings until they gleamed in the sunshine
    ere it took flight to the empyrean above.</p>

    The Silent Pool</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The woods were unusually still. Not a sound broke the delicious hush which
    lay over this summer&rsquo;s morning, when Fernande de Courson made her way
    stealthily through the tangled undergrowth, avoiding the trodden paths and
    the clearings, flitting in and out among the trees like some young elf at
    play. The mischievous light which was scarcely ever wholly absent from her
    eyes was more apparent to-day than it had ever been before. She was wearing
    a white dress; her arms and shoulders were bare, and on her way she had gathered
    an armful of bluebells, there where they grew thickest with long stalks and
    giant bells, on the fringe of the wood.</p>
  <p>It was still very early in the morning, so early that the bluebells were
    dripping with dew, and the sun came slanting in through the trees, making
    the vivid green of tiny elm and birch leaves gleam like emeralds and suffusing
    the gummy tips of the young chestnut with a vivid crimson glow. The carpet
    of last year&rsquo;s leaves made a soft swishing sound under the girl&rsquo;s
    feet; from the branches overhead the birds peeped down on the intruder with
    quaint inquisitiveness in their tiny, beady eyes, and now and then there
    would come a louder rustle, a murmur through the trees as a frightened squirrel
    hopped from bough to bough, fleeing at the approach of the human foe. But
    the human foe, clad all in white, and with the morning sun touching her fair
    curls with living gold, did not pause in order to gaze up at white-throat
    or finch; she did not hearken to the call of the mating linnet, nor did she
    watch the squirrels in their flight. She had heard something last night which
    had caused her to rise very early this morning and to start out for a walk
    in the woods, armed with a sheaf of bluebells and a very arsenal of feminine
    wiles.</p>
  <p>A week had gone by since she had pledged her faith that she would make the
    untamed bear of La Vieuville dance to her piping. Since then she had quietly
    but with marvellous perseverance studied the ground whereon she desired to
    lay her trap for the catching of the unwary beast. During that week she had
    had to endure some ridicule from her father, a few gibes from her aunt, and
    renewed scowls from Laurent. But she was not to be deterred, and none of
    her kinsfolk&mdash;not even Laurent&mdash;had the least idea what was going
    on in that young head, nor what mischief was brewing behind the mocking glance
    of her blue eyes.</p>
  <p>Fernande de Courson had spent that week trying to find out something definite
    about &ldquo;the General&rsquo;s&rdquo; habits and movements during the day.
    That had been an easy task. Anyone in the district could have told her that
    the hero of Austerlitz and Hohenlinden, and of a hundred other fights, toiled
    down from the Ch&acirc;teau of La Vieuville up on the height to his foundries
    in the valley below, every morning at seven o&rsquo;clock, and returned home
    again every evening at nine. That he took a short cut across the fields between
    the edge of the wood and the foundry, walking rather slowly across the rough
    ground, and dragging his wounded leg slightly toward the end of his journey.</p>
  <p>Any one could have told Fernande de Courson that Ronnay de Maurel could
    be found every day and all day, either in one of the workshops or else in
    the small office which he had fitted out for himself, and from whence he
    supervised the administration of his huge estate and of the works which supplied
    the Emperor&rsquo;s army with the material wherewith to conquer the world
    and subjugate the enemies of France. Any one, too, could have added that
    when &ldquo;the General&rdquo; was not at the foundry, he was sitting in
    the back kitchen of the Ch&acirc;teau of La Vieuville, trying to cheer in
    his rough way the monotonous hours of a confirmed invalid.</p>
  <p>All these facts Fernande had learned in four-and-twenty hours. It took her
    a week to find out something more. That something was the fact that &ldquo;the
    General&rdquo; was mightily fond of shooting, and that during the winter
    he had often been seen with a gun on his shoulder and a dog at his heels,
    at break of day, roaming through the moors and forests of La Frontenay, dragging
    his wounded leg at the close of two or three hours&rsquo; hard tramping,
    and often returning with a young deer slung across his shoulders, or a few
    snipe, or pheasant, or golden plover swinging round his belt. But in the
    springtime of the year, when the close season set in and the gun had to be
    laid aside, M. de Maurel did not discontinue his wanderings, and there were
    many who averred that at break of day &ldquo;the General&rdquo; could still
    be seen wending his way towards the woods, his dog at his heels, his breakfast
    in his wallet. People said that he was overfond of pushing as far as the
    silent pool, which was close to the boundary that separated the domain of
    La Frontenay from that of Courson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say that his heart is always with the army,&rdquo; so Fernande&rsquo;s
    informer told her, &ldquo;and that he goes daily to the silent pool, in order
    to listen if the pigeons of St. Front are cooing&mdash;for, indeed, &rsquo;tis
    a sure sign, Mademoiselle, that if the pigeons coo, great sorrow or disaster,
    or even death, awaits the one who hears them; and to the General sorrow and
    disaster to himself only means sorrow and disaster to the Emperor. They say
    that he sits for hours beside the pool, and if he does not hear the pigeons,
    he goes away satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was in Villemor itself that Fernande had gleaned this information. She
    had driven in one day in P&egrave;re Lebrun&rsquo;s carriole, sitting upon
    the pile of vegetables which he was taking into the town. P&egrave;re Lebrun
    was a cultivator who owned a bit of land of his own whereon he grew cabbages
    which he sold when and how he could; he also owned an old nag and a broken-down
    carriole, and once a week&mdash;when the weather was propitious&mdash;he
    drove into Villemor&mdash;a matter of eight kilom&egrave;tres&mdash;and combined
    pleasure with business, by going to see his sister, who lived in the village
    of La Vieuville, on the way to Villemor. This Fernande learned while she
    sat on the pile of P&egrave;re Lebrun&rsquo;s cabbages. She had desired to
    be driven into the town for the sake of a few commissions which she had to
    do there; but thoughts of Ronnay de Maurel were never absent from her mind
    now, and as soon as the pointed roofs of La Vieuville came in sight, she
    led P&egrave;re Lebrun to talk of the inmates of the old ch&acirc;teau. And
    P&egrave;re Lebrun was as ready for gossip as is a peach to fall from the
    tree when it is ripe. One word set him going, and he had a great deal to
    tell of old M. Gaston&rsquo;s eccentricities and miserliness, as well as
    of &ldquo;the General&rdquo; and his queer, rough ways. But though he spoke
    much, he could only quote hearsay, and Fernande was waxing impatient, when
    Lebrun suddenly told her that his sister Ad&egrave;le Lapin did the m&eacute;nage
    daily at the ch&acirc;teau, and that all his information about the two eccentric
    dwellers thereof came from her.</p>
  <p>Whereupon Fernande discovered that her commissions in the town would easily
    keep for another day, and, moreover, that riding in a carriole on the top
    of a pile of cabbages made her sick. She demanded to be put down at the door
    of Mme. Ad&egrave;le Lapin, declaring that she would wait there until P&egrave;re
    Lebrun had finished his business in Villemor and came to pick her up at his
    sister&rsquo;s house before driving back to Courson.</p>
  <p>The result of this change of plans was a wealth of information gleaned from
    Mme. Ad&egrave;le&rsquo;s voluble talk. She knew all about old M. Gaston,
    who, indeed, was very ill, and all about &ldquo;the General,&rdquo; who was
    as savage, as morose and as shy as a bear. But Lapin, her husband, worked
    at a farm the other side of the La Frontenay woods, and when he went to his
    work at break of day, he nearly always met M. Ronnay tramping through the
    thickets, and once or twice he had seen him sitting beside the silent pool.
    Other people had seen him, too, and they said that he sat so still that undoubtedly
    he was listening for the cooing of the pigeons of St. Front.</p>
  <p>And Fernande de Courson drove home that afternoon in P&egrave;re Lebrun&rsquo;s
    carriole feeling like a soldier on the eve of battle. She hardly spoke to
    anyone the whole of that evening, and Laurent had serious cause to complain
    of her lack of responsiveness. She pleaded fatigue from her expedition and
    went early to bed. But the next morning she was up betimes and tramping soon
    after sunrise in the direction of the woods of La Frontenay.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Women have often, as a sex, been comprehensively accused of not being truthful&mdash;of
    being full of deceit or at best of guile. It is averred that women will stoop
    to ways and means for gaining their own ends which men will disdain to utilize
    for theirs. Be that as it may, this chronicle, not being a dissertation,
    nor yet an argument one way or the other, but a faithful transcription of
    events, it behoves us to say that Fernande de Courson did sprain her ankle
    just as she was skirting the silent pool and treading through the tangle
    of wild iris and budding meadowsweet; also, that the sprain caused her acute
    agony; that the water of the pool looked deliciously cool and healing, and
    that she had no other thought at the back of her mind but the desire to alleviate
    the pain, when she took off her shoe and her stocking, soaked her handkerchief
    in the cold water and then laid it as a compress round her ankle.</p>
  <p>To say that Ronnay de Maurel was at the time very far from her thoughts
    would perhaps be putting it a little too strongly; but he was far enough&mdash;shall
    we say?&mdash;from her immediate mental vision to cause her considerable
    surprise by his sudden appearance through the thicket, right in front of
    her, whilst she was reclining full length on a carpet of moss with the sheaf
    of bluebells held to her face and an impish glint of sunlight playing with
    the tendrils of her fair hair and with the tips of her bare toes.</p>
  <p>Now de Maurel, had he seen her before she caught sight of him, would undoubtedly
    have beaten a precipitate retreat. But he was apt to walk along buried in
    his own thoughts&mdash;thoughts of Prussian or Italian campaigns for the
    most part&mdash;and seeing little but the dome of leaves above him, or the
    squirrels that ran away at his approach; nor did he expect to see anyone
    beside the pool. At times, certainly, a labourer or a charcoal burner, or
    a couple of children violet-poaching, would cross the small clearing at the
    far end of the water; but, as a rule, he had the place to himself, and loved
    it for its loneliness and its solitude.</p>
  <p>Whilst Fernande not only did expect to see someone here, but after the pain
    in her foot had become easier, every one of her senses became on the alert
    to catch the sound of a footfall that might be drawing nigh. She heard the
    approach of a heavy footstep from quite a considerable distance; it was unmistakable,
    because of the slight dragging sound caused by one leg being weaker than
    the other.</p>
  <p>She had only just the time to arrange her gown in its most becoming folds,
    to decide on the exact position of the sheaf of bluebells and of her outstretched
    arm, and to assure herself that the sunlight was, indeed, playing with her
    hair and with her toes in just the manner she desired.</p>
  <p>Then she closed her eyes and waited.</p>
  <p>There is nothing on earth more difficult or more tantalizing to do than
    to wait with eyes closed while something is going on around which one would
    give the world to see. Twenty times and more in the space of a few minutes
    did Fernande positively ache with the longing to open her eyes. She heard
    the heavy, unequal step approaching, she heard the smothered exclamation
    which proclaimed impatience at seeing someone in possession of the lonely
    spot ... she heard the stealthy approach of her quarry&mdash;the pause not
    a step or two away from her, and almost felt the hot breath which came and
    went from his nostrils as he stooped in order to look at her.</p>
  <p>But she had the strength of mind to wait until she was quite sure that dark,
    scowling, inquiring eyes were close to her face; then she opened her own.</p>
  <p>At once the man drew himself up and retreated as if the glance from those
    blue eyes had struck him in the face. Yet there was nothing very formidable
    in the pathetic, white-clad figure reclining there upon the moss, and with
    its poor injured foot swathed in a half-dried bit of gossamer rag. Fernande
    watched the retreating ogre until he had fairly turned to go; then she said
    in a quaking voice, and with a sigh that would have rent a heart of stone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m in such pain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she closed her eyes again.</p>
  <p>There was a pause, during which even birds and squirrels seemed to have
    passed the word &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; round. Only a slight flutter among
    the young leaves overhead disturbed the perfect stillness of this fateful
    moment. Fernande&rsquo;s entire hope of success rested on the efficacy of
    her last heartrending appeal.</p>
  <p>For a second or two the ogre appeared to hesitate. Then a halting voice
    broke the spell of expectancy which had fallen over the woods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I be of any help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the dragging, heavy footstep was once more audible as it approached
    quite close to her. Again Fernande sighed, more woefully than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  she moaned, &ldquo;I am utterly helpless. But....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She raised herself upon her elbow, looked round her in perfect bewilderment,
    passed her hand once or twice over her forehead, and finally made up her
    mind to allow her blue eyes to rest on de Maurel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel!&rdquo; she murmured, with the most profound astonishment
    that human voice can possibly express.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo;  he responded with obvious embarrassment, &ldquo;I
    chanced to be passing by.... You seem to be in pain.... Is there aught that
    I can do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is, Monsieur,&rdquo; she replied unblushingly. &ldquo;I fear
    that I have broken my ankle. I am in great pain, and very far from home.
    My name is Fernande de Courson....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he broke in simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are cousins,&rdquo; she suggested demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I pray you help me to get up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had Ronnay de Maurel been asked to hoist up on his shoulder a cannon which
    weighed a couple of tons, he would have felt less puzzled how to proceed
    than he did now, when an exquisite thing which looked as if it might break
    at the slightest touch asked him to help her to raise herself from the ground.</p>
  <p>He was, as usual, dressed in blouse and rough breeches. He had no cap on
    his head, and his feet were encased in heavy riding-boots. For a second or
    two he looked round him with pathetic helplessness, as if he expected the
    dwellers of the forest to come to his aid in this awful dilemma. But no one
    came, and the lovely creature, whose tiny bare foot looked like an exquisite
    flower, was appealing&mdash;oh, so piteously, for help!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas, Monsieur!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an you&rsquo;ll not come
    to my assistance, I shall have to wait till some chance passer-by prove more
    full of pity than you. It is six kilom&egrave;tres from here to the Ch&acirc;teau
    of Courson and I am breakfastless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice&mdash;the tone of which appeared to Ronnay de Maurel like the
    singing of a nightingale&mdash;broke in her plucky effort to keep back the
    tears of mortification and of pain. He suddenly felt like a brute to stand
    by and see her suffer so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said tentatively, &ldquo;but
    I am so clumsy, so rough. I should spoil your gown and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;I would sooner
    have a spoiled gown than remain here till noonday. Give me the support of
    your arm and I will try to raise myself. Perhaps, with the aid of your stick,
    I might then be able to hobble home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus admonished, Ronnay de Maurel, stooping low, held out his arm, and the
    exquisite creature placed one tiny hand upon it, then coolly bade him hold
    the other. Mechanically he obeyed, thinking all the while that the lovely
    fingers&mdash;slender and velvety like the petals of a lily&mdash;would be
    crushed to pieces in his grasp.</p>
  <p>But they remained unscathed, and every succeeding moment he felt her hold
    tightening upon his arm, whilst a delicious fragrance as of spring air laden
    with blossom seemed to come from her entire person, and the soft tendrils
    of her fair hair brushed against his cheek like a fairy&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I shall be able to walk,&rdquo; said Fernande
    ruefully, as she clung more firmly with both her hands to his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you try?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Lean on me and let me support
    you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Perhaps if you held the stick with one hand and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;  she interposed decisively, in perfectly matter-of-fact
    tone, &ldquo;if you will put your arm round my waist, I think that perhaps....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did as he was told, and felt the whole weight of her lissom body against
    his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I can put my foot to the ground....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She tried. But the movement wrung a cry of pain from her lips. She fell
    back against the broad shoulder which was so conveniently held for her support
    and leaned her head against it. She closed her eyes as if ready to swoon.
    De Maurel was ready to anathematize Heaven for perpetrating such wanton cruelty
    against a being so perfect and so frail.</p>
  <p>A pair of blue eyes that were swimming in tears were turned dolefully up
    to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I fear me that I shall have to remain breakfastless, after all,&rdquo; murmured
    Fernande, with lips that quivered like those of a child about to cry. &ldquo;I
    pray you leave me, dear cousin. You cannot afford to waste your time over
    the ailments of an insignificant person like me. Perhaps you may find some
    one in the village good enough to take a message over to my father by and
    by, asking him to send P&egrave;re Lebrun&rsquo;s carriole hither. But oh!
    I pray you haste! I shall be so desperately hungry ere the carriole come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel earnestly, &ldquo;you
    have, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, every excuse for looking upon me as an ill-mannered
    cur, but none, I think, for imagining that I am an inhuman wretch. Nothing
    would induce me to leave you here ... in this lonely spot ... alone and in
    pain....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how am I to get home, dear cousin?&rdquo; she queried, darting
    a glance on him from under the fringe of her dark lashes that would have
    tantalized a saint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you will grant me leave,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;I will
    carry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carry me?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, it is six kilom&egrave;tres
    to the ch&acirc;teau!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it were twenty I could carry you thither,&rdquo; he interposed
    with that quaint smile which was wont to lighten his stern face like sunshine
    on a troubled sea.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough and quite unaccountably, Fernande felt a quick blush rising
    to her cheeks under the look which accompanied that smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  he added simply, &ldquo;you weigh less than a bird.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Less than one of the pigeons of St. Front, perhaps,&rdquo; she retorted
    gaily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were of stone,&rdquo; quoth he dryly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! you know the legend, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was born at La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard the pigeons cooing, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he replied curtly. &ldquo;Once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before an infernal bomb was hurled
    by an assassin at Napoleon Bonaparte, the idol of France, and his precious
    life was only saved by a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande had been leaning with both hands upon de Maurel&rsquo;s arm all
    this while; but at these words, which he spoke with renewed roughness, she
    drew back quickly as if she had been stung. Strangely enough, she appeared
    quite able to stand on her injured foot now, and equally strangely he failed
    to notice this. For a second or two a look that was nothing short of hate
    crept into her eyes, and the flush which rose to her cheeks was one of hot
    anger and of defiance.</p>
  <p>He did not flinch under her gaze, even though he would gladly have recalled
    the foolish speech which had escaped his lips and which obviously had wounded
    her. Indeed, he could not help but see that the allusion to the aborted conspiracy
    against the life of Bonaparte planned by the Royalists of Normandy had stung
    her pride to the quick, and already he was cursing himself for a clumsy lout,
    and trying to find in his limited vocabulary words wherewith to win her pardon.</p>
  <p>But for the space of a few seconds, at any rate, he knew that she stood
    before him in avowed enmity, and Fernande had to close her eyes lest he should
    read in them that hatred and contempt which she felt and which she knew that
    she would always feel for this traitor to his King and to his caste. She
    had to force herself to remember the r&ocirc;le which she had set herself
    to play, to force herself to think of this abominable regicide as a tool
    for furthering the very cause which he was now helping to crush; and there
    was a marvellous fund of energy and of enthusiasm lurking in the heart of
    this child&mdash;a marvellous power of duplicity and of self-control, there
    where her patriotism and her ideals guided her.</p>
  <p>As she closed her eyes the hot flush fled from her cheeks, leaving them
    pale and transparent, and with a pearly shadow cast over them by the drooping
    fringe of her lashes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; exclaimed de Maurel, overwhelmed with
    shame and contrition at his own brutality.</p>
  <p>But already Fernande had recovered her self-possession; and even before
    the first words of abject self-abasement had passed his lips, she uttered
    a low moan of pain and tottered as if about to fall. She would have fallen&mdash;no
    doubt most gracefully&mdash;had not his arm proved to be once more so conveniently
    near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas cruel, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she murmured feebly, &ldquo;to
    speak such words, whilst I am too weak to raise my voice in defence of those
    I love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he said appealingly, &ldquo;I said
    just now that I had never given you cause to call me an inhuman wretch. Until
    a while ago I could have asserted on my soul that I had never been cruel
    to a woman in my life. Now you see me shamed beyond endurance. Will you believe
    me when I say that I would give twenty years of my life to unsay the thoughtless
    words I spoke just now? Mademoiselle Fernande, will you deign to forgive
    a poor wretch who hath never had a knowledge of soft words, but who would
    sooner have bitten out his tongue ere he uttered the senseless ones which
    have so justly angered you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s head was bent, in utter humility and remorse, while
    he spoke, or he could not have failed to note the look of triumph which shot
    out of the girl&rsquo;s eyes from beneath her half-closed lids, or the swift
    sigh of satisfaction which escaped her parted lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call those words unsaid, dear cousin,&rdquo; she said
    softly. &ldquo;I know, alas! that between your political aims and our own
    there is an abyss of divergent ideals! You and your party have the power
    now&mdash;we are humbled and helpless&mdash;and must, therefore, rely on
    your generosity not to embitter the joy which we felt when we trod once again
    the soil of our beloved country, after years of poverty and of exile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Protestations would come ill from me,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You
    would scorn them&mdash;and justly, too&mdash;after my unwarrantable transgression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to be patient with us, <i>mon cousin</i>. We may have
    erred in the past, we may be foolish and misguided now, but you must try
    and remember always that every one of our actions is guided solely by our
    love of France&mdash;by the burning patriotism which helped us to endure
    exile and untold misery for the sake of our beliefs and of our aspirations.
    Mistaken we may be; but until you have heard the advocacy of our cause, I
    pray you do not judge us as harshly as you have obviously been led to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, dear cousin, let us not dwell on that sad subject any longer.
    See! the sun is high in the heavens&mdash;the birds are singing a deafening
    anthem of joy ... and,&rdquo;  she added archly, &ldquo;I am still breakfastless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again de Maurel had to chide himself for a clumsy and selfish lout. For
    himself he would gladly have continued to dwell on the sad subject, seeing
    that it was being argued by an exquisite creature with the rosiest of lips
    and the most enthralling voice he had ever heard, even whilst she leaned
    her ethereal form against his arm, and cast an occasional look on him from
    out a pair of eyes as limpid and as blue as the sky. But the word &ldquo;breakfastless&rdquo; once
    more struck him with remorse. To think that this beautiful and diaphanous
    being could suffer hunger, discomfort, even pain, seemed to him the most
    monstrous outrage in the whole scheme of creation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God forgive me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for a thoughtless dolt. I
    was forgetting the flight of time. Now, Mademoiselle Fernande, if you will
    trust yourself to me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you really mean,&rdquo; she queried, &ldquo;that you will carry
    me all the way to Courson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you will let me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw him a mute glance of gratitude, which somehow seemed to addle
    his brain in a manner which he thought strangely unaccountable, but not altogether
    unpleasant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my flowers!&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed ruefully. &ldquo;I
    had taken such trouble to pick them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sheaf of wild hyacinth was lying in a disordered mass of blue at her
    feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon cousin</i>, I pray you pick them up for me!&rdquo; she added
    with a pretty tone of appeal.</p>
  <p>At once he was down on his knees; it seemed practically impossible that
    he should disobey the slightest of her commands, and, mechanically, he gathered
    together the bunch of bluebells and handed it up to her. He was strangely
    awkward in the accomplishment of this task, and when he looked up to her
    again, a mischievous light was dancing in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think me a clumsy oaf, I&rsquo;ll warrant,&rdquo; he said, while
    that ghost of a smile which became him so well lit up his face in response. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
    the first time in my life I&rsquo;ve waited on a lady, and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she took the flowers from him her fingers closed for a moment over his
    hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis most gallantly you do it, Sir Knight,&rdquo; she said
    graciously.</p>
  <p>She held the sheaf of flowers in both her arms and buried her face in the
    tangle of blue. It was amazing how little pain the sprained ankle was causing
    her at this moment; nothing more perfect or more graceful could be imagined
    than the picture which she presented, standing thus in her white gown beside
    the silent pool, with the spikes of the wild iris framing her knees, behind
    her a background of tender green and russet branches. Her broad-brimmed hat
    hung against her shoulder, and its black velvet ribbon, tied round her neck,
    enhanced still further the perfect whiteness of her throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s masterpiece, indeed!&rdquo; thought Ronnay de Maurel,
    as, despite himself, his eyes would feast themselves on the exquisite apparition,
    wandering in rapt admiration from the golden crown of her fair hair to that
    tiny bare foot which stood half buried in a bed of moss.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he perceived that her white dress was soiled, there where it had
    come in contact with the sleeve of his blouse. He could have cursed loudly
    in an agony of contrition, and in a moment a hot flush of intense mortification
    spread over his forehead. He would have given worlds to be able to strip
    off that horrible blouse before he ventured once more to touch that fragrant
    and delicate creature, whose airy white robe his work-stained hands had sullied.
    Unfortunately he was not certain whether his shirt was not in holes. Never
    in his life had Ronnay de Maurel felt so deeply shamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid ... I ... I fear,&rdquo; he stammered, and looked down
    ruefully on his hands and blouse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That you have dirtied my frock,&rdquo; she broke in with a laugh. &ldquo;Well,
    you know, dear cousin, that our meeting was impromptu, else, I am sure, you
    would have donned more suitable attire. Believe me, that in moments of pain
    an invalid takes no heed of a kind healer&rsquo;s clothes. <i>Allons!</i>&rdquo; she
    added gaily, &ldquo;will you carry me pick-a-back, or....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In my arms, if you will permit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed, he lifted her from the ground as if she were a weightless fairy
    or a bird.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you deign to put one arm round my shoulder?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There!
    Is that comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo;  she murmured, as she snuggled like a white kitten
    against him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;  she exclaimed. &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this query he made no reply, but started on his way. It was six kilom&egrave;tres
    to Courson, through the woods first, and then across the fields. To Ronnay
    de Maurel ever afterwards it seemed as if the distance had been less than
    one. Leaving the pool on his right, he struck the footpath among the trees,
    treading softly and warily on the carpet of leaves and moss, lest his clumsy,
    dragging gait should cause her pain. She lay quite quiescent in his arms,
    holding the sheaf of bluebells so that it lay between her face and his. The
    dewy petals brushed against his cheek and mouth, and he was conscious of
    the delicious fragrance which filled his nostrils and of the cool dewdrops
    which moistened his lips. Her face he could not see, only the pellucid tendrils
    of her hair, as the soft breeze that murmured through the woods made them
    flutter in the sunshine. And he could see the little foot, half swathed in
    its gossamer bandage, each delicate toe so like the petal of a rose. He felt
    neither weight nor fatigue; he would have walked thus through life, thinking
    that it had suddenly become marvellously fair. Once or twice he asked her
    if she was comfortable, and she always answered: &ldquo;Very comfortable,
    I thank you!&rdquo; But she never asked him if he were fatigued. She knew
    that he was not. Once, when he put the question, he was not far from Courson,
    and the wood was already far behind, and through the veil of bluebells he
    could just see that her eyes were closed. He thought that she slept. From
    the earth close to his feet a lark rose, singing its joyous anthem, and fluttered
    upwards into the heavenly blue above.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>It took Ronnay de Maurel two hours to reach the village of Courson. The
    ch&acirc;teau was half a kilom&egrave;tre further on. Never had he cursed
    its circular, pointed roofs as heartily as he did to-day. He would have liked
    to push them to the outermost confines of the earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; Fernande asked softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very near home,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must have been asleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are not tired?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I am not tired,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>All the while that he had tramped with his burden through the woods and
    across the fields, he had felt contented with only the squirrels and the
    birds around him to mock him for his heavy gait, his stained blouse and muddy
    boots. The sight of the first cottage of Courson suddenly took all the zest
    out of his spirit. Self-consciousness returned, and with it his full measure
    of wrath against his kinsfolk, whom of a truth he had no mind to meet again&mdash;not
    while his fatigue, of which he suddenly became conscious, and the additional
    mudstains on his clothes after the long tramp, placed him at such obvious
    disadvantage. Their presence, he felt, would jar upon his mood to a degree
    which he felt he could not endure.</p>
  <p>Fernande, who had been silently watching him from behind the bunch of bluebells,
    saw the scowl which gradually gathered on his brow and chased away that strange
    rapt look and the sunny smile, which she had noted with such satisfaction
    every time that she contrived to catch a glimpse of his face. Her womanly
    instinct had been so unerring up to now, the success of her undertaking so
    assured, that she had no mind to mar it by a false move in the end.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said suddenly, just as de Maurel, avoiding
    the main village street, had struck through an orchard and along a by-path,
    which led to a postern gate in the boundary wall of the ch&acirc;teau, &ldquo;<i>mon
    cousin</i>, by your leave, an you&rsquo;ll take me as far as the Lodge, I
    could try and walk up the avenue to the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no one at the Lodge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    the avenue is over long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Annette will be at the Lodge,&rdquo; she argued; &ldquo;she goes
    thither every morning to air the rooms. The door will be open. I could slip
    in.... No one would see us....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now that she suggested just what he would have liked to do, he was ready
    with opposition.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should not like to leave you. You might be in pain again,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my ankle is much better! It has had two hours&rsquo; rest. I
    can wait at the Lodge till Annette comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mechanically he had obeyed, and turned back in the direction of the main
    gates of the park. The Lodge&mdash;a small stone pavilion&mdash;was just
    inside the gates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be spied from the ch&acirc;teau, do we, <i>mon
      cousin</i>?&rdquo; added the young girl, whilst a ripple of laughter, musical
      as the song of a lark, helped to chase away the last lingering remnant
      of de Maurel&rsquo;s moodiness. &ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i> would be vastly
      shocked, for my hair is dishevelled, and my gown wet and stained. Laurent
      would be angry and father would scold....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and suddenly uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin! what have I done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande, what is
    it? Are you in pain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. No, it is not that. My foot is so much better ... but ... but....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed ready to cry, and just now he felt that he would curse loudly
    and long if he saw her in distress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;I
    entreat you to tell me what troubles you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My shoe and my stocking,&rdquo; she murmured in a weak, trembling
    voice. &ldquo;I left them beside the pool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ronnay de Maurel literally gave a gasp of horror. A calamity such as this
    seemed to him to be beyond the confines of possibility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beside the pool!&rdquo; he exclaimed aghast. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How impossible?&rdquo; she retorted impatiently. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
    my shoe and stocking on, have I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took a peep at the bare, rosy toes, which vied in delicacy with the apple-blossom
    overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You certainly have not!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? And have you got them in your pocket, <i>mon cousin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sighing with regret, he vowed that he had not.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I must have left them by the pool,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and fetch them,&rdquo; he said at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And walk another dozen kilom&egrave;tres to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When shall I bring them?&rdquo; was all that he said by way of rejoinder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it will have to be soon ... that is if you really think that
    you wouldn&rsquo;t be too tired to go and fetch them.... But, you know, Mme.
    la Marquise is so rigid in the matter of decorum ... she will be so angry
    when she hears that I have lost my shoe ... and she will scold me ... and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We may take it that de Maurel was far too unversed in the usages of feminine
    amenities to notice how hopelessly the lovely creature in his arms was floundering
    in the mazes of her own rhetoric; he was obviously far too unsophisticated
    to suggest that if Mme. la Marquise was, indeed, so rigid in the matter of
    decorum, she would hardly approve of his walking in at Courson one day with
    her niece&rsquo;s shoe in one pocket and her stocking in the other. Just
    for a moment Fernande had a slight qualm of anxiety. She had engineered this
    final move in her campaign on the spur of the moment, and she had not had
    the time to think it out in detail. But, indeed, her fears were futile. De
    Maurel did not even notice the glaring discrepancy in the tale of Mme. la
    Marquise&rsquo;s supposed attitude towards the proprieties. As a matter of
    fact, the thought that Fernande should be scolded for having lost her stocking
    was so horrible, that his one idea now was a longing to get to the Lodge,
    to deposit his fair burden&mdash;if possible in Annette&rsquo;s charge&mdash;and
    then to start running at once, as fast as his wounded leg would allow&mdash;in
    search of the two precious articles.</p>
  <p>The calamities which might overtake Fernande in the interval&mdash;her father&rsquo;s
    wrath, her aunt&rsquo;s reproaches&mdash;were so awful to contemplate, that
    poor Ronnay felt a cold sweat breaking out upon his forehead. Fortunately
    the incident did not weaken the power of his arms. He reached the Lodge without
    untoward accident; the gates, luckily, were open and there was no one about.
    Fernande declared that she was now not only able to stand, but also to hobble
    as far as the Lodge parlour, and to sit quietly there until Annette arrived,
    when she would forthwith proceed to the ch&acirc;teau, where, no doubt, every
    one was devoured with anxiety about her.</p>
  <p>How thankful was de Maurel that the park of Courson was so lonely and deserted.
    He would have hated it if prying eyes had been nigh when, with infinite precaution,
    he lowered his precious burden to the ground. It was terrible to see how
    he had crushed her gown, and, alas! the bluebells hung their tiny heads in
    a very drooping fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said, as leaning against
    the stone pillar of the porch she held out her hand to him. He knew quite
    well that he ought then to have taken that little hand, which was as white
    and delicate as a snowflake, and that he ought to have kissed the tips of
    those flower-like fingers. But had he not boasted a brief while ago that
    he did not know the art of kissing a lady&rsquo;s hand? This was so true,
    that at this moment, when he would have bartered his life for the pleasure
    of pressing his lips against that hand, he could only murmur a few meaningless
    and clumsy words. His whole bearing became awkward and ungainly; he was self-conscious,
    furious with himself, angered against that world which had shut him out from
    its reserved precincts.</p>
  <p>He threw one quick look of appeal to the young girl, encountered her glance
    of indulgent mockery, muttered a hasty farewell, and then turned abruptly
    on his heel.</p>
  <p>Fernande remained standing in the porch until the tall, massive figure with
    the curious, dragging gait had disappeared beyond the gates of the park;
    then&mdash;oh, shame! unblushing shame!&mdash;she executed a pirouette upon
    that sadly injured foot. She stretched out her arms with a gesture of triumph,
    and threw back her head, filling her lungs with the intoxicating air of this
    glorious spring morning. Her eyes were dancing with glee, the quick breath
    came and went through her full, parted lips, and there was a glow of excitement
    upon her cheeks.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The paths were too rough for Fernande to attempt to go back shoeless to
    the ch&acirc;teau, so she waited in the porch, leaning against the pillar,
    in the same attitude wherein she had received de Maurel&rsquo;s final clumsy
    farewell; she waited with her own triumphal thoughts for company, for close
    on half an hour, when she suddenly spied Laurent walking briskly down the
    drive toward the Lodge.</p>
  <p>She called to him and he uttered a cry of obvious relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were all getting so anxious,&rdquo; he shouted breathlessly, as
    soon as he was near enough to make himself heard. &ldquo;It is nearly eleven
    o&rsquo;clock. Matthieu said that he saw you walking through the orchard
    soon after daybreak. Where have you been, Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went for a walk in the woods,&rdquo; she replied simply; &ldquo;incidentally
    I sprained my ankle. Look!&rdquo; she added, holding up her skirt and pointing
    her bare foot at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye gods!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are quite right there, Laurent,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;the
    gods had much to do with my sprained ankle. In fact, they have been busy
    with me all the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will tell you what I mean, as soon as I have a stocking and a shoe
    upon this foot&mdash;and not before. So if you are devoured with curiosity,
    my dear cousin, I pray you find Annette and tell her to bring me the wherewithal
    to clothe my injured foot with decency. It is getting blue with cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go immediately; but
    do tell me first, I entreat....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you nothing till my foot is clad,&rdquo; she responded
    firmly.</p>
  <p>Now Laurent de Mortain was pastmaster in the knowledge of feminine moods
    and caprices, wherein his elder brother was so woefully ignorant. He did
    not stop to argue the point. That something unusual had happened, besides
    the sprained ankle, was, of course, plainly writ on Fernande&rsquo;s glowing
    cheeks and in her glittering eyes; but that she did not mean to tell him
    anything about it for the present was equally plainly marked round the lines
    of her obstinate little mouth. Therefore, Laurent, with a shrug of his shoulders
    and a muttered: &ldquo;As you will!&rdquo; at once turned on his heel and
    walked rapidly back towards the ch&acirc;teau in obedience to his lady&rsquo;s
    commands.</p>
  <p>And Fernande was once more left alone in the porch of the Lodge, gazing
    after the retreating figure of a man. In this instance she could watch an
    elegant and graceful retreat&mdash;a springy gait, the knightly bearing of
    a well-groomed head. She could not help but compare the two brothers, greatly
    to the advantage of Laurent&mdash;vastly to the detriment of the uncouth
    creature whose stained and shabby blouse had soiled her white gown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said that the bear would soon be dancing to my piping,&rdquo; she
    mused, &ldquo;and he is standing on his hind legs now, ready to begin....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  she added, and here her thoughts became confused and
    unruly, &ldquo;the bear would not have gone to fetch Annette; he would have
    put his great strong arms round me and carried me to the ch&acirc;teau. And
    oh! how I should have hated him for it!&rdquo;  she concluded, with a little
    shudder as she smoothed out the creases in her muslin gown.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>All that Fernande vouchsafed to say, once she was duly shod, was that the
    Ch&acirc;teau of Courson might expect the visit of M. le Comte de Maurel
    that self-same afternoon. Mme. la Marquise was incredulous and M. de Courson
    angry. Laurent looked very glum and remained silent and morose all through
    dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mais enfin</i>, Fernande,&rdquo; he had asked a score of times, &ldquo;what
    actually did happen?&rdquo;  And a score of times he had received the same
    answer: &ldquo;Nothing has happened to anger you, dear cousin. I met M. de
    Maurel in the woods and suggested to him that he should renew his visit to
    us. To this suggestion meseemed that he agreed. He may come this afternoon
    ... but he is rude and obstinate ... so who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he pressed her for fuller explanations, she gave him a curt answer
    and a haughty little look, two things which poor Laurent never could bear
    patiently.</p>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise thought that Fernande was over-confident. &ldquo;Your wish
    is father to your thought, my child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why should Ronnay
    come at your simple bidding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why he should, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; rejoined
    the young girl imperturbably, &ldquo;but somehow I think that he will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in order to proclaim her faith in her own prophecy, she went and changed
    her soiled gown after dinner for an entirely fresh and very dainty one.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter &nbsp;8<br>
    The General</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Mme. la Marquise&rsquo;s incredulity with regard to her niece&rsquo;s assertion
    lasted well into the afternoon. She could not bring herself to believe that
    de Maurel&rsquo;s hostile attitude towards all the inmates of Courson, which
    he had so steadily maintained since his first unfortunate visit, could have
    undergone such a material change in so short a time.</p>
  <p>She had looked on Fernande&rsquo;s childish boasting as mere nonsense, and
    during the past week had been eating out her heart in vain regret and remorse
    at her own folly, her own insentient pride, which had undoubtedly precipitated
    the catastrophe, and turned into an open feud what had, after all, only been
    a kind of skulking neutrality before. Mme. la Marquise was quite sure in
    her own mind that if she had been present throughout the interview between
    the two brothers, she would have known how to avert the quarrel. Once it
    had occurred, she felt that nothing would ever bridge it over. The short
    glimpse which she had that day of Ronnay de Maurel had told her plainly that
    he was, indeed, the son of his father&mdash;endowed with the same passionate
    and violent temperament and the same obstinacy. Some latent impulse&mdash;or
    perhaps mere idle curiosity, she thought&mdash;had prompted him to come the
    once. But unfortunately he had been made unwelcome, and Madame la Marquise
    knew that he would resent this most bitterly, and that he would prove as
    irreconcilable as her husband had been, as old Gaston de Maurel still was.</p>
  <p>Was it likely, therefore, that he would surrender at a word from a mere
    girl, and come and eat that humble pie at Courson which was bound to be very
    distasteful to him? Madame thought not; and in this she proved herself as
    ignorant of male temperament as her son was of feminine wiles. But Fernande
    was so positive that M. de Maurel would come, that something of her confidence
    communicated itself to the others. Her appearance in a new frock of delicate
    muslin, with tiny puffed sleeves and the shortest of waists, the folds of
    her long skirt clinging very closely to her girlish figure, finally brought
    Madame&rsquo;s incredulity to an end, and though nothing was done this time
    in preparation of M. de Maurel&rsquo;s coming, the excitement which pervaded
    the ch&acirc;teau was none the less acute.</p>
  <p>The weather continued to smile the whole afternoon. It had been the warmest
    day of the young year, and Madame&mdash;still pretending that she was not
    expecting her son&mdash;ordered Annette to bring some semblance of order
    in the vast circular veranda that overlooked the park. In olden days this
    veranda had been a favourite spot on warm afternoons; the view between the
    stone pillars right over the ornamental water and the English garden beyond
    was magnificent. In those days the flagged floor was covered with soft carpets,
    chairs and lounges stood around, with one or two card-tables and stands for
    wines or coffee. Now there were neither carpets nor lounges; a few garden
    seats of stout wood had alone survived the years of disrepair. But after
    Annette had scrubbed the floor and the chairs, after Madame had ordered a
    table or two to be brought out and light refreshments to be disposed on them,
    after she had spread a couple of gaily-coloured Paisley shawls&mdash;remnants
    of her own depleted wardrobe&mdash;over the seats, the place looked inviting
    enough, and nothing could spoil the view across the park, right over an apple
    orchard aglow with blossom to the distant wooded heights beyond.</p>
  <p>Madame took her seat beside the coffee-urn, her knitting in her hand. M.
    de Courson, feeling unaccountably restless, joined her after a while, making
    pretence to read the <i>Moniteur</i>&mdash;a week old&mdash;which a courier
    from Paris had brought that morning. Soon afterwards Laurent and Fernande
    were seen coming round the ornamental water. They came up the stone steps
    to the veranda, Fernande&rsquo;s unconcerned prattle and her merry laugh
    raising the echoes of the old walls.</p>
  <p>Laurent was moody, as he always was when his brother&rsquo;s name was so
    much as mentioned; but Fernande was in the highest possible spirits, even
    though she masked her gaiety behind a look of sober demureness.</p>
  <p>Everyone&rsquo;s nerves were on the jar. The paper rattled in M. de Courson&rsquo;s
    hands; Madame&rsquo;s knitting needles clicked jerkily.</p>
  <p>Laurent sat with his two hands tightly clasped between his knees, staring
    down most of the time at Fernande&rsquo;s little feet, which were stretched
    out before her. They were encased in a delicious pair of heelless black alpaca
    sandals, with satin ribbons criss-crossing over the instep and tied in a
    bow just above the ankle. Her fingers were busy with a delicate piece of
    embroidery, and she was expounding her views to Laurent on the subject of
    the rearing of chickens.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>At half-past three Annette came rushing from the house on to the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The General!&rdquo; she cried excitedly. &ldquo;He is just coming
    up the avenue. Matthieu sent me to ask if Mme. la Marquise will receive him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame looked up from her work and turned cold, reproving eyes on worthy,
    perspiring Annette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The General?&rdquo; she queried calmly. &ldquo;I know no General
    in the King&rsquo;s army who is like to pay me a visit to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon Annette, thus rebuked, was covered with confusion, from which
    it took her some time to recover.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg a thousand pardons, Mme. la Marquise,&rdquo; she stammered
    ruefully, as she wiped her hot, red hands on her apron. &ldquo;I have known
    the Gen&mdash;I mean M. de Maurel all these years, and ... I ... I was meaning
    that....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That what, my good woman?&rdquo; asked Madame tartly.</p>
  <p>She appeared very detached and haughty, but Fernande, who shot one of her
    keen, mischievous glances at her aunt from beneath her long lashes, noted
    with vast amusement that though Madame was not working for the moment, the
    knitting needles in her hands were clicking audibly one against the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean, Madame la Marquise, that M. le Comte de Maurel is coming
    down the avenue,&rdquo;  Annette was at last able to blurt out. &ldquo;Will
    Mme. la Marquise receive him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will receive M. le Comte,&rdquo; replied Madame with
    perfect dignity. &ldquo;Tell Matthieu to show M. le Comte up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; murmured Annette, who felt a little
    awed by the atmosphere of pomp which had so unaccountably descended on the
    old veranda and its inmates, and to which she&mdash;poor soul!&mdash;was
    wholly unaccustomed. &ldquo;And Matthieu says, Madame la Marquise, what is
    he to do about the horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Gen ... I ... I mean M. le Comte is on horseback and the stable
    roof fell in six years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good Annette,&rdquo; here interposed M. de Courson with marked
    irritability, &ldquo;do not worry Madame la Marquise with such trifles. Surely
    Matthieu can look after a horse for an hour or so while a visitor pays his
    respects up here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well ... Matthieu says,&rdquo; muttered Annette, whose temper was
    none too equable at any time, &ldquo;that he cannot come up and announce
    a visitor and look after a horse at one and the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An exclamation of impatience came from Laurent as he rose from his seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why all this pother, I wonder?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    go and see after the man&rsquo;s horse. One of his own vanners, I suppose.
    He must look funny on horseback with that linen blouse of his flopping round
    him in the wind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He crossed the veranda, ready to follow Annette. The worthy woman, having
    shrugged her fat shoulders and thrown up her hands with an expressive gesture
    of complete detachment from the doings of her betters, started to shuffle
    back the way she came. But before either she or Laurent had reached the wide
    glass porti&egrave;res which gave on the principal State apartments of the
    ch&acirc;teau, a firm tread, with a curious drag in it and accompanied by
    the click of spurs, was heard to cross the hall and then to resound on the
    parquet floor of the vast reception-room which led directly to the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; said Fernande in her tantalizingly
    demure way. &ldquo;M. de Maurel has apparently been too impatient to await
    your welcome. He....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused&mdash;the next words dying upon her lips&mdash;her hands poised
    in mid-air holding her work and the embroidery thread. Even she could not
    repress a slight gasp of astonishment as Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s tall figure
    appeared under the lintel of the door.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>He wore the uniform of a General of Division in the army of the Emperor&mdash;the
    uniform which he had last worn at Austerlitz, and which he had since laid
    aside for the blue linen blouse. He carried his <i>chapeau-bras</i> under
    his arm, and there was, indeed, nothing visible now of the slouchy attire
    which had so offended against Madame la Marquise de Mortain&rsquo;s ideas
    of what was picturesque. The gorgeous uniform, though worn and patched, became
    the tall, massive figure admirably, and though the gold of collar and epaulettes
    was so tarnished that it looked almost black, and the cloth of tunic and
    breeches so faded that their original dark green colour was almost unrecognizable,
    they lent a certain barbaric splendour to this last descendant of an ancient
    lineage turned democrat from conviction and temperament. From out the tall,
    stiff collar, covered with tarnished gold, the neck rose erect and firm,
    and the shoulders were squared as on parade. Ronnay de Maurel had halted
    on the threshold, and with a rigid military salute had greeted the assembled
    company. Instinctively, and on the spur of the moment, M. de Courson had
    risen in order to greet the new-comer; he now advanced with hand extended.
    Madame la Marquise could scarce believe her eyes; a change had, indeed, come
    over the uncouth figure of a week ago. Her cold and quizzical eyes took in
    at a glance all that was fine and picturesque in her eldest son&rsquo;s demeanour.
    The gold-embroidered tunic pleased her, despite the stains on it caused by
    the grime and smoke of powder, and a quick look of compassion, which was
    almost furtive, so unwonted was it, crept into her grey eyes when they caught
    sight of the large stain and the obvious patch in the left leg of his breeches&mdash;there
    where the cloth had been torn away, when a bullet from the Austrian gun had
    laid this splendid soldier low.</p>
  <p>As Ronnay came forward Madame rose slightly from her seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a pleasure to see you, my son,&rdquo; she said graciously.</p>
  <p>She gave him her hand, which he did not take. Obviously he did not see it,
    nor yet M. de Courson&rsquo;s kindly gesture. But he took Laurent&rsquo;s
    hand. The awkwardness which he felt was manifested in all his movements and
    in the few vague words of thanks which he uttered. Then suddenly Fernande&rsquo;s
    clear, young voice rang out merrily through the constrained atmosphere which
    de Maurel&rsquo;s appearance had produced on everyone present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;am I then so
    small or so insignificant that I alone am not worthy of your regard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not move from her seat, but this time de Maurel was not slow either
    in coming to her side or in taking the tiny hand which she held out to him.
    With a clumsy gesture, though without the slightest hesitation, he raised
    it to his lips. Laurent smothered an exclamation of wrath; but into Madame
    la Marquise&rsquo;s cold, grey eyes there came a sudden light of satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not sit down, my son?&rdquo; she said, with a well-bred
    air of condescension. &ldquo;I trust that you have come to pay us a nice
    long visit. My brother-in-law is no worse, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pointed to a chair which, though at some distance from Fernande, would
    afford the sitter a clear view of the charming picture which the girl presented.
    That something more than a mere casual rencontre had taken place between
    her eldest son and her niece she no longer doubted; the child went up in
    her estimation at once, for obviously she had played her cards well. Nothing
    would suit Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s plans better than that de Maurel should
    evince an ardent admiration for Fernande de Courson; and if that admiration
    warmed into love&mdash;well, so much the better for the cause of the King.
    The bear was certainly beginning to dance, thought Madame, whilst the smile
    of satisfaction lingered round her lips and her thoughts went off roaming
    in the realms of fancy. Laurent would have to console himself with a rich
    heiress for the loss of his charming fianc&eacute;e. At best, Madame herself
    did not greatly favour the match. M. de Courson had not a sou wherewith to
    endow his daughter, and Madame la Marquise had oft expressed her doubts as
    to His Majesty&mdash;even when he came to his throne again&mdash;being ever
    rich enough to compensate all his loyal adherents for the losses which they
    had sustained. Laurent was so handsome, that any rich girl would only be
    too proud to regild his escutcheon for him in exchange for all the advantages
    which his gallant bearing and his sixteen quarterings would bestow upon her.
    Indeed, everything was shaping out for the best. Madame, while talking platitudes
    to de Maurel to which he only listened with half an ear, was able to note
    with practised eye every symptom of profound attention which he bestowed
    on the slightest word or movement from Fernande.</p>
  <p>In her mind she had already appraised the enormous advantages that would
    accrue to the King&rsquo;s cause if a marriage between a de Courson and this
    wealthy adherent of Bonaparte could be effected. Madame la Marquise de Mortain
    belonged to a generation which had often seen petticoat government ruling
    the destinies of nations. And though&mdash;Ronnay being what he was, the
    true son of his father, and having perhaps inherited his father&rsquo;s temperament
    as well as his democratic ideals&mdash;she could not fail to appreciate the
    possibility of a de Courson once again reducing a de Maurel to complete,
    if short-lived, slavery.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not suffered from the result of your accident, Mademoiselle
    Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all, <i>mon cousin</i>, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A pause. Then a pair of blue eyes were once more raised from what seemed
    very absorbing work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woods round La Frontenay are very beautiful, <i>mon cousin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very beautiful, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had never visited the silent pool in the early morning before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another pause, necessitated by an intricate stitch in the embroidery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The silent pool is a very romantic spot, do you not think so, <i>mon
      cousin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know so little about romance, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woods will teach you, <i>mon cousin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent and I often wander in the woods&mdash;don&rsquo;t we, Laurent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent, sitting on the edge of the stone balustrade, with his arms folded
    over his chest and a sinister scowl upon his face, did not vouchsafe an answer
    to the direct query.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have been as far as the silent pool,&rdquo; continued Fernande
    unconcernedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a short walk from Courson,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A very long one, I think ... over six kilom&egrave;tres.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over six kilom&egrave;tres.... Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore, we have never been further than the pool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet another pause. Madame la Marquise had resumed her knitting. M. de Courson
    tried not to appear ill at ease, and Laurent, whose exasperation became more
    and more obvious every moment, jumped down from the balustrade and began
    pacing up and down the veranda, hoping thereby to keep his nerves under control.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But from the distance I have seen the smoke of your foundries, <i>mon
      cousin</i>,&rdquo;  again resumed Fernande, wholly unperturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;!!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have never seen the interior of a foundry in my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not a romantic sight, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, que si, mon cousin!</i>&rdquo; she retorted with sudden seriousness. &ldquo;There
    is nothing more romantic than to see a man toiling with his body and with
    his brain, using his intelligence and the power which his mind has given
    him, in order to overcome the many difficulties which God has laid in his
    path, in face of the great natural advantages which He has assigned to His
    brute creation. And then to see hundreds of men all working together in the
    same way and for the same end&mdash;working in order to wrest from Nature
    her manifold secrets and enchain them in the service of Man. Oh, it must,
    indeed, be a very inspiring sight, and one I would dearly love to see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had spoken with an air of quaint earnestness which became the spiritual
    aspect of her personality to perfection. De Maurel had listened to her with
    grave intentness, his brows knit together as if he was afraid to miss some
    hidden meaning in her words. Laurent, on the other hand, had found it difficult
    to contain himself while she delivered herself of her somewhat pompous little
    speech. Now before his brother could reply he broke in with a harsh laugh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An inspiring sight, mayhap, but also a mightily unpleasant smell.
    Smoke, grime, dirt,&rdquo; he added tartly, &ldquo;mingled with perspiring
    humanity, make up a sum total of unpleasant odours which you, Fernande, would
    be the first to resent if my brother Ronnay were so foolish as to accede
    to your whim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must leave me to judge, my dear Laurent,&rdquo; retorted Fernande,
    with one of her demure little pouts, &ldquo;as to what I would resent and
    what not. Well, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she added once more, turning to
    de Maurel, &ldquo;you hear what Laurent says. Are you going to be sufficiently
    foolish to gratify my curiosity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, do not appeal to Ronnay, dear cousin,&rdquo; rejoined the young
    man testily. &ldquo;He hath no liking for women&rsquo;s company. Rumour hath
    it that the foundries are encircled by a wall beyond which no feminine foot
    hath ever trod, and anxious wives are not even allowed to bring hard-working
    husbands their dinner. &rsquo;Tis said that all the jail-birds in France
    are employed in forging cannon and manufacturing gunpowder, and that the
    overseers have to stand over them with flails and loaded muskets, for fear
    that the spirit of insubordination which is always rampant should break into
    open riot, and the foundries of La Frontenay be blown up sky-high by rebellious
    hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Maurel had waited with outward patience and in his own calm somewhat
    sullen way until his young brother had come to an end with his tirade; then
    he interposed curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rumour hath lied as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot deny, anyhow,&rdquo; retorted Laurent, &ldquo;that all
    the deserters out of the army are made to slave in your factories.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are not enough deserters in the armies of France to keep a
    single foundry going,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel simply. &ldquo;But these
    days, when foreign enemies threaten the country on every side, we cannot
    afford to keep even jail-birds idle. So we employ them in the powder factory,
    where the work is hard and full of danger, and where accidents, alas! are
    frequent. But the pay is good, and men who have a crime upon their conscience
    can redeem their past by toiling for their country, who hath need of their
    brain and of their muscle. Many pass out of the workshops into the army,
    and the Emperor had no finer soldiers than a company of our jail-birds, as
    you call them, who fought under my command at Austerlitz.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, for, as usual, every reference to the army and to his Emperor,
    whom he worshipped, was apt to stir his blood, so that his words became less
    sober and less measured. And he had come here this afternoon with the firm
    determination not to lose control over himself as he had done the other day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle Fernande desires to see the foundry,&rdquo; he said
    quite quietly after a while, &ldquo;I will accompany her and show her all
    that there is to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If accidents in your works are frequent, my good Ronnay,&rdquo; rejoined
    Laurent, who was vainly trying to conceal the irritability of his nerves, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
    obviously not fit that our cousin should visit them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not take her there where there is any danger,&rdquo; retorted
    de Maurel curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is always danger for a refined woman in the propinquity of
    men who have been nurtured in class-hatred. The sight of a delicate and aristocratic
    girl is like to rouse the same resentment in your jail-birds that led to
    the atrocities of the Revolution. Fernande would certainly run the risk of
    insults, if not worse. I for one marvel at you, my dear brother, that you
    should think of exposing our cousin to the danger of hearing the blasphemous
    and obscene language which I am told is the only one spoken inside the foundries
    of La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is neither blasphemous nor obscene language spoken inside my
    workshops when I am present. If Mademoiselle Fernande deigns to entrust herself
    to my guidance, I&rsquo;ll pledge mine honour that she shall neither hear
    nor see a single thing that may offend her eyes or her ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, indeed, <i>mon cousin</i>, I am over-ready ...&rdquo; began
    Fernande, when Madame la Marquise interposed in her wonted decisive way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Here are you young people discussing
    projects which obviously cannot be put into execution without the consent
    of your elders. &rsquo;Tis I and my brother who alone can decide whether
    Fernande might go to visit the foundry or not. Nor hath M. le Comte Gaston
    been consulted as to his wishes in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My uncle would raise no objections,&rdquo; said Ronnay moodily. &ldquo;The
    inspection of the foundry is open to the public....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a case of objections, my son,&rdquo; rejoined Madame
    with quiet condescension; &ldquo;nor is your cousin Fernande to be classed
    among the public to whom casual permission might thus be given.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Maurel frowned and that old look of churlish obstinacy once more crept
    into his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  &rsquo;tis simple enough, my good de Maurel,&rdquo; interposed
    M. de Courson in his turn. &ldquo;There are certain usages of good society
    which forbid a young girl to go about alone in the company of a man other
    than her father or her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely you knew that?&rdquo; queried Laurent ironically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; replied de Maurel curtly. &ldquo;Why should
    not Mademoiselle Fernande come with me to visit my foundries, if she desires
    to see them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because ... because ...&rdquo; said Madame somewhat haltingly, obviously
    at a loss how to explain to this unsophisticated rustic the manners and usages
    of good society.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would see that she came to no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure of that, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; quoth Fernande with
    a little sigh and a glance of complete understanding directed at de Maurel. &ldquo;I
    should feel perfectly safe in your company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;  exclaimed Laurent hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, you see?&rdquo; she said, with a shrug of her pretty shoulders. &ldquo;<i>La
      jeune fille</i> is a regular slave to a multiplicity of senseless conventions.
      Do not argue about it, <i>mon cousin</i>, it is quite useless. <i>Ma tante</i> will
      hurl the proprieties at your head till she has made you feel that you are
      a dangerous Don Juan, and unfit to be left alone in the company of an innocent
      young girl like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;  This time the exclamation came from Madame la Marquise,
    and it was uttered in a tone of stern reproach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thousand pardons, <i>ma tante</i>! please call my words unsaid.
    And you, <i>mon cousin</i>, I entreat take no heed of the sighings of a young
    captive chafing against her fetters. Indeed, I am a very happy slave and
    only resent my chain on rare occasions, when it is pulled more tightly than
    suits my fancy. Otherwise my gaolers are passing lenient, and I am given
    plenty of liberty, so long as I indulge in it alone; and when in the early
    morning I take my favourite walks in the woods, I am even allowed to wander
    as far as the silent pool and listen to the pigeons of St. Front, unattended
    by a chaperone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande, while she spoke, appeared deeply engrossed in disentangling a
    knot in her embroidery silk; this, no doubt, accounted for the fact that
    her words came somewhat jerkily, and with what seemed like deliberate slowness
    and emphasis. Laurent, lost in the whirl of his own jealousy, watched her
    less keenly than he was wont to do. Certainly he did not notice the glance
    which accompanied those words&mdash;a glance which de Maurel, on the other
    hand, did not fail to catch. It was directed at him, and was accompanied
    by an enigmatical little smile which he was not slow to interpret&mdash;so
    much guile had a pair of blue eyes already poured into the soul of this unsophisticated
    barbarian! Twenty-four hours ago he would have been intolerant of a young
    woman&rsquo;s diatribe on the subject of conventions, with which he had neither
    sympathy nor patience; to-day he heard in it certain tones which for him
    were full of meaning and of a vague promise.</p>
  <p>The feeling, too, that this exquisite creature took him, as it were, into
    her confidence, that she implied&mdash;by that one glance of her blue eyes&mdash;that
    a secret understanding existed between her and him, was one that filled him
    with an extraordinary sense of happiness&mdash;of detachment from everything
    else around him&mdash;of walking on air, and of seeing the blue ether above
    him, open to show him a vision of intoxicating bliss.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>The minutes after that went by leaden-footed. Ronnay de Maurel was longing
    to take his leave, to ride home as fast as he could, and in the privacy of
    his bare, uncomfortable room to think over every minute of this eventful
    day, and to anticipate as patiently as possible the hour when it might reasonably
    be supposed that an angel would take its morning walk abroad. Madame la Marquise
    made great efforts to keep the ball of conversation rolling pleasantly; but
    she found it difficult owing to the fact that de Maurel scarcely opened his
    lips again. Fernande, too, had become silent and tantalizingly demure. Her
    aunt thought that she was sulking owing to the veto put upon the proposed
    visit to the foundries. Madame would have wished to reopen that subject,
    for, of a truth, she would not have been altogether averse to going over
    to La Frontenay or La Vieuville, or even to bearding old Gaston de Maurel
    in his own lair; but Ronnay, after his one suggestion that he would take
    Fernande over the works, did not again renew his offer. Laurent, too, had
    become indescribably morose, and for once in her life Madame found it in
    her heart to be actually angry with her beloved son. Obviously the rapprochement
    with the de Maurels would be impossible if Laurent remained so persistently
    on the brink of a quarrel with his brother.</p>
  <p>Though after a while Annette brought wine and biscuits on a tray, and M.
    de Courson and Madame la Marquise performed miracles of patience in trying
    to remain genial, the atmosphere became more and more constrained every moment.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, after a while de Maurel appeared quite as eager to go as was
    his mother to be rid of him. He rose to take his leave, and beyond making
    a clumsy bow in the direction where Fernande was sitting, silent and industrious,
    he took no more intimate farewell of her than he did of the others. This
    had the effect of allaying in a slight measure Laurent&rsquo;s irritation.
    He even unbent to the extent of accompanying his brother to the gates of
    the ch&acirc;teau, an act of courtesy in which M. de Courson also joined.</p>
  <p>But the moment that de Maurel&rsquo;s back was turned, and the steps of
    the three men had ceased to echo through the house, Fernande threw down her
    work and ran over to her aunt. She stood before the older woman, holding
    herself very erect, her little head held up with a remarkable air of dignity,
    her hands clasped behind her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>, tell me,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;for, of
    a truth, I have become confused&mdash;which of the two things in life do
    you prize the most&mdash;the cause of our King or the fetish of social conventions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  retorted Madame sternly, &ldquo;meseems that for
    the past day or two you have taken leave of your senses. I will not be questioned
    in this fashion by a childlike you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; broke in the young girl solemnly, &ldquo;I
    entreat you to believe that I am asking no idle question. I beg of you most
    earnestly to answer the question which I have put to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The question hath no need of answer. It is answered already. And
    you, Fernande, are impertinent to put the question to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, <i>ma tante</i>, I ask it in all seriousness, and I
    beg for an answer in the name of the cause which we all hold dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you put it that way, child,&rdquo; rejoined Madame coldly, &ldquo;I
    cannot help but reply: you are foolish and impertinent, and I almost feel
    bemeaned by pandering to your foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; pleaded Fernande insistently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it you want me to say, <i>enfin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me plainly and simply, <i>ma tante</i>, which you prize most:
    a few hollow conventions or the success of our arms in the cause of our King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, child! of course you know that I prize the cause of our King
    above all else on earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are ready to make any sacrifice for its success?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I am! What nonsense has got into that childish head of
    yours, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One moment, <i>ma tante</i>. Tell me one thing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In your opinion, do you think that every one of us should be ready
    for any sacrifice that might help to further the cause of our King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, child. I trust you are prepared to make whatever sacrifice
    the cause of the King may demand from you. I know that your father is more
    than prepared, and so is Laurent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so am I, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; said Fernande firmly. &ldquo;Therefore,
    one day soon I&rsquo;ll go to meet M. de Maurel in the woods of La Frontenay,
    and together we&rsquo;ll visit the Maurel foundries&mdash;all in the name
    of the King, <i>ma tante</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    The Cooing Of The Pigeons</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>But it was close on a fortnight before Ronnay de Maurel saw Fernande again.
    He went every morning to the silent pool, soon after break of day, and every
    morning he waited for her until the sun was high in the heavens, and he was
    obliged to go back to his work. He spent his time in gazing into the pool
    or listening to the murmur of the woods. He knew the note of every bird,
    he knew where each tiny couple had built its nest; he watched the crimson
    tips of the young chestnut unfold and turn to bronze and then to green; he
    read every morning in the book which God hath laid out in springtime for
    every one of His creatures to read. He also spent a considerable amount of
    time in gazing at a silk stocking and a tiny sandal shoe, which happily he
    thought Fernande had forgotten to claim. He would draw these treasures from
    out the breast pocket of his blouse and hold them in his hands and toy with
    them, and gaze till a mist would come to his eyes and a curious, impatient
    sigh would come through his parted lips.</p>
  <p>But he never tired while he lay in wait for the beautiful fairy-like creature
    who had so graciously intimated to him that one day she would come. It never
    occurred to him to give up waiting for her; that was not his nature. The
    same dogged obstinacy of the de Maurels, which had driven Denise de Courson
    well-nigh distraught, brought Ronnay daily to the spot where he knew that
    he must one day meet Fernande.</p>
  <p>Often he would wax impatient and at times anxious, but never weary; nor
    did he ever lose hope. He would grow anxious when two days went by and he
    could glean no news of her; then perhaps that self-same afternoon he would
    tramp over after work as far as Courson and hear from one or other of the
    villagers that they had seen Mademoiselle walking to church or in the orchard,
    or else, mayhap, he himself would catch a glimpse of her through the gates
    of the park or in the carriole of P&egrave;re Lebrun, and he would go home
    satisfied.</p>
  <p>And he would wax impatient when the sun was specially bright overhead and
    glinted through the trees till every tender fibre of moss looked like a tiny
    emerald, and the wings of the dragon-flies glistened with myriads of iridescent
    colours as they skimmed the surface of the pool. Then he would long for Fernande
    with a longing which was akin to physical pain; he longed to point out to
    her the play of the sun upon the tender leaves of the alder, and show her
    just where the white-throats had built their nest.</p>
  <p>Then one day the sun rose behind a veil of rain-clouds, and all morning
    the sky was overcast. It had rained heavily during the night, and a boisterous
    wind stirred the branches of the trees and shook down from them the cold
    showers of raindrops that had lingered on the leaves. De Maurel had started
    out later than usual. He had no hope of meeting Fernande on such a grey day,
    when the clouds overhead still threatened and no gleam of sunshine came to
    cheer.</p>
  <p>Yet this was the very day which she had selected for her walk in the wood.
    He saw her the moment he reached the clearing. She was moving slowly between
    the trees towards the pool. She had thrown a shawl over her shoulders and
    a hood over her hair; from between its folds her fair young face peeped out
    somewhat sober and demure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Directly she saw him she gave a little cry of surprise and held out her
    hand to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strange to meet again, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said
    lightly, &ldquo;and on such a day as this. Brr!&rdquo; she added, with a
    little shiver as with the other hand she drew the shawl more closely round
    her shoulders, &ldquo;I am perished with cold. It seems more like December
    than May.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She noticed, with a little smile of satisfaction, that he was not slow this
    time in taking her hand, or clumsy in raising it to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From what you said, Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he said in his
    abrupt way, &ldquo;I knew that you would come one morning. Was I like to
    stay away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From what I said?&rdquo; she retorted with perfect surprise. &ldquo;Why!
    What did I say, <i>mon cousin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His direct and searching look brought a hot flush to her cheeks. Yet she
    did not know why she should blush, and was greatly angered with herself for
    letting him see that she was, of a truth, covered with confusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i> gave me leave to visit the foundries of La Frontenay,&rdquo; she
    said, with a quaint assumption of dignity, &ldquo;so I came this morning,
    thinking, mayhap, that you would remember your promise to conduct me round
    the workshops ... and that perchance I might meet you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came here every morning for the past fortnight,&rdquo; he rejoined
    simply. &ldquo;I hoped that you would come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to wait,&rdquo; she said unblushingly, &ldquo;till <i>ma tante</i> gave
    me leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I loved the idea of meeting you here ... in secret ... unknown to
    any one....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For some reason which she could not have accounted for, this&mdash;his first
    really bold speech&mdash;angered her, and she retorted coldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would not have come at all, if Laurent had not approved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! It was Laurent then who gave you leave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she replied, &ldquo;it was Laurent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somehow she felt strangely out of tune this morning, and wished heartily
    that she had not come. For one thing, she hated to see him in that odious
    blouse which he wore; it seemed to have the effect of making him, not only
    clumsy and loutish, but dictatorial and arrogant. The other afternoon, when
    he came to Courson, she had thought him passable&mdash;in a rough and picturesque
    way. The faded and tarnished uniform had lent, she grudgingly admitted, a
    certain look of grandeur to his fine physique. To-day he looked positively
    ugly&mdash;one of &ldquo;the great unwashed,&rdquo; she thought, and despised
    him for a demagogue&mdash;he who bore one of the finest names in France.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you prepared to come to the foundry this morning?&rdquo; he asked
    abruptly.</p>
  <p>For the moment she had a mind to say &ldquo;No!&rdquo; then remembered her
    folk at home and the boast she had made about taming this bear. It would
    have been passing foolish to give up the enterprise at the first check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she said, as graciously as she felt
    able.</p>
  <p>He, too, felt the constraint which seemed to stand like a solid wall between
    her and him, and in his rough, untutored way he was seized with a sudden,
    wild desire to pick her up again, as he had done that other morning a fortnight
    ago, and to carry her through the woods which were dripping wet with the
    rain. He wanted to carry her through the tangled undergrowth, so that her
    little feet brushed against the low branches of the trees, and caused them
    to send down a shower of cool drops over his head, which felt hot and aching
    all of a sudden, as if some unseen and heavy hand had dealt him a blow between
    the eyes.</p>
  <p>The exquisite fairy of two sennights ago looked like a haughty and unapproachable
    woman to-day, sedate and grave, with that dark shawl folded primly round
    her shoulders, and the folds of her hood hiding her golden hair and casting
    a shadow over her limpid blue eyes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not give me your arm, <i>mon cousin</i>?&rdquo; she asked
    after a while, just as he was beginning to wonder whether he would not turn
    on his heel and run away as the simplest way out of his present misery. He
    looked at her&mdash;puzzled at the sudden graciousness of her mood, and then
    he encountered her blue eyes, from whence all sternness had vanished as swiftly
    as does a snowflake under the warm kiss of the sun. He held out his arm and
    she placed her hand on it.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>For a brief moment their eyes met, with strange, inward questioning on both
    sides. Even she&mdash;Fernande&mdash;with all her hatred, all her contempt
    for this traitor to his King, this enemy to his kindred and his caste, could
    not help but feel that here was no ordinary man with whose passions and whose
    feelings she could toy with impunity. That subtle intuition which comes to
    every woman even before she has stepped over the threshold of childhood,
    had told her before now that Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s rough and unbridled
    nature had already been stirred to its depths by her beauty, and that he
    loved her at this moment with a love all the more ardent that he himself
    was as yet scarce conscious of its glow.</p>
  <p>A sense of triumph chased all other thoughts from her mind. She had it in
    her power&mdash;she, Fernande de Courson, who had seen kindred, friends,
    her own father, driven to poverty and exile by the brutal excesses of these
    democrats&mdash;she had it in her power to bring this protagonist of those
    revolutionary ideals to humiliation and suffering. Not one spark of pity
    did she feel for the man who was doomed to suffer for her sake. That he would
    suffer&mdash;keenly, grievously&mdash;was plainly writ in those deep-set
    eyes of his which, she now noticed for the first time, were of that mysterious
    violet colour which reveals a passionate soul. It was writ, too, on that
    sensitive mouth round which the lines of pleasure and of pain were wont to
    chase one another so swiftly. Yes, he would suffer and at her hands&mdash;suffer
    quite as much, mayhap, as her father had suffered when he had to flee from
    his home at dead of night, leaving his one motherless baby to the care of
    a sister as helpless, as homeless as himself. He would suffer less, at any
    rate, than did the martyred Queen, when her royal husband was torn brutally
    from her arms by that revolutionary mob whose ideals Ronnay de Maurel would
    uphold.</p>
  <p>It was, indeed, the law of reprisals which was pursuing its course with
    ruthless impartiality, and Fernande, with the fire of an ardent patriotism
    filling her entire soul, could not find a spark of pity for the enemy of
    her cause. She hated him as she never thought that she had it in her to hate
    any man; she longed for that freedom of thought and of action when she need
    no longer dissemble, when she need not endure the look of boundless admiration
    wherewith he dared to envelop her as with a caress, and when she could tell
    him to his face, the utter contempt, the hopeless loathing wherewith he inspired
    her.</p>
  <p>The intensity of her feelings at the moment literally swept her off her
    feet. Her heart was so full that tears of self-pity welled up to her eyes;
    and he, seeing her tears, was clumsy enough to misinterpret them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he said, with a soft tone of entreaty
    in his rugged voice, &ldquo;meseems that you are sad to-day. Will you not
    tell me if aught hath angered you, or caused you distress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as she made no reply&mdash;for, of a truth, she felt that the next
    words which she uttered would choke her&mdash;he added more gruffly: &ldquo;Will
    you believe me, I wonder, when I say that I would give my life to save you
    a moment&rsquo;s pain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She would have liked to withdraw her hand from his arm, for she was afraid
    that he would perceive how it trembled. But he held her close, and she felt
    too numbed to struggle. But he&mdash;poor wretch!&mdash;once again felt that
    wild, mad longing to pick her off the ground, and to carry her away&mdash;away
    out of this world of sordid quarrels and of strife, away to a land of which
    his ignorant, uneducated soul had only vaguely dreamed&mdash;a land where
    the trees were always of a tender green, wherein the mating birds sang a
    never-ending anthem&mdash;a land where there were no tears, no clouds, and
    wherein the sunlight danced for ever on the golden tendrils of her hair and
    the flower-like tips of her toes ... away to a lonely spot where only fairies
    and angels dwelt, and where he could lay her down on a bed of dewy moss and
    kiss away the tears that hung upon her lashes ... one by one.</p>
  <p>And as with a sigh that came from the depths of his overfull heart, he made
    a motion to lead her away from this enchanted spot, wherein he had tasted
    the first bitter-sweet fruit of unending love, it seemed to him that from
    out the limpid mirror of the silent pool there came a call as of many living,
    breathing creatures in pain. The call rose and fell as if on the unseen bosom
    of gently lapping water, and overhead the tender branches of birch and chestnut
    whispered softly to one another, stirred by a newly-awakened breeze. Fernande,
    too, had paused&mdash;she, too, evidently had heard, for she turned inquiring,
    almost frightened eyes up at de Maurel. The call was so like the cooing of
    innumerable wood-pigeons&mdash;mournful, soul-stirring, and with a tender
    wail in it that spoke of sorrow, of heart-ache and of farewells.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The pigeons of St. Front!&rdquo; she murmured under her breath.</p>
  <p>For a moment both stood still, until the melancholy plaint was wafted away
    on the wings of the wind. A strange feeling of awe had descended upon them.
    It seemed as if the Fates sitting in their eyrie far away had taken up the
    threads of their destiny, and were weaving and weaving, until their spindles
    came into a tangle which nothing but godlike hands could ever straighten
    out again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was fancy, of course,&rdquo; said de Maurel after a while, seeing
    that Fernande had turned very white and that she clung with a pathetic unspoken
    appeal for support to his arm. &ldquo;I have often heard this melancholy
    call when the wind stirred among the trees. &rsquo;Tis no wonder the poor
    folk of the country-side fly from this place in terror! There is something
    spectral in the sound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; murmured Fernande, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
    believe in the pigeons of St. Front?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is there to believe in such an ancient legend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the cooing of the pigeons foretells disaster to those that hear
    it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he replied decisively. &ldquo;I do not believe it in
    this case, Mademoiselle Fernande. The world would be topsy-turvy, indeed,
    and God asleep in the heavens, if disaster were to overtake so perfect a
    creature as you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She broke into a low, little laugh, which to a more sophisticated ear would
    have sounded mirthless and forced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you attribute to the
    world certain desires for my welfare which, of a truth, scarcely concern
    it, and God, I imagine, when He endowed us with free-will, left us to be
    the architects of our own destiny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With an overseer, mayhap,&rdquo; he added with earnest significance, &ldquo;to
    watch over the safety of the building.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She chose to misinterpret his meaning and not to see the look which accompanied
    his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it not time we went to the foundry?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>The spell was broken. Fernande de Courson became the self-possessed young
    woman of the world once more, and Ronnay de Maurel the clumsy rustic, who
    is greatly honoured by the condescension of a great lady infinitely above
    him in station. They turned away from the pool, which seemed more absolutely
    silent now that the cooing of the pigeons had been merged in the ceaseless
    murmurings of the woods. Fernande leaned on Ronnay&rsquo;s arm, and he guided
    her along the paths and through the clearings, walking silently by her side.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When they reached the open, he pointed to the left where the main country
    road wound its smooth ribbon at the foot of the distant hills. Here a small
    one-horsed vehicle was standing, some few metres away from the edge of the
    wood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is another five or six kilom&egrave;tres to the foundries from
    here, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so every morning, always hoping
    that you would come, I ventured to order a carriole to await you here; one
    of our men will drive you by the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande was conscious of a slight feeling of vexation. &ldquo;But you, <i>mon
      cousin</i>?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I walk across the fields,&rdquo; he replied curtly, &ldquo;they are
    ploughed and ankle-deep in mud; but I will be at the foundry in time to await
    your coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had it on the tip of her tongue to demand that he should sit beside
    her in the carriole, or to insist on walking across the ploughed fields with
    him, but her pride would not permit her to do either. Perhaps, also, she
    thought that having been intermittently out of tune in the woods, an hour&rsquo;s
    jolting in a rickety carriole would shake away the cobwebs that clung persistently
    round her mood. The carriole proved to be of very modern build, high and
    comfortable; a perfect English cob&mdash;priceless in value these days&mdash;was
    in the shafts, looking a picture of gloss and experienced grooming. A young
    man in sombre livery coat sat with the reins in his hand.</p>
  <p>De Maurel lifted Fernande into the vehicle, then stood by, giving a comprehensive
    glance to the turn-out with an obviously experienced and critical eye. Then,
    as the driver gave a click of the tongue and the cob started off at a smart
    trot, he turned brusquely on his heel, and Fernande for a long time could
    see his tall figure making its way, with its peculiar, halting gait, across
    the ploughed fields, till a group of trees that marked a homestead hid him
    from her view.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter &nbsp;10<br>
    The Foundries Of La Frontenay</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>It was a strange experience for Fernande to see Ronnay de Maurel in the
    midst of the men who worked under his orders. Outwardly&mdash;by dress and
    appearance&mdash;one of themselves, there was obviously an inward force and
    authority in him which the workers readily recognized. Somehow her visit
    to the foundries discouraged and disappointed her. Not that Ronnay was in
    any way less under her sway than he had been in the romantic atmosphere of
    the woods. On the contrary, every time that her eyes met his, she read in
    them more and more clearly the progress which his passion for her was making
    in the subjugation of his will-power and of his senses; and every time that
    in the course of his demonstrations to her, of the various processes which
    went to the making of the &ldquo;mouths of fire,&rdquo; his hand came in
    contact with hers, she could feel the tremor which went through him at her
    touch.</p>
  <p>No, indeed! she had no cause to think that the untamed bear would not be
    ready to dance the moment she began to pipe; but here, in the foundries where
    he ruled as lord and master, where thousands of men obeyed at a word or sign
    from him, she first realized that between enslaving a man like de Maurel,
    through his passions or his sensibilities, to the chariot wheel of her beauty,
    and gaining a real mastery over his thoughts and actions, there was the immeasurable
    gulf of ingrained convictions and of the fetish of intellectual freedom.</p>
  <p>That de Maurel was the real master in the foundries of La Frontenay Fernande
    could not doubt for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes and ears open, child,&rdquo; Madame la Marquise had
    said to her, when she at last expressed reluctant approval of her niece&rsquo;s
    plan to visit the ogre in his lair. &ldquo;We hear many rumours of discontent
    at the works&mdash;of insubordination&mdash;of open revolt. It would serve
    an abominable democrat like my son Ronnay right, if the proletariat which
    he upholds against his own traditions and his own caste were to turn against
    him now as they turned against us in &rsquo;89. Keep your eyes and ears open,
    Fernande; the discontent of which we hear may prove a splendid card in our
    hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande had not altogether understood what Madame la Marquise was driving
    at.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of what use can discontent among M. de Maurel&rsquo;s workmen be
    to us?&rdquo; she had asked, wondering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If they were to turn against their master, my dear,&rdquo; quoth
    Madame dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And rally round to us....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it likely, <i>ma tante</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More than likely. Laurent and your father and I have a plan ...&rdquo; said
    Madame with some hesitation; &ldquo;we have put it before de Puisaye and
    our other leaders.... I can&rsquo;t speak of it just yet, child,&rdquo; she
    added somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;but it is most important that you should
    keep your eyes and ears open to-day. We must reckon, remember, that King
    Mob, in whose name these execrable revolutionists have murdered their King
    and hundreds of innocent men, women and children, has felt the power of his
    own will. He has tasted the sweets of open revolt against constituted authority,
    and he has been given a free hand to murder, to pillage and to outrage. He
    is not likely to be so easily curbed again; he will rebel as he has rebelled
    before. His so-called Emperor has placed an iron heel upon his neck ... and
    Ronnay de Maurel and his like think that they can quench the flame of lawlessness
    which they themselves have kindled. Bah! methinks that it is King Mob who
    will avenge us all one day, by turning against the hands that first led him
    to strike against imaginary tyrants, and then forged the chains that made
    a slave of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Fernande de Courson, as she wandered through the workshops of La Frontenay,
    thought of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s impassioned tirade. How little revolt
    was there in these ordered places wherein men toiled and sweated in order
    that the Emperor might have all the cannons and powder he wanted wherewith
    to conquer the enemies of France! Here were no murmurings, no rebellion over
    authority; every man knew, as de Maurel passed him by and gave a look to
    the work in hand, that here was the master whose word and will must be law
    if all the toil, the patriotism, the enthusiasm which went to the making
    of these &ldquo;mouths of fire&rdquo;  were to prove useful to the State.</p>
  <p>The place was not picturesque. It was not inviting. The men, stripped to
    the waist, were covered with grime. But on their bearded faces they wore
    the same look of energy and of determination which glowed in the eyes of
    the soldiers who followed the young General Bonaparte over the Alps and across
    the Danube, through the snows of Poland and the sands of the desert from
    victory to victory. There was the same spirit&mdash;of that there could be
    no doubt&mdash;which had roused the whole nation to defend itself against
    the foreigners&mdash;the same spirit that made every man, woman and child,
    who could not fight the foe, toil in order to help subjugate him.</p>
  <p>That de Maurel understood how to deal with the men was equally obvious.
    They evidently looked up to and trusted him, and Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s
    dream of seeing the proletariat turn against the hands that fed it would
    certainly not come true at La Frontenay.</p>
  <p>Not that every cog-wheel of the gigantic machinery worked with equal smoothness.
    Though, for the most part, de Maurel&rsquo;s progress through his workshops
    was accompanied by looks of deference and at times of genuine affection and
    gratitude, there were murmurings, too. More than once Fernande caught the
    drift of a muttered complaint: &ldquo;The heaviness of the toil, the unhealthy
    conditions, the dearness of food at home.&rdquo; De Maurel, however, had
    only one answer for all and sundry: &ldquo;France,&rdquo;  he said, and his
    ringing voice sounded above the din of hammers and heavy tools, above the
    roar of furnaces and bellows, &ldquo;France has her back up against the wall,
    my men! the whole of Europe is up in arms against her! every one of her sons
    must either fight or toil till victory is assured. After that ... well ...
    toil will be less hard ... life more healthy ... food less dear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife and children have not tasted meat for a month,&rdquo; retorted
    one man moodily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not tasted any for half a year,&rdquo; was de Maurel&rsquo;s
    cheerful reply. &ldquo;My uncle and I up at La Vieuville live as you do down
    here; we toil as you do, suffer as much as you. When the Emperor hath brought
    the Prussian to his knees and compelled Austria to sue for peace, we&rsquo;ll
    all feast together ... and not before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis dog&rsquo;s work sweating in front of these furnaces all
    the day ...&rdquo; growled another man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Try sweating in front of the Prussian cannon, <i>mon ami</i>,&rdquo; retorted &ldquo;the
    General,&rdquo; with a careless shrug of his broad shoulders.</p>
  <p>He passed on and in his wake the murmurings somehow died down. He had a
    way with him, and he was so full of energy and breathed vitality from every
    pore to such a degree, that instinctively toil appeared lighter, and it seemed
    a humiliation to grumble.</p>
  <p>It was only in the powder factory that the tempers of the men appeared of
    a different mettle.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The factory stood some little way from the smelting works. It was surrounded
    by a high wall, and its numerous sheds and imposing magazine, surmounted
    by a clock-tower, nestled at the foot of the hills some distance back from
    the road.</p>
  <p>Mathurin, the chief overseer&mdash;a burly giant, who followed de Maurel&rsquo;s
    every movement with the look of a faithful watchdog&mdash;ventured to lay
    a restraining hand on his master&rsquo;s arm when he was told to lead the
    way to that more risky and dangerous portion of the great armament works.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux,&rdquo;  he said, and there was a tone of anxiety in his gruff
    voice, &ldquo;is in one of his most surly moods. He has given a deal of trouble
    lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the more reason why I should speak with him,&rdquo; retorted
    de Maurel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the lady, <i>mon g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Mathurin,
    as he indicated Fernande.</p>
  <p>De Maurel turned to the young girl. &ldquo;Would you care to wait, Mademoiselle
    Fernande,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;till I have spoken to the recalcitrants?
    Mathurin will make you comfortable in his office....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said boldly, with a toss of her
    pretty head, &ldquo;are you thinking that I am afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed not, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he rejoined; &ldquo;nor would I
    allow you to enter the factory if there was the slightest cause for anxiety.
    But the men in there are rough; they are,&rdquo; he added with a harsh laugh, &ldquo;the
    jail-birds for whom my brother Laurent hath such great contempt. They rebel
    against their work&mdash;and it is hard and dangerous work, I own&mdash;but
    the State hath need of it, and ... well, someone has to do it. But, of course,
    some of them hate their taskmaster, and I for one cannot altogether blame
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo;  queried Fernande, &ldquo;do they hate you, <i>mon cousin</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied with a smile; &ldquo;I am the taskmaster.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But ... in that case ...&rdquo; she hazarded, somewhat timidly this
    time, &ldquo;are you not exposing yourself to unnecessary danger by....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She hesitated, then paused abruptly, as he broke in with a loud laugh. &ldquo;Danger!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed. &ldquo;I? In my own workshops? Why, I fought at Austerlitz, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She said nothing more, for already she was ashamed of her sudden access
    of sensibility. Mathurin, once more ordered to lead the way to the factory,
    obeyed in silence.</p>
  <p>No doubt that here the men wore a sullen and glowering aspect which had
    been wholly absent in the foundries. The risky nature of the work, when the
    slightest inattention or carelessness might cause the most terrible accident,
    the rank smell of the black carbon, of the saltpetre and sulphur, together
    with the dirt and the mud and the weight of the mortars, all seemed to produce
    an ill-effect upon the tempers of the men, and as de Maurel entered the first
    and most important workshed, the looks which greeted him and which swept
    over Fernande were furtive, if not openly hostile.</p>
  <p>It was clear that muttered discontent was in the air, and as de Maurel went
    from one group to another of the workers, and either praised or criticized
    what was done, murmurings were only suppressed by the awe which his personality
    obviously inspired. Mathurin stuck close to his heels, and the look of faithful
    watch-dog became more marked on his large, ruddy face.</p>
  <p>A word of severe blame from the master for grave contravention of rules
    set the spark to the smouldering fire of discontent. A short, thick-set man,
    with tousled red hair and tawny beard, on whom the blame had fallen, threw
    down his tool at de Maurel&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blame? Blame?&rdquo; he snarled, showing his yellow teeth like an
    ill-conditioned cur, &ldquo;nothing but blame in this place of malediction.
    Are we beasts that we should be made to work and risk our lives for a tyranny
    that would make a slave of every free citizen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon become a beast, <i>mon ami</i>,&rdquo; retorted
    de Maurel coolly, &ldquo;if you refuse to work; a useless beast and a burden
    to the State, fit only to be cast into a ditch, or thrown as food for foreign
    cannon. Pick up your tool and show that you are a man and a free citizen
    by doing your duty for France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not another stroke will I do,&rdquo; growled Leroux sullenly, &ldquo;till
    I&rsquo;ve eaten and drunk my fill, which I&rsquo;ve not done these past
    twenty days. Not another stroke, do you hear? And if I lift that accursed
    tool again it will be to crack your skull with it! Do you hear, <i>mon G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>?
    I am under one sentence for murder already&mdash;another cannot do me much
    more harm. So look to yourself&mdash;what? for not another stroke of work
    will I do ... <i>Foi de</i> Paul Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then by all means go and eat and drink your fill, friend Leroux,&rdquo; rejoined
    de Maurel imperturbably; &ldquo;go, and wait as leisurely as you please for
    the hour when the Emperor&rsquo;s orders send you to join your battalion
    in Poland. Never another stroke of work will you do in this factory, <i>mon
    ami</i>, but &rsquo;tis the Russian cannons who will eat their fill of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned to the overseer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mathurin!&rdquo;  he called peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>mon G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give Leroux the money that is due to him. He is no longer in my employ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Name of a dog ...&rdquo; came with an ominous imprecation from Leroux, &ldquo;is
    this the way to treat an honest citizen?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no honest citizen, my man,&rdquo; spoke de Maurel firmly, &ldquo;save
    he who toils for France. Get you gone! Get you gone, I say! France has no
    use for slackers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll rue that, General, on my faith,&rdquo; here interposed
    one of Leroux&rsquo; mates in tones that held an overt threat. &ldquo;No
    one can finish this crushing save Leroux. If you dismiss him now, some of
    us go with him ... and the twelve hundred cannon-balls of this high calibre
    which the Emperor hath ordered will not be completed for want of a few skilled
    men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those of you who wish to go,&rdquo; retorted de Maurel loudly, &ldquo;can
    go hence at once, and to hell with the lot of you,&rdquo; he added, with
    a sudden outburst of contemptuous anger. &ldquo;Have I not said that France
    hath no use for slackers? You grumblers! you miserable, dissatisfied curs!
    Go an you wish! The workshop stinks of your treachery!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as some of the men, somewhat awed by his aspect and by the flame of
    unbridled wrath which shot from his glowing eyes, congregated in a little
    group of malcontents, egging one another on to more open revolt, he went
    close up to them, forcing the group to scatter before him, till he stood
    right in the midst of them, looking down from his great height on the skulking
    heads which were obstinately turned away from him and on the furtive glances
    which equally stubbornly avoided his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You miserable cowards!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Have you no entrails,
    no hearts, no mind? When the sons of France&mdash;her true sons&mdash;bleed
    and die on the fields of Prussia and in the mountains of Italy&mdash;sometimes
    unfed, always ill-clothed, under a grilling sun or in snowstorms and blizzards&mdash;dragging
    half-shattered limbs up the precipitous heights of the Alps, or falling uncared
    for, unattended and unshriven, into the nearest ditch&mdash;when your brothers
    and your sons die for France with a &lsquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur&rsquo; upon
    their lips, with the unsullied flag held victorious in their dying hands,
    you murmur here because food is dear and work heavy! To hell, I say! to hell!
    Give me that, tool, Mathurin. The Emperor shall not lack for gunpowder because
    a few traitors refuse to toil for France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Fernande, who watched this scene from a remote and dark angle of the
    workshop, to which she had crept on tiptoe, terrified lest her presence be
    noticed and considered an outrage in the midst of these turbulent quarrels&mdash;to
    Fernande, it seemed as if the whole personality of de Maurel had undergone
    an awesome change. There was something almost supernatural in that huge,
    massive figure with the proud head thrown back, the face lit up by the grey
    light which came through the skylight above.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly, with a quick, impatient gesture, he cast off his blouse and
    shirt and stood there in the midst of the sullen and threatening crowd&mdash;a
    workman among his kindred&mdash;a man amongst men; stripped to the waist
    as they were, with huge, powerful torso bare, and massive arms whereon the
    muscles stood out as if carved in stone, as he lifted from the floor the
    enormous iron pestle which Leroux had flung down, and wielded it as if it
    were a stick. And Fernande bethought herself of all the mythological heroes
    of old of which she had read as a child in her story-books; of men who were
    as strong and mighty as the gods; of those who defied Jupiter and Mars and
    dared to look into the sun, or to enslave the hidden forces of the earth
    to their will.</p>
  <p>For a while Leroux and the others looked on &ldquo;the General&rdquo; with
    shifty eyes wherein hatred and murder had kindled an ill-omened light. But
    in the mighty figure which towered above them there was not the slightest
    tremor of fear; in the commanding glance that met their own there was not
    a quiver and not the remotest sign of submission. The intrepid soldier, who
    at Austerlitz, bleeding, muddy, with leg shattered by a bullet, a sabre-slash
    across his forehead, a broken sword in his hand, had with two thousand men&mdash;some
    of them ex-jail-birds, as he said&mdash;held ten thousand Russians and their
    young Czar at bay, until the arrival of Rapp and his reinforcements, and
    then fell with shattered leg almost beneath the hoofs of the victorious cavalry
    still shouting: &ldquo;Vive la France!&rdquo;&mdash;he was not like to give
    in or to retreat before a few murderous threats from a sulky crowd of dissatisfied
    workmen. No, not though he knew that in the hip-pocket of more than one pair
    of breeches there was&mdash;always ready&mdash;the clasp-knife of the ex-jail-bird
    made to toil in the defence of the country which his crimes had outraged,
    and still at war with the authority which he had once defied. Rumour in this
    had not lied; it was with flails that some of these men were kept to their
    work&mdash;the flails of the mighty will-power of one man, of his burning
    patriotism and of his boundless energy. Even now his look of withering contempt,
    his open scorn of their threats, his appropriation of Leroux&rsquo; tool
    and the skill and strength wherewith he wielded it, whipped them like a lash.
    In a moment Leroux, the leader of the malcontents, found himself alone, a
    hang-dog expression in his face, hatred still lurking in his narrow eyes,
    but subdued and held in submission by a power which he could not attack save
    by the united will of his mates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish my work,&rdquo; he muttered after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do double shift at half-pay for ten days,&rdquo; said
    de Maurel, ere he handed him back his tool, &ldquo;and one month in the black
    carbon factory for insubordination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment it looked as if the men would rebel again. A murmur went round
    the workshop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another sound,&rdquo; said the General loudly and firmly, &ldquo;and
    I send the lot of you back to rot in jail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw Leroux&rsquo; tool down and quietly struggled back into his shirt
    and blouse. The incident was obviously closed. A minute or two later the
    men were back at their work, with renewed energy, perhaps, certainly in perfect
    silence and discipline. Mathurin, the overseer, shrugged his shoulders as
    he conducted Fernande and &ldquo;the General&rdquo; out of the workshop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That means peace and quiet for a few weeks,&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;but
    Leroux is a real malcontent, and gives me any amount of trouble. He was condemned
    to deportation for murder and arson&mdash;one of the worst characters we
    have in the place. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust that man, General....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is a good workman,&rdquo; was de Maurel&rsquo;s only comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good workman? Yes,&rdquo; Mathurin admitted, &ldquo;but he is always
    ready with his knife. We have had two or three affrays with him. He gave
    me a nasty cut on the forearm less than a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I? The cut will heal all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I would have had the fellow thrashed like the cur he is,&rdquo; came
    with a harsh oath from de Maurel. &ldquo;So no doubt you were wise not to
    tell me&mdash;good old Mathurin,&rdquo; he added, and placed his hand affectionately
    on the workman&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would be better to have him sent elsewhere,&rdquo; suggested the
    overseer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one would have him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him join the army. He is good fodder for Prussian cannon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A mischief-maker in the army is more dangerous than here at home.
    And if he is a skilled workman, the Emperor hath more need of him just now
    at La Frontenay than in Poland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mathurin was silent for a moment or two, then he muttered between his teeth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We ought to have a couple of military overseers here, as they have
    at Nevers and at Ruelle. The Minister of War is ready to send us help whenever
    we want it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we puling infants,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel lightly, &ldquo;that
    we want nurses to look after us? You must have a poor opinion of your employer,
    my good Mathurin, if you think he cannot keep a few recalcitrant workmen
    in order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one can guard against a madman striking in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If a madman chooses to strike at me in the dark,&rdquo; rejoined
    de Maurel coolly, &ldquo;all the military representatives in the world could
    not ward off the blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough, my good friend,&rdquo; broke in the other, with a slight
    tone of impatience. &ldquo;You know my feelings in the matter well enough.
    I do not intend to have military overseers in my works, whilst I have the
    strength to look after them myself. When the Emperor allows me to rejoin
    the army I&rsquo;ll write to the Minister of War, for a couple of representatives
    to take my place during my absence ... but not before.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Then at last he turned to Fernande.</p>
  <p>She had been terribly frightened at first, but the same magnetic power which
    had quelled the turbulent spirit of a pack of jail-birds had also acted on
    Fernande&rsquo;s overstrung nerves. Her fright had soon given way before
    the power and confidence which de Maurel&rsquo;s attitude inspired. In the
    same way as she had marvelled at his dealings with the workmen who were loyal,
    so did she render unwilling homage in her thoughts to his unflinching courage
    in the face of treachery. Perhaps she realized more completely than she had
    ever done before that here was a man whom it was easy enough to hate, but
    not one whom it was possible to despise. That she&mdash;Fernande&mdash;still
    hated him, she felt more than sure ... hated him for his rough ways, which
    had perhaps never been so apparent as now, when he tried to reassure her.
    His blouse was more stained and crumpled than ever. It had lain in the mud
    of the workshop, when he flung it away from him in a fit of passionate wrath.
    As for his hands, they were smeared with grime, and she could see that the
    sweat was pouring down from his forehead when with an impatient movement
    he brushed his thick, brown hair with his hand away from his brow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am deeply grieved, Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he said in his
    unapt and halting way, &ldquo;that your ears should have been offended and
    your eyes outraged by the sayings and doings of a pack of traitors. Meseems
    you will be able to regale your kinsfolk up at Courson with tales of the
    mutinous spirit of these unworthy soldiers of the Empire. I can hear my brother
    Laurent laughing his fill at your tale. Indeed, I know that I am to blame.
    I ought not to have brought you here. But Mathurin and I are passing proud
    of the work done by these men, and I wanted to show you what the spirit of
    patriotism will often do with fellows, whom my brother Laurent hath so scornfully
    dubbed my jail-birds. &rsquo;Twas unfortunate,&rdquo; he added with quaint
    shamefacedness, &ldquo;that the rascals just chose to-day for breaking out
    in such senseless and childish revolt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Childish and senseless,&rdquo; Fernande said, with a contemptuous
    smile round her pretty lips;  &ldquo;you take things easily, by my faith!&rdquo; Then
    she added earnestly: &ldquo;Take care, <i>mon cousin</i>! one of them will
    kill you one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned brusquely to face her, and for a moment looked at her with a dark,
    puzzled frown between his eyes; then he asked abruptly: &ldquo;Would you
    care if they did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back suddenly, as if his strange and earnest query had hit her
    in the face. He did not withdraw his gaze from her, however&mdash;a curious,
    searching, intense gaze&mdash;which sent the blood coursing hotly through
    her veins in unbounded pride and anger. Indeed, for the moment she forget
    her r&ocirc;le, forgot her foolish boast, her childish wager that she would
    bring this untamed ogre to his knees. For the first time now she felt appalled
    at the magnitude of a passion which she had wantonly kindled, and with the
    marvellous prodigality of youth&mdash;she would at this moment have bartered
    twenty years of her life to undo the mischief which she had already done.
    She felt like a sleep-walker who&mdash;suddenly awakened&mdash;sees a yawning
    abyss at his feet, and with a strange instinct of self-protection she put
    up her hands as if to ward off a threatened blow.</p>
  <p>The gesture, and a vague look of fear in her eyes, sobered him quickly enough,
    and after a while he reiterated quite gently:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you care, Mademoiselle Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande de Courson, young as she was, had a great fund of self-control
    and self-confidence, and already she had recovered from that sense of fear
    which had paralysed her for a moment and of which she was already heartily
    ashamed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I would care, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she replied coolly
    and with a forced little laugh. &ldquo;Did you not care when our kinsfolk
    were murdered on the guillotine by a lot of insensate brutes? You are my
    kinsman, too! Surely you do not credit me with less sensibility than you
    or M. Gaston de Maurel possess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had hit back boldly this time, and he was not quite so unsophisticated
    as not to know that she was punishing him for all the bitter words which
    he had spoken so freely&mdash;even in the woods, when her beauty and her
    helplessness ought to have put a curb upon his tongue. A hot flush rose to
    his brow, and a look of remorse, which seemed intensely pathetic and appealing,
    crept into his eyes. But Fernande, after her fright of a while ago, was in
    no mood for gentleness, and she responded to his mute prayer for forgiveness
    by a light, ironical laugh and a careless shrug of the shoulders.</p>
  <p>Before she had time to speak again, however, good old Mathurin had intervened
    in a blundering fashion, which had the effect of adding more fuel to the
    smouldering flames of Fernande&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, his voice quivering with emotion, &ldquo;I
    would to God you could persuade the General not to expose himself alone in
    the midst of those hellhounds in there. As you say, one of them will be sticking
    a knife into him one day ... and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mathurin!&rdquo;  came in stern reproof from de Maurel.</p>
  <p>But Mathurin had ventured too far now to draw back. He gave a shrug of his
    broad shoulders, as if to show that he was prepared to take all the consequences
    of his boldness. Worthy old Mathurin&mdash;who was wholly unversed in the
    ways of women&mdash;had an idea that in Fernande he had found an ally who
    would second him in his anxiety for his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo;  he went on, imperturbed by de Maurel&rsquo;s
    glowering look, &ldquo;the General&rsquo;s life is too precious to be thrown
    to those dogs.... Mademoiselle ... if you love him....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Mathurin!&rdquo; thundered de Maurel roughly, and this time
    he succeeded in stopping the flow of the worthy man&rsquo;s eloquence. Mathurin
    hung his head, looking shamed and sheepish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I said?&rdquo; he queried ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing that you need be ashamed of, my good friend,&rdquo; said
    Fernande de Courson with gentle earnestness, &ldquo;and I honour you for
    your devotion to your master. Indeed, he were well advised&mdash;I feel sure&mdash;to
    listen to your counsels.&rdquo; Then she turned to de Maurel and said coolly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall we go, <i>mon cousin</i>? My father and <i>ma tante</i>, not
    to speak of Laurent, will be desperately anxious if I do not return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more it seemed as if between her and him some subtle sortilege had
    suddenly been broken. De Maurel felt as if he had been roughly wakened from
    a dream, wherein angels and demons had alternately soothed and teased him.
    His brother&rsquo;s name acted as a counter-charm upon his mood. In a moment
    he became constrained, halting in his speech, clumsy in his manner. His self-consciousness
    returned, and at the same time his delight in Fernande&rsquo;s company vanished.
    He thought that in the blue eyes which met his now so unconcernedly, he read
    mockery and contempt, as well as the indifference which had stung him a while
    ago, but which he had schooled himself in a measure to endure. Once again
    he felt hot shame of his ignorance, of his soiled blouse and grimy hands;
    and his shame and irritation were aggravated by the sting of suddenly awakened
    jealousy against the young and handsome brother, who even in absence appeared
    to exercise a sort of acknowledged mentorship over Fernande. He lost control
    over his temper and retorted with unwarrantable gruffness and worse discourtesy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not let me detain you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mathurin
    will see you safely into the carriole, and the man will drive you to Courson
    as fast as the horse can trot. I would not like to be the innocent cause
    of my brother&rsquo;s anxiety. But I fear me,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that
    you will carry away a very unpleasant impression of La Frontenay&mdash;the
    jail-birds have pecked at their keeper, eh? Well, if I have to dismiss some
    of them, they&rsquo;ll be available for the campaign of highway robbery and
    pillage which I hear the adherents of the dispossessed King have set on foot,
    in order to fill his coffers; and my brother Laurent will be satisfied, I
    hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, Fernande&mdash;proud, imperious, high-handed Fernande&mdash;felt
    all her anger against de Maurel suddenly melt away at his scornful tirade.
    Indeed, had he been less blind and more sophisticated, he could not have
    failed to notice the little smile of triumph which lit up her entire face
    as she listened to words which of a surety ought to have filled the measure
    of her wrath. There could be no doubt now that the bear was over-ready to
    dance whithersoever he was led, seeing that the mere mention of his brother&rsquo;s
    name had caused him to forget himself completely in this new feeling of jealousy,
    and to hit out senselessly in every direction. Well, thought Mademoiselle
    Fernande&mdash;and she drew a contented little sigh&mdash;he should suffer
    punishment for this outburst of temper&mdash;punishment far more severe than
    he had endured a while ago, for it would be accompanied by stinging remorse
    and a gnawing fear that forgiveness would never be granted to him again.
    With this thought of retributive justice in her mind, she allowed becoming
    tears to gather in her eyes and a slight tremor to veil her voice, as she
    drew herself up to her full height with stately dignity and said coldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My cousin Laurent would, indeed, be satisfied if he saw me once more
    safely at Courson, where, though we are poor, and still, in a measure, strangers
    in our native land, we are at least not subjected to insult. My good Mathurin,&rdquo; she
    added, placing her small white hand on the grimy sleeve of the overseer, &ldquo;I
    pray you escort me to the carriole. The heat and noise of the workshops have
    made me faint. I should be grateful for the support of your arm. <i>Au revoir,
    mon cousin!</i>&rdquo; she said in conclusion, with a slight nod of her dainty
    head toward de Maurel, accompanied by a look of cold reproach. &ldquo;Let
    us go, my good Mathurin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before de Maurel had time to throw himself at her feet, as he, indeed,
    was longing to do, and to sue for pardon on his knees, weeping tears of blood
    for his brutality, she had sailed out of the workshop, with small head erect,
    her final glance turned deliberately away from him. And he remained there
    as if rooted to the spot, his heart aching with the bitterness of his remorse,
    gazing on the marks which her tiny heelless shoe had made upon the mud floor
    of the workshop, and longing with a mad and senseless aching of his whole
    heart to grovel on that floor and kiss each small footprint which was all
    that was left to him of her fragrant presence and the magic of her person.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter &nbsp;11<br>
    The First Trick</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>It was over a week before Ronnay de Maurel dared venture as far as Courson
    in order to sue for pardon; and then mayhap he would not have gone, only
    that Madame la Marquise sent over repeatedly to La Vieuville, complaining
    of his want of attention to her and desiring his presence as soon as may
    be.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis hard, indeed,&rdquo; she said in one of her letters, &ldquo;that
    when I thought I had found my son again, I should so soon lose him through
    no fault of mine own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And at the end of another epistle she had added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know everything, and pledge you my word that you need have no fear.
    Forgiveness is assured you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a strange fact, and one of which de Maurel was in his heart mightily
    ashamed, that he did not speak to his uncle Gaston of his mother&rsquo;s
    letters, or of his own desire to go to Courson and obtain his pardon from
    the girl, the thought of whom now filled his entire soul. Of course, the
    invalid knew of Fernande&rsquo;s visit to the foundries; he knew of the incident
    that had occurred during the visit, and felt just strong enough to resent
    bitterly the fact that his workmen had shown their disloyalty in the presence
    of one of these &ldquo;cursed Royalists.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But after that one serious attempt which he had made to keep Ronnay away
    from Courson, old Gaston de Maurel had not said another word on the subject;
    nevertheless, the keen insight which his fondness for his nephew gave him
    soon showed him the clue of what was in the wind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of those <i>satan&eacute;</i> de Coursons has got hold of the
    boy,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;and God help him; for she&rsquo;ll
    make him suffer, as my dead brother suffered. God grant he does not break
    his heart over the wench.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sent for Mathurin and questioned him. But Mathurin was not reassuring.
    He thought that the General did not seem to pay much court to the lady, but,
    on the other hand, he declared that the lady was very beautiful, and had
    tantalizing, blue eyes. Old Gaston was nearer scenting the trap that was
    being set for Ronnay than the latter was himself. But it is passing likely
    that even if Ronnay had been warned he would still have deliberately courted
    his destiny.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The last message which his mother sent him set his pulses on fire. He could
    not have kept away from Courson after that. Some strange instinct for which
    he despised himself, caused him to avoid the invalid&rsquo;s room after he
    had donned his uniform and made ready to start for Courson. He feared his
    uncle&rsquo;s gibes and his counsels of prudence, even though in his heart
    he knew that his uncle was right.</p>
  <p>When he reached Courson he found his mother in a soft and tender mood; she
    and Fernande were sitting together under the trees in the garden. M. de Courson
    and Laurent had gone fishing, he was told, and the ladies professed themselves
    delighted at his company. Fernande said little, but her smile was kind, and
    she gave de Maurel her hand to kiss. She was sitting on a low stool beside
    her aunt, and now and then she shot a glance from her blue eyes at him&mdash;a
    glance which set him galloping once more to the land of dreams. But Madame
    la Marquise talked a great deal and with marked affection to her son, telling
    him something of her troubles, something of her anxieties about Laurent.
    She had no home, she said, for, of a truth, she could no longer live on the
    bounty of her brother. Laurent chafed at the thought of owing bread and board
    to his uncle.</p>
  <p>De Maurel listened in silence to everything she said. Indeed, he was glad
    that his mother talked at such lengths. He would have sat here and listened
    for hours, all the while that he could watch Fernande, as she put in a word
    here and there, or made a movement to show her love and sympathy with her
    aunt. The sun came slanting in between the branches of the trees, and there
    was nothing in the world that Ronnay loved more than to watch the play of
    light upon Fernande&rsquo;s fair hair, or to see it creeping round the contour
    of her exquisite neck and shoulders, outlining their pearly hue with gold.
    When he went, he promised to come again the next day.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>For the next fortnight he came nearly every day. Sometimes M. de Courson
    would be at home; sometimes&mdash;more seldom&mdash;Laurent would be there;
    but nearly always the two ladies would be alone, and Madame would talk about
    her troubles, and Ronnay de Maurel listened with half an ear, while his eyes
    followed Fernande&rsquo;s every movement.</p>
  <p>Within a week he had offered to his mother and to Laurent his own Ch&acirc;teau
    of La Frontenay as a residence, and Madame la Marquise had graciously accepted
    the offer. It had been made because at the precise moment when de Maurel
    had his eyes fixed on Fernande, she had looked up at him, and Madame had
    said quite casually: &ldquo;Fernande will make her home with me for the next
    few months while my brother and Laurent are away,&rdquo; and Fernande had
    added with a pathetic little sigh: &ldquo;Is it not pitiable that <i>ma tante</i> has
    no home of her own, whilst you are so rich, <i>mon cousin</i>, and your ch&acirc;teau
    stands empty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time every counsel of wisdom and prudence spoken by Gaston de Maurel
    had long since been forgotten. Ronnay saw things through a pair of blue eyes,
    his thoughts only mirrored those which had their birth behind a smooth, white
    forehead and beneath a crown of golden hair.</p>
  <p>To Laurent, however, his brother&rsquo;s daily visits at Courson were nothing
    short of martyrdom, and it took Madame la Marquise all her time and all her
    powers of persuasive eloquence to keep her younger son out of the way when
    de Maurel called. If by some mischance the brothers met, a quarrel was only
    averted by Madame&rsquo;s untiring tact and&mdash;it must be admitted&mdash;by
    Ronnay&rsquo;s own determination to avoid another scene which might hopelessly
    imperil the friendly footing which he had earned for himself in the house
    where dwelt his divinity.</p>
  <p>That Ronnay de Maurel was by this time deeply in love with Fernande no one
    could fail to see. Madame la Marquise chose to pooh-pooh the idea only because
    she was afraid of Laurent&rsquo;s outbursts of jealousy, which would thwart
    all her carefully laid plans before she had put them into execution. Laurent,
    of a truth, was almost beside himself during these days; even though Fernande
    soothed his jealous temper with more soft words and more endearing ways than
    she had been wont to bestow on him in the past. Though the young man suffered
    acutely all the while that he knew de Maurel to be in Fernande&rsquo;s company,
    she very quickly sent him into paradise the moment the ogre was out of the
    way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am working for King and country,&rdquo; the young girl would say,
    with a kind of dreamy exultation, whenever&mdash;after the departure of de
    Maurel&mdash;she had to endure one of Laurent&rsquo;s outbursts of insensate
    rage. &ldquo;Think you that it is a pleasure to me to be in daily contact
    with such an odious creature? Bah! meseems when I speak with him that I can
    see the spectre of our martyred King and Queen calling to me to avenge them!
    Surely,&rdquo; she added reproachfully, &ldquo;if I can endure the looks,
    the touch, the propinquity of the traitor, if I can bear the thought that
    he actually dares to sully me with his love, you, Laurent, might for the
    sake of our cause try to keep your unwarrantable jealousy in check.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; exclaimed Laurent vehemently, &ldquo;when I know
    that the man has dared to make love to you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, he has not yet done that, dear Laurent,&rdquo; broke in Fernande
    thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you mean to allow him to make love to you when the fancy seizes
    him!&rdquo; he retorted angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do. I have a wager on it with you. Have I not said that
    the bear would dance to my piping?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He doth that quite enough already. And I&rsquo;ll release you of
    that wager, Fernande.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flushed with wrath, wretched with maddening jealousy, he drew nearer to
    the girl, and with a brusque movement seized her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;you torture me....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked up at him&mdash;there certainly was a look of acute suffering
    in his young face. She disengaged herself from his arms and said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Laurent! If it were not that we have need of the man and that <i>ma
      tante</i> sets such great store by La Frontenay, I would turn my back on
      him for ever to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he was not satisfied, even though she had spoken with singular vehemence,
    and his misery wrung from him a last passionate appeal:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not love him, Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two she stood quite still, her eyes fixed on the distance,
    far away where lay the woods of La Frontenay&mdash;a dark green patch on
    the lower slope of the hills; then she turned slowly and looked calmly into
    Laurent de Mortain&rsquo;s glowering eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hate him,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Madame la Marquise, on the other hand, encouraged Fernande with all her
    might. She was one of those fanatics in the Royalist cause who would stick
    at nothing in order to gain influence, men, money that would help toward
    ultimate success. In fact, she dreaded that Fernande was really only playing
    with de Maurel&rsquo;s love, and that she really meant to throw him over.
    In her heart she was hoping that the child could be persuaded to accept his
    attentions. As the wife of Ronnay de Maurel, the master of the foundries
    of La Frontenay, she could render incalculable services to the King. What
    was a girl&rsquo;s happiness worth, when weighed in the balance with the
    triumph of a sacred cause? But Madame was too shrewd a campaigner to show
    her hand to the enemy&mdash;the enemy in this case being both Laurent and
    M. de Courson. The latter, of a truth, saw little of what went on, even though
    Laurent boldly tackled him one day on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande sees too much of Ronnay de Maurel, <i>mon oncle</i>,&rdquo; he
    said, when as usual he and M. de Courson were out of the way at the hour
    when de Maurel paid his visit to the ladies. &ldquo;He pesters her with his
    attentions....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. de Courson shrugged his shoulders at the idea. &ldquo;You are dreaming,
    my good Laurent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My sister would never allow Fernande
    to accept the attentions of one of that pestiferous crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And when Laurent hotly pressed his point, M. de Courson had an indulgent
    smile for his vehemence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your jealousy blinds you, my good Laurent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fernande
    loves you and she is not a girl to change her feelings lightly. Just now
    she is coquetting with de Maurel because it is in all our interests to keep
    on friendly terms with him. We are beginning to organize our army; we shall
    be wanting money, arms, munitions, suitable headquarters. All these de Maurel
    can supply us with&mdash;if he remain friendly. Fernande has gained influence
    over him. Already he is less bitter when he speaks of the King. Let the child
    be, my good Laurent. There is no more enthusiastic patriot than our little
    Fernande. She vowed that she would make the Maurel bear dance to her piping.
    Let us not place any obstacles in the way of success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, <i>mon oncle</i>,&rdquo; protested Laurent hotly, &ldquo;our
    future happiness is at stake ... both Fernande&rsquo;s and mine ... and if
    my brother....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ah,  &ccedil;&agrave;</i>,&rdquo; broke in M. le Comte tartly, &ldquo;are
    you insinuating, Monsieur my nephew, that my daughter is like to be untrue
    to her promise to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why all this pother, I pray you? Fernande knows just as well&mdash;and
    better than both of us&mdash;how far she can go with de Maurel. Her coquetry&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    stake my oath on it&mdash;is harmless enough, nor would my sister countenance
    de Maurel&rsquo;s visits here if they erred against the proprieties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But though M. de Courson refused to admit before Laurent that there was
    anything but the most harmless coquetry between his daughter and de Maurel,
    he, nevertheless, made up his mind then and there that he would talk seriously
    on the subject with Madame la Marquise.</p>
  <p>This he did, and she soon succeeded in reassuring him. A little patience,
    she argued, and Ronnay would be definitely pledged to place La Frontenay
    at her disposal; after which Fernande need never see him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going over there within the next few days in order to select
    the rooms which are to be got ready for me. I shall arrange it so that Vardenne,
    the chief bailiff, shall see me there, and hear Ronnay speak definitely of
    my future residence in the place. Once he has done that in front of Vardenne,
    it will be impossible for him to go back on his word. Moreover, Fernande
    will be with me, and Ronnay will say anything, promise anything, while I
    let him think that she will take up her abode at La Frontenay with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>M. de Courson frowned. There is always a certain esprit de corps in the
    male sex, which is up in arms the moment one man sees that a feminine trap
    is being set for another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not playing a very dignified game there, Denise,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;  she retorted. &ldquo;Did those infamous revolutionists
    play a dignified game, I wonder? Is not everything fair in war&mdash;such
    war as we must wage&mdash;we who are poor and feeble, against the whole might
    of this mushroom Empire? Fernande is a true patriot. She is willing to be
    a pawn in the great game which we are about to play, and the stakes of which
    are the immortal crown and sceptre of St. Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as she saw that M. de Courson still remained moody and silent, she
    said reassuringly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not fear for Fernande, my brother. If I have no fear for
    Laurent&mdash;and, believe me, I have none&mdash;then surely you may rest
    satisfied that the happiness of our children is not at stake.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>That same afternoon de Maurel spoke of the woods and of the silent pool
    before Fernande. The warm summer mornings were exquisite there just now,
    he said; the water-lilies on the pool were in bud, and the sun glittered
    with myriads of colours on the iridescent wings of the dragon-flies. The
    mountain-ash was in full blossom and the white acacia filled the air with
    its fragrance. Fernande seemed to be listening with half an ear, but anon
    she said: &ldquo;I will have to resume my early morning walks again some
    day. I have been lazy of late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took this to mean that she would come, and seemed quite unconscious of
    the fact that while Fernande spoke, Laurent had stood by with an unusually
    dark scowl upon his face.</p>
  <p>But a whole month went by ere she came&mdash;a month during which Ronnay
    walked every morning in the woods, going as far as the silent pool, and there
    waiting on the chance of seeing her. It was a weary month for him, because
    matters at the armament works were going from bad to worse with the discontented
    workmen. Leroux, smarting under the punishment imposed upon him, worked hard
    to rally his more unruly comrades around him. Exactly what it was the men
    wanted, even they would have found it difficult to say. They had been called
    to the colours and allowed to take on work in the powder factories, but they
    were amenable to military discipline. The fact that most of them had been
    let out of prison, in order to help supply the Emperor and his armies with
    their needs, should have made them more contented with their lot, even though
    that lot was not an easy one.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis true that the hardest and most dangerous tasks were put upon
    them; hours of idleness were few, and they were not free to come and go,
    as were the other workmen in the foundry. They dwelt in compounds, always
    under supervision; those who had families were not allowed to live with them&mdash;the
    boys belonged to the State and were drilled for soldiers as soon as they
    were old enough; the girls were set to make clothes and shirts for the army
    as soon as they could handle a needle.</p>
  <p>Leroux took for his main grievance this segregation of the men away from
    their families, choosing to remain oblivious of the fact that had he and
    his mates been serving their full term of imprisonment or been deported to
    New Caledonia, they would have been still more effectually separated from
    their wives and children. But he was able to talk impassioned rhetoric on
    the subject, and men are easily enough won over by the bait of a real or
    supposed grievance.</p>
  <p>It took all de Maurel&rsquo;s energy to cope with the trouble, and it was
    only in the early morning, before work in the powder factory had properly
    begun, that he was able to absent himself from the works. He had to discontinue
    his afternoon visits to Courson, and in the hope of seeing Fernande again
    he could only rely on the vague words which she spoke the last time he saw
    her: &ldquo;I will have to resume my early morning walks again some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While the trouble with his men filled his thoughts, he did not become a
    prey to that melancholy which was gnawing at his heart, when day after day
    went by and Fernande did not come. To a man of de Maurel&rsquo;s wilful and
    dictatorial temperament, the delay was positive torture, and it is quite
    likely that this constant jarring of his nerves, this aching desire for a
    sight of the woman whom he loved so passionately, tended to make him less
    lenient with Leroux and the malcontents.</p>
  <p>He who throughout his administration of the great factory had always been
    in complete sympathy with every one of his workmen, found himself often now
    in complete disharmony with them&mdash;impatient of their complaints, severe
    in punishment, bitingly scornful in the face of threats. These had become
    more numerous and more violent of late. Mathurin and the other overseers,
    who were loyal to a man, went in fear and trembling for their master&rsquo;s
    life. And all the while old Gaston de Maurel was sinking. His life at times
    seemed literally to be hanging by a thread; at others he would rally, and
    with marvellous tenacity would refuse all medicaments and declare that he
    had still many years before him wherein to defeat the machinations of those
    Coursons whom he abhorred.</p>
  <p>He knew quite well all that was going on; he knew that his nephew had started
    on that pilgrimage of suffering, wherein a de Courson led the way, and which
    could but end in a broken heart at the journey&rsquo;s end; but he said nothing
    more on the subject. He was a de Maurel, too, and knew well enough that against
    the wilfulness of one of that race, all the warnings and all the tears of
    a faithful mentor would be in vain.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>6</b></h3>
  <p>Toward the end of June Ronnay de Maurel sent a courier over to his mother,
    asking her to come over to La Frontenay and select the rooms which she would
    like to be made habitable for her use.</p>
  <p>Madame handed the letter over to her brother with a triumphant smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first battle has been won,&rdquo; she said firmly. Then she turned
    to her niece and placed her hand affectionately on the young girl&rsquo;s
    shoulder. &ldquo;Thanks to Fernande,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And in years
    to come, my dear, think how proud you will be that you have rendered such
    a signal service to His Majesty&mdash;God guard him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It has not been easy, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande with
    a whimsical smile. &ldquo;Laurent has been a perfect ogre; lately he has
    taken to dogging my footsteps. He lies in wait for me at every turn. I dared
    not meet M. de Maurel outside the ch&acirc;teau, lest Laurent pounced upon
    us and provoked a scene. I was beginning to fear that my bear would escape
    me, after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No fear of that, child. My son Ronnay is deeply enamoured of you.
    His absence from you these last few weeks has provoked him into capitulating
    sooner than I thought. To-morrow will clinch the pledge which Ronnay has
    already given me, and by autumn we shall be settled at La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Fernande, I trust,&rdquo; here interposed M. de Courson with
    stern decision, &ldquo;need never meet that abominable democrat again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As usual, when the subject was alluded to, Madame held her peace. She was
    in no hurry to settle anything with regard to Fernande. Everything would
    depend on Ronnay&rsquo;s attitude toward herself and toward her political
    schemes. If he remained impassive and indifferent, or if he could be kept
    in ignorance of the Royalist plans till these were sufficiently mature to
    ensure success, things between him and Fernande might very well be left as
    they were. He was far too shy and inexperienced to brusque a crisis with
    any woman, and Fernande might easily be trusted to keep him at arm&rsquo;s
    length, whilst allowing him to hope, until such time as he was no longer
    in the way of the Royalist schemes.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, if he proved openly hostile, then Fernande must still
    be the bait whereby so dangerous a fish would have to be caught; she would
    have to be sacrificed in order to win him over completely. Once Ronnay de
    Maurel had a de Courson for wife, it would be her business to see that he
    closed his eyes to the Royalist intrigues which had the armament works of
    La Frontenay for their chief objective.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise knew well enough that discontent and disloyalty were
    rife in the powder factories of La Frontenay. Her task would be to see that
    the disaffection spread to the foundries. The dearness of food, the oft times
    irksome military regulations for the defence of the realm, were always safe
    cards to play when men were to be won over from constituted authority to
    a cause wherein promises were cheap and plentiful. Rumours of disturbances
    at the factory had become more insistent of late, and they were an augury
    of further disturbances to come. And, after all, thought Madame, even jail-birds
    were not to be disdained as allies in a cause which was both sacred and just.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>7</b></h3>
  <p>Laurent, backed by M. de Courson, raised so many objections to Fernande
    going over to La Frontenay again, that Madame la Marquise was for once obliged
    to yield. Nor did she regret Fernande&rsquo;s absence when she realized that
    Ronnay was all the more determined to push her own installation at the ch&acirc;teau
    forward as a means of his seeing the young girl again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Fernande will settle down here with me,&rdquo;  Madame said
    very judicially at the most critical moment of the interview; &ldquo;she
    will help me to put things in order, and bear me company in my loneliness,
    as my brother and Laurent will be going away very soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vardenne, the head-bailiff, had much ado to keep his master&rsquo;s impatience
    in check after that. He was to see at once that the rooms which Madame la
    Marquise had selected were put ready for her occupation. If men were not
    available capable women and girls would have to be brought up from the village;
    in any case, Madame la Marquise should be installed here within the week,
    and suitable servants engaged for her. He himself was so absolutely ignorant
    of what ladies required in order to be comfortable in a ch&acirc;teau, that
    he then and there placed the bailiff entirely at Madame&rsquo;s disposal
    for any orders she might deign to give.</p>
  <p>Nothing could have pleased Madame better. She was quite ready to take up
    her abode at La Frontenay, where already she had arranged to meet M. de Puisaye
    and the other Royalist leaders, and where every kind of plan and scheme could
    be discussed and prepared at leisure. Madame had plans of her own to think
    of as well&mdash;plans intimately connected with the armament works of La
    Frontenay and its disaffected workmen, and which she felt sure would commend
    themselves at once to Joseph de Puisaye. So she returned to Courson in a
    high state of exultation. The rapidity wherewith happy events had moved along
    surpassed her wildest expectations. That same evening M. de Courson decided
    that he and Laurent had best join de Puisaye, their chief, immediately. The
    whole aspect of the proposed rising was wearing a different aspect now that
    such perfect headquarters were at the disposal of its leaders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Directly you are settled at La Frontenay,&rdquo; M. de Courson said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    communicate with Prigent and d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;, and they can come over
    with de Puisaye as soon as you are ready to receive them. The park is so
    marvellously secluded and so extensive, that there is practically no fear
    of Bonaparte&rsquo;s spies being about, and I feel confident that our chiefs
    can come and go when they like, and as often as they like, without fear of
    discovery....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till we are ready for our big coup,&rdquo; asserted Madame eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  mused M. le Comte; &ldquo;it begins to look feasible
    now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Feasible?&rdquo;  exclaimed Madame, whose optimism and enthusiasm
    nothing would ever damp. &ldquo;Feasible? I look upon it as done. Give Fernande
    and me three months, and we&rsquo;ll have won over two-thirds of the workmen
    at La Frontenay. When our recruits march upon the foundry and demand its
    surrender in the name of the King, they will be received with acclamations
    of loyalty, and within the hour the foundries of La Frontenay will be manufacturing
    munitions of war for the triumph of the King&rsquo;s cause and the overthrow
    of that execrable Bonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant that your hopes may be realized, my dear Denise,&rdquo; rejoined
    M. de Courson; and Laurent added fervently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a triumph that will be for us! The mouths of fire and engines
    of war fashioned by regicides and traitors for the exaltation of the baseborn
    Corsican, suddenly turned against that very idol whom they have dared to
    set up against their lawful King!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter &nbsp;12<br>
    A Fool And His Folly</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>At last there came a morning when Fernande felt free from Laurent&rsquo;s
    untiring vigilance. Since the day when she had thrown out the vague hint
    to de Maurel that she would resume her walks in the wood, Laurent had never
    wearied of keeping an eye on every one of her movements.</p>
  <p>Morning after morning, when the sun irradiated the distant slopes with gold,
    she had started out at an hour when even old Matthieu was not yet about;
    she had tiptoed out of the house, certain that she would not wake anyone;
    she had stolen out into the garden by way of the veranda, her soft, heelless
    shoes gliding noiselessly along the parquet floors as well as upon the flagged
    stones. She had then skirted the ch&acirc;teau, in order to reach the park
    gates, only to find Laurent pacing up and down the avenue of limes, ostensibly
    engaged in reading a book, quite self-possessed and unconcerned, and exhibiting
    only the very slightest show of surprise at seeing her abroad so early in
    the day. He then suggested a walk round the park, or even at times a stroll
    as far as the woods, and she, inwardly exasperated at her own discomfiture,
    had perforce to appear gay and unconcerned too.</p>
  <p>Once she thought that she would try to cross the park as far as the postern
    gate and to slip out into the orchard that way and thence to the woods; but
    she had not yet reached the park wall before she heard Laurent&rsquo;s voice
    calling her by name. The avenue of limes commanded an extensive view of the
    gardens, and he had caught sight of her white dress flitting in among the
    trees.</p>
  <p>She did not wish to be caught stealing out of the precincts of the ch&acirc;teau
    like some country wench tripping to a rendezvous, so she had perforce to
    give up her matutinal excursions for a while, and to be content with an inward
    vision of poor Laurent getting up at break of day and cooling his heels morning
    after morning under the lime-trees while she lay snugly in bed, breaking
    her little head in order to devise some means of eluding his watchfulness.</p>
  <p>Why she should have wished to meet de Maurel again&mdash;alone in the woods&mdash;she
    herself could not have said. Encouraged by Madame la Marquise, she had certainly
    come to look upon her final subjugation of the Maurel bear as a work of selfless
    patriotism, and even an actual duty to her King and his cause. At the same
    time, the subjugation was already so complete, that it lay well within her
    power&mdash;this she knew&mdash;to precipitate the crisis at any moment when
    she felt so inclined. At a word, a look now, she could bring de Maurel to
    his knees and force from his untutored lips the avowal of his love which
    he himself was at no pains to conceal. One word from her&mdash;a message
    sent by courier to the foundries&mdash;would bring him to her side, even
    though the factories were on fire or the workmen in open revolt. She knew
    all that, and felt at the same time that she would sooner cut off her right
    hand or cut out her tongue than pen the message or speak the word. And yet
    she could not conquer the desire to meet him once again&mdash;alone&mdash;there
    where the romance of the pool, the song of birds, the murmur of the trees
    would all help to bring about that very avowal which she dreaded.</p>
  <p>Of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s more serious intentions with regard to herself
    and Ronnay de Maurel she knew nothing as yet. Had she known of them, she
    would have fought against them with her whole might. She had far too much
    ardent hatred for the man to think of him as anything but a mere tool for
    the success of her own cause&mdash;a tool to be speedily cast aside once
    it had served its purpose.</p>
  <p>That her coquetry with the man was not only capricious and thoughtless,
    but also wantonly cruel, she did not realize for a moment. Just now she felt
    more amused than thrilled by the thought that she had aroused tender feelings
    in the heart of a man of de Maurel&rsquo;s calibre; and she was only eighteen,
    and had no one to guide her in the somewhat tortuous path in which she had
    embarked. Madame la Marquise encouraged her openly. Her father was indulgently
    detached, and Laurent somewhat ridiculously jealous, whilst all the while
    she never brought herself to believe that de Maurel had it in him to love&mdash;sincerely,
    tenderly, unendingly. To her he was&mdash;he still remained&mdash;the enemy
    and the traitor; the man who perhaps had had no actual hand in the atrocities
    and the murders of the Revolution, but who had, nevertheless, countenanced
    them by openly professing democratic principles. Such a man was, therefore,
    fair prey for any loyal subject of His Majesty the King who had it in her
    power to make him suffer&mdash;as those of his kind had made the innocent
    suffer&mdash;and to make him weep tears of longing or of shame, that those
    very principles which he professed had shut him out for ever from the heart
    of his kindred, from their family circle, from home life and from happiness.</p>
  <p>Yet, hating the man as she did, detesting all that he loved and despising
    all that he worshipped, Fernande&mdash;such are the contradictions of a woman&rsquo;s
    heart&mdash;man&oelig;uvred day after day, at great risk to her own comfort
    and to her reputation, for the chance of meeting that same man alone and
    on the self-same spot where in his deep and ardent eyes she had already more
    than once read the secret of a passion which he himself had not yet probed
    to its depths.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Fernande was not at all surprised when she saw de Maurel sitting beside
    the silent pool&mdash;obviously waiting for her.</p>
  <p>Laurent and M. de Courson had gone to Avranches the previous day in answer
    to a summons from their chief; they were not expected home till the late
    afternoon. And that morning Fernande was free&mdash;free to steal out of
    the park gates while the morning sun tipped the distant hills with rose and
    made each dewdrop upon the leaves of beech and alder glisten like a diamond.
    She was free to wander through the orchards, where the apples were beginning
    to ripen, and where the cherry-trees were already stripped of their rich
    spoil; she was free to plunge into the cool and shady wood, to flit between
    the larches and the pines, feeling the cones crackling under her feet and
    the exhalation of warm earth rising to her nostrils and sending a delicious
    intoxication through her veins.</p>
  <p>The moment she saw de Maurel she was ready to run away. But it was already
    too late. He had spied her white dress, and in a moment he was on his feet,
    and a look of strange, exultant happiness lit up his entire face. Before
    she could move he had reached her side and taken her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew that you would come, my beloved,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>She tried to be flippant, or else wrathful, but somehow the words died on
    her lips. Such an extraordinary change had come over him, that she caught
    herself looking intently into his face&mdash;studying wherein lay that subtle
    transformation of his whole personality which made him seem like a triumphant
    lover. Indeed, the manner in which he had greeted her had taken her breath
    completely away, and it was quite mechanically that she allowed him to lead
    her to her favourite bank of moss, there where the broken stump of a tree
    trunk made a comfortable seat whereon to rest, and where the wild iris grew
    thickest and the meadowsweet in full flower sent its delicious fragrance
    through the air.</p>
  <p>She sat down on the tree trunk and arranged the folds of her gown primly
    round her feet, and he half sat, half lay, on the moss beside her, and all
    the while that she fumbled with her gown he sat quite still, with his elbow
    resting on the stump of the tree, his head leaning upon his hand. She felt
    restless and not a little nervy, and was vastly vexed with herself because&mdash;strive
    how she may&mdash;she could not steady the slight tremor of her fingers,
    and she could see that he was watching them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not think of meeting you here, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she
    contrived to say after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! but I think you did,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly. &ldquo;How could
    you think not to meet me once you gave me hope that you would come? Every
    morning I have lain in wait for you until the hour when I knew that it would
    be too late for you to venture out so far without being seen. Then I have
    gone back to my work. If I had not seen you to-day, I would have come again
    to-morrow, and the day after, and the day after that&mdash;for a month or
    for a year&mdash;or for ten years&mdash;until you came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk at random, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said coldly, choosing
    to ignore the intense passion which vibrated in his voice, and the ardent
    look wherewith he seemed to hold her, just as he had held her once in his
    strong arms. &ldquo;You talk at random,&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;Your
    words seem to imply that my desire was to meet you here, without being seen
    by others, whereas it is my custom to walk here often, sometimes alone, but
    more often with Laurent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! that was a long while ago,&rdquo; he said, with that same smile
    which was wont to light up his bronzed face with a strange air of youth and
    of joy. &ldquo;You used to walk in the woods with Laurent in the olden days,
    but not of late. Of late you sometimes started in the early morning, hoping
    to steal from out the park unperceived. But Laurent has always been on the
    watch, and you could not come. To-day he is absent....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; broke in Fernande vehemently, &ldquo;your
    imagination carries you far. I do not know whence you have gleaned this fantastic
    information, but....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The smile still lingered round his firm lips as he rejoined quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every morning at break of day I have prowled around the park of Courson.
    Every morning, until a week ago, I saw your white dress gleaming amongst
    the trees. I also saw Laurent wandering, disconsolate, under the lime-trees
    until he caught sight of you and turned you from your purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have, indeed, a vivid imagination, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she
    retorted, somewhat abashed, &ldquo;if you connect my early morning walks
    in the park of Courson in the company of Laurent with any desire on my part
    to meet you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the past week,&rdquo; he went on, wholly unperturbed, &ldquo;I
    have only seen Laurent, still walking dolefully under the limes. You did
    not come. But yesterday Laurent went to Avranches and this morning I saw
    you from afar. I saw your white dress, which looked like an exquisite white
    cloud on which the sun had imprinted a kiss and covered it with a rosy glow.
    I saw your hair like a golden aureole and the outline of your shoulders and
    your arms as you flitted like a sprite in and out amongst the trees. Then
    I knew that you were on your way hither; I soon outdistanced you. How I walked
    I cannot tell. Meseems that fairies must have carried me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems that your work cannot of late have been very absorbing, <i>mon
      cousin</i>,&rdquo; she rejoined with well-assumed flippancy, &ldquo;if
      you have spent every morning spying on my movements ten kilom&egrave;tres
      away from your home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would walk fifty on the chance of catching sight of you for five
    minutes in the distance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but not because I am idle.
    Work at the foundries and in the factory has been arduous and heavy. Rumour
    will have told you that some of our men have been troublesome....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked straight down into his eyes and said earnestly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those for whose sake you and yours became false to your King and
    to your caste are turning against you now, <i>mon cousin</i>. Yes! Rumour
    hath told me that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you have rejoiced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I have rejoiced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because in your thoughts you still hate me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because in my thoughts I condemn you as false to your country and
    false to your King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But in your heart, Fernande,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;in your
    heart you no longer hate me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you hate me, Fernande?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>She would have given worlds for the power to jump up then and there and
    to run away. But some invisible bond kept her chained to the spot. She could
    not move. There was a clump of meadowsweet close to her feet, all interwoven
    with marguerites, and overhead a mountain-ash was in full bloom and the pungent
    scent went to her head like wine. Her cheeks felt glowing with heat, and
    there were tiny beads of perspiration at the roots of her hair, but her hands
    felt cold and her feet numb, and her throat was dry and parched.</p>
  <p>She had just enough strength left to try and hide her confusion from him.
    She stooped and picked a marguerite, and thoughtfully, mechanically, her
    delicate fingers began to pull the white petals off one by one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An that flower does not lie,&rdquo; he said, with the same quiet
    earnestness, &ldquo;it will tell you that I love you ... passionately....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word, the look which accompanied it&mdash;above all, his hand which
    had without any warning seized her own&mdash;suddenly dispelled the witchery
    which up to now had so unaccountably held her will and her spirit in bondage.
    With a brusque movement she jumped to her feet and wrenched her hand out
    of his grasp, and now stood before him, tall, stately, with flaming cheeks
    and wrath-filled eyes, whilst a laugh of infinite scorn broke from her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ah  &ccedil;&agrave;!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you have
    methinks taken leave of your senses, <i>Monsieur mon cousin</i>. Or hath
    rumour lied again, when it averred that you led an abstemious life? The cellars
    of La Vieuville are well stocked with wine apparently, and its fumes have
    overclouded your brain, or you had not dared to insult me with such folly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He, too, had risen and stood facing her, his cheeks pale beneath their bronze,
    his hands tightly clenched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no insult,&rdquo; he said quietly, as soon as she had finished
    speaking, &ldquo;in the offer of an honest man&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An honest man&rsquo;s love?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;The love
    of a man whose hands are stained with the blood of all those I care for!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A truce on this childishness, Fernande,&rdquo; he rejoined almost
    roughly. &ldquo;Are we puppets, you and I, to dance to the piping of political
    wirepullers? I say, that when a man and a woman love one another, political
    aims and ideals soon sink into insignificance. What matters it if you desire
    to see this nation governed by a descendant of the Bourbons, or I by a newly-risen
    military genius? What matters it, dear heart, if one loves?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye! if one loves!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a derisive laugh. &ldquo;But
    you see, I do not love you, <i>mon cousin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is where you are wrong, Fernande,&rdquo; he riposted, still
    speaking calmly, even though his voice had now become quite hoarse and choked. &ldquo;You
    do not know your own heart, my dear ... you are too young to know it. But
    I knew that you loved me the day that first you came to meet me here! You
    remember? It was a lovely day in May; the sun shone golden between the branches
    of the trees, the mating birds were building their nests, the woods were
    fragrant with the scent of violets and lilies of the valley. You had gathered
    a bunch of wild hyacinths and they lay scattered at your feet, and I knelt
    down and picked them up for you, and for one instant your hand came in contact
    with mine. You loved me then, Fernande! you loved me when you nestled in
    my arms, and I carried you through the woods and out in the fields beneath
    the clear blue sky, less blue than your eyes. And from below a skylark rose
    heavenwards and sang a hosanna in the empyrean above. Your eyes were closed,
    but you did not sleep. You loved me then, Fernande! I felt it in every fibre
    of my heart, in every aspiration of my soul. My entire being thrilled with
    the knowledge that you loved me. You love me now, my dear,&rdquo; he added
    with ineffable tenderness, &ldquo;else you were not here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel!&rdquo; cried Fernande, &ldquo;this is an outrage!&rdquo; Her
    voice was choked with tears&mdash;tears of shame and of remorse for the past,
    tears of wrath and of misery at her own helplessness. She buried her face
    in her hands, lest he should see her tears; her feet were rooted to the ground;
    she dared not move, she dared not fly! she was only conscious of an awful,
    an overwhelming sense of fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the truth, Fernande,&rdquo; he rejoined calmly. &ldquo;Ah!
    you may scorn me, your beautiful eyes may flash hatred upon me. No doubt
    that I deserve both your scorn and your hate. I am rough, uneducated, illiterate,
    common, vulgar&mdash;what you will; but I am a man, a creature of flesh and
    blood, with a mind and a soul and a heart. That soul and that heart are yours&mdash;yours
    because you filched them from me with your blue eyes and your enchanting
    smile. You may turn away from me now&mdash;and we may part to-day never perhaps
    to meet again! We may each go our ways&mdash;you to sacrifice your youth,
    your beauty, your life to a degenerate cause; I, to eat my heart out in mad
    longing for you; but what has passed between us will never be forgotten.
    My words will ring in your ears long after an assassin&rsquo;s hand, which
    your kinsfolk have armed against me, has done its work and sent me to fall
    obscurely in a ditch with a Royalist bullet between my shoulders....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her hands dropped away from her face. She drew herself up and looked at
    him with large, puzzled, inquiring eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked slowly.</p>
  <p>With a careless laugh and a shrug of the shoulders, he pointed to the thicket
    immediately behind her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that day after day an assassin lurks in the undergrowth, dogging
    my footsteps, watching his opportunity. I mean that three times in the past
    week I have caught a man in there with a musket in his hand&mdash;a musket
    which was aimed at me. Three times I dragged a man out into the light of
    day, and the terror of being handed to the hangman forced an avowal from
    his lips. An avowal! always the same! He had been paid by an agent of Joseph
    de Puisaye to put a bullet into my back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Why should the hands that
    pillaged the home of M. de Ris, that murdered the Bishop of Quimper and outraged
    the Bishop of Cannes&mdash;why should they hesitate to strike a de Maurel
    who happens to be an inconvenient foe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; she reiterated vehemently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;False, think you? Then I pray you listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put up his hand, and instinctively she obeyed. The wood lay quite still
    under the heat of this July forenoon. There was not a rustle among the trees;
    the birds were silent, and from the mysterious pool there only came the gentle
    lapping of lazy waters against the mossy bank.</p>
  <p>Fernande strained her ears to listen, and soon she heard a stealthy, furtive
    movement in the undergrowth close by, and she was conscious of that curious,
    unerring sense which in the midst of Nature&rsquo;s silence proclaims the
    presence of a hidden human being. She felt more than she heard that somewhere
    amidst the tangled chestnut a creature was lurking, who was neither bird
    nor beast&mdash;a creature who might, indeed, be hiding there with sinister
    intent, his hand upon a musket which he had been paid to wield.</p>
  <p>A shudder of horror went right through her. She knew well enough that the
    Chouan leaders nowadays openly boasted of the reprisals which they meant
    to take; she had often heard fanatics, like Madame la Marquise, declare that
    in this coming war they would stick neither at murder, nor pillage, nor outrage,
    and an icy terror overcame her lest, indeed, some malcontent had been bribed
    to strike at this dangerous opponent from behind and in the dark.</p>
  <p>De Maurel moved toward the thicket, and she, with an impulse that was almost
    crazy, caught at his arm and clung to it, carried away by that same agonizing
    and nameless terror which in a swift vision had shown her the lurking assassin,
    and this splendid soldier of France lying murdered in a ditch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she cried wildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To find the assassin,&rdquo; he replied with a loud laugh. &ldquo;Those
    Normandy peasants are vastly unapt with their muskets. God forgive him, but
    in aiming at me he might succeed in hitting you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not go. It is madness to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It were madness not to go, Fernande. I entreat you take your dear
    hand from off my arm....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall not go,&rdquo; she reiterated half deliriously.</p>
  <p>He could not have wrenched himself free from her grasp without hurting her
    delicate hands. &ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; he said more gently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    return in a trice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall not go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall not go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then suddenly he yielded. With a quick movement he turned and caught her
    in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Fernande!&rdquo; he said exultantly, &ldquo;can you tell me now
    that you do not love me?&rdquo;  And as she, suddenly brought back to her
    senses, tried to drag herself away from him, he seized both her wrists and
    held her there one moment firmly, almost brutally, so that she was forced
    to look him straight in the eyes&mdash;his deep-set, passionate eyes, wherein
    love, triumph, joy, a mad jubilation had kindled a glowing light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was all a ruse, Fernande,&rdquo; he said, and the words came with
    vast rapidity, tumbling through his lips, &ldquo;a ruse to catch you unawares.
    Do you think that I care if an assassin doth lurk behind a thicket? Our fate
    is in God&rsquo;s hands, and I have affronted Prussian or Austrian cannon
    too often to think twice of a peasant&rsquo;s musket. But I wanted you to
    know, to realize what love means. And just now, when you thought my life
    in danger, there came a call from your heart, Fernande, the hearing of which
    I would not barter for the highest place in paradise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You love me, Fernande.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hate you. Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not until you understand. Ah, my dear, my dear, if you only realized
    what it means, you would not fight&mdash;like the shy young bird that you
    are&mdash;against the most glorious, the most magnificent, the most overpowering
    joy that God can grant to his miserable creatures. You would understand,
    Fernande, how paltry a thing are country, kindred, friends, King or Emperor,
    life or death? You love me, Fernande, and in love you would forget aught
    but love. Together we would forget, together we would live, my arms around
    you, your sweet head upon my breast. Look up to Heaven now, my dear, there
    where through the branches of that delicate birch you can see glints of blue
    and of gold, and swear now before God that you still hate me ... swear it,
    Fernande, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She remained silent, numbed, bewildered, her very senses aching with the
    intensity of her emotion, her gaze held by the fascination of that transcendental
    passion which glowed from out his eyes. Just for a moment they remained thus,
    hand in hand, whilst the murmurings of the woods were hushed, and a soft
    breeze stirred the delicate tendrils of her golden hair&mdash;just for one
    moment&mdash;that supreme second which in the life of God&rsquo;s elect spells
    immortality!</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Then, as when in the midst of a master&rsquo;s touch upon a perfectly tuned
    violin, a string suddenly snaps with a harsh and grating sound, so did a
    strident laugh break upon the exquisite silence of the woods.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well done, Fernande! well done!&rdquo; came in ringing accents from
    out the thicket. &ldquo;You have, indeed, won your wager. The bear is dancing
    to your piping, and I am just in time to see that he doth not commence to
    growl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the first sound of that laugh and of those words de Maurel had suddenly
    dropped Fernande&rsquo;s hands; he drew away from her and staggered almost
    as if that shot from the assassin&rsquo;s musket had struck him in the back.
    He put his hand up to his forehead and gazed out into the depths of the undergrowth
    close by, where Laurent de Mortain&rsquo;s slim form could be seen with outstretched
    arms pushing aside the thick branches of the young chestnut, his face&mdash;set
    and pale with passion&mdash;peering out from amongst the leaves.</p>
  <p>Fernande had not moved; only the tender glow of a while ago had suddenly
    fled from her cheeks and left them pale as ashes, and her eyes&mdash;which
    looked preternaturally large and dark with their dilated pupils&mdash;were
    fixed upon the approaching figure of Laurent. And de Maurel gazed from one
    to the other, from Laurent to Fernande, in a dazed, uncomprehending manner.
    He could not speak, he could not confront his young brother with the taunt
    that he was lying. He had looked on Fernande, and, God help him! he could
    not understand.</p>
  <p>But already Laurent had extricated himself out of the tangled coppice, and
    was striding rapidly toward them both.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very well done,&rdquo; he said as he approached. &ldquo;Many
    a time these past two months we all thought that you would fail. But you
    were so sure, were you not? Ah!&rdquo; he added, as with a nervy gesture
    he flicked his boot with the riding whip which he carried, &ldquo;how well
    I remember your boast, after that day when de Maurel and I quarrelled so
    hotly that we all feared he never would come nigh us again. &lsquo;The Maurel
    bear,&rsquo; you said, &lsquo;will dance to my piping on the faith of Fernande
    de Courson!&rsquo; No offence, dear brother,&rdquo; continued the young man
    with well-affected unconcern; &ldquo;our fair cousin&rsquo;s innocent coquetry
    must have vastly pleased your vanity. But there&rsquo;s no harm done, is
    there? We all have to go through the mill of women&rsquo;s wiles, and are
    none the worse for it in after life. You&rsquo;ll learn that, too, my good
    de Maurel, when you become better acquainted with the world. Shall we go
    now, Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With an air of proprietorship as well as of perfect courtesy he bowed before
    his young cousin and held out his arm to her. She appeared to be in a dream,
    all the life seemed to have gone out of her, and she stood there like a wooden
    doll, motionless and with wide-open eyes still fixed upon Laurent. Now, when
    he seemed to expect her to place her hand on his arm, she obeyed with a mechanical,
    automatic gesture.</p>
  <p>That half-crazy vacancy which had descended on de Maurel&rsquo;s mind when
    first Laurent&rsquo;s derisive words had hit him as with a blow, was gradually
    lifted from him. Sober common-sense, of which he had an abundant fund, had
    soon begun to whisper insidiously that here was no misunderstanding, no arrogance
    or perversion on the part of Laurent, since Fernande had not by word or gesture
    attempted to deny the truth of what he said. She had been ready enough to
    cry out: &ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; when those whom she loved were being
    indirectly attacked. That cry had come from her heart, whereas now she did
    not deny. She gave no word, no look. She allowed Laurent to lead her away.
    She had had her fun&mdash;her game with the besotted rustic, who had dared
    to raise his eyes to her unapproachable beauty&mdash;she had had her fun
    with him; now she was in a hurry to get home, in order to laugh at her ease.</p>
  <p>But to see her go away like that was something past the endurance of any
    man. De Maurel felt that even a word of torturing cruelty from her would
    be more bearable than this icy silence. And, after all&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the
    magic of her voice might dispel even this horrible dream. And so just as
    she was about to move away, he spoke to her, slowly, deliberately, forcing
    his rough voice to tones of courtesy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One moment, I pray you, Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Surely,
    ere you go, you will at least deign to confirm the truth of what my brother
    hath said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need no confirmation from Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; broke
    in Laurent harshly. &ldquo;I am not in the habit of lying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to Mademoiselle Fernande I was speaking,&rdquo; rejoined
    de Maurel quietly. &ldquo;I would humbly beg her to answer for herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then only did she turn and look at him, and at sight of the hopeless shame
    and misery which were imprinted on his face, she felt the hot tears welling
    up from her heart, and she had to close her eyes, lest he should read in
    them all the agonizing remorse which she felt.</p>
  <p>But she could not speak; every word she uttered would have choked her. And
    he, seeing her coldness, that proud aloofness which seemed to have descended
    upon her like a mantle the moment Laurent de Mortain appeared upon the scene,
    could have cried out in his humiliation and his wretchedness like some poor
    animal that has been wounded unto death. Not to these two proud aristocrats,
    however, would he show how terribly he was suffering. She&mdash;Fernande&mdash;held
    him in ridicule, it seemed&mdash;in contempt and derision. With cruel scorn
    she had toyed with his tenderest heart-strings, and laughed at his coming
    misery with those who would gladly sweep him off this earth. How she must
    have hated him, he thought, to have planned his abasement so thoughtfully,
    so deliberately.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That first day in the woods, the sheaf of bluebells, her exquisite bare
    toes ... all a trick! a trick! and he stood before her now&mdash;before Laurent
    his brother&mdash;shamed to the innermost depths of his being&mdash;openly
    denounced as a self-deluded fool&mdash;an unpardonably vain, besotted, unjustifiable
    fool!!</p>
  <p>For the moment he could do nothing, save to try and rescue a few tattered
    shreds of his own self-respect; so now, when after a second or two of silence,
    Laurent made as if he would speak again, Ronnay interposed firmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have had my answer,&rdquo; he said, as calmly as the hoarseness
    of his voice would allow, &ldquo;and there is nothing left for me to do,
    meseems, save to tender to Mademoiselle Fernande de Courson my humble apologies
    for the annoyance which this present scene must have caused her. I may be
    a rustic&mdash;and I know that I am a fool&mdash;still, I am not quite such
    an one as not to realize how very unpleasant even a chance meeting with me
    in the future would be to her. I should like to assure her, therefore, as
    well as Madame la Marquise, my mother, that I shall be leaving for Poland
    soon to join the Emperor, and that the sight of my soiled blouse and unkempt
    hair will not offend their eyes for many months to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent, vaguely stirred by shame at his own attitude at this moment, felt
    that he ought to say something amicable or conciliatory, but with a decided
    gesture of the hand, de Maurel repelled any further argument. He remained
    undoubtedly the master of the situation, a curiously dignified figure despite
    his rough clothes and the humiliation which had been put upon him. He remained
    standing close by the mossy bank whereon he had first dreamed&mdash;a foolish
    fond dream of happiness. The exquisite vision of loveliness and of grace
    who, with small, cruel hands had oped for him the secret door and shown him
    a glimpse of paradise, was even now turning away from him, without a word,
    without a look, arm in arm with the man for whom she had reserved her kisses,
    her fond embrace, the mere thought of which had sent fire through his own
    veins.</p>
  <p>She went right round the lake, her hand resting on Laurent&rsquo;s arm;
    then they struck the woodland path which led straight to Courson. For a while
    de Maurel could see her white dress gleaming amongst the trees, and once
    a ray of sunshine caught the top of her tiny head and made her hair shine
    like living gold. Then the thicket gradually enveloped them, and in the next
    few minutes they were hidden from his view.</p>
  <p>The breeze of a while ago had begun to rustle more insistently through the
    trees; the birds flew back to their nests. Overhead a squirrel looked down
    with beady, inquisitive eyes on that motionless figure of a human foe. And
    wafted upon the breeze, there came from out the depths of the silent pool
    the sustained, dulcet cooing of wood-pigeons. The soft and melancholy sound
    rose up like the wail of a broken heart; it floated through the leaves of
    the wild iris and the clumps of meadowsweet, until it soared up finally among
    the quivering leaves of birch and mountain-ash, and then was still.</p>
  <p>And with a cry like that of a dumb animal in pain, de Maurel fell upon his
    knees, and burying his face in the dewy moss, he sobbed his poor, overburdened
    heart out in desolation and utter loneliness.</p>

    After A Year</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  said Madame la Marquise, &ldquo;you mean to be childish
    and obstinate about this, Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may call it childish and obstinate, <i>ma tante</i>, if you wish,&rdquo; replied
    the young girl quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meseems that you evince a singular want of loyalty in the matter.
    To leave La Frontenay&mdash;now&mdash;when the work of the past year is on
    the point of bearing fruit, when our chiefs are here every day, planning,
    concerting, arranging everything for our great coup. I, for one, would not
    be absent at such a time for the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I thought that my presence at La Frontenay would be of the slightest
    use to M. de Puisaye or to our cause, I would not hesitate, <i>ma tante</i>.
    But obviously women are <i>de trop</i> in war councils. What can I do save
    listen in silence? We must all accept blindly whatever our chiefs decide.
    I am quite prepared to do that; on the other hand, I see no object in my
    being present at their deliberations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; ejaculated Madame, with a sigh of impatience. &ldquo;In
    heaven&rsquo;s name, why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that I could be of some use at Courson,&rdquo; replied Fernande
    firmly. &ldquo;Sister Mary Ignatius, from the Visitation at Mortain, has
    promised to come and stay with me for a while. She is wonderfully clever
    at healing the wounded ... and meseems that we shall have need of her skill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could make yourself more useful by organizing your base hospital
    here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Courson is more central and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could not bear to tend our wounded under the hospitality of M.
    de Maurel,&rdquo;  concluded Fernande very quietly, with an intensity of
    feeling which caused Madame to exclaim angrily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are stupid and childish, Fernande. Your father and I and Laurent
    have each told you that we look on your present attitude as nothing more
    than a silly whim. Last year&rsquo;s nonsense is a thing of the past. Ronnay,
    no doubt, has long forgotten all about it. In any case, it did not influence
    him in any way, and before he went he ordered Vardenne to attend to my installation
    at La Frontenay just as if nothing had happened. So why you should harbour
    so much foolishness in your head I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande made no reply. She turned away with a slightly impatient sigh,
    but a strange look of tenacity round her delicate mouth made her young face
    suddenly seem old and set.</p>
  <p>Laurent de Mortain was sitting in a corner of the room, seemingly absorbed
    in turning over the pages of a book, and taking no part in the discussion,
    but now&mdash;at Fernande&rsquo;s obvious distress&mdash;he threw his book
    down; then he rose and came up to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not let my mother worry you, Fernande,&rdquo; he said, as he took
    her inert hand in his and fondled it timidly. &ldquo;There is&mdash;as you
    say&mdash;no special reason why you should remain at La Frontenay after to-day,
    and every reason why you should not. It will be almost impossible, I imagine,
    to avoid unpleasant rencontres in the future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Quite gently but coolly, and with a detached little air, Fernande withdrew
    her hand, but she threw him a grateful look.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that there is no doubt that de Maurel has come back?&rdquo; interposed
    Madame coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt whatever,&rdquo; replied Laurent. &ldquo;He arrived at La
    Vieuville three days ago. The military overseers left La Frontenay yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew those brutes had gone! The very sight of them in and about
    La Frontenay made me sick with hatred these past twelve months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not sure that you will find my worthy brother more pleasant
    to look on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; rejoined Madame, with a careless shrug of the
    shoulders. &ldquo;Our bear is no doubt still suffering from a sore head,
    after the correction you administered to him last year. What a million pities
    that was!&rdquo; she added with a sigh. &ldquo;If you only had kept your
    temper then, Laurent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kept my temper?&rdquo; he retorted hotly. &ldquo;At sight of that
    lout forcing his attentions on my future wife?... I had been less than a
    man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande was not your future wife, then, Laurent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was that in her heart already. Were you not, Fernande?&rdquo; he
    added, as once again he drew near to the young girl and took hold of her
    hand. &ldquo;Thank God she is that now!&rdquo; he added, as he raised the
    little hand to his lips.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise frowned. With all her love for her youngest son she yet
    was wroth with him for having so clumsily upset all her plans. She had but
    little patience with sentimental dalliance, and would have parted Laurent
    from the object of his heart&rsquo;s desire even now if it suited her purpose,
    and without the slightest compunction.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;In any case, mother,&rdquo; rejoined the young man, after a while, &ldquo;you
    have had no cause to quarrel with Ronnay&rsquo;s burst of ill-temper, which
    took him off to Poland for close upon a year. Had he been at home, I doubt
    if you could have trafficked so easily with Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before Madame la Marquise had time to reply the door was thrown open, and
    M. le Comte entered in the company of three other men, every one of whom
    Madame greeted most effusively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Puisaye!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It is really an honour
    for this house to harbour our valiant chief! And you too, my dear Monsieur
    Prigent, and M. d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;!&rdquo; she continued, as the three men
    in turn kissed her slender, finely-chiselled hand, then bowed to Mademoiselle
    Fernande and shook Laurent de Mortain by the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a presage of greater things to come,&rdquo; she added excitedly, &ldquo;that
    you should be able to enter the grounds and the Ch&acirc;teau of La Frontenay
    like this, in open daylight ... without fear of spies!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The shorter of the three men&mdash;he whom Madame had addressed as de Puisaye&mdash;rubbed
    his hands gleefully together. He was a small man, dressed in worn and shabby
    clothes, who might have been termed good-looking but for the air of recklessness
    and dissipation which had already furrowed his face and dimmed the brightness
    of his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A presage, indeed, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;M.
    de Courson tells me that you have everything ready for our big coup, and
    that all we need decide now is the day on which it were best to carry it
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Optimistic as ever,&rdquo; broke in Fran&ccedil;ois Prigent, a tall,
    lean man, whose threadbare coat was a miracle of neatness, his down-at-heel
    boots polished till they shone, and whose nails were carefully manicured. &ldquo;Our
    friend Joseph already sees himself the master of the Maurel foundries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so he will be, by the grace of God,&rdquo; broke in Laurent confidently. &ldquo;Personally,
    I do not see how we can fail. We were just speaking of our chances when you
    arrived, and as far as it is humanly possible to foresee events, the foundries
    will be turning out arms and munitions for the King&rsquo;s Majesty within
    the week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should just like to hear exactly how we stand,&rdquo; here interposed
    the Vicomte d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;&mdash;a stout, florid man, with full lips
    and protruding eyes, which he kept fixed on Mademoiselle de Courson with
    undisguised admiration. &ldquo;De Puisaye has told me nothing definite; in
    fact, he has been talking somewhat at random. I never saw a man quite so
    confident of success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; quoth M. de Courson, whose sober manner contrasted
    vividly with the feverish excitement of all his friends. &ldquo;No wonder
    that de Puisaye is confident of success. The situation in this little corner
    of Normandy is more favourable to the King&rsquo;s cause than any that hath
    ever gone before anywhere. Of course, we all know the importance and the
    value of the La Frontenay foundries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; assented d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They belong to my nephew, Ronnay de Maurel. He inherited them from
    his father&mdash;who was my sister Denise&rsquo;s first husband&mdash;when
    he was a mere baby. Old Gaston de Maurel administered his fortune and the
    foundries for him for many years, as Ronnay joined the Republican army when
    he was little more than sixteen, and was away from home for over twelve years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Gaston de Maurel is dead, is he not?&rdquo; queried one of the
    men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he is not, worse luck!&rdquo; commented Laurent, &ldquo;though
    he was said to be dying a year and more ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo;  rejoined M. de Courson, &ldquo;he has ceased to count
    for some time&mdash;in fact, ever since Ronnay came home wounded after Austerlitz
    and took over the management of his works himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are rumours all over the country of the eccentricity of the
    two de Maurels,&rdquo;  interposed Prigent; &ldquo;they are said to be hopeless
    rustics and quite illiterate. I trust,&rdquo; he added, with old-fashioned
    gallantry, &ldquo;that Madame la Marquise will pardon this uncomplimentary
    remark about her eldest son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray you, do not spare me,&rdquo; said Madame, with a forced little
    laugh. &ldquo;My son and I have nothing in common. As a matter of fact, people
    have talked a great deal of nonsense. Ronnay de Maurel may be a rustic, but
    he is not illiterate, and I looked upon him from the first as a dangerous
    enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has influence with his men?&rdquo; asked de Puisaye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had,&rdquo; she assented, &ldquo;a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what about now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  resumed M. de Courson in his slow and deliberate way, &ldquo;as
    to that we are somewhat in the dark. Ronnay de Maurel, after spending several
    months at La Vieuville, managing and reorganizing his factories, went away
    again about a year ago, to rejoin the army&mdash;so &rsquo;twas said&mdash;though
    I personally would have thought that his wounded leg unfitted him for the
    hard campaigning to which Bonaparte subjects his troops. Be that as it may,
    however, Ronnay de Maurel has been away from home for over a year now. He
    only returned a few days ago&mdash;much aged and still more severely crippled,
    so I am told. I have not seen him. While he was away old Gaston de Maurel
    took up the reins of government at the foundries in his own feeble hands.
    He seems to have rallied somewhat unexpectedly after Ronnay&rsquo;s departure,
    and though he really is sinking fast now&mdash;so they say&mdash;he certainly
    kept an eye on his nephew&rsquo;s interests, with the help of a military
    commission whom the War Office sent down here at Ronnay&rsquo;s desire to
    supervise the armament works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A military commission!&rdquo; exclaimed d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;, with
    a contemptuous shrug of his wide shoulders. &ldquo;The War Office! Hark at
    the insolence of that Corsican upstart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The others laughed, too. The Empire of France and its vast military and
    civil organization were mere objects of derision to these irrefragable Royalists.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was this military commission?&rdquo; queried de Puisaye after
    a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, my good de Puisaye,&rdquo; exclaimed M. de Courson with a sigh, &ldquo;you
    have lived so completely out of the world these past six or seven years,
    that I suppose you have no notion how absolutely this unfortunate country
    has come under the sway of military dictatorship. Everything, my good friend,
    is under military control&mdash;the police, of course; the municipality,
    the hospitals, the schools, the Church&mdash;let alone factories and munition
    foundries. Every man who owns and controls any kind of armament works and
    who finds it difficult to cope with his men has, it seems, the right to apply
    to the War Office to send him as many representatives as he may deem expedient
    to help him keep his workers in order. These representatives are really overseers
    with military rank and military authority; very convenient for the masters,
    but none too pleasant for the men!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Military tyranny invariably treads on the heels of democratic revolt,&rdquo; said
    Prigent sententiously. &ldquo;The English have had their Cromwell, the unfortunate
    French nation is groaning under its Bonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does very little groaning just now,&rdquo; quoth M. de Courson
    dryly. &ldquo;Bonaparte is amazingly popular. The army worships him&mdash;<i>cela
    va sans dire</i>&mdash;but so does the populace. We have had great difficulty
    in rallying the proletariat round here to their allegiance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  interjected d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;what
    did this military commission do <i>enfin</i>? What did it consist of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It consisted of four or five exceedingly vulgar men in uniform, who
    ruled the Maurel foundries with a rod of iron. Punishments for slackness
    and disobedience were doled out with a free hand, and the slightest attempt
    at concerted grumbling was instantly met with handcuffs, arrest, bread and
    water and other unpleasant manifestations of military discipline. The men
    openly sighed for the return of &lsquo;the General,&rsquo; as they call Ronnay
    de Maurel, though he was none too pleasant a taskmaster either, so I&rsquo;ve
    been told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I suppose that while that military commission sat at La Frontenay,
    you were able to do very little in the way of recruiting for the King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little indeed. You see, most of the able-bodied men in the neighbourhood
    are employed in the foundries, and it is only here and there that we have
    found a malcontent who was willing to come over to us. But we have got the
    two hundred men from the powder factory; they are ready to join us the moment
    your men march on La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  exclaimed de Puisaye, as he once more rubbed his wrinkled
    hands together with an excited gesture which seemed habitual to him. &ldquo;Ah!
    there you have it at last, my good d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;. Our friend de Courson
    has explained the situation to you as it has been this past year; now let
    me tell you how we stand at this present, and what causes me to be so certain
    for the future. The two hundred men of whom de Courson speaks are convicts
    employed solely in the more dangerous processes of the manufacture of gunpowder.
    They are a rough, surly, discontented lot, who live segregated from their
    fellow-workmen in compounds, which are under special supervision, and they
    are subject to special discipline. Personally, I should say that even so
    with these restrictions it was pleasanter to manufacture gunpowder in the
    factories of La Frontenay than in the jails of Caen or the galleys of Brest.
    But apparently Paul Leroux, who is in some sort of way the acknowledged leader
    of the gang, and his mates do not think so. They hate old Gaston de Maurel,
    they hate Ronnay, they execrated the military commission. They only work
    under strict compulsion&mdash;some say under the lash; in any case, they
    only work under the terror of punishment, and they are ready at any moment
    to rebel, to murder, to blow up the factory or to come in on our side&mdash;to
    do anything, in fact, for a change from their present condition, and, above
    all, for a bribe in the form of a promise of liberty and of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While de Puisaye spoke all the men had sat down and drawn their chairs together
    round a table which stood by the window in a corner of the room. Madame la
    Marquise, too, had joined the conclave, her enthusiasm and her energy were
    at least equal to that of any man. Only Fernande sat a little outside the
    circle, at the end of a sofa, near her father and close beside the window,
    from whence she could see right over the park to the distant wooded hills,
    thick and heavy with foliage now, and with the brilliant June sun picking
    out the clumps of wild roses round the edge of the wood, and the little stream
    in the valley which wound its turbulent course to the silent pool far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; resumed Joseph de Puisaye, after a while, &ldquo;we
    all know that a set of jail-birds are not to be trusted in the long run,
    and it is not my intention that we should rely on them. But our friends here,
    Madame la Marquise de Mortain, M. de Courson and our ever loyal Laurent,
    have had certain access to these men for the past year, and they seem to
    have made marvellous use of their opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I marvel that they were allowed to visit the foundries at all,&rdquo; commented
    Fran&ccedil;ois Prigent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were only allowed the one visit,&rdquo; said Madame dryly. &ldquo;Vardenne,
    my son&rsquo;s chief bailiff, engineered that for me. It seems that when
    Ronnay went away last year he never revoked the orders whereby he placed
    Vardenne entirely at my disposal; and though old Gaston de Maurel tried to
    interfere once or twice, Vardenne looked upon me as his mistress, and his
    attitude towards me influenced a good many others. I have been treated with
    marked respect by all and sundry in and around the property. It was only
    in the factories that Gaston and the military representatives held masterful
    sway, and there, after that one visit, not one of us was ever allowed to
    set foot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That being so, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; continued de Puisaye with
    flattering earnestness, &ldquo;I can only say that what you have accomplished
    is nothing short of miraculous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  rejoined Madame unblushingly, &ldquo;my son Ronnay left
    a large sum of money behind for my use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was only Laurent, whose eyes never wandered away for long from the contemplation
    of Fernande, who noticed the quick, hot flush which at Madame&rsquo;s words
    had suffused the young girl&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; interposed de Puisaye; &ldquo;and, indeed,
    His Majesty owes you a deep debt of gratitude, Madame, for the privations
    which you endured so nobly, in order to place the bulk of that money at our
    disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to use some,&rdquo; rejoined the Marquise, &ldquo;for bribing
    Leroux, and also our go-betweens. Unfortunately, those men to whom I had
    free access&mdash;the workmen in the foundries and armament works who live
    in the villages round&mdash;were not at all tractable. They are disloyal
    almost to a man. For them Bonaparte is a god and Ronnay de Maurel his prophet;
    we had to fall back on the convicts in the powder factory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With that man Paul Leroux as the chief asset,&rdquo; added M. de
    Courson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beggars must not be choosers,&rdquo; commented de Puisaye with a
    sigh. &ldquo;Two hundred jail-birds in the King&rsquo;s cause,&rdquo; he
    added na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;are better than five hundred on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what about Leroux and his gang, then?&rdquo; queried d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the occasion of our only visit to the foundries,&rdquo; replied
    Madame, &ldquo;my brother, Laurent and I had agreed that one of us must have
    conversation with the man Leroux, with the help and connivance of the other
    two. Rumour had already told us that Leroux was the chief malcontent, who
    had given even the military representatives plenty of anxiety. We knew that
    we must get hold of him before we could approach any of the others. Fortunately
    luck was on our side. Something&mdash;I forget what&mdash;engaged the attention
    of one of the military representatives who were escorting us round the powder
    factory, my brother was able to engage the others in conversation, whilst
    Laurent drew the overseer Mathurin&rsquo;s attention to himself. This gave
    me just two minutes&rsquo; talk with Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; put in Prigent dryly. The others were listening
    in eager silence to Madame&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough for my purpose,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Leroux was in
    a surly mood, smarting under some punishment which I&rsquo;ve no doubt he
    deserved. A curse and a snarl from him directed at the overseer gave me my
    opening. In two minutes I managed to promise him freedom from his present
    position and money wherewith to create for himself a new one. He sucked in
    my suggestion greedily, and I asked him how we could communicate with one
    another in future. &lsquo;The boundary wall,&rsquo; he muttered,  &lsquo;where
    it was repaired recently&mdash;the stones are new-looking. I will throw a
    message over at that point when I can&mdash;during exercise hours&mdash;eight
    o&rsquo;clock and two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;you can be on the watch.&rsquo; There
    was no time to say more. But I was satisfied. We had made a beginning. For
    over a week one of us was on the watch twice every day outside the boundary
    wall at the spot which Leroux had indicated. It was easily recognizable because
    of the new-looking stones. The spot is a lonely one. There is a footpath
    which follows the boundary wall at this point; the other side of the footpath
    is bordered by a bit of coppice wood. Either my brother, or Laurent, or I
    remained in observation, hidden in the coppice, while we heard the tramp
    of the men exercising inside the boundary wall. After a week, a piece of
    dirty paper, weighted by a stone, was flung over the wall. It had been my
    turn to watch. I picked up the paper and managed to decipher the scrawl upon
    it. Leroux explained that on this self-same spot in the wall&mdash;but on
    the inner side&mdash;he had succeeded in loosening a stone, immediately below
    the coping; he suggested that messages to him should be slipped behind the
    stone exactly five minutes before exercising time, and the stone replaced.
    The yard, he said, was always deserted then. Needless to say that we acted
    upon his suggestion, and the very next morning Laurent succeeded in clambering
    over the wall&mdash;though it is a high one&mdash;at exactly five minutes
    before eight o&rsquo;clock, and managed to slip a message for Leroux into
    the hiding-place behind the stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It all sounds like a fairy tale!&rdquo; broke in d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; enthusiastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; here interposed M. de Courson, taking up the interrupted
    narrative, &ldquo;after that, matters became comparatively simple. Leroux
    was more than ready to do all that we asked of him, and he kept us posted
    up with everything that went on inside the factory. Thus we enjoined him,
    for the sake of his own future and for the success of our undertaking, to
    drop his rebellious attitude&mdash;to become industrious, willing, a pattern
    amongst the workmen. We told him to gain the confidence of the War Office
    representatives by every means in his power and so to ingratiate himself
    with them that he might obtain the post of chief overseer of the powder factory,
    which would confer upon him privileges that he then could utilize for our
    service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and did he succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed, he did,&rdquo; assented Madame la Marquise. &ldquo;We have
    offered him a bribe of ten thousand francs if he served us in the way we
    required: the first step towards this service was to be his good conduct&mdash;the
    second his appointment as overseer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paul Leroux is now overseer of the powder factory at La Frontenay.
    He was appointed by old Gaston de Maurel, who has been completely taken in
    by the man&rsquo;s change of front. Leroux is quoted throughout the district
    as a marvellous example of how a man can rise from his dead self, through
    patriotism and discipline, to a new life of industry and consideration. The
    epic of Leroux,&rdquo; added Madame with a laugh, &ldquo;forms the comedy
    side of the palpitating drama which we have been enacting at La Frontenay
    these past twelve months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid! Marvellous!&rdquo; acclaimed the men in chorus, and d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;,
    less well informed than the others of what had been going on, added eagerly: &ldquo;So
    much for the present; now what about the future?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The future,&rdquo; resumed M. de Courson quietly after a while, &ldquo;is,
    in fact, rosier than any of us had ever dared to hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux will prove useful, you think?&rdquo; queried Prigent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux, my dear friends,&rdquo; broke in Madame triumphantly, &ldquo;is
    prepared to hand over the entire factory to us, lock, stock and barrel. He
    has both the power and the means to do it. With the factory in our hands,
    the foundries and armament works will fall to us automatically.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; exclaimed d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; impassionedly, &ldquo;in
    Heaven&rsquo;s name how? Believe me, the whole thing still seems to me like
    a fairy-tale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure it does,&rdquo; she retorted gaily, &ldquo;and yet it is
    all real ... so real ... Laurent!&rdquo; she continued suddenly, turning
    to the young man, &ldquo;I pray you go and see if Leroux hath come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laurent obeyed readily and de Puisaye said approvingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! you have the man here; that is good!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can come and go at will now, out of his working hours,&rdquo; said
    M. de Courson, &ldquo;and for the past two weeks has been up to the ch&acirc;teau
    every day to make report to us, as to what is going on inside the factories.
    Comparative freedom is one of the privileges which have been granted him
    now that he is chief overseer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have, indeed, accomplished miracles, Madame,&rdquo; said de Puisaye,
    gallantly kissing Madame la Marquise de Mortain&rsquo;s well-shaped hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait till you have spoken with Leroux,&rdquo; retorted Madame with
    a triumphant smile.</p>
  <p>For the next moment or two no one spoke; obviously the nerves of every one
    in the room were strained to breaking point. Madame la Marquise leaned back
    in her chair. She was flushed with satisfaction and triumph; she kept her
    glowing eyes fixed upon Fernande as if she desired to challenge the young
    girl now to persist in her obstinacy of a while ago. &ldquo;How can you think
    of abandoning this scene of coming triumphs?&rdquo; she seemed to say. But
    Fernande kept her eyes resolutely averted from her aunt as well as from the
    three men, who seemed willing enough to while away these few minutes&rsquo; suspense
    by casting admiring looks on the beautiful and silent girl by the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle de Courson,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;, who had
    always been known for his gallantry, &ldquo;has not honoured us by an expression
    of opinion on any point as yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father would tell you, sir, and justly, too, no doubt,&rdquo; said
    Fernande coldly, &ldquo;that I am over-young to have an opinion on any point,
    and men have oft averred that danger looms largely on ahead whenever women
    meddle with politics.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then will Madame&rsquo;s diplomacy prove them wrong this time,&rdquo; cried
    de Puisaye gaily. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll warrant that you, Mademoiselle, have
    borne no small share in the noble work that has been going on at La Frontenay
    for the behalf of His Majesty the King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you do me too much honour, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande. &ldquo;I
    have been a passive witness here, seeing that I was&mdash;unwillingly enough,
    God knows!&mdash;a guest beneath M. de Maurel&rsquo;s roof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as Madame la Marquise uttered an exclamation of reproof and M. de
    Puisaye one of astonishment, M. de Courson broke in quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; he said, not without a stern look directed on
    Fernande, &ldquo;hath meseems proved the truth of her assertion to your satisfaction,
    my friends. She is obviously too young to understand the grave issues which
    are at stake and wherein overstrung sensibilities must not be allowed to
    play a part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame was frowning, and Fernande turned her little head once again obstinately
    away. And the three guests, scenting a family jar, promptly fell to talking
    of something else.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter &nbsp;14<br>
    The Tool</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>A moment or two later Laurent returned closely followed by Leroux. Fernande
    instinctively turned to look at the man whom she had last seen in the factory,
    covered with grime and smoke and sweat, threatening by foul words and furtive
    gestures the master who had controlled and punished him.</p>
  <p>Of a truth, she scarcely recognized him. Paul Leroux, actuated both by greed
    and by the desire to free himself from present constituted authority, had
    played his part over well. From the surly, ill-conditioned jail-bird of twelve
    months ago, he had succeeded in eliminating every unpleasant aspect, save
    that of the eyes, which had remained shifty and glowering as before. But
    he wore the cloth coat and corduroy breeches of a well-to-do artisan now;
    his hair was combed and oiled and held back in the nape of the neck with
    a tidy piece of ribbon. He wore neckcloth, stockings and shoes with buckles.
    His hands were almost clean.</p>
  <p>De Puisaye and the others surveyed this new recruit to the Royalist cause
    with genuine satisfaction. Except for that shifty look in the eyes, which
    perhaps these men, unaccustomed to psychological analysis, failed to note,
    Paul Leroux looked a well-conditioned, reliable, well-fashioned tool, ready
    for any guiding hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well now, Leroux,&rdquo; began Joseph de Puisaye, with a sort of
    condescending gruffness which he thought suitable for the occasion, &ldquo;Madame
    la Marquise de Mortain has been telling me that you have resolved to become
    once more a loyal and independent subject of His Majesty King Louis the Eighteenth
    by the grace of God, and that you are ready to throw off your allegiance
    to the adventurer who has dared to set himself upon the throne of France.
    That is so&mdash;is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If by all that talk,&rdquo; retorted the man surlily, &ldquo;you
    mean that I and my mates are heartily sick of de Maurel and of the tyranny
    of his minions, and that we don&rsquo;t mind throwing in our lot with you
    for a consideration ... then you are right. I am your man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Puisaye threw his head back and laughed, and even solemn Prigent could
    not suppress a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well said, my good Leroux,&rdquo; riposted de Puisaye unconcernedly. &ldquo;You
    put things bluntly, but that certainly is the proposition. Let me put it
    quite as bluntly to you. We have eight hundred men between this and Avranches,
    ready to march on La Frontenay on a given night. We want to obtain possession
    of the factories, the foundries and the armament works. Can you help us to
    them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can and I will,&rdquo; replied the man gruffly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll
    give me ten thousand francs for my pains, and a hundred francs apiece for
    my mates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have already agreed to that,&rdquo; rejoined de Puisaye, &ldquo;and
    I pledge you my word of honour that you shall have the money on the day when
    I myself walk into the foundries of La Frontenay as their master. Now how
    do you propose to do what we want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For one instant Leroux&rsquo; shifty eyes had flared up beneath their flaccid
    lids, as the Comte Joseph de Puisaye pledged himself to pay that ten thousand
    francs for which Leroux would readily have sold his soul to the devil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you explain to these seigneurs, Leroux,&rdquo; commanded M.
    de Courson, &ldquo;the plan which we have agreed on? They would prefer to
    hear it from your own lips, so that we can all be assured that you thoroughly
    understand all that you will have to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not to sit down?&rdquo; queried Leroux roughly.</p>
  <p>The gentlemen looked at one another in some consternation. Here was a problem
    which, simple as it seemed, nevertheless embodied a good many of the puzzles
    which would inevitably confront the old r&eacute;gime when it did succeed
    in re-establishing itself above the ruins and the ashes of Equality and of
    Fraternity. For a man in Leroux&rsquo; position to dare think of sitting
    down in the presence of his seigneurs was, indeed, an unheard-of possibility
    in the days before the proletariat had ventured to assert its rights to live
    like human beings rather than like beasts of burden. Now, of course, things
    were very different; the theory of social levelling&mdash;which had found
    expression in the title of &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; applied equally to the whilom
    aristocrat and to the vagrant in the street&mdash;made even de Puisaye marvel
    if he dared impose upon a man like Leroux those conventions which in the
    past would have been as natural to him as the indrawing and exhaling of his
    breath, but which now might arouse his resentment and turn him, headstrong
    and wrathful, against the project wherein his co-operation was of such vital
    importance.</p>
  <p>Compromise that did not grate upon the susceptibilities on either side was
    obviously the only wise course to adopt under the circumstances, and de Puisaye,
    keeping an air of haughty condescension that satisfied himself, said in a
    pleasant tone intended to conciliate Leroux: &ldquo;If the ladies have no
    objection, my man, you certainly may sit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise nodded approval, and Leroux, muttering something which
    fortunately remained inaudible, sat down.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; resumed de Puisaye after a while, &ldquo;will you
    tell these ladies and gentlemen here as clearly as you can what plan you
    can adopt in order to deliver the Maurel factories into our hands? Then we
    shall be able to see how best we can co-operate with you in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can manage things all right for you,&rdquo; said Leroux roughly. &ldquo;I
    am chief overseer of the powder factory now&mdash;what?&mdash;so I have my
    quarters inside the precincts. I live in the Lodge&mdash;you know it&mdash;it
    stands in the centre of the group of work-sheds over against the powder magazine.
    What I can do is this: I can keep half a hundred of my mates&mdash;those
    that I know I can rely on&mdash;to work overtime one evening. They can easily
    slacken work during the day, and I should then have the right to keep them
    back for two or three hours in the sheds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will form the main garrison inside the precincts,&rdquo; explained
    M. de Courson. &ldquo;On their quick and efficient work will depend our success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I quite understand that,&rdquo; assented de Puisaye. &ldquo;Now,
    how is that garrison going to work for us? I presume that there are night-watchmen
    about in the various sheds and throughout the works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; replied Leroux briefly, &ldquo;two in every shed,
    and Mathurin, the chief overseer of the foundries, sleeps in one of the main
    buildings, too. At night&mdash;if it is necessary&mdash;the alarm is given
    by ringing the bell in one of the clock towers. There are two of these towers
    in the precincts of the works, one in the main building of the foundries,
    the other above the Lodge in the powder factory, where I sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo;  commented Prigent dryly, &ldquo;the first thing
    that you and your garrison will have to do, my man, will be to hold the two
    clock towers, and then to surprise and overpower the various night-watchmen
    as simultaneously as possible ... as silently as may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  rejoined Leroux curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  added de Puisaye eagerly, &ldquo;having disposed of
    the night-watchmen, what would you do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of us will stay behind on guard in the different sheds, and
    a score or so will march on the compound, where the rest of our mates are
    penned up as if they were savage beasts that must be kept in cages.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aha! That means another hundred and fifty of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, another hundred and fifty. There are sentries at the gates of
    the compound, but we can easily overpower those. The watch will not be quite
    so strict now that the General has come home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  ejaculated de Puisaye, &ldquo;matters slacken up at the
    works when the master is home&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Leroux. &ldquo;But those military overseers
    have been absolute brutes. Things cannot be quite so bad now they have gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel is more easy-going, or more indifferent&mdash;which?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux shrugged his shoulders, then said gruffly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The General has altered a good deal since he has been away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; here interposed Madame la Marquise impatiently, &ldquo;Laurent
    and I can vouch for the fact that the watch round the compounds is not over
    strict just now. We went past there last night. There were only a couple
    of sentries at the gates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so you will have to be careful, my good Leroux,&rdquo; added
    M. de Courson, &ldquo;so as not to raise the alarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; rejoined Leroux. &ldquo;We can
    deal with the sentry easily enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you think that a couple of hundred men can march from the
    compound back to the works without being seen or heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! if they are determined not to make a noise. It is not far
    to the factories. Less than a kilom&egrave;tre. The roads are soft under
    foot. We&rsquo;ll be careful not to be seen or heard, you may be sure of
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And once you are all back at the works?&rdquo; queried M. d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just wait there, ready to let you in when you come,&rdquo; replied
    the man simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about arms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are thousands in the stores and in the cellars below the buildings!
    Enough to equip an army!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid! splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed de Puisaye with enthusiasm. &ldquo;This
    man is a jewel! what say you, gentlemen?&mdash;and well deserves the money
    which I have pledged mine honour to place into his hands. Ten thousand francs
    for the brain that devised the scheme, a hundred francs apiece for those
    who carry it through. That&rsquo;s it, is it not, my brave Leroux?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied the ex-convict with a leer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; concluded de Puisaye, &ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll call
    that settled. All that we need do now is to decide on the night when we do
    our coup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; said Leroux; &ldquo;it is dangerous
    to leave a thing like that hanging about. It may be blown upon at any time.
    I have had to warn some of my mates that there was something in the wind.
    Any one of them may be a blackleg, for aught I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man is right,&rdquo; said M. de Courson decisively; &ldquo;delays
    are always dangerous. Moreover, there is no cause for procrastination. The
    next four-and-twenty hours ought to see us fully prepared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have just to think things over,&rdquo; interposed de Puisaye
    who, throughout his adventurous career, never failed for want of caution,
    but rather from too much indecision. &ldquo;In a couple of days I could name
    the day&mdash;or rather the night&mdash;when I shall be quite ready&mdash;but
    not before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely, my dear M. de Puisaye ...&rdquo; hazarded Madame la Marquise.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame, I entreat you,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;to trust to me
    in this. I have to make my dispositions as carefully as may be. May I suggest
    that we dismiss this man for the moment, with orders to report here for duty
    the day after to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we should wait all that time,&rdquo; muttered
    Leroux.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are many things, no doubt, my man,&rdquo; said M. de Courson
    haughtily, &ldquo;many things in the councils of your betters that escape
    your comprehension. As far as arguing goes, we none of us think of quarrelling
    with the decisions of our chief. We all work for the same cause, and you
    must learn obedience, the same as we have done, or,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;you
    will have to forfeit the ten thousand francs and your own liberty, which
    are to be your reward if you serve us as we desire. Now is that clearly understood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what do you want me to do, <i>enfin</i>?&rdquo; growled Leroux,
    on whom the magic mention of money at once acted as a sedative to his surly
    temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We want you to go on quietly,&rdquo; said M. de Courson, &ldquo;just
    as you have done hitherto&mdash;trying to win M. de Maurel&rsquo;s confidence
    just as you succeeded in winning that of the military overseers. It is only
    a matter of a couple of days at most. Do not let more of your mates into
    the secret for the present, above all, remember to report for duty here the
    day after to-morrow at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Now you can
    go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux would have liked to stay and argue for a while longer. Though he
    had fully made up his mind to do exactly as he was told, both for the sake
    of the reward and for the sake of getting even with life, as he would put
    it, by striking a big blow at constituted authority, he was far too conscious
    of his own importance, far too puffed up with pride, to take such peremptory
    orders without a protest. But neither de Puisaye nor any of the others were
    in a mood to waste time by useless arguings.</p>
  <p>While Leroux was busy drawing upon his stock of impudence with a view to
    letting these &ldquo;aristos&rdquo; know that he had them in his power, and
    would stand no domineering ways from them, they had already coolly turned
    their backs on him and were deep in whispered consultation together. This
    haughty ignoring of his personality had the effect of damping the ex-convict&rsquo;s
    arrogance. He rose and gazed somewhat sheepishly on the array of backs turned
    so resolutely upon him. He twiddled his hat between his fingers, fidgeted
    first on one leg, then on the other. At last he was driven to acquiescence
    and said roughly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here at three o&rsquo;clock the day after to-morrow.
    And if you are wise, all of you,&rdquo; he added significantly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
    arrange for matters to come to a head that same night or there&rsquo;ll be
    trouble. <i>Foi de</i> Paul Leroux!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he turned on his heel and strode out of the room.</p>
  <p>But just as he was about to bang the door behind him, he happened to turn
    back again, and he encountered Mademoiselle de Courson&rsquo;s blue eyes
    fixed upon him with such an expression of loathing, that much against his
    will, and quite understandably, a hot flush of anger&mdash;or was it of shame?&mdash;rose
    right up to his forehead and to the roots of his hair.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter &nbsp;15<br>
    A Note Of Warning</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Now do you see how impossible it is that we can fail?&rdquo; exclaimed
    Madame la Marquise triumphantly, as soon as the man had gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not see how we can,&rdquo; assented de Puisaye.</p>
  <p>The others all concurred. Leroux, despite his ill-favoured appearance, despite
    his criminal antecedents which none of them here could ignore, had made a
    favourable impression on them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man means to go straight, I think,&rdquo; said Prigent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hates his present condition,&rdquo; commented M. de Courson dryly, &ldquo;and
    would sell his soul, if he had one, to be freed from it. Bonaparte will find
    that it is a dangerous experiment,&rdquo; he added na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;to
    try and use men like Leroux and his mates to help him prosecute his infamous
    wars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; continued M. d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;, &ldquo;that the
    mates on whom this man reckons are ex-convicts like himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; replied Madame la Marquise quite unabashed. &ldquo;Most
    of the men who are detailed to the powder factories in France now were serving
    life sentences for murder, rape, or arson before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose that we can trust them,&rdquo; said Prigent, with a doleful
    sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; replied Madame decisively. &ldquo;We must get hold
    of the factories, and there is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One way is as good as another,&rdquo; concluded de Puisaye cheerfully. &ldquo;When
    we have done with those brigands we must rid ourselves of them as quickly
    as we can. They will bring themselves soon enough once more under the ban
    of the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, my dear de Puisaye,&rdquo; said M. de Courson earnestly, &ldquo;will
    you tell us exactly what our respective parts are to be in the great coup
    which those jail-birds will prepare for us? Laurent and I have four hundred
    men in hiding between Courson and Mortain; we have armed them as best as
    we could with a few weapons which we received from the English agency in
    Jersey&mdash;not nearly enough, and most of the men have only got sticks
    ... but, of course,&rdquo; he added hopefully, &ldquo;there are magnificent
    stores at La Frontenay when once we hold the works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There really will be no need for arms,&rdquo; rejoined de Puisaye. &ldquo;On
    the night that we decide for our coup we will assemble at our usual place,
    the Cerf-Volant woods to the south of Mortain. I propose that I take four
    hundred men, and with them march quietly up to the factories. Leroux will
    be waiting for me, and we will order him beforehand to have all the arms
    that are necessary for the men ready out of the stores. We will then have
    six hundred men inside the factories, all thoroughly armed and equipped with
    splendid guns placed in position. We will be able to hold out against any
    attack made upon the works by de Maurel&rsquo;s work-people, even if they
    are aided by the local peasantry. In the meanwhile, you, my dear de Courson,
    will march with two hundred men on Mortain, and Laurent with another two
    hundred on Domfront, and if you both are as clever and resourceful as I take
    you to be, you will each of you surprise the small garrison in those respective
    towns, seize the town-halls, collar the <i>sous-pr&eacute;fets</i>, and hold
    the forts until Fran&ccedil;ois Prigent, on the one hand, and our good d&rsquo;Ach&eacute;,
    on the other, arrive to reinforce you, which should be at about midday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;  ejaculated Laurent. &ldquo;Monsieur Prigent and
    M. le Comte d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; will, of course, have marched all the way
    from Avranches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. We have another eight hundred men there; they are strong and
    eager, but, of course, there, as well as here, our trouble is the want of
    arms. With the armament stores of La Frontenay in our hands we shall be absolutely
    invincible. I propose, therefore, that Prigent and d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; march
    first on La Frontenay, equip themselves with arms and guns, and then divide
    into three companies, one to remain with us, one to march back on Mortain
    to reinforce M. de Courson, and the other to push on to Domfront. This man&oelig;uvre
    will cause a little delay, but its advantages are, I think, so obvious that
    it needs no discussing. With Domfront and Tinchebrai in our hands, we can
    think of La Fert&eacute;-Mac&eacute;. Our brilliant success&mdash;for it
    will be a very brilliant success&mdash;will rally a great many waverers around
    us, and, of course, holding the foundries and factories of La Frontenay will
    make us literally the masters of Normandy. Avranches will fall to us within
    a few days, and after that it will be Caen and Brest; then foreign support
    to any extent! Oh, my friends! my dear friends!&rdquo; he added, his voice
    hoarse and choked with excitement, &ldquo;what a day! what prospects! what
    a future! Madame la Marquise, by coming back to settle in these parts, by
    effecting a reconciliation with your eldest son and installing yourself in
    this ch&acirc;teau, you have reconquered France for our King!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame&rsquo;s eyes were moist with pride and emotion. Laurent could no
    longer sit still; he was pacing up and down the narrow room, and for the
    moment he almost forgot to look at Fernande, who had remained sitting quite
    still beside the window, gazing&mdash;still gazing&mdash;out into the distance
    to the slope of the hill, where lay the woods of La Frontenay and the silent
    pool.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that your plan is quite admirable, my dear de Puisaye,&rdquo; said
    M. de Courson after a while, &ldquo;and I, for one, can only give it my very
    hearty approval. In fact, you have thought everything out so well, that all
    my nephew and I can do is to obey implicitly. Now when do you think that
    you can be ready with your men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When can you be ready with yours?&rdquo; retorted de Puisaye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we are ready now. Laurent and I can assemble our company together
    any day you may decide. We can easily pass the word round and muster up at
    the Cerf-Volant woods outside Mortain on any night you think most suitable.
    It would not be safe to muster at Courson, and though Mortain is a good deal
    farther, it is much more lonely and, as you say, it would be best for us
    all to start out at one and the same time&mdash;shall we say, at eleven o&rsquo;clock
    in the evening. You would then reach La Frontenay and Laurent get to Domfront
    almost simultaneously, bar accidents. Laurent and I can surprise the garrisons
    at dead of night before either of them can get wind of the affair, and thus
    obviate the possibility of their falling on you ere you on your side can
    reach La Frontenay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That being so,&rdquo; rejoined de Puisaye, &ldquo;why not decide
    on the day after to-morrow? I shall have my four hundred men assembled at
    Mortain too, by that time, and we have given the man Leroux orders to present
    himself here on that day. We will&mdash;with her permission&mdash;entrust
    Madame la Marquise with the happy task of telling Leroux that he must arrange
    his coup for the same night, and be prepared for my arrival with my small
    contingent. Whilst he waits for me he must open up the stores and get out
    all the small arms that he can; then directly I arrive I can get what guns
    there are into position, and prepare for a regular siege if it is necessary.
    I cannot help wishing that the next morning may see us attacked in full force
    by de Maurel&rsquo;s work-people, for then, when Prigent and d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; come
    upon the scene, they would get the attacking party in the rear, and though
    insufficiently armed, they would, nevertheless, effect heavy slaughter, and
    gain an immediate and brilliant victory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are we going to live until the day after to-morrow?&rdquo; sighed
    Laurent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How, indeed?&rdquo; was echoed by all the others in the room.</p>
  <p>The very atmosphere seemed redolent of triumph, of exultation, of confidence
    in victory. The co-operation of the ex-convict and of two hundred of his
    kind had brought forth a situation which had endless possibilities in it.
    The general consensus of opinion was that failure was absolutely out of the
    question. Never, since the English agencies had withdrawn their active support,
    had the prospects of a successful Royalist rising been so rosy. De Puisaye
    was glowing with enthusiasm, Prigent had laid aside his solemnity, d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; ceased
    to ogle Fernande; even M. de Courson&rsquo;s pale cheeks were flushed. As
    for Madame&mdash;she was already present in thoughts at the first reception
    which Queen Marie-Jos&eacute;phine-Louise would be holding at the Tuileries.
    As for Fernande, everyone was fortunately too much excited, too much engrossed
    in schemes and plans to pay much attention to her, or her silence and extraordinary
    aloofness from the all-absorbing topic of conversation could not have passed
    unperceived.</p>
  <p>It was late in the afternoon before everything was said that had to be said,
    before every plan had been discussed, every argument worn threadbare. Then
    at last the council of war agreed to disperse, and Joseph de Puisaye and
    his two friends took final leave of Madame la Marquise and of Fernande, whilst
    M. de Courson went with them, in order to escort them as far as the boundary
    gates of the park.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>It was only when the men had gone that Madame la Marquise bethought herself
    of her niece, and of the latter&rsquo;s strange attitude while the council
    of war had been going on; whereupon she frowned and then remarked testily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, Fernande, I do not understand you. Here you have been
    sitting like a stuffed dummy, the while the destinies of France were being
    talked of by men who are sacrificing their lives for her. Where is your enthusiasm
    of a year ago, my child? Where is your patriotism? And what, in Heaven&rsquo;s
    name, hath come over you these past few days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; replied Fernande with a little sigh
    of impatience; &ldquo;only a foreboding, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A foreboding?&rdquo; queried Madame. &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it seems to me that you are all so confident
    ... so sure of success....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, are not you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that M. de Puisaye&mdash;that you all, in fact, are not taking
    one vastly important factor into your reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Fernande? What factor are you alluding to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To M. le Comte Ronnay de Maurel, of course,&rdquo; replied Fernande.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  queried Madame tartly, &ldquo;what about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only, <i>ma tante</i>, that M. de Maurel is not the nonentity that
    you and M. de Puisaye seem to imagine. He has just come back from Poland,
    and at once dismissed the military overseers who had taken his place in his
    absence. Does that look as if he meant to let the reins of government slip
    through his fingers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, child. Ronnay de Maurel may have
    every intention in the world of ruling over his work-people and being master
    in his own factories, but we are going to relieve him of that responsibility
    in a day or two&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is where you are wrong, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; broke in Fernande
    firmly. &ldquo;Ronnay de Maurel is not a man from whom you can wrest a responsibility
    or a right quite so easily. Think you he doth not already suspect Leroux&rsquo; treachery
    and hath not taken the first steps to combat it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I do not think it for a moment,&rdquo; replied Madame with her
    usual decisiveness. &ldquo;Ronnay has only been home two days; he cannot
    yet have taken up the reins of government at his factories with any assurance.
    Moreover, Gaston de Maurel hath claimed all his nephew&rsquo;s attention.
    The old man is really dying at last, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Comte de Maurel is quite capable of devoting his time to his
    sick kinsman and of keeping an eye on the administration of his factories
    at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have a very high opinion of my son&rsquo;s capabilities,
    my dear,&rdquo; said Madame la Marquise snappishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have seen him with his workmen, remember,&rdquo; retorted Fernande. &ldquo;I
    have seen him deal with men like Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?... And?...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And as I told you just now, he is not a man whom the Leroux&rsquo; or
    the de Puisayes are going to hoodwink, or to make a fool of; he is not a
    man who can be caught napping, or from whose nerveless hands the sceptre
    of power can so easily be snatched. Ronnay de Maurel may to all outward appearances
    be a rustic&mdash;an unsophisticated boor&mdash;but he is a man, for all
    that&mdash;a man and not a puppet&mdash;he is very wide-awake&mdash;he is
    alive, oh! very much alive!&mdash;and, believe me, he will know how to guard
    what is not only his own, but is also of priceless value to the Emperor whom
    he worships.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity, child!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame with ill-concealed asperity. &ldquo;Your
    indifference of a while ago seems to have given place to marvellous vehemence
    in the defence of our common enemy. &rsquo;Tis lucky your future husband
    is not here to see your flaming cheeks now and your glowing eyes. But perhaps,&rdquo; she
    added with a dry, forced laugh, &ldquo;you will be good enough to explain
    the meaning of these Cassandra-like prophetic warnings, for, of a truth,
    I do confess that I do not understand them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An you will jeer, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; said Fernande quietly; &ldquo;&rsquo;twere
    better I said no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is your duty to say more, child, now you have said so much,&rdquo; said
    Madame gravely. &ldquo;What is it that in our council of war has struck you
    as rash or ill-advised? I will confess that you do know my son Ronnay better
    than any of us; you have seen him more often. He has made love to you, and,
    in so doing, he may have revealed some traits in his character which have
    remained hidden from us. Speak, therefore, child, openly and frankly. You
    wish to warn us all. Against what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Against bribing a criminal&mdash;a jail-bird like Leroux, to betray
    his master,&rdquo; replied Fernande calmly.</p>
  <p>Madame laughed and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;my dear, is childish. On Leroux&rsquo; help
    rests the whole edifice of our plans and our entire hope of success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that well enough,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande. &ldquo;I know
    that you are not like to heed anything I say. I only spoke because you forced
    me. Think you,&rdquo; she added more vehemently, &ldquo;that if I had thought
    for a moment that you, or father, or M. de Puisaye, would have listened to
    me, I would not have dragged myself at your feet and kissed the ground and
    licked the dust and never risen until you heard, until you gave up all thought
    of joining issue with a miserable traitor, a criminal like Leroux. It is
    because I knew that my voice would count as less than nothing with you all
    that I remained silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You speak with strange excitement, child....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I speak as I feel,&rdquo; she retorted hotly. &ldquo;I speak because
    something in me tells me that some awful disaster will come to us and to
    our cause through trafficking with Leroux and his kind. Of this I am as convinced, <i>ma
    tante</i>, as I am of the fact that M. de Maurel already suspects our machinations,
    and on this,&rdquo;  she concluded with marvellous forcefulness, &ldquo;I
    would stake my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mad, Fernande!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad?&rdquo;  retorted the girl hotly, &ldquo;mad because I implore
    you not to sully our cause by joining issue with a handful of felons; mad
    because I foresee an abyss of misery and of remorse for us all in this monstrous
    treachery which we have planned. Ah! if it only meant a ruse of war, a clever
    intrigue to catch an unwary foe! But what M. de Puisaye has planned may mean
    murder, <i>ma tante</i>&mdash;the murder of a brave man&mdash;and that man
    your son ...!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande! In Heaven&rsquo;s name, what does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cry came from the door, which had suddenly been thrown open, and Fernande,
    almost beside herself with the vehemence of her emotion, turned and found
    herself face to face with Laurent, who was standing under the lintel, his
    cheeks pale, his breath coming and going in rapid gasps through his parted
    lips, his dark eyes fixed gloweringly upon her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, will you explain?&rdquo; continued the young man peremptorily,
    as he turned to Madame la Marquise and, closing the door behind him, strode
    into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, my good Laurent,&rdquo; replied Madame testily, &ldquo;that
    I cannot do. The explanation of this extraordinary outburst on the part of
    your fianc&eacute;e can only come from her. As for myself, I confess that
    I am utterly bewildered by this torrent of recrimination which Fernande has
    chosen to let loose upon us all. It seems that M. de Puisaye is a murderer
    and we his accomplices ... that we are bribing a felon to assassinate Ronnay
    de Maurel, for whose welfare my niece appears to evince an extraordinarily
    deep interest. You must forgive me, therefore, if I leave you to deal with
    the situation as best you can. When Fernande is in a more rational frame
    of mind, we can discuss the question of her leaving for Courson as soon as
    may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Madame sailed out of the room and Laurent was left alone with Fernande.
    Already the strain seemed to have been lifted from her nerves; the hectic
    flush of a while ago had fled from her cheeks and left her face pale and
    her eyes calm and clear. Laurent approached her, quivering with excitement;
    the insensate jealousy which never ceased to torture him had him now under
    its evil sway. He tried to draw Fernande close to him, and almost uttered
    a cry of rage when she appeared unresponsive and turned quite coolly away
    from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  he said, and tried in vain to subdue the harshness
    of his voice, which he felt must grate unpleasantly on the young girl&rsquo;s
    overstrung nerves, &ldquo;I heard most of what you said to my mother. She
    is hurt&mdash;and justly so&mdash;at your attitude. Will you let me go to
    her with a message from you, telling her that you were overwrought and hardly
    conscious of what you said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may go, Laurent,&rdquo; replied Fernande coldly, &ldquo;and tell <i>ma
      tante</i> that I am deeply grieved if what I said did really offend her.
      I did not mean to offend. I only meant to strike a note of warning. It
      hath proved jarring,&rdquo; she added dejectedly, &ldquo;and of no avail.
      Therefore am I doubly sorry. But, even so, I would not have it unsaid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not even if I were to tell you, Fernande, that your hot defence of
    that traitor went to my heart like a knife and caused me infinite pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If what I said about your brother hurts you, Laurent, then you must
    be harbouring thoughts about me which are an insult to your future wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only I could believe that you loved me!&rdquo; he cried, as with
    sudden and passionate impulse he once more tried to take her in his arms.
    His glowing eyes strove to meet her glance, but she seemed utterly unapproachable
    as she stood beside him like a slender white lily, with her small head averted
    and her blue eyes looking out into the distance as far away from him as was
    the heaven of which he dreamed. His arms dropped listlessly to his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I only could believe that you loved me, Fernande,&rdquo; he reiterated
    sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Laurent,&rdquo; she murmured gently. Of her own free will now
    she placed her cool fingers upon his lips, and he seized upon them hungrily
    and covered them with kisses. &ldquo;Poor Laurent! I told you, did I not,
    on the day nearly a year ago now, when I solemnly plighted my troth to you
    in response to my father&rsquo;s wish, that I had it not in me to love any
    man? Methinks that I shall never know really what love is.... I shall never
    know,&rdquo; she added, with a quaint, melancholy little sigh, &ldquo;the
    kind of love which is for ever wounding and hurting the thing it loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Fernande,&rdquo; he cried, already repentant, cursing
    himself for his perpetual folly, and knowing all the while that nothing would
    ever cure him of it. &ldquo;I am a jealous brute, I know. I hate and despise
    myself every time that my temper offends you. But if you only knew, Fernande
    ...&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;if only you could understand....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do know, Laurent, and I do understand ... am I not always ready
    to forgive?... But you must try, dear, to trust me a little better. A scene
    like the one we have just had is not an over good augury for our future,
    is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hated to hear you speak so warmly about that man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I called him brave ... can you deny that he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No ... but....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she said soothingly, dealing with him with infinite
    gentleness now that she had reduced him to a state of remorse. &ldquo;Go
    and speak with <i>ma tante</i>, and make my excuses to her, if you think
    they are necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She held out her cheek to him with one of her most captivating smiles, and
    poor Laurent was ready to sob with delight. She allowed him to take her in
    his arms and to kiss her sweet lips, her eyes, her hair, and if she did not
    respond to his caresses quite as ardently as he would have wished, he had,
    nevertheless, no cause to complain that she withdrew herself from them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My mother said that we were to discuss the question of your going
    to Courson,&rdquo; he said, before he finally took leave of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that,&rdquo; she rejoined coolly, &ldquo;you may tell <i>ma
      tante</i> that I have changed my mind. She did not approve of my going,
      did she? so I will, if I may,&rdquo;  she added, with a sweet air of innocence, &ldquo;remain
      at La Frontenay for a few days longer with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande, you are an angel!&rdquo; he exclaimed. And he dropped on
    his knee and kissed her little hand with the same fervour as he would have
    kissed the robe of a Madonna. His head was bent and the tears of remorse
    still hung upon his lashes, or else, no doubt, he would have perceived the
    strange, elusive smile which lingered round his beloved one&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Away from Fernande&rsquo;s bewitching presence Laurent de Mortain was conscious
    once more of the gnawing pangs of jealousy, nor did his mother contrive to
    soothe him in any way. Madame la Marquise was terribly angered against her
    niece. The girl&rsquo;s accusing words: &ldquo;And that man your son!&rdquo; rang
    unpleasantly and insistently upon her ear. Not that fanaticism allowed her
    for a moment to feel compunction&mdash;let alone remorse&mdash;at what she
    had done, nor did she delude herself for a moment as to the probable truth
    of Fernande&rsquo;s accusations. De Puisaye&rsquo;s plan of seizing the La
    Frontenay factories through the mediation of a set of unscrupulous blackguards
    would certainly entail bloodshed&mdash;murder, perhaps&mdash;if, indeed,
    the slaughter of a dangerous enemy could be called by such an ugly name when
    the cause was so holy and so just.</p>
  <p>That the dangerous enemy happened to be her own son did not weigh for a
    moment with Madame la Marquise. Her heart and soul were wrapped up in the
    cause of King Louis, and if her beloved Laurent had at any time proved a
    traitor to it, she would have plucked him out of her heart and left him to
    die a traitor&rsquo;s death, with the stoicism of a Spartan mother sacrificing
    an unfit son to the general weal of her country. But though fanaticism did
    in so complete a manner rule her every thought and smother every one of her
    sensibilities, Madame did not like to hear her actions criticized, nor the
    callousness of her heart brought so crudely to the light of day. She was
    very angry with Fernande, and seeing that Laurent&rsquo;s jealousy had been
    very fully aroused by the scene which he had witnessed, she was willing to
    let her son be the avenger of her own offended dignity. She knew that Laurent
    could make his fianc&eacute;e suffer acutely while he was a prey to one of
    his moods, and that he would find many a word wherewith to wound her as deeply
    as she had dared to wound his mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said Madame, with a good deal of acerbity,
    when she was discussing with Laurent, a quarter of an hour or so later on,
    Fernande&rsquo;s inexplicable conduct of a while ago. &ldquo;It is strange
    that she should so suddenly desire to remain at La Frontenay when not more
    than a couple of hours ago she was so set on going away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, mother?&rdquo; he asked with a frown. &ldquo;Do
    you think...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; broke in Madame testily. &ldquo;Fernande
    has been very strange of late. Her attitude to-day has been absolutely incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; murmured Laurent with some hesitation
    and not a little shamefacedness, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that she has
    met Ronnay again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You never know what Fernande has done or what she may do,&rdquo; rejoined
    Madame evasively. &ldquo;She has become so headstrong and so secretive, I
    really do not know what to make of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All of which did not tend to pour oil on the troubled waters of poor Laurent&rsquo;s
    jealousy; in fact, the more Madame talked, the more wretched he became, until
    his face became literally distorted with wrath and with misery. Then she
    felt sorry for him; compunction smote her, for she did not genuinely believe
    that Fernande had done anything to justify her lover&rsquo;s suspicions,
    and she also realized at the same time that she was doing considerable harm
    by irritating her son&rsquo;s nerves with her spiteful promptings, at a moment
    when he had need of all his coolness and courage to accomplish the important
    task which his chief had assigned to him. The campaign would begin now in
    earnest; Laurent would perforce be often separated from his fianc&eacute;e,
    and the cause of King Louis would be ill served if his heart and his thoughts
    remained at La Frontenay while he was leading a surprise attack upon Domfront.
    This being, as always, Madame la Marquise de Mortain&rsquo;s primary consideration,
    she drew in her horns and did her best to undo the mischief which she had
    been at great pains to wreak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; she said soothingly, &ldquo;to worry yourself
    unnecessarily about Fernande. She certainly is very headstrong&mdash;she
    is also self-willed and thoughtless; but she has loved you ever since you
    and she were children together. There is not a thought of guile in her, and
    the provoking little scene with which she regaled me just now may have been
    due to pique, that I did not at once accept her prophetic warnings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could think so,&rdquo; sighed Laurent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must bring yourself to think so, my dear,&rdquo; retorted Madame
    dryly. &ldquo;You have far more important things to dwell on at this moment
    than the vagaries of a young girl&rsquo;s moods. Not only will the success
    of M. de Puisaye&rsquo;s plans depend upon your coolness and your valour,
    but his life and the lives of the men whom he leads will hang upon the master-stroke
    which you will have to accomplish by surprising the garrison of Domfront
    ere wind of the affair hath reached the fort, and by holding a couple of
    hundred soldiers of Bonaparte in durance until reinforcements can reach you.
    It is a heavy task for such young shoulders, my son,&rdquo; she added earnestly. &ldquo;May
    God give you strength to carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would give my life,&rdquo; murmured Laurent dully, &ldquo;for the
    right to remain at La Frontenay for the next few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A Marquis de Mortain,&rdquo; broke in Madame with rigid sternness, &ldquo;cannot
    lag behind when those of his kindred are risking their lives for their King.
    Have no fear for Fernande, my dear boy,&rdquo; she added more gently. &ldquo;It
    is as well that she stays here with me. I can keep an eye on her. You can
    trust me to keep your treasure in safety for you, against your speedy return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obviously Laurent was neither convinced nor pacified; but there was nothing
    more to be said. Within the next few moments M. de Courson returned, and
    uncle and nephew had to talk over their plans of the next forty-eight hours.
    It were best, so M. de Courson decided, that they should go immediately to
    Courson and make arrangements for mustering their men there before the general
    rally in the Cerf-Volant woods two days later. Laurent would have wished
    to take a final, impassioned farewell of his fianc&eacute;e, but on this
    M. de Courson&mdash;as his senior and his leader&mdash;pronounced a decided
    veto. This was not the time for sentimental dalliance and indulgence in nerve-racking
    fits of jealousy. Laurent now was amenable to military discipline, which
    was all the more strict as subservience to it was purely voluntary.</p>
  <p>Madame gave her unqualified approval to M. de Courson&rsquo;s decision.
    Fernande, she declared, would be well guarded and under her own eye. She&mdash;Madame&mdash;would
    see that the child&rsquo;s emotional nature did not lead her into some headstrong
    act of folly.</p>
  <p>After a while Laurent had perforce to yield; disobedience was out of the
    question. At this juncture it would even bear an uglier name than that; and
    though the young man&rsquo;s heart was aching for a last sight of his beloved,
    though he longed to plunge his gaze into her blue eyes and to read within
    their limpid depths all that he would have longed to find, of love, of ardour
    and of fidelity, he braced himself up for a great effort, and with, at any
    rate, outward calm, he bade his mother an affectionate farewell and finally
    followed M. de Courson out of the ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise, from the window beside which she was standing, was able
    to watch the two slim figures&mdash;her son and her brother&mdash;as they
    strode rapidly down the broad avenue of the park, until a clump of tall-growing
    conifers hid them from her view.</p>
  <p>Then she fell on her knees, and resting her elbows on the window-ledge,
    she buried her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God! My God!&rdquo; she prayed, with all the ardour of a devotee, &ldquo;give
    success to our arms! Bring those two back triumphant and victorious! Bring
    our beloved King back to his throne again!&rdquo;</p>

    The Irreparable</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Ronnay de Maurel had been absent nearly a year from his home. He had joined
    the Emperor in Poland, and despite his game leg, he had fought at Jena and
    Auerstadt, at Eylau and at Friedland.</p>
  <p>When the two Emperors met upon the bridge at Tilsit and decided on the terms
    of peace, de Maurel, created Marshal of France on the field of Auerstadt,
    returned quietly to La Vieuville in time, he hoped, to close the eyes of
    old Gaston and to hear his last dying words. He had been home just three
    days. The day after his arrival he sent back the military representatives
    who had looked after his factories for him during his absence, and quietly
    took up once more the reins of government, which an unendurable heart-ache
    had caused to drop temporarily out of his hands. He laid aside his fine uniform
    and once more took up his blouse and his woollen cap. Old Gaston was too
    feeble to note the subtle change which had come over his nephew during twelve
    months of rough campaigning among the snows and the marshes of Poland; he
    did not perceive how passing seldom Ronnay ever spoke now, or how he sat
    late into the night staring straight out before him with a yearning gaze
    in his dark, deep-set eyes. He had passed through Paris on his way home and
    brought back a number of books with him&mdash;he who before this had never
    troubled about one in his life&mdash;and when his eyes ached from staring
    into vacancy, he would open one of these books, and drawing the lamp closer
    to him, he would rest his elbow on the table and shade his face with his
    hand and become so absorbed, that the grey dawn would oft find him still
    sitting in the invalid&rsquo;s room, with the book open in front of him&mdash;unless
    he had pushed it aside and sat with his head buried in his hands.</p>
  <p>On the day of his arrival he had, with the help of Madame Lapin, reorganized
    the La Vieuville household on a more comfortable basis. But little could
    be done in the way of comforts for the dying man; he was past noticing if
    his room was aired or his food brought to him at regular intervals. The village
    doctor visited him from time to time, but there was nothing to be done now.
    The machinery of life was worn out; for over a year now it had threatened
    to break down altogether&mdash;an iron constitution and an invincible will
    to live until the beloved nephew came home once more, had alone kept the
    enfeebled heart to its work.</p>
  <p>To Ronnay de Maurel the aspect of La Vieuville seemed infinitely dreary;
    the thought of the factories and the foundries singularly uninspiring. What
    mattered it that he had come home&mdash;a great deal older, a little more
    crippled, more impatient and more indifferent? Old Gaston could not now last
    more than a few days, and the representatives of the War Office had seen
    to it that the output of guns and of munitions did not fall too far short
    of the Emperor&rsquo;s needs. Why should a man come home&mdash;a man who
    had courted death in an hundred desperate fights&mdash;a man who had nothing
    to live for, no one to care for, no one who would rejoice when he returned
    or who would weep if he fell ... when countless precious sons and brothers
    and lovers and husbands were left to rot unburied on the ice-covered plains
    of Poland, and countless mothers and widows mourned, broken-hearted, at their
    loss?</p>
  <p>But it was not his way to let things drift. Peace had, of a truth, been
    signed at Tilsit, but it was not like to be a lasting peace. The European
    Powers had once and for all decided that France was not to remain in bondage
    to the Emperor whom she worshipped. He was in everybody else&rsquo;s way,
    he must be swept aside in order to make room for the effete and incompetent
    Bourbons, who were hanging on to the coat-tails of England and Austria and
    Russia, with a view to reaping the chestnuts which others had pulled out
    of the fire for them. De Maurel was one of those who would have preferred
    their idolized Emperor to sit at home after this last campaign, to enjoy
    the fruit of his victories and to prove to the world that France, when she
    divested herself of the old r&eacute;gime, had gained a benefactor, even
    though she had had to pass through fire and water, through crime and ignominy,
    ere she got him. But to know Napoleon intimately, as did the privileged few,
    was to realize that measureless ambition which was destined to hurl him,
    not only down from the giddy heights of triumph and of victory whereon his
    glorious achievements of the last two campaigns had established him, but
    also from his secure place within the heart of his people, a place which
    he would only reconquer when his mortal remains were brought back to France
    after the years of conflict and of misery which were to come.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>That all was not well at the factories de Maurel did not fail to perceive
    within four-and-twenty hours of his return. The military overseers had done
    their duty&mdash;the output of munitions, if not lavish, had been adequate,
    and there had been no open rebellion among the workers. But in the first
    tour of inspection which the master made of his demesnes he realized how
    more than surly was the temper of former malcontents now and how sorely had
    the loyalty of the honest workmen been tried.</p>
  <p>Complaints and grumblings had not been listened to now for over a year;
    the rough admonitions of a sympathetic taskmaster had given place to peremptory
    commands from military disciplinarians and to threats of condign punishment
    at the slightest sign of discontent. It would take many weeks of untiring
    patience and firmness to re-establish the happy concord which reigned in
    the foundries and armament works a year ago. As for the powder factories,
    de Maurel was compelled to reserve judgment as to where real grievances began
    and slackness and covert rebellion ended. Leroux, suave and obsequious, at
    once aroused his distrust, but the War Office representatives, when they
    left, had given the man an excellent character, both for trustworthiness
    and for industry, and de Maurel was not the man to act on mere intuition.</p>
  <p>Intuition had played him such a damnable trick a while ago when he would
    have staked his soul on the loyalty of a pair of blue eyes!</p>
  <p>Mathurin certainly struck a note of warning, but he found his master so
    unapproachable, that he dared not say much, and old Gaston had long since
    been too feeble to see anything that was going on.</p>
  <p>Of Madame la Marquise up at La Frontenay he could glean but little information.
    M. le Marquis had been absent a great deal during the year with M. de Courson,
    and Mademoiselle Fernande had remained with her aunt during the absence of
    M. le Marquis; but neither she nor Madame had done more than pay the one
    visit to the foundries as the orders of the War Office authorities were very
    peremptory on that point. The ladies were seldom seen outside the limits
    of the ch&acirc;teau; they had dismissed all the servants whom Vardenne had
    engaged for them locally, and replaced them gradually by importations of
    their own.</p>
  <p>It was generally understood in the district that Mademoiselle de Courson
    was now formally affianced to M. le Marquis de Mortain.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>It was on the day following the council of war at La Frontenay that Ronnay
    de Maurel started out soon after dawn for one of his favourite tramps across
    the moors and through the woods. Before he went away last July he had left
    very strict orders that no one should henceforth be allowed to wander in
    the La Frontenay woods. The explanation was given that valuable game was
    being preserved there, and one of old Gaston&rsquo;s last efforts at administering
    his nephew&rsquo;s property was to establish in accordance with Ronnay&rsquo;s
    express instructions, a veritable army of keepers in the district, with discretionary
    powers to warn every trespasser off the forbidden grounds.</p>
  <p>De Maurel, therefore, when he started off on that exquisite June morning
    to re-visit the place where he had suffered the most terrible mental torture
    which heart of man could endure, felt confident that he would remain secure
    from intrusion; that, above all, he need not fear a rencontre which would
    inevitably reopen the burning wound which time had not even begun to heal.</p>
  <p>To him, now that a year of hard work and hard fighting had passed over that
    awful day of misery and of shame, it seemed as if time had stood still; as
    if it had been but a few hours ago that he had started out&mdash;just as
    he did now&mdash;on that walk beneath the early morning sunshine, which had
    ended in such an appalling disaster&mdash;in the total wreckage of his life,
    of his newly-awakened youth, of every newly-risen hope of home and of happiness.
    Then, as now, the dew still lay upon the carpet of moss, the mountain-ash
    and the elder were in full bloom, and the mating birds had finished building
    their nests. Then, as now, the swallows circled swiftly overhead, and a lark
    rose from the ground at his feet and sang its joyful song of thanksgiving
    to God.</p>
  <p>But then the world held for him an exquisite being who was all tenderness
    and charm, who had lured him with her blue eyes, until he remembered that
    he, too, was young and he, too, had a right to love and happiness; the woods
    had held for him a nymph with feet like the petals of flowers, with sun-kissed
    hair which shone like living gold. A nymph! a creature of grace, of air,
    of light, whose fragrance was akin to a wilderness of roses, whose laugh
    was like the song of the lark, and whose arms were white and slender like
    the lilies! And when she stood before him or lay placid and drowsy in his
    arms, mysterious voices in the woods had murmured in his ear insidious promises
    of happiness to come.</p>
  <p>He, poor fool, had listened to those voices&mdash;sirens&rsquo; voices,
    which are wont to lure the unfortunate mariner on life&rsquo;s ocean to his
    own destruction&mdash;to his own misery and undoing; sirens&rsquo; voices
    which whispered that the exquisite fairy-like form which lay like a nestling
    bird in his arms would one day be his for always&mdash;that she would always
    snuggle up, just like this, against his shoulder; that he would one day cull
    a kiss from those perfect lips, that he would one day have the right to hold
    her and keep her and to guard her for always against every ill.</p>
  <p>Since then the voices of the sirens had turned to harsh and dismal screeching;
    the hopes of a year ago had turned to blank despair, and the savour of that
    triumphal aspiration turned to the dead sea fruit of unconquerable humiliation.</p>
  <p>Prussian cannon had disdained the prey which Ronnay de Maurel had offered
    with crazy recklessness; he had come back laden with honours, a broken-hearted
    and lonely man; and the birds still sang, the woods were still fragrant,
    the world of sunshine and of springtide, of flowering trees and full-blown
    roses mocked at his irretrievable beggary.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>And when Fernande de Courson started out that same morning, soon after daybreak,
    in a random spirit of wandering, and her footsteps led her&mdash;unconsciously,
    perhaps&mdash;in the direction of the woods, she, too, had little thought
    of meeting Ronnay de Maurel again. The hour was so early that not another
    soul was abroad&mdash;so early that not a sound stirred the quietude of valley
    and of hills save the distant murmuring of the tiny stream which found its
    resting-place in the silent pool.</p>
  <p>It was an hour, too, wherein even the keepers established by old Gaston
    to patrol the La Frontenay woods usually slackened their vigilance. It was
    too late for poachers, too early for tramps; Fernande, as she left the meadows
    behind her, turned into a woodland path unperceived.</p>
  <p>For a time she walked on somewhat aimlessly. It was deliciously cool under
    the trees, and the smell of budding blossom, of wet moss and of pine, acted
    as a tonic on her overstrung nerves. She wandered on, not allowing herself
    to think. All through the past few days she had tried not to feel that Ronnay
    de Maurel had come back; she had tried to forget that he was near, that any
    day, any moment, if she took her walks abroad she might come face to face
    with him.</p>
  <p>And, in a measure, she had succeeded. She was now Laurent de Mortain&rsquo;s
    future wife, the follies of a year ago must yield to a sober view of future
    events. Except for that one brief, if vehement outburst yesterday in the
    presence of Madame&rsquo;s monstrous callousness, she had succeeded in relegating
    the man to whom she had done an infinite wrong to the furthermost recesses
    of her mind. But here, in these woods where every murmur among the trees,
    every call of bird or fragrance of flower, reminded her of him&mdash;in the
    woods through which she had once passed nestling against his shoulder, secure
    in the embrace of his strong arms, thoughts of him went hammering through
    her brain. All the dangers which beset him through Joseph de Puisaye&rsquo;s
    plan of campaign and Leroux&rsquo; treachery caused her heart to beat with
    a nameless horror and fear. At every moment she thought to hear his rugged
    voice calling her by name, and even now her heart almost stilled its beating
    as a woodland echo seemed to bring back to her ear that cry of triumph which
    had rent her very soul: &ldquo;You love me, Fernande!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And as she wandered on, she lost count of time, and soon she found that
    she had lost her way. She had never entered the La Frontenay woods from the
    direction of the ch&acirc;teau since first she came to stay there, and she
    had no idea now which way to turn in order to go back home again. Soon she
    felt tired and dispirited; she did not know how long she had been wandering,
    nor how far she had gone.</p>
  <p>Then all at once she knew where she was. She had walked a few steps along
    a moss-covered path, which wound its way right through the thicket, and suddenly
    there came a break in the coppice, and there before her lay the silent pool,
    with its mossy banks and clumps of wild iris and of meadowsweet, and the
    fallen tree-trunk where she had sat that day&mdash;a whole year ago.</p>
  <p>And as she made her way nearer to the water, she saw Ronnay de Maurel sitting
    there on the bank; he was leaning against the fallen tree-trunk, his elbow
    resting upon it and his head supported by his hand.</p>
  <p>She would have fled if she could, for at sight of him she had at once realized
    that to meet him here and now was the last thing in the world that she had
    wished. She realized that rather than he should see her, rather than she
    should speak with him, she would have run for miles, fearful only lest he
    should follow her track. How could she meet him&mdash;even to speak the words
    of contrition which for the past year she had longed to utter one day&mdash;how
    could she meet him whilst up at La Frontenay her own kindred, her own friends,
    those whom she loved, were planning treachery and murder against him!</p>
  <p>But unfortunately now there was no time to run away; already he had seen
    her, and before she could stir from the spot, he had struggled to his feet
    and was coming towards her. Even then she would have given worlds to be able
    to go, but she could not. For one thing, he walked more haltingly than he
    had ever done before&mdash;and then he looked older, less sure of himself,
    more forlorn and solitary. He dragged his wounded leg more markedly&mdash;more
    as he used to do in the olden days when he was overtired, and all her womanly
    tenderness and pity went out to him, because of that indefinable air of helplessness
    which his lameness momentarily gave him. Not only did Fernande de Courson
    not beat a hasty retreat, but when he paused, irresolute and timid, it was
    she who came a step or two nearer to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I am trespassing,&rdquo; she said tentatively, for,
    of a truth, she felt suddenly frightened&mdash;frightened at his look&mdash;a
    look of bitter resentment, she thought, of hate perhaps as absolute as she
    had felt for him in days gone by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, it is I,&rdquo; he retorted dryly, &ldquo;who have no right
    to be here, seeing that it is evidently Mademoiselle de Courson&rsquo;s favourite
    walk. By your leave, I will vacate the field. The keepers should have warned
    me. Had they done so, I would not have come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bowed in his usual awkward style and made as if to go, but with a word
    Fernande called him back. For a moment or two he hesitated. No doubt he,
    too, had as great a desire to run away as she had; but the girl now&mdash;with
    one of those contradictory impulses which are peculiar to sensitive temperaments&mdash;felt
    an unconquerable wish to speak with him ... if only for the purpose of challenging
    him to those words of reproach which he had spared her on that day when Laurent&rsquo;s
    cruel scorn and her own callousness had struck him as with a physical blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel,&rdquo; she cried, moved by that sudden impulse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your commands, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ... I ... believe me I had no thought of meeting you here ... or
    of intruding upon your privacy ... but now that we have met, I beg of you
    that you will let me tell you....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused, feeling that a hot flush had risen to her cheeks and that her
    words sounded both halting and cold. And yet he had made no movement to stop
    her. It had never been his way to interrupt. For good or ill, he always listened
    to the end of whatever anyone chose to say. He had listened to the end, when
    Laurent, with a few harsh words, had shattered the shrine wherein he had
    set his fondest illusions; he stood quite still now, ready to listen to everything
    she might wish to say. But somehow it was just his attitude of quiet expectancy
    which stemmed the flow of her words. It was only when she had been silent
    for some few seconds and apparently was not going to speak again, that he
    interposed calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there any necessity for you, Mademoiselle, to tell me anything?
    Surely not, seeing that it distresses you. Will you, on the other hand, permit
    me to offer you my well-meant congratulations on your approaching marriage
    with my brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already Fernande had recovered some measure of self-control. Her dignity
    was on the qui vive. Apparently he meant to meet every advance on her part
    with frigid enmity. The look of resentment in his eyes had deepened, and
    to Fernande&rsquo;s keen senses it seemed as if they held no small measure
    of scorn as well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;It was <i>ma tante&rsquo;s</i> intention
    to send you an announcement of our <i>fian&ccedil;ailles</i>, but we only
    heard yesterday with any certainty that you had returned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for my mother to trouble herself about such
    trifling conventions with me,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I feel so sure that
    she hath no desire to claim the slightest kinship with a de Maurel that any
    formalities of the kind which she seems to contemplate would be a mere farce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very irreconcilable, M. de Maurel,&rdquo; said Fernande coldly, &ldquo;and
    are making your mother and Laurent suffer for the thoughtlessness which I
    committed a year ago, and of which I would like you to believe that I have
    since bitterly repented.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no recollection of any thoughtlessness on your part, Mademoiselle
    ... certainly of none which should cause you any regret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your actions belie your words,&rdquo; she rejoined quietly. &ldquo;If,
    as you say, you have not only forgiven but forgotten the foolishness of a
    year ago, then why have you kept aloof from your mother ... from us all?
    You were wont to be a constant visitor at Courson, your mother and Laurent
    have enjoyed your hospitality for the past twelve months. Yet you have not
    been nigh La Frontenay, and &rsquo;tis three days since your return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My uncle Gaston is dying,&rdquo; he said curtly; &ldquo;he and the
    works have claimed my attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does that mean, then, that you will come?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;one
    day soon when you are not so engaged?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as he made no reply, she added more insistently: &ldquo;Your mother
    and Laurent bore no part whatever in the wrong which I alone committed. M.
    de Maurel, why should you remain at enmity with them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At enmity, Mademoiselle?&mdash;am I at enmity with my mother or with
    my brother? Surely not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not go to see them? Why not come to see us all as you used to
    do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chiefly, I think,&rdquo; he replied roughly, &ldquo;because up at
    La Frontenay no one has any desire to see me. My brother and I have nothing
    in common&mdash;my mother and I still less. You, Mademoiselle Fernande, proved
    to me a year ago what an utterly ridiculous boor I was, fit only to be jeered
    at and made game of. Now a bear is not usually a good plaything for women;
    he is apt to snarl and render himself odious by his antics. He is far better
    out of the way, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are ungenerous, M. de Maurel. God knows how bitterly I have regretted
    my folly! I had no thought of seeing you here, &rsquo;tis true, but now,
    despite your harshness, I am glad that we have met. Words of sorrow and of
    repentance which refused me service a year ago have seared my heart ever
    since. I could not speak then, I was too much overcome by shame and by remorse.
    But I entreat you to believe that not a day has gone by during the past twelve
    months that I did not in my heart pray for your forgiveness. I was very young
    then, very thoughtless and very inexperienced. I knew nothing of men, nor
    was I vain enough to gauge the amount of mischief that thoughtless coquetry
    on my part would wreak. M. de Maurel, for the hurt I caused you that day
    I do sincerely beg your forgiveness. Before then <i>ma tante</i> and Laurent
    had reason to believe that in you they had found a friend. I entreat you,
    do not add to my remorse by venting on them your resentment which should
    be for me alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice broke in a short sob. Her blue eyes were filled with tears. Overhead
    the sun had hidden its radiance behind a bank of clouds, and all around the
    woods appeared grey and desolate, and from the pool there came the melancholy
    croaking of frogs and the call of wood-pigeons was wafted through the trees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bear must dance again, eh?&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel harshly. &ldquo;He
    may prove dangerous if he slips his chain. I wonder what it is that does
    go on inside La Frontenay that all this <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> should
    have been resorted to once more in order to hoodwink me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande drew back as if she had been struck. A hot flush rose to the very
    roots of her hair; it seemed to her as if an unseen and aggressive hand had
    thrown a veil right over her head, and then dealt her a heavy blow between
    the eyes. Everything around her suddenly appeared blurred and a strange sense
    of cold crept into her limbs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! but I think you do, Mademoiselle Fernande,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;A
    year ago it was thought necessary to enchain the Maurel bear so that he might
    dance to Royalist pipings; for this he was lured and cajoled and fed with
    treacle and honeyed words. The foolish, awkward creature began to dance;
    he was ready to see nothing save a pair of blue eyes that looked as limpid
    as a mountain stream, to hear nothing save the piping of a voice as clear
    and guileless as that of a lark. Unfortunately the jealous ravings of a puppy
    wakened the clumsy brute from his trance ... wakened him too soon, it seems,
    but so roughly that, feeling dazed and shaken, he preferred to crawl away
    out of sight rather than remain a butt for mockery and ridicule. Now he has
    come back and may prove dangerous again&mdash;what? Bah! the same old methods
    can easily be tried again, the same honeyed words spoken, the same blue eyes
    raised tantalizingly to his. Too late, Mademoiselle Fernande!&rdquo; he added,
    with a laugh which sounded strident and harsh as it echoed through the woods. &ldquo;The
    bear has awakened from his winter sleep, he is not like to be caught napping
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel,&rdquo; protested Fernande, &ldquo;you are not only
    ungenerous now, but wilfully cruel and unchivalrous; and, of a truth, your
    harshness now hath killed every feeling of remorse which I have felt. You
    have, of a truth, the right to hate me, the right to hate us all; but I spoke
    to you in all sincerity, and my humility and repentance should at least have
    saved me from insult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sincerity!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, &ldquo;sincerity from a Courson!
    Ah! Mademoiselle Fernande, you said just now that I was at enmity with my
    brother Laurent. By my faith, I will remain for ever his debtor. But for
    his interference on that memorable day meseems that Madame my mother would
    have succeeded in staging once again the tragedy which had already once been
    enacted at La Frontenay, when a de Maurel took a de Courson for bride, and
    the final curtain rang down upon his broken heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A broken heart!&rdquo; she retorted hotly, &ldquo;you! Nay, every
    word that you utter hath proved to me the foolishness of my remorse. Your
    heart hath been full only of outraged vanity and of unreasoning resentment,
    the while I wept countless tears of sorrow and of regret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Regret for what, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he exclaimed roughly. &ldquo;What,
    I pray you, had you to regret? You say that you wept countless tears&mdash;what
    for? Had you to mourn the only illusion of your life? Had you to mourn the
    loss of every hope which for days and nights had haunted you with its sweet,
    insistent call? Had you to weep because the one being in this mean and sordid
    world whom you thought pure and true&mdash;almost holy&mdash;suddenly appeared
    before you false and cruel&mdash;double-tongued and insidious, a commonplace
    siren set to lay a trap for men? Had you to weep because the being whom you
    had learned to worship had with wanton frolic and a mocking smile plucked
    out your heart-strings and left you forlorn and desolate, a prey to ignominy
    and to lifelong regret? And had you to weep tears of bitter humiliation in
    the knowledge that those who hated and despised you were laughing their fill
    at your folly? Oh! I, too, Mademoiselle Fernande, was young then ... I, too,
    was inexperienced ... I was a dolt and a fool&mdash;but what wrong, in God&rsquo;s
    name, had I done you that you should treat me so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silently Fernande had listened, her hand grasping a clump of branches of
    young chestnut, else mayhap she would have fallen. That feeling of a veil
    enveloping her head was still with her; there was a buzzing in her ear through
    which his harsh voice came with a sound like hammering upon the portals of
    her brain. The agony and misery which rang out from his words found their
    echo in her own heart. Indeed, many a time in the past year had she felt
    pitifully sorry for the man whom she had wronged with such unpardonable thoughtlessness,
    but never before had she felt as she did now; never before had she realized
    the full extent of the misery which she had caused.</p>
  <p>His voice broke into a heartrending sob. He covered his face with his hands
    with a gesture of such racking pain, that she would have given her very life
    at this moment for the right to comfort him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel,&rdquo; she said gently, and, indeed, now her voice
    was softer than that of a cooing dove, &ldquo;God alone knows how deeply
    your words have hurt me; and I go away to-day feeling that you have made
    me atone for all that I made you suffer. Indeed, indeed, I had no thought
    a year ago that my senseless coquetry could arouse in a noble-hearted man
    like you, feelings which I so little deserved. Whatever you may think, however,
    I did not lie to you when I told you that for the past year, not one day
    has gone by without a thought of burning remorse in my mind for what I had
    done. I did not lie when I sued for your forgiveness. This I do swear to
    you by every memory that clusters round this glade, by every memory that
    speaks to you as well as to me in the rustle of the leaf-laden trees and
    in the murmurings of the woods; I swear it by the unforgettable hour when
    we both heard the gentle cooing of the wood-pigeons, and my hand rested in
    yours in complete amity. As for the future, &rsquo;tis not likely that we
    shall ever meet again. I hope to leave La Frontenay very soon&mdash;to-day
    if I can. May I therefore beg you in all earnestness to take up the threads
    of friendship with your mother&mdash;there where my own foolishness caused
    them to snap? Go to her, M. de Maurel ... go to-day if you can. Do not forget
    that she is your mother.... Do not let her forget that you are her son. God
    be with you and guard you! And whatever may happen in the future, will you
    at least try to bear in mind that Fernande de Courson would gladly give her
    life to heal the wound which she hath inflicted. Time will inevitably do
    that,&rdquo; she added with a choked little sigh, &ldquo;and in the years
    to come you will mayhap think less bitterly of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she turned and, like a deer, she vanished in the thicket. Ronnay&rsquo;s
    hands fell from his face. For a long while he remained there gazing on the
    spot where she had stood. Through the murmurings of the wood he still could
    hear the echo of her silvery voice, and it seemed to him that her pale face,
    with the tear-filled eyes, still peeped at him from between the branches
    of the coppice, and that the perfume of her white gown and of her golden
    hair still filled the air with their intoxicating fragrance.</p>
  <p>Then with a heavy sigh he, too, turned and went his way.</p>

    A Last Appeal</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Fernande had said nothing to Madame la Marquise of her rencontre with Ronnay
    de Maurel. Of a truth, Madame, despite her many promises to Laurent, had
    not kept a very close eye on her niece&rsquo;s movements. Fernande had been
    away from the ch&acirc;teau during the best part of the morning; she came
    home with tear-stained eyes, and her gown had obviously trailed in the mud,
    but Madame apparently noticed nothing. All the day she wandered about the
    ch&acirc;teau in a perfect fever of excitement. In the afternoon a runner
    came over from Courson with news from all the chiefs. The next day was now
    irrevocably fixed upon for the attack on the foundries. Leroux was to be
    given his final instructions, and Madame herself be prepared to hold the
    ch&acirc;teau against any assault delivered against it by the local peasantry,
    who no doubt were well armed by de Maurel and had been drilled against any
    emergency.</p>
  <p>M. de Courson had added a special note to the letter telling Madame, that
    the Comte de Puisaye had decided to send his friend Prigent with forty or
    fifty men to La Frontenay in case of attack.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The ch&acirc;teau can very easily be held,&rdquo; M. de Courson&rsquo;s
    note went on, &ldquo;and we have no fears for you, knowing your energy and
    resourcefulness. Give Leroux the fullest instructions possible, then do not
    send for him again during the day. I have an idea that he is being watched
    by spies of de Maurel&rsquo;s, and he will have to be very circumspect for
    the next thirty-six hours. As for us all, we are more full of hope than ever.
    We reviewed our men last night in the park. They are marvellously enthusiastic
    and firm in the belief that their prowess will rally thousands of waverers
    to the Fleur-de-Lis. De Puisaye has recruited a further two hundred, and
    hath now a force of over six on the further side of Mortain. Everything,
    therefore, is for the best, and nothing but some absolutely unforeseen accident
    can now rob us of success. Above all, I entreat you, my dear sister, be as
    silent and discreet as the grave. Remember that walls of French ch&acirc;teaux
    have oft had ears in the course of their history. Speak to no one of our
    plan for to-morrow ... not to Matthieu Renard, not to his wife. Do not discuss
    it with Fernande in the presence of those whom you think most loyal. To-morrow
    afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock see Leroux in your private boudoir. Be sure
    that door and windows are closed and that no one lurks behind curtains or
    screens. Then tell the man to have everything ready for that night. De Puisaye
    will arrive at the foundries soon after midnight, and he will expect to find
    arms for six hundred men ready to his hand. After that he will see to everything
    himself. Command Leroux to speak to no one, to trust no one&mdash;but to
    select with the utmost care the fifty men whom he requires to remain at the
    factories with him, in order to surprise the watchmen and prevent the alarm
    being given. Keep Fernande out of your councils, my dear Denise, as far as
    you can. The child appears to me to be overwrought and might do some act
    of headstrongness which might ruin everything. Something seems to have occurred
    between her and Laurent just before we left La Frontenay. You will know,
    no doubt, what it was. Laurent is a prey to most acute jealousy. He has worried
    me considerably since yesterday. He hath need of all his courage and coolness
    to bear his share of our work to-morrow night. While I lead the attack on
    Mortain it will be his duty to hold up the garrison of Domfront, else they
    may fall on de Puisaye and his men, or else on me, when perhaps not one of
    us would come out of it alive. I would not wrong Laurent by suggesting that
    he is not up to the task, but it were well if Fernande sent him a loving
    message by this same runner, in order to reassure him and to brace him up
    for his task. Now, my dear sister, I can do nothing more save commend you
    and my child to the care of God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The letter closed with many assurances of affection and a tone of seriousness,
    which showed that M. de Courson was not perhaps quite in such an optimistic
    frame of mind as were his chiefs.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Madame had frowned and uttered an exclamation of impatience when in her
    brother&rsquo;s letter she had read the passage about Laurent. The Fates
    which are wont to spin the threads of human destinies without heeding the
    best-laid plans of men, smiled, no doubt, in their lonely eyrie up on the
    summit of the Brocken, when Madame la Marquise de Mortain, disdaining her
    brother&rsquo;s advice, chose in her usual dictatorial, self-willed way to
    send a message to Laurent herself, rather than ask Fernande to do so.</p>
  <p>She couched her message in loving and reassuring terms, but she said nothing
    to Fernande on the subject. Why, she could not herself have said. There was
    no reason why the girl should not be told that her fianc&eacute; was in the
    throes of a maddening attack of jealousy, and that a word from her might
    soothe his perturbed spirit and restore to him that courage of which he would
    presently be in such sore need. But Madame had a horror of anything that
    might present her beloved son in an unfavourable light. Any failing or weakness
    of his would, she felt, redound in a measure to her discredit. That is the
    only reason why she said nothing to Fernande, and why she herself sent the
    message to Laurent which, as events unfortunately proved subsequently, had
    not the effect of reassuring him.</p>
  <p>In other matters she acted entirely in accordance with her brother&rsquo;s
    orders. Obedience in that case meant military discipline, and rather flattered
    Madame&rsquo;s sense of her own importance and responsibility. She spent
    the best part of the day in her own room, and, entirely self-absorbed, she
    completely ignored Fernande&rsquo;s presence and Fernande&rsquo;s movements.
    From the ch&acirc;teau she could see or hear nothing of the bustle and movement
    of the distant factories, but it seemed to her as if their unheard throbbings
    found their echo against her heart. To-morrow, she thought, they would for
    the last time manufacture engines of war to help the King&rsquo;s enemies
    in their disloyalty and their treachery; for the last time to-morrow would
    the abominable Corsican upstart look to La Frontenay for the cementation
    of his throne. She could not spare a thought for the son against whom she
    was intriguing with such ruthless callousness. A year ago she had planned
    to win him over to her side. In this she had signally failed. She might have
    tried again now, only that there was no time for protracted diplomacy.</p>
  <p>To bring Ronnay de Maurel back to heel was a doubtful proposition; if it
    did succeed, it would be months before good results could be hoped for. In
    the meanwhile the King could not wait. Ronnay de Maurel stood in his way:
    therefore must the loyal adherents of the King sweep the offending obstacle
    from his path.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Leroux arrived punctually at three o&rsquo;clock the following afternoon.
    Madame la Marquise was in Fernande&rsquo;s room, talking platitudes to the
    young girl in a tardy fit of remorse at having neglected her so completely
    these past two days.</p>
  <p>Fernande appeared more dejected than she had been before, and Madame had
    much ado to keep her temper from breaking away against so much pessimism,
    which almost amounted to disloyalty.</p>
  <p>It was old Annette who announced Leroux, and Madame la Marquise sent a message
    down to say that she would see him immediately. As soon as Annette had gone,
    Fernande, with one of her sudden, impulsive gestures, threw her arms round
    Madame&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before it is too late, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she cried, with a
    tone of desperate entreaty,  &ldquo;will you not think&mdash;just once more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late for what, child?&rdquo; retorted Madame impatiently, and
    she shook herself free from the young girl&rsquo;s arms which encircled her
    with a forceful and passionate grip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too late to avert this appalling calamity,&rdquo; replied Fernande. &ldquo;That
    man Leroux is a criminal, a murderer,&rdquo; she continued with ever-increasing
    vehemence. &ldquo;His greed for the money which has been offered him will
    render him utterly unscrupulous. I could see it in his face the other day
    ... when he was here ... and M. de Puisaye was speaking to him. He will stick
    at nothing, <i>ma tante</i>, at nothing in order to gain his ten thousand
    francs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined Madame coldly, &ldquo;we want a man
    who will stick at nothing. King Louis hath no use for velvet gloves, for
    mincing ways, or for half-hearted cowards these days. We have to fight an
    unscrupulous foe, remember. What is Bonaparte, what are these regicides,
    I&rsquo;d like to know, but criminals and murderers! What is Mademoiselle
    de Courson at this moment,&rdquo; she added, as with flaming cheeks and glowing
    eyes she turned on Fernande and would have smitten her with a look&mdash;&ldquo;what
    is Mademoiselle de Courson now save a half-hearted coward, unworthy to stand
    shoulder to shoulder with her father, her lover, her kinsfolk in their homeric
    struggle for justice and for right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Fernande bore the withering looks and the insult unflinchingly. It seemed
    as if in the last two days she had stepped boldly across the dividing line
    which separates blind unquestioning childhood from understanding and reasoning
    womanhood. All the horror for past crimes and past excesses committed against
    her King and against her cause was still present in her mind; but now she
    refused to accept the complacent theory that crime must beget worse crime
    and that revenge and reprisals, murder and pillage, would ever help the righteousness
    of a cause or be justifiable in the sight of God.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bid me fight, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she retorted proudly, &ldquo;side
    by side with my father; bid me meet the enemies of my King in loyal combat,
    and I&rsquo;ll warrant you&rsquo;ll not find me weak or cowardly. Fight!
    Yes, let us fight&mdash;fight as did George Cadoudal and Louis de Frott&eacute; and
    Henri de la Rochejaquelin&mdash;let us fight like men, but not like criminals.
    In God&rsquo;s name let us not stoop to murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder, child!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame, &ldquo;who talked of murder,
    I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you swear, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; riposted Fernande slowly, &ldquo;that
    whilst you traffic with a man like Leroux, the possibility of an awful, hideous,
    horrible murder has never presented itself to your mind? That you have never
    envisaged the likelihood of Ronnay de Maurel getting wind of this affair
    and of his taking Leroux to task for his proposed treachery? Have you never
    thought, <i>ma tante</i>, of what would happen if Leroux thought that his
    master suspected him, and if he then came face to face with him&mdash;somewhere
    alone...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just for the space of one second Madame la Marquise de Mortain stood quite
    still&mdash;rigid almost as a statue&mdash;with eyes closed and lips tightly
    set. Just for the space of that one second it seemed as if something human,
    something womanly, stirred within that heart of stone. Then an impatient
    exclamation escaped her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tush, child!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be taken to task
    by you. Who are you, pray, that you should strive to throw your childish
    sensibilities, your childish nonsense across the path of your King&rsquo;s
    destiny? Ronnay de Maurel must take his chance in this fight,&rdquo; she
    added, as she threw back her head with a movement of invincible determination. &ldquo;He
    has chosen the traitor&rsquo;s path; while he and his kind have the power,
    they stick at nothing to bring us into subjection. We have the chance now
    ... one chance in a thousand&mdash;to gain the upper hand of all these regicides
    and these minions of Bonaparte. To neglect that chance for the sake of a
    craven scruple were now an act of criminal folly. Let that be my last word,
    child,&rdquo; continued Madame, as she made for the door; &ldquo;do not let
    me hear any more of your warnings, your prophecies, or your sermons. What
    has been decided by our chiefs shall be done&mdash;understand?&mdash;and
    what must be, must be. And when your father returns, after having risked
    his life for the cause which you seem to hold so lightly, take care lest
    the first word he utters be one of condemnation of a recreant daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Madame la Marquise did not pause to see what effect her last stern words
    had upon Fernande. She sailed out of the room with no further thought in
    her mind of the passionate appeal which had left her utterly cold. To her
    now there existed only one thing in the entire world, and that was the project
    for the seizure of the La Frontenay foundries and its consequent immense
    effect upon the ultimate triumph of the Royalist cause. Everything else,
    every thought, every feeling, every duty she swept away from her heart and
    from her mind as petty, irrelevant, and not worthy to be weighed in the balance
    with the stupendous issue which was at stake.</p>
  <p>Indeed, as she sped down to the hall for this final momentous interview
    with Leroux, she felt greatly thankful that yesterday she had not acted on
    her brother&rsquo;s advice, and that she had written to Laurent herself rather
    than allowed Fernande to do so. The girl, in writing to her lover, might
    have indulged in one of those dithyrambics which were so unexplainable, and
    which might still further have upset Laurent. As it was, everything was for
    the best, and Madame dismissed any latent fears from her mind just as readily
    as she had dismissed any slight twinge of remorse which Fernande&rsquo;s
    words might have caused to arise in her heart.</p>
  <p>Leroux, gruff and surly as usual, had been shown into a small library adjoining
    the great entrance-hall of the ch&acirc;teau, a room which M. de Courson
    had of late used as an office for transacting the correspondence of his party
    and receiving any messengers sent to him by one of his chiefs. Here the man
    had waited, while Madame was being detained upstairs by Fernande&rsquo;s
    last tender appeal.</p>
  <p>He greeted Madame la Marquise with a rough and churlish word, and as soon
    as she had closed the door behind her he began abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be very careful,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;something
    of our project is known to de Maurel. I&rsquo;d stake my life on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The flush of anger of a while ago fled from Madame&rsquo;s cheeks, but otherwise
    nothing in her attitude betrayed to this boor the slightest sign of fear
    on her part.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; she asked coolly, as she took a
    seat in a high-backed chair, and graciously waved her hand to Leroux in token
    that he, too, might sit down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yesterday I wanted to come here and speak with you about one or two
    matters,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;when I met the Mar&eacute;chal upon
    the high road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Mar&eacute;chal?&rdquo; queried Madame, with a supercilious lift
    of the eyebrows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes! Our General is Marshal of France now,&rdquo; said Leroux
    with a sneer. &ldquo;He gained his baton fighting against the Prussians,
    so I&rsquo;ve been told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All of which is of no consequence, my man,&rdquo; broke in Madame
    impatiently. &ldquo;We have no time to waste this morning, and you were telling
    me that you met M. le Comte de Maurel when you were on your way hither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; rejoined Leroux sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He asked me where I was going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told him that I was free to come and go as I pleased, seeing that
    I was chief overseer of the factory now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was very imprudent to give your present master such an impertinent
    answer,&rdquo;  said Madame peremptorily. &ldquo;You were expressly ordered
    to curb your temper and to gain M. de Maurel&rsquo;s confidence as far as
    lay in your power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did curb my temper,&rdquo; rejoined the man. &ldquo;And I did not
    give him an impertinent answer. I spoke as if I had honey in my mouth. I
    am merely telling you the drift of what I said. My actual words were cringing
    enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then, what happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Mar&eacute;chal told me that though the military representatives
    had appointed me chief overseer, he himself had not confirmed that appointment,
    nor would he confirm it, he said, till I showed myself really worthy of his
    confidence. He didn&rsquo;t say much, for he is never over talkative with
    any of us. But he looked me through and through in a way that I didn&rsquo;t
    like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind how he looked. Did he say anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He told me that he expressly forbade every one of his men to
    have any intercourse with the ch&acirc;teau, and that I was distinctly to
    understand that he forbade me most strictly to come to the ch&acirc;teau,
    or to hold converse with any of its inmates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame bit her lip and her slender white fingers beat an impatient tattoo
    upon the desk beside her. But she said quite unconcernedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that was all. But I thought it best not to come yesterday. To-day
    I had to come, because we absolutely must do the work to-night&mdash;even
    to-morrow might be too late. I am certain that I am being watched; every
    hour&rsquo;s delay means danger of discovery. You should have taken my advice
    and done the trick two days ago; it would all be over by now....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it will be done to-night,&rdquo; broke in Madame firmly. &ldquo;You
    were told two days ago that it would be for to-night, and you had no right
    to endanger your position at the works by being discovered coming here so
    often.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was told nothing definite two days ago, and I was on my way here
    for the express purpose of warning you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In any case, there&rsquo;s not much harm done,&rdquo; rejoined Madame
    coolly. &ldquo;Even if M. de Maurel comes to mistrust you, no change can
    take place in the arrangements for to-night. He would not dismiss you at
    a moment&rsquo;s notice, would he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He would not dare to do that,&rdquo; retorted Leroux roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From what I hear,&rdquo; said Madame la Marquise, &ldquo;there is
    not much that M. de Maurel would not dare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, in any case, he could not turn me out neck and crop from the
    Lodge. I am there securely enough, at any rate, until the time when I hand
    over the works to your people in consideration of ten thousand francs for
    myself and a hundred apiece for my men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is all understood, of course. And you are quite prepared for
    to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite. Fifty of my mates are slackening off already. When I return
    to the works I shall give out that those fifty must work overtime to-night.
    Don&rsquo;t you be afraid; there&rsquo;s not going to be any hitch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray God there won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; murmured Madame fervently.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>She was about to recapitulate some further instructions to Leroux, when
    a timid knock at the door, repeated more insistently a moment or two later,
    caused her to order Leroux to stand aside for a moment while she herself
    went to the door. She had no premonition of any trouble just then; long afterwards,
    when in her mind she lived over again every hour of that memorable day, she
    always was quite certain that she went to open that door without any thought
    of an approaching calamity.</p>
  <p>Old Matthieu Renard was at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough, although both he and his wife were firmly attached to
    M. de Courson and to Madame la Marquise, they had never thoroughly imbibed
    the contempt which all loyal Royalists were compelled to feel toward the
    honours and distinctions which were conferred on his adherents by the usurper
    Bonaparte.</p>
  <p>Madame drew back at his words very suddenly, like someone who, wandering
    in a peaceful glade, comes unprepared upon some fearsome thing. She had certainly
    this time become white to the lips, and the hand wherewith she beckoned to
    Matthieu to enter trembled visibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean M. de Maurel?&rdquo; she queried huskily. &ldquo;Where is
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just coming up the perron steps,&rdquo; replied Matthieu, who also
    appeared very agitated.  &ldquo;He took his horse round to the stables first.
    I was in the garden. I saw him. He called to me and sent me to announce his
    visit to Madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had best go,&rdquo; muttered Leroux hurriedly and shuffled up to
    the door.</p>
  <p>Madame stopped him with a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;If M. de Maurel is coming up
    the perron steps now, you cannot fail to meet him face to face in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to see me here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, man,&rdquo; commanded Madame imperiously, and
    Leroux, whose sallow cheeks were the colour of ashes, muttered something
    between his teeth and withdrew into a dark corner of the room. Then Madame
    turned once more to old Matthieu.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did not think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of saying to M. de Maurel
    that I was from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;I told him you were away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That he would wait until your return, and in the meanwhile would
    speak with his overseer, Paul Leroux, who he believed was within.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There came a violent oath from Leroux, and Madame put a handkerchief up
    to her lips which felt cracked and dry; and during the silence that ensued
    there came echoing through the silent house the sound of a footfall with
    a curious lilt in it&mdash;the unmistakable footsteps of a man who is lame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand aside, Matthieu,&rdquo; said Madame, with as much dignity as
    she could command, even though her voice sounded raucous and hoarse. &ldquo;I
    will go speak with M. de Maurel. Do you follow me into the hall, and you,
    Leroux,&rdquo; she added, once more turning to the craven creature who made
    no attempt to disguise his fears, &ldquo;stay here!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter &nbsp;18<br>
    The Word Of The Master</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>De Maurel stood waiting for her in the pillared hall. In accordance with
    the custom which he himself had established during his last visits to Courson,
    he was in uniform without his sword and mantle. Madame la Marquise had already
    fully recovered her self-possession; her short progress across the hall restored
    to her the full measure of her habitual <i>sang-froid</i>. With a well-schooled
    smile upon her lips she came forward eagerly to greet him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear Ronnay,&rdquo; she said, as she extended a gracious hand
    to him, &ldquo;this is indeed a surprise&mdash;none the less joyous as it
    was so wholly unexpected. Indeed, we here at La Frontenay had come to believe
    that you had wholly forgotten us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bowed low over the gracious hand, and even touched the finger-tips with
    his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You look more bronzed than ever, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; added
    Madame with an arch smile, &ldquo;and your numerous new dignities and the
    added gorgeousness of your uniform will play sadder havoc than ever before
    in the hearts of our impressionable young girls. You have come to pay me
    a long visit, I hope. Come to my boudoir, my dear Ronnay, the room which
    your generosity hath furnished with such lavish care for your old mother.
    We can talk undisturbed there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Within a few moments, Madame,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;I will
    be entirely at your service. But, first of all, may I, with your gracious
    permission, speak a few words with my overseer Leroux?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The abruptness of the attack nearly caused Madame to lose countenance then
    and there. Of a truth, the danger was more real and more immediate than she
    had foreseen. For the space of a few brief seconds she debated in her mind
    whether she would deny Leroux&rsquo; presence in the house altogether&mdash;feign
    ignorance of it, and risk an exposure which might prove disastrous and certainly
    would be humiliating. It all depended on how much Ronnay really knew. If
    he had actually seen Leroux entering the ch&acirc;teau, denial would be positively
    fatal; if his attitude at this moment only rested on surmise, then it might
    prove a good card to play. Unfortunately time pressed, and she was forced
    to decide on a course of action in the space of a few seconds while de Maurel
    kept dark, inquiring eyes fixed composedly upon her face. In any case, a
    little procrastination was imperative, and Madame, with a certain vague fear
    gnawing at her heart-strings, at last contrived to say with a complacent
    smile and an affectation of great surprise:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your overseer, my son? I do not understand.... Why should you seek
    your overseer in this house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I happen to have seen him enter it, half an hour ago,&rdquo; he
    replied curtly, &ldquo;in spite of my strict prohibition which I enjoined
    upon him yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He comes courting one of my maids, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But my prohibition is none the less binding on him. So with
    your leave, Madame ...&rdquo; he added, as he made a movement in the direction
    of the door whence Madame la Marquise had just emerged in order to greet
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Ronnay,&rdquo; rejoined Madame, with all the haughtiness
    which she could command, &ldquo;I trust that you will not inflict a scene
    upon me here in this house, which would be extremely unpleasant for us all.
    If you wish to speak with your overseer, surely you can wait till he has
    returned to your works. A factory or a workshop, or even the high road, are
    fitter places for a wrangle with a refractory workman than in your mother&rsquo;s
    private room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is neither my fault nor my wish,&rdquo; retorted de Maurel dryly, &ldquo;that
    a refractory workman in my employ happens to be in my mother&rsquo;s private
    room. Nor would I care to wait until the man chooses to return to his duties
    in order to give him the trouncing which he deserves. I have no time to waste
    in waiting on his good pleasure, and I specially desire to speak with him
    here&mdash;in this house&mdash;and in your presence, Madame, an you will
    grant me leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In my presence!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame, with a forced laugh which
    was intended to hide an ever-increasing terror. &ldquo;My dear Ronnay, meseems
    that you have taken leave of your senses. What in the world have I got to
    do with your overseer and with your quarrels with your men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is just what I desire to ascertain, Madame,&rdquo; rejoined
    de Maurel quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you cannot do it,&rdquo; said Madame testily, &ldquo;either
    here or now. You will not, I presume, have the effrontery of forcing your
    way into my private apartments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your presumption is correct, Madame. I would not for the world intrude
    upon your privacy. But let me not, on the other hand, detain you here. I
    can wait your gracious pleasure, until you deign to turn my overseer out
    of your private apartments, and send him hither to speak with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Madame looked round her in hopeless bewilderment. The situation
    had developed in a manner wherewith she was unable to cope. For the first
    time in her life she would have given much to have someone else&rsquo;s support
    or counsel in this crisis which she began seriously to fear would culminate
    in disaster. But there was no one near to help her out of her difficulty.
    Fernande had not left her room, M. de Courson and Laurent were far away,
    and even old Matthieu had very discreetly retired as soon as he saw Madame
    la Marquise in close conversation with &ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence in the vast pillared hall for a second or two while these
    two equally firm wills stood up in bitter conflict one against the other.
    There was never a doubt for a moment as to who would be forced to yield.
    Madame even now felt like some bird whose strong wings were in the hands
    of a ruthless tamer, who already was busy in clipping them. She tried to
    brave that tamer or else to defy him; but he, armed with a determination
    no less firm than her own and with a tenacity that nothing could conquer,
    was waging a war of attrition, and was calmly biding his time while Madame,
    torn between genuine fear and outraged dignity, was seeking in vain for a
    means of extricating herself from this harrowing position.</p>
  <p>Ronnay de Maurel, in fact, was leaning against one of the marble pillars
    of the hall with a smile round his firm lips which, had not the situation
    been quite so tense, might almost have been interpreted as one of keen, if
    somewhat grim, amusement, whilst Madame stood before him, hot and defiant,
    her small foot tapping the ground in order to ease the exacerbation of her
    nerves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said abruptly, and she deliberately turned
    on her heel and made for the door of the library, where Leroux no doubt was
    still standing, quaking in his shoes like the miserable craven that he was. &ldquo;Very
    well! An you are determined to put this insult on your mother in the presence
    of such an oaf, I can do naught to prevent you. Go and speak with your overseer
    an you have a mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And will you deign to be present at the interview, Madame?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; she replied curtly.</p>
  <p>Of a truth, she would not have trusted Leroux to speak alone with de Maurel;
    the man was three parts a coward, and it was more than doubtful whether under
    stress of fear he would remain true to his bargain with de Puisaye; whilst
    the part of him that was base and criminal might lead him to an attack of
    violence, which, whatever its results might be, was certainly not within
    the scope of Madame&rsquo;s reckonings.</p>
  <p>Therefore she chose to make a virtue of necessity and, walking rapidly across
    the hall, she called curtly to de Maurel to follow her into the library.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Leroux had assumed an air of jaunty defiance which the pallor of his cheeks
    and the shifty looks in his eyes did more than belie. He had recognized his
    employer&rsquo;s voice at the outset, and one or two words spoken in Madame&rsquo;s
    somewhat shrill voice had prepared him, in a measure, for the interview which
    he so frankly dreaded.</p>
  <p>Like most cowards, Leroux himself would have been quite incapable of saying
    definitely what it was that he was afraid of. He had oft proclaimed it audibly
    that he would as soon be sent to Prussia or to New Caledonia as to continue
    the life of honest work and of monotony which his present conditional liberation
    entailed. He could not, therefore, be afraid of a mere dismissal, whilst
    he was quite keen and shrewd enough to know that de Maurel was not like to
    resort to physical violence against him, and punishments, even degradation
    from his present position, could not longer affect him, seeing that he was
    pledged to de Puisaye and the Royalists.</p>
  <p>It must be presumed, therefore, that Leroux&rsquo; access of terror when
    his employer suddenly appeared under the lintel of the door in the wake of
    Madame la Marquise, was just due to the unpleasant physical sensation which
    assails a dastard in the presence of a brave and loyal man. He was standing
    close beside the window, and with his back to the door, and as Madame and
    de Maurel entered, he turned round suddenly, with something of a snarl like
    a savage creature trapped.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel desired to speak with you, Leroux,&rdquo; Madame said,
    whilst de Maurel closed the door behind him, &ldquo;and I have allowed him
    to see you in this house....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where you had no right to be, as you know well, Leroux,&rdquo; interposed
    de Maurel, speaking calmly and in measured tones. &ldquo;I warned you yesterday
    that I would look on any infraction of my commands as direct and wilful disobedience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux shifted uneasily from one foot to the other, but he looked his master
    squarely in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orders such as those,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are for the men in subsidiary
    positions. I am chief overseer now&mdash;what? I come and go as I please
    and where I please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told M. de Maurel,&rdquo; broke in Madame hurriedly, &ldquo;that
    I saw no objection to your visiting my maid Marie, seeing that she is betrothed
    to you. I have begged him to overlook your transgression this time, and urged
    that your anxiety might excuse you. Marie is very ill,&rdquo; she continued,
    turning to de Maurel, &ldquo;and this unfortunate fellow forgot his duty,
    I fear me, in his solicitude for the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A solicitude all the more remarkable, Madame,&rdquo; rejoined de
    Maurel with a quaint laugh, partly of amusement and partly of impatience, &ldquo;as
    Leroux has already a wife of his own, whose faithful heart his many crimes
    have oft wounded before now. I fear me that you must look upon me as a gaby
    to unfold so specious a tale for my delectation. Nor&mdash;an you will forgive
    me for saying it&mdash;are you serving the man&rsquo;s interests by trumping
    up such hollow excuses for his disobedience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come and go as I please, and where I please,&rdquo; reiterated
    Leroux surlily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are neither daft nor deaf,&rdquo; said de Maurel quietly. &ldquo;You
    heard and understood my orders yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am chief overseer now,&rdquo; retorted the man obstinately. &ldquo;Such
    orders do not apply to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every order which I give applies to every man in my employ. I told
    you when first I returned and found you installed in a position, which I
    knew you neither deserved nor were able to fill, that I would leave you in
    it on probation only. I am now convinced that you are quite unfit to rule
    over any of my men, seeing that you have no idea of discipline, of obedience,
    or of truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ready to leave your service,&rdquo; said Leroux with a muttered
    oath; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not a downy bed&mdash;what?&mdash;to sweat day after
    day over those accursed mortars, with your life hanging by a thread all the
    time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not in my service, Leroux. You are primarily in the service
    of the State, whose laws you have broken, and who has given you this means
    of working out your punishment, by honest toil and loyalty to your country,
    rather than as a convict in jail or New Caledonia. But for the time being
    I am your employer. You eat my bread and owe loyalty and obedience to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then send me packing,&rdquo; growled Leroux, &ldquo;if you are not
    satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I intend to do,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel. &ldquo;At
    the hour when you chose flagrantly to disobey my orders you ceased to be
    my overseer. Go back now at once to the factories and report yourself to
    Mathurin, who will take over your duties at the close of the day. After to-day
    you will take up your place once more, among the rank and file and with the
    other workmen&mdash;the same place, in fact, which you occupied before you
    proved yourself unworthy of the trust which M. Gaston de Maurel reposed in
    you. Now you may go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Already while de Maurel spoke, Leroux had slowly advanced toward him, with
    a measured tread that in itself implied rebellion, and hands held tightly
    clenched. Now he came to a halt as close to his master as he dared; his eyes
    shot defiance and rage, his breath came with a hissing sound through his
    set teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not.
    Curse you for your arrogance and your blustering, dictatorial ways. I&rsquo;ll
    not go, do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux!&rdquo;  exclaimed Madame firmly.</p>
  <p>The man turned to look at her; his shifty eyes encountered the warning glance
    wherewith she strove with all her might to enjoin outward yielding and prudence
    to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Maurel is perhaps somewhat harsh, my good Leroux,&rdquo; she
    continued, trying to put as much significance into her words as she dared; &ldquo;but
    I feel sure that on consideration you will decide that submission is really
    the best in your own interests. Let me advise you to return to the factory
    now and to think over quietly the events of the past hour. I feel confident
    that by to-morrow you will have convinced M. de Maurel that you are a man
    worthy of confidence and of trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The moment she began to speak, a change came over Leroux&rsquo; attitude.
    He had, indeed, forgotten for the time being and in the paroxysm of his rage,
    that within a few hours he would hold the employer whom he hated completely
    at his mercy&mdash;in the hollow of his grimy hand. Obviously&mdash;as Madame
    said&mdash;it was in his interest to appear submissive now. He wanted the
    next few hours to himself, to prepare the treacherous coup which was to satisfy
    both his greed and his desire to be revenged upon the execrated taskmaster.
    Any overt rebellion now might render his position doubly difficult later
    in the day, while he still had the power to rally his confederates around
    him. The advent of de Maurel upon the scene had, of a truth, been more than
    unfortunate; but all was not yet lost. He&mdash;Leroux&mdash;was still in
    possession of the Lodge, and, as far as he knew, his degradation to the ranks
    was not to take effect until after the close of day&mdash;not in any event
    till after he had been able to concert with his mates. All these thoughts
    coursed swiftly through his tortuous brain, and he contrived, after a moment
    or two of hesitation, to throw a reassuring look to Madame la Marquise. Then
    he turned to de Maurel, and said with an air of contrition and of shamefacedness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was forgetting myself just now, was I not, M. le Mar&eacute;chal?
    But even Madame la Marquise has deigned to admit that you have been unduly
    harsh with me. I have worked in your factories for over two years now; you
    will not, I hope, degrade me before all my mates in any hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will act as I think best, my man,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel, unperturbed. &ldquo;You
    have wilfully placed yourself outside the pale of my consideration. At the
    same time, you may rest assured that I did not condemn you behind your back.
    Until I actually found you out in flagrant disobedience and disloyalty I
    would not have made a change in the administration of the factory. But anon
    at close of day all your mates will know that you have once more become one
    of themselves. Now go,&rdquo; he added more harshly, &ldquo;and do not waste
    my time with further parleyings. When I return to the works presently, let
    me hear from Mathurin that you are back at your work, and that you are not
    trying by words or acts to incite the others to discontent. Remember that
    I know how to punish, and that I mean to bring back order and discipline
    in my works, if necessary at the cost of utmost rigour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pointed to the door with an authoritative gesture, and Leroux, no longer
    hesitating&mdash;eager, perhaps, to get out of the presence of his master&mdash;shuffled
    across the room. Madame was able to throw him a last, warning look, to which
    he responded by a significant nod of the head. Whether de Maurel actually
    saw either of these two signs, or whether his suspicions had been aroused
    during the interview, it were difficult to say. Certain it is that Leroux
    had already opened the door and was stepping across the threshold, when a
    peremptory &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; from de Maurel brought him to a halt. He remained
    standing under the lintel, his hand upon the door and glancing back over
    his shoulder at Ronnay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; he queried sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will vacate the Lodge at close of day, of course,&rdquo; said
    de Maurel curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vacate the Lodge?&rdquo; muttered Leroux. &ldquo;I cannot vacate
    the Lodge all in a moment like that. What should I do with my clothes? Where
    should I sleep to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the compound,&rdquo; replied de Maurel dryly, &ldquo;and you can
    collect your effects in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is like turning a dog out of his kennel,&rdquo; retorted Leroux
    with a snarl. &ldquo;And who is to sleep at the Lodge to-night? Mathurin
    cannot leave the foundries. There are fifty thousand barrels of powder stacked
    in the shed behind the Lodge ... and fifty men working overtime to-night.
    Who is going to look after them? Who is going to see that the fifty thousand
    barrels of gunpowder are not blown into kingdom come through the carelessness
    of one of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely not you,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel quietly, &ldquo;whose disobedience
    is only equalled by your criminal carelessness. Yesterday, after closing
    hours, I found the side gate open and unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carelessness is not a crime,&rdquo; riposted Leroux in a more conciliatory
    tone. &ldquo;We are all worked to death at the factory like galley-slaves
    ... I more than the rest.... I forgot to see to the side gate&mdash;what?
    It is not a crime. If I am to be turned out of my bed like a cur,&rdquo; he
    reiterated sullenly, &ldquo;who, I should like to know, is going to sleep
    in it to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied de Maurel simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word came simultaneously from two pairs of lips. Madame had spoken it
    instinctively, just as&mdash;instinctively&mdash;she had risen to her feet,
    and Leroux had uttered it hoarsely and raucously, as he suddenly turned on
    his heel, and once more faced the master whom he hated and feared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;  he reiterated in an indefinable tone of incredulity,
    of rage and of terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spoke plainly enough,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel unmoved. &ldquo;Did
    you perchance think that I was jesting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two the man was silent. He stood immovable and quite close
    to de Maurel, the while his shifty gaze tried to probe in the other&rsquo;s
    dark eyes what lay hidden within their depths. And Ronnay, from his great
    height, looked down on the coarse and evil face which was turned up to his;
    he, too, was trying to fathom all that was going on behind that narrow, receding
    forehead and behind the pale, protruding eyes, with their flaccid lids and
    lines around them of recklessness and dissipation. For that brief moment
    there was deadly silence in the room, silence through which the crackling
    of Madame&rsquo;s silk dress could distinctly be heard, as she was quivering
    from head to foot.</p>
  <p>Then Leroux, challenged by de Maurel&rsquo;s fixed gaze, replied slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then see that the Lodge is vacated by ten o&rsquo;clock this evening.
    Overtime work must be finished by then, and you can hand me over all your
    keys ere you go back to the compound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed as if Leroux meant to say something; once or twice he even opened
    his mouth, as if the words were about to tumble out of it; but every time
    that he looked up, he encountered de Maurel&rsquo;s gaze fixed quite steadily
    upon him, and after a while no doubt he realized that for the moment, at
    any rate, he was sorely at a disadvantage. So he contented himself with muttering
    a curse and a threat, after which he turned rapidly on his heel, and with
    a few quick steps he stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Madame had not moved since the moment when de Maurel&rsquo;s announcement
    that he intended to sleep at the Lodge that night had so completely staggered
    her that she felt momentarily dazed and quite unable to think. For a second
    or two it seemed to her as if her heart had completely ceased to beat, as
    if her body alone had remained sitting in the room there, while her spirit
    had fled on the wings of a nameless terror.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ronnay de Maurel at the Lodge that night! What did that mean? How much did
    he know? What did he suspect? These were questions which went hammering through
    her brain while Leroux was finally cowed and dismissed. Now that she was
    once more alone with her son, it was obviously of the most vital importance
    that nothing in her attitude should betray the agitation which she felt.
    She had to make an almost superhuman effort to recover herself, to rise from
    her chair, and to steady her knees which were shaking under her. But all
    this she did, and even succeeded in saying, with every appearance of unconcern:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do think, my dear Ronnay, that you were unnecessarily harsh with
    the man. He is not a sympathetic personality I own, and, of course, he did
    very wrong in disobeying you; but now that we are alone, let me assure you
    that it is indeed my maid Marie whom he has been visiting of late. He knew
    that he had done wrong; your allusion to his own wife roused his surly temper,
    and undoubtedly he forgot himself. And now,&rdquo; she added glibly, &ldquo;shall
    we forget this unpleasant incident? Fernande is in the garden. Shall we join
    her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, Madame,&rdquo; he replied coldly, &ldquo;but I must
    return home as soon as possible. My uncle cannot bear me out of his sight
    for very long, and there are many matters I must attend to before nightfall.
    An you will allow me to pay you my respects another time....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not much respect you have paid me to-day, my good Ronnay,&rdquo; rejoined
    Madame, who, indeed, by now was once again completely mistress of herself. &ldquo;Why
    you should have dragged me into your quarrel with that creature I cannot
    imagine, and I ought to deal very severely with you for this want of consideration
    for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have offended you, Madame, and fear me that I must
    do so again ere I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere not wise to do that, Ronnay,&rdquo; she retorted haughtily; &ldquo;even
    a mother&rsquo;s indulgence hath its limits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I trust that I shall not be overstepping them, Madame, when I request
    you in all earnestness to refrain in future from any intercourse with my
    workpeople.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you afraid that I might succeed in imbuing them with a spirit
    of loyalty to their King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever my motive, Madame, I earnestly pray you to follow my behests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean, your commands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call them that an you wish,&rdquo; he replied slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You forbid me to speak to your workpeople?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not over confident of their loyalty,&rdquo; she said, with
    a sardonic little laugh.</p>
  <p>He made no reply. Madame&rsquo;s searching gaze was fixed upon him; she
    would have given worlds to divine his thoughts. On the whole, she felt reassured
    that he knew nothing of the vital issues which centred round the powder factory
    to-night. She was pretty certain that Leroux would try to see her again to-day&mdash;he
    had probably not left the ch&acirc;teau, and was waiting his opportunity
    to have speech with her as soon as de Maurel had gone. Something would have
    to be devised, something thought of, to meet the unlooked-for eventuality
    of de Maurel&rsquo;s presence at the factory to-night. But for this Madame
    required solitude and a calm view of the new situation. For the moment she
    was supremely conscious of the desire to be alone. Ronnay&rsquo;s presence
    now jarred well nigh unbearably on her nerves; the calm way in which he regarded
    her and dictated his will to her, with a certainty that she would obey, irritated
    her past endurance.</p>
  <p>She turned away from him, for she did not choose to let him see how maddened
    she was, how thoroughly shaken was her usual haughty placidity. She walked
    deliberately to the window and turned her back on him, her aristocratic fingers
    beating a devil&rsquo;s tattoo against the panes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d best go now,&rdquo; suggested de Maurel, after a while,
    in that same awkward manner of his which seemed only to have dropped from
    him when he was dealing with Leroux.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are in your own house, my good Ronnay,&rdquo; rejoined Madame
    coldly, and without turning to look at him; &ldquo;you have a perfect right
    to come and go as you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then am I your obedient servant,&rdquo; he said placidly.</p>
  <p>Madame, from where she stood, could feel that his whole attitude was one
    of complete detachment. Her wrath and her scorn had no more effect on him
    than Leroux&rsquo;  threats of a while ago. She knew instinctively that he
    bowed and took his leave in that clumsy manner which she abhorred. Then she
    heard him moving across the room, opening the door, and finally shutting
    it behind him.</p>
  <p>Even then she did not turn round. She remained standing beside the window,
    gazing out into the distance&mdash;seeing nothing and yet still gazing&mdash;her
    mind fixed upon the one great, all-absorbing puzzle. What was to happen to-night?
    She never moved, while her ears caught the sound of that firm, dragging step
    as it slowly died away in the distance. Then, when even its echo had ceased
    to reverberate through the silent house, she caught at the heavy curtain
    beside her, for suddenly in her whole body there was a relaxing of the tension
    on her nerves, and for the first time in her life Madame de Mortain felt
    ready to swoon. But even when she was all alone she would have scorned an
    unnecessary exhibition of weakness. A few seconds sufficed her to regain
    her self-control. She turned away from the window at last and sat down beside
    the heavy desk whereat she had so often penned enthusiastic reports to the
    Royalist agents. She drew pen and ink closer to her and sat thinking for
    a while. She had a mind to send a letter to de Puisaye&mdash;a runner might
    be found quick and clever enough to deliver it into the hands of the Chouan
    leader in the Cerf-Volant woods and to bring back his answer before nightfall.</p>
  <p>In any case, before she wrote Madame was bent on seeing Leroux again. Leroux
    alone, she thought, would be able to cope with the situation as it now presented
    itself. Leroux was a man of resource, as his correspondence with Madame over
    the wall of the exercising ground had proved. He was not greatly troubled
    with scruples, and though he was by nature a coward, his temper, when roused,
    was apt to be both defiant and ugly.</p>
  <p>Moreover, he was wilful, and would know how to act without any very explicit
    instructions, which Madame, in the absence of the chiefs, was not prepared
    to give him.</p>
  <p>She put down her pen again, and pushing her chair away from the table, she
    rose with an impatient, nervy little sigh. Despite the warmth of this June
    afternoon she shivered, almost as if she felt cold.</p>
  <p>Somewhere in the ch&acirc;teau a distant clock struck six.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter &nbsp;19<br>
    The Parting Of The Ways</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Ten minutes later Matthieu once more knocked discreetly at the door of the
    library, and in response to Madame&rsquo;s call, he opened the door very
    softly and peeped in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux has returned,&rdquo; he said, instinctively dropping his voice,
    even though he knew quite well that no eavesdroppers could be about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; queried Madame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just outside. Shall I show him in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. At once. Stay,&rdquo; she added, as Matthieu had already made
    haste to obey. &ldquo;Where is Mademoiselle de Courson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the garden, I think, Madame la Marquise. But I will go to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Never mind now. But if you see Mademoiselle coming in, ask her
    to go and wait for me in my room upstairs; then let me know immediately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Madame la Marquise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux was standing waiting in the hall, when Matthieu came to tell him
    that Madame la Marquise would see him in the library. He shuffled into the
    room, looking sulky and villainous, nor did he moderate his attitude or assume
    the slightest show of respect when he found himself alone in the presence
    of Madame. He did not remove his tricorne hat as he entered, but merely pushed
    it with a nervy gesture to the back of his head. The first word which he
    spoke was a curse, and he spat on the carpet as he uttered it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  queried Madame haughtily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  he retorted with a leer.</p>
  <p>She would have given worlds for the power to flare up at his impertinence,
    but she and her friends were too deeply involved with the brutish creature
    to venture on rousing his resentment at this hour, when the very throne of
    the King of France rested on the insecure foundation of a recreant&rsquo;s
    loyalty to a bond. The sinister aspect of the ex-convict caused her to shudder;
    she longed for the presence of her brother or her son to help her deal with
    the arrogant ruffian, to turn him from her presence with the contumely which
    she felt, yet dared not express. At the same time, she was longing, with
    a desperate, passionate earnestness, to hear what he had come to say&mdash;she
    longed to hear him put into actual words those thoughts of evil and of darkness
    which had assailed her ever since Ronnay had gone and which she did not dare
    to face. She felt like a man who has been mysteriously and grievously wounded,
    who feels some awful pain which he has not yet had the chance to locate,
    and knows that somewhere on his body there is a hideous and gaping sore,
    unseen as yet by him, which is gnawing at his very life, torturing him insidiously
    and hitherto only felt&mdash;not yet seen&mdash;by him. And, like him, she
    felt that at all costs must she see that hidden wound and realize exactly
    how deeply she was hurt.</p>
  <p>Leroux, with keen, shifty eyes, was watching the play of emotions on Madame&rsquo;s
    haughty face. His mouth was distorted by a hideous grin of scorn and of arrogance.
    He knew well enough how completely he now had all these scheming aristocrats
    at his mercy. One word from him and he could send the lot to moulder in jail
    or else to the guillotine. But strive how he might, he could not perceive
    one single trait of fear in the cold, pale eyes which Madame kept fixed upon
    him; her calmness irritated him, even though he knew well enough that it
    only lay on the surface. An insensate desire seized him to see that proud
    lady cringe with terror, to see her blanch when he made her understand plainly
    the bond which existed between her and him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why have you come back?&rdquo; queried Madame after a while. &ldquo;Have
    you not realized that M. de Maurel might return, too, and that...?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  retorted Leroux fiercely, &ldquo;and if he does ...
    you don&rsquo;t want him in the way, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made no reply, but lifted her handkerchief up to her mouth in order
    to smother the cry which had so instinctively risen to her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; resumed the man gruffly, &ldquo;that you would
    wish to know that, as far as I am concerned, the Mar&eacute;chal&rsquo;s
    interference will not affect our plans in any way. There&rsquo;s plenty of
    time between now and the close of day to talk things over with my mates.
    Do not be afraid, my fine lady, we are prepared for every eventuality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Prepared?&rdquo;  she asked, and her voice sounded choked and hoarse. &ldquo;Prepared?&rdquo; she
    reiterated.  &ldquo;In what way do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, we must assume that the Mar&eacute;chal is not coming down
    in force to-night to turn me out of my Lodge, mustn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he
    queried with a snarl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No ... I suppose not,&rdquo; she replied vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he rejoined slowly, &ldquo;we can deal with him
    easily enough if he is alone&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more Madame had to make a vigorous effort to repress a cry of horror.
    The combat which she was fighting with herself while the impudent wretch
    stood looking down on her, his hands buried in the pockets of his breeches,
    his feet planted wide apart, his whole attitude one of arrogance and of scorn&mdash;was,
    indeed, a bitter one. On one side were ranged her fanatical enthusiasm for
    a cause which she held to be as sacred as that of her faith, and her boundless
    belief in the efficacy of the coup which had been planned for this night.
    To jeopardize its success now at this eleventh hour, by allowing her sensibilities
    to overmaster her, would in her eyes have been akin to the blackest, the
    most dire treachery toward her King and her country.</p>
  <p>Indeed, at this moment she was putting to pagan uses and misinterpreting
    the dictum of the Gospel: &ldquo;If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out.&rdquo; She
    was wilfully closing her heart against every dictate of sentiment or of motherhood.
    As she would have been ready&mdash;and more than ready&mdash;to risk her
    own life for the sake of her cause, so was she willing to throw into the
    balance of her King&rsquo;s cause the safety of a man who happened to be
    in the way, even if at the same time he happened to be her son.</p>
  <p>And Leroux, the servile tool in the nefarious work, knew exactly what was
    passing in the proud lady&rsquo;s mind: he knew that she had understood the
    covert hint which he had thrown out, and that by her very silence she had
    acquiesced in his schemes.</p>
  <p>He had no intention of relinquishing the ten thousand francs which had been
    offered him because of that obstacle which he was more than ready to sweep
    out of his path. Murderer, incendiary, thief, jail-bird and convict!&mdash;what
    was a crime more or less upon the conscience of such a man? Nor did he feel
    the slightest respect for these people who had bribed him to do a monstrous
    treachery. Brute as he was, he was shrewd enough to look upon them as his
    equals in villainy, and to realize that they had far more to gain by the
    iniquitous deed which he contemplated than he had himself.</p>
  <p>And for a while there was silence in the room while this man and this woman&mdash;the
    jail-bird and the high-born lady&mdash;looked straight into one another&rsquo;s
    eyes and tacitly sealed a bond of fraternity between them. The measured ticking
    of a clock upon the mantelpiece marked the passage of time which separated
    this unspoken and monstrous compact from its fulfilment by and by. A bundle
    of papers beneath Madame&rsquo;s hand rustled with weird persistency, and
    suddenly Leroux gave a laugh, throwing back his head and showing his ugly
    yellow teeth, and he shrugged his shoulders and spat once more on the carpet
    ere he queried with contemptuous familiarity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then our plans are as they were&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As they were,&rdquo; replied Madame.</p>
  <p>The man turned on his heel and started whistling the old &ldquo;<i>&Ccedil;a
      ira</i>&rdquo; of Revolution times through his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>&Ccedil;a ira! &Ccedil;a ira! Les aristos &agrave; la lanterne!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His hand was already on the handle of the door, when he looked once more
    over his shoulder and said roughly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your people are not going to leave me in the lurch, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is out of the question,&rdquo; replied Madame coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you know, my good woman,&rdquo; he said, still over his shoulder,
    as he opened the door and stepped across the threshold, &ldquo;if the Mar&eacute;chal
    gives us trouble to-night and your people fail us afterwards, it will mean
    hanging for some of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at Madame and nodded with studied insolence by way of farewell.
    But she seemed to have forgotten his presence already. She sat upright and
    stiff in the high-backed chair, the silk of her gown falling in rigid folds
    around her, the darkness of her attire relieved by a white scarf round her
    shoulders. Her face was set and pale beneath the hard line of her white hair
    dressed in the mode of the past generation, her eyes stared, unseeing, before
    her. Leroux laughed once more&mdash;it was the scornful laugh of a hardened
    criminal for what he termed a white-livered beginner. Once more he shrugged
    his shoulders, then with a final muttered imprecation he stalked out of the
    hall.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The moment he had gone Madame pulled herself together with an almost superhuman
    effort of will; she shook herself free from the torpor which had momentarily
    paralysed her limbs, and, rising to her feet, she went quickly to the door
    which Leroux had left ajar.</p>
  <p>It had seemed to her that the moment when the man&rsquo;s shuffling footsteps
    began to resound against the marble floor of the hall, he had uttered an
    exclamation of surprise, and that exclamation from Leroux had at once been
    followed by another sound&mdash;one soft and mournful like a sigh.</p>
  <p>Less than five seconds later Madame was in the hall&mdash;just in time to
    see Fernande walking rapidly across it toward the monumental glazed doors
    which gave on the outside stairway and on the terraces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande,&rdquo;  she called authoritatively, &ldquo;where are you
    going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively the young girl had paused when she heard her name, but it
    was only for an instant; the next she had resumed her quick walk, and had
    just reached the first glazed door when Madame overtook her and, without
    warning, seized her peremptorily by the wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Fernande?&rdquo; she reiterated harshly.</p>
  <p>The girl looked round at her somewhat wildly, then she made a vigorous effort
    to disengage her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going out, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she replied, with a quietude
    which in no way deceived Madame la Marquise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out?&rdquo;  queried Madame. &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into the garden, <i>ma tante</i>. The heat indoors is oppressive
    and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie, Fernande,&rdquo; broke in Madame curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie. Tell me where you are going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as the girl made no reply but drew up her slim, graceful figure to
    its full height and looked fearlessly into the austere face of Madame de
    Mortain, the latter continued sternly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see Leroux just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Fernande quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you heard what he said just as he was leaving?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two longer the two women stood looking keenly into one another&rsquo;s
    eyes. The vast ch&acirc;teau was solitary and still; not a sound came from
    within, and the heavy doors shut out effectually all the many sounds which
    fill the air on a warm, midsummer afternoon: the call of thrush and blackbird,
    the distant croaking of frogs and cooing of wood-pigeons, the flutter of
    parched leaves upon the tiny boughs and tripping of unseen little beasts
    through thicket and shrubbery.</p>
  <p>It was Madame whose eyes were the first to veil themselves behind their
    heavy lids, in order to conceal the thoughts within from the searching gaze
    of the younger woman. The next moment Fernande was free to go; Madame no
    longer held her wrist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will not ask you again, my child, whither you are going,&rdquo; she
    said quietly. &ldquo;Since first the rising nations were torn between conflicting
    parties of men who had divergent aims there have been traitors as well as
    heroes in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, my child, for at this supreme moment of your whole
    existence you are standing at the parting of the ways, at the cross-roads
    where many a woman has stood before you, hesitating at the two turnings which
    faced her on the tortuous path of life. Many a woman before you has taken
    the wrong turning, Fernande. Take care that you do not do the same and for
    ever after weep endless tears of remorse and of shame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would indeed weep bitter tears, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; retorted
    the girl firmly, &ldquo;if I were to allow the monstrous outrage to be perpetrated
    which that dastardly wretch hath even now set out to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You rave, Fernande,&rdquo; rejoined Madame quietly, &ldquo;and &rsquo;tis
    not my purpose to probe into the thoughts which are leading you at this moment
    into the path of treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no treachery, <i>ma tante</i>, in warning an unsuspecting
    man that a murderer&rsquo;s hand is raised against him in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You talk at random, child, and your ears deceived you if you attribute
    such intentions to Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In any event, <i>ma tante</i>, will you send a runner over to M.
    de Puisaye and let him know what has occurred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What has occurred?&rdquo; queried Madame, with a slight lift of her
    eyebrow in token of contemptuous surprise. &ldquo;What&mdash;in your estimation&mdash;has
    occurred, my dear Fernande, that would justify my upsetting M. de Puisaye
    at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you let M. de Puisaye know that M. de Maurel will be at the
    factory to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I? In what way do you suppose that M. de Maurel&rsquo;s
    comings and goings can possibly affect the business of His Majesty the King,
    or the plans which his faithful adherents have formed for the triumph of
    his cause?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; protested Fernande, with all the fervour
    and all the strength at her command, &ldquo;you know quite well what I mean.
    M. de Puisaye must be told that if M. de Maurel goes to the factory to-night,
    Leroux has it in him to commit a dastardly murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Puisaye cannot obviously prevent M. de Maurel from going to
    his own factory to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. But he can prevent the dastardly deed from being accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not for me to try and influence the actions of our chiefs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is for every woman&mdash;every human being who has a spark of
    loyalty and Christianity in them&mdash;to try and prevent murder being done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the space of a second or two Madame made no retort; there was a cold
    glance of mockery in her eyes. Then she said slowly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had you perchance thought of confronting M. de Puisaye yourself and
    trying to turn him from his purpose by your wild and incredible tales? Let
    me assure you, child, that our chief is not the man to allow one life&mdash;and
    that the life of our bitter enemy&mdash;to stand in the way of His Majesty&rsquo;s
    cause and of its success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Fernande in horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, child,&rdquo; rejoined Madame coldly, &ldquo;I do but
    waste my time in arguing with you. You are self-willed and obstinate, and
    in your heart you have chosen to range yourself on the side of the enemy
    of your King and of your kindred. Therefore, I will not argue. &rsquo;Tis
    for you to probe your heart, and find out for yourself how much disloyalty
    doth lurk in it against Laurent, against your father, against all your friends.
    With that I have nothing to do. In the happy times which are so near to us
    now, when the King of France comes to his throne again through the self-sacrifice
    and the heroism of those whom in your heart you proclaim murderers and outcasts&mdash;when
    that happy time comes, I say, repentance will come with it for you. Until
    then nothing I may say now will turn you back to the path of loyalty. But
    let me tell you this, Fernande,&rdquo;  continued Madame with desperate earnestness, &ldquo;that
    whatever you may think, whatever you may suspect, whatever you may fear,
    if you speak one word of warning to Ronnay de Maurel you will not only be
    betraying the cause of your King and of your country, but you will also betray
    your father, your lover&mdash;every one of your kindred and your friends.
    Your father, M. de Puisaye and Laurent are in camp at this moment in the
    Cerf-Volant woods on the other side of Mortain; within the next few hours
    they will have started upon their march: Laurent for Domfront, M. de Puisaye
    for La Frontenay, your father to carry out the surprise attack against the
    garrison of Mortain. If the slightest alarm be given to the garrison of Domfront&mdash;and
    you may be sure that after your warning, that is one of the first things
    which Ronnay de Maurel will do&mdash;Laurent will be the first to fall into
    the <i>guet-apens</i> which you will have been the means of preparing for
    him; with Laurent&rsquo;s failure to surprise that garrison, your father&rsquo;s
    attack on Mortain is bound to fail. Domfront will warn Mortain; your father&rsquo;s
    small force will be cut up, he himself either killed or a prisoner in the
    hands of the Imperialist forces, with the prospect of the guillotine or,
    at best, deportation before him. Of myself I will not even speak, and will
    leave you to imagine the fate which will await M. de Puisaye on his march
    hither, once de Maurel&rsquo;s five thousand works men are prepared against
    his coming. The catastrophe of 1800, when Cadoudal and all his followers
    perished for our cause, will be repeated once again; and this time the fate
    of your kindred, of your lover and of your father, will be laid at your door,
    their blood will sully your hands. To save the man whom in your treacherous
    heart you have come to set above your King and your caste, you will have
    sacrificed your father, the lives of your nearest kin and the honour of your
    name. And now, child,&rdquo; she concluded calmly, &ldquo;thank God on your
    knees that I was here in time to save you from committing a crime, beside
    which in the years to come the foulest betrayal that hath ever blackened
    the pages of our country&rsquo;s history will seem like the thoughtless prank
    of a child. I&rsquo;ll say no more, Fernande. You are free to take the turning
    which your heart will indicate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The harsh, strident voice resounded from end to end of the vast hall; it
    beat against Fernande&rsquo;s brain long after the marble walls had ceased
    to send back its echo. Madame gathered her heavy silk skirts around her and
    then, without another word, without another look for the unhappy girl on
    whose finest feelings she had so ruthlessly trampled, she sailed across the
    hall and up the monumental staircase, and her soft footfall alone went echoing
    now through the silent house.</p>
  <p>For a few moments Fernande remained quite still ... white and rigid like
    the marble pillars around her; only her mouth twitched convulsively, and
    there was a look of mute agony in her face. The swish of Madame&rsquo;s skirts
    soon ceased to resound from above; after a while Fernande&rsquo;s straining
    senses heard the opening and shutting of a door ... then nothing more&mdash;silence
    absolute, and the utter solitude of a soul that is irrevocably parted from
    its mate.</p>
  <p>A heartrending sob broke from the unfortunate girl&rsquo;s overburdened
    heart. She staggered forward and, pushing open the heavy glazed door, she
    ran like one pursued down the monumental stone steps which led to the garden
    beyond. She ran&mdash;looking neither to right or left&mdash;across the terrace
    to a distant shrubbery which screened her favourite walk and a seat whereon
    she liked to sit and dream. As soon as she felt that she was quite alone,
    and that no prying eyes could look upon her misery, she fell on her knees,
    and throwing her arms over the seat, she buried her head between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Dear God! tell me what to do!
    Give me some sign&mdash;a word&mdash;a token! Oh, my God! have mercy! Tell
    me what to do! Tell me which road to take!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter &nbsp;20<br>
    The Straw</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The clock in the tower of the ch&acirc;teau struck nine when Fernande, wrapped
    in a dark cloak and with a hood thrown over her head, stole on tip-toe across
    the hall and slipped through the glazed doors and down the perron steps.
    She went along with utmost caution, peering all round her ere she ventured
    along.</p>
  <p>Once past the terrace she felt freer, and without hesitation she dived into
    the path which, winding through the shrubberies, led both to the main entrance
    of the park and to a small postern gate in the boundary wall.</p>
  <p>After the sultriness of the day the evening was oppressive and dark; heavy
    banks of clouds had gathered before the crescent moon, and there was a stillness
    in the air which presaged a storm. The splendid gardens of La Frontenay were
    wrapped in gloom; not a breath stirred the leaves of secular oaks and chestnuts;
    not a sound came from out the thicket, save now and then the crackling of
    tiny twigs under the feet of furtive little beasts that ran scurrying by.</p>
  <p>From over the hills there came from time to time the roll of distant thunder,
    and ever and anon a flash of summer lightning threw for the merest fraction
    of a second a weird glow on the far-off woods, and the vague outline of the
    factory buildings some three kilom&egrave;tres away.</p>
  <p>Fernando, holding her cloak tightly around her, slipped through the postern
    gate, and found herself in the lane which after a few hundred m&egrave;tres
    abuts on the high road; from this point the foundries could be reached in
    a little over half an hour. She walked as quickly as the darkness would allow.
    She had never been along this way before, but she knew that she could not
    miss it. Darkness was her friend and her ally in her nocturnal expedition,
    since it kept her hidden from the view of the occasional passer-by.</p>
  <p>The road was lonely enough. It was long after working hours; the factory
    hands and foundry men had, for the most part, returned to their homes; here
    and there in the distance a tiny light from a cottage window glimmered feebly
    like a yellow winking eye out of the surrounding blackness; and up on the
    height the village of La Vieuville clustered around its church and its ch&acirc;teau.</p>
  <p>After the excitement and the soul agony of the day, Fernande felt perfectly
    calm. The horrible alternative which Madame la Marquise had so ruthlessly
    placed before her had put all her sensibilities and every one of her nerves
    on the rack, until the very faculty for suffering had gone from her, and
    she felt numbed and bruised both physically and mentally. But during that
    terrible hour, when driven forth like a hunted creature to seek shelter and
    solitude from the cruel taunts of Madame, she had prayed to God to guide
    her in her terrible perplexity, a resolution had gradually taken form in
    her mind, a resolution which she firmly believed had been instilled into
    her in answer to her impassioned prayer.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise was, no doubt, right when she said that the life or death
    of a bitter enemy was not like to turn Joseph de Puisaye from his present
    purpose. An appeal or a warning to him at this hour from anyone but Madame
    herself would obviously not only be futile, but would waste several precious,
    irreclaimable hours.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, if she&mdash;Fernande&mdash;did go to La Vieuville&mdash;as
    her first instinct had prompted her to do&mdash;and warned de Maurel not
    to go alone to the factory this night, there was no doubt that the plans
    of de Puisaye would not only be gravely jeopardized, but they would be rendered
    impossible of execution, and her father&rsquo;s position, not to speak of
    Laurent&rsquo;s and of the other chiefs&rsquo;, would be irretrievably compromised&mdash;their
    lives probably in danger. De Maurel, scenting a conspiracy, would at once
    pass the word round to the garrisons close by, and until their arrival he
    would know how to protect his property with the help of his own loyal workmen.</p>
  <p>This, Madame had undoubtedly put very clearly before Fernande; she could
    not save de Maurel from the <i>guet-apens</i> which had been prepared against
    him, except by sacrificing Laurent, her father and her friends&mdash;her
    King and his cause. Indeed, it was only God who could show a way through
    such an appalling perplexity, and Fernande was more than justified in her
    conviction that the thought which came to her whilst she knelt heart-broken
    and in prayer, was a direct manifestation of His will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can at least save him from that assassin,&rdquo; she thought, when
    at nine o&rsquo;clock she started on her way.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Fernande had only once been to the La Frontenay factories, and that was
    over a year ago in the company of de Maurel. Since then she had purposely
    avoided taking her walks in that direction, and her recollection of the place
    was, therefore, hazy and incomplete. She had now been walking a little over
    half an hour when a sudden bend in the road revealed the proximity of the
    huge pile of irregular buildings&mdash;standing partly within iron fencings,
    partly inside the precincts of high boundary walls&mdash;which nestled at
    the foot of the hills and represented Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s priceless
    patrimony.</p>
  <p>Up to now she had met an occasional passer-by on the highway&mdash;a belated
    workman going to his home, a young pair of lovers out for a stroll, a housewife
    with heavy basket returning from Domfront&mdash;but here silence and loneliness
    appeared to be absolute. A row of street-lanthorns fixed in the boundary
    walls of the group of buildings shed uneven circles of light at intervals,
    and inside the precincts a few of the windows showed a light, whilst higher
    up two clock-towers loomed out of the darkness like monster glow-worms.</p>
  <p>Fernande walked a few hundred m&egrave;tres further on and then she came
    to a standstill, trying to co-ordinate her recollections of the place. That
    time&mdash;a year ago&mdash;de Maurel had conducted her through the foundries
    first, and then he had led her through a gate in the iron fencing, across
    a clearing to another gate built in the high wall. This gave on a vast quadrangle,
    on every side of which lay the worksheds of the powder factory. Her thoughts
    on it all were still very chaotic, but she had a vague remembrance of the
    large storehouse standing in the centre of the quadrangle and surmounted
    by its clock-tower, of Mathurin escorting her after she had taken leave of
    de Maurel, back through the postern gate and along a footpath until she came
    once more to the main road, where the carriole and the high-stepper stood
    waiting to take her home again to Courson.</p>
  <p>Now when she closed her eyes, shutting away the confusion of lights which
    flickered through the impenetrable shadows, she was able to visualize the
    locality more accurately. The foundries obviously lay to her right behind
    the iron fencing; the powder factory lay beyond, some two-thirds of a kilom&egrave;tre
    away, isolated, and well away from the road inside its high encircling walls.
    With the various positions thus fixed upon her mind, Fernande advanced more
    boldly. Her heart was beating tumultuously in her bosom&mdash;not with fear,
    but with vague wonderment as to what was to come. The sight of the high walls
    had given her the first pang of doubt. If gates were closed against her,
    if sentries challenged, what would she do?</p>
  <p>But she had no mind to draw back. On her actions, she felt, depended the
    life of a brave man and also the honour of her cause. She walked quickly
    past the foundries on the opposite side of the road; then, when she saw the
    factory walls, she crossed over, and keeping well within the shadows, she
    found herself presently outside the main gates. They were of forged iron,
    high, massive and forbidding; a metal lanthorn was fixed immediately above
    them, and at the moment when she passed into the circle of light projected
    by the lanthorn, a peremptory voice called out from within: &ldquo;Who goes
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At once she beat a hasty retreat and a frown of deep perplexity settled
    upon her brow. If she could not get to the Lodge at all, how would she speak
    with Leroux? What would she do to save an unsuspecting man&mdash;a brave
    man&mdash;from assassination?</p>
  <p>Vividly, as in a flash of awakened memory, there came back to her mind every
    word of that conversation which she had overheard this afternoon between
    Madame, Leroux and de Maurel, she heard once more&mdash;as distinctly as
    she had heard it then&mdash;Leroux&rsquo;  savage question: &ldquo;Who is
    to sleep at the Lodge to-night?&rdquo; She heard the simple answer: &ldquo;I
    am!&rdquo; She heard Leroux&rsquo; snarls and his overt threats, she heard
    de Maurel&rsquo;s accusing words: &ldquo;Your disobedience is only equalled
    by your criminal carelessness!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then her heart gave a leap. Memory did not play her false; it brought back
    also the very words which now gave her renewed hope and courage. &ldquo;Last
    night, after closing hours,&rdquo; de Maurel had said, &ldquo;I found the
    side gate open and unguarded.&rdquo;  Leroux, most like, surly and obstinate,
    would not redeem the carelessness of the day before. It was more than probable
    that he would leave the gate unguarded again to-night.</p>
  <p>Buoyed by this hope, excitement getting the better of her quietude of a
    while ago, Fernande now retraced her steps in order to find the footpath
    which, somewhere between the foundry fencing and the factory wall, must,
    she knew, lead to the side gate through which Mathurin had conducted her
    a year ago.</p>
  <p>Her memory had not deceived her; after a minute or two she struck the path
    and at once turned to walk rapidly along it. Darkness here was absolute;
    there were no lanthorns fixed either in the wall or the fencing, only a couple
    of hundred m&egrave;tres on ahead a tiny glimmer of light flickered feebly
    through the gloom. Fernande was walking more cautiously now, and she felt
    the wall as she went all along with her hand. She had fixed her eyes on that
    tiny glimmer which seemed to her like a beacon which would lead her to her
    goal. Soon it revealed itself as a small, well-screened light fixed just
    above a low iron gate.</p>
  <p>No one challenged her this time as she approached, and by the dim light
    above she felt for the latch. It yielded. She pushed open the gate, and the
    next moment she found herself inside the precincts of the powder factory.
    Everything was dark around her, and through the darkness there loomed up
    dense and black the pile of irregular low buildings&mdash;the sheds, the
    offices, the workshops, with, in the centre, the somewhat taller edifice
    of the storehouse, which contained the vast reserves of explosives. It was
    surmounted by a clock-tower, from which the rays of an unseen lamp projected
    a large circle of light on the pavement below; close by was a small building,
    presumably the Lodge. At any rate, this was the only spot in the large quadrangle
    which showed signs of life inside its walls. Everything else was absolutely
    still as well as dark. Fernande ventured nearer, then she paused, breathless.
    She had come to the end of her journey, to the point where her powers of
    persuasion would be put to the test, where she would have to rely upon herself,
    upon her own eloquence, her own personality, in order to compel a few miscreants
    to abandon their dastardly purpose.</p>
  <p>For the first time here, where only a few m&egrave;tres separated her from
    that band of assassins, she realized the possibility of failure; and she
    realized that her plan, which had seemed so simple and so direct at home,
    was, indeed, like a mere straw at which a dying man might clutch.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There was a light in two of the windows of the Lodge; one of these was open;
    through it came the murmur of muffled voices. Fernande tip-toed up to it
    as closely as she dared. She would have given worlds to hear what was said
    in there&mdash;by Leroux and his mates, whose purpose it was to betray their
    master this night&mdash;God help them!&mdash;to murder him if he stood in
    their way.</p>
  <p>Oh, for the power to avert that awful catastrophe without betraying her
    own father, her friends and her King!</p>
  <p>But though thoughts, projects, wild hopes and wilder fears went on hammering
    at the portals of her brain, it seemed to her that they went round and round
    in a continuous circle, which never diverged from that one appalling centre: &ldquo;If
    the alarm is given, the forces which have started from Mortain under de Puisaye,
    under Laurent and under her father, cannot fail to be surprised&mdash;cannot
    fail to be overwhelmed and possibly annihilated; at best, the whole project
    whereon now rests the hopes of the entire Royalist party is doomed to fail;
    and she&mdash;Fernande de Courson&mdash;would be the traitor who had betrayed
    her own kindred and the cause of her King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a while she felt more calm. Finality to a brave soul does not mean
    despair&mdash;it means a renewal of courage to face or fight even the inevitable.
    No longer hesitating now, Fernande walked boldly up the steps which led to
    the entrance door of the Lodge; then she rapped on the door with her knuckles.</p>
  <p>The strain of muffled voices which had come from within died down at her
    loud rat-tat, and through the open window she heard a sound like the shuffling
    and scurrying of heavy, furtive feet; then nothing more.</p>
  <p>The roll of distant thunder had become louder and more continuous, the flashes
    of summer lightning more frequent. From the wooded heights behind the factories
    there came the intermittent soughing of the wind through the trees, followed
    by an absolute stillness, a calm which was the direct forerunner of the coming
    storm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The air was sultry and filled with the sickening odour of sulphur. From
    time to time a heavy raindrop descended, large as a thumbnail, and Fernande
    fell to wondering how her father and Laurent would fare on their march if
    the storm broke with its threatened violence, and how far de Puisaye and
    his four hundred men were at this hour from La Frontenay.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>After a while she knocked again. This time she heard distinctly a heavy,
    shuffling footstep approaching the door. Though her heart was beating so
    violently that its throbbing felt nigh to choking her, she was not the least
    afraid, and when, after a moment or two, the door was thrown open and Leroux&rsquo; ungainly
    figure appeared before her, silhouetted against the light beyond, she spoke
    quite calmly and without the slightest tremor in her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is I, Leroux,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle de Courson&mdash;you
    know me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man came nearer to her. She was standing on a step below him and the
    light from a hanging lamp in the room behind him fell full upon her face.
    He looked at her keenly for a few seconds, then he replied curtly: &ldquo;Yes.
    I know you! What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To speak with you, Leroux,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a message
    for you from Madame la Marquise de Mortain. Let me in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Marquise chooses her messenger strangely,&rdquo; he retorted
    sullenly, &ldquo;at this hour of the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one else was willing to affront the coming storm. Our servants
    are cowards. Let me in, Leroux.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux made no immediate reply. He looked over his shoulder into the interior
    of the room, apparently with a view to taking counsel with his mates. Fernande,
    with her hood and cloak drawn closely round her, waited on the doorstep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That moment a vivid flash of lightning rent the heavy bank of clouds in
    the east, and a clap of thunder rolled echoing above the hills. She suppressed
    an involuntary cry of terror, but she called out more insistently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me in, Leroux. &rsquo;Tis a matter of life and death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Leroux did not stand aside; instead of this, he stepped over the threshold,
    and as Fernande instinctively retreated, he came down the steps, and then
    he closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me in, Leroux,&rdquo; she said more peremptorily. &ldquo;I cannot
    speak with you out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I have no secrets that the night
    birds may not hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Every time that he spoke Leroux came a step or two nearer to her, and every
    time she retreated as far away from him as she dared, without arousing his
    resentment and causing him to turn sullenly from her and refuse to listen
    to what she had come to say. Thus he had forced her as far back as the circle
    of light which came from the clock-tower. Here he paused and looked her up
    and down with every mark of surliness and insolence imprinted upon his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now what is it?&rdquo; he queried roughly. &ldquo;And be quick about
    it. There&rsquo;s men&rsquo;s work to be done here to-night. &rsquo;Tis not
    a place for women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; replied Fernande boldly; &ldquo;the work that
    I am doing now is really men&rsquo;s work. It is nearly four kilom&egrave;tres
    from La Frontenay, and I have walked all the way. The storm will be at its
    height ere I can get home again. Think you I would have come, had it not
    been a matter of life and death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked the man fearlessly in the eyes. For the first time since she
    left home more than an hour ago, she realized the enormity of what she had
    done. Through the partially opened window of the Lodge she could hear men
    moving and whispering. How many of them there were she could not say. She
    was here all alone, unknown to every one at home, at the mercy of men who
    already had every conceivable crime upon their conscience. Not that she feared
    any violence on their part; she was under the unseen &aelig;gis of their
    new employers, of those who were paying them for the abominable work which
    was to be done this night. She had no thought of her own personal safety.
    What she dreaded was the failure of her enterprise, a failure which would
    result, perhaps, in her being forced to witness that which she would give
    her life&rsquo;s blood to avert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say what you want, then,&rdquo; said Leroux gruffly, &ldquo;and get
    you gone. Madame la Marquise should have known better than to send a comely
    wench like you philandering at night upon the high roads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She had no choice,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande quietly. &ldquo;She had
    no one else to send, and she desired me to tell you that you must not think
    of misinterpreting her words of this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What words?&rdquo; he queried with a frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Marquise feared that she had not put it plainly enough
    to you, that whatever else happened this night, she and all our leaders would
    hold you responsible for the life and safety of M. de Maurel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux was silent for a moment or two, but it had seemed to Fernande as
    if through the open window she had heard a low laugh&mdash;one that in the
    stillness of the night sounded weirdly mirthless and satanic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oho! that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; quoth Leroux after a while, with
    a leer. &ldquo;Madame la Marquise is suddenly troubled with remorse. The
    precious son, whom a few hours ago she was ready enough to sacrifice to her
    own schemes, has suddenly become as the apple of her eye....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must not say that, Leroux,&rdquo; broke in Fernande steadily. &ldquo;Madame
    la Marquise never dreamed of sacrificing any of her friends to her schemes&mdash;let
    alone her own son; and apparently she was justified in thinking that you
    had misinterpreted her thoughts....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you think that she was justified in sending you to plead de Maurel&rsquo;s
    cause&mdash;what?&rdquo; retorted the creature with a snarl. &ldquo;But if
    you have come here, my wench, in order to stand between me and that man,
    then the sooner you go back home the better it will be for you. You can tell
    Madame la Marquise that I&rsquo;ll deal with the Mar&eacute;chal as I choose
    ... and if he were twenty times her son and twenty times your lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You forget yourself, Leroux,&rdquo; said Fernande with quiet dignity,
    choosing to ignore the hideous wretch&rsquo;s coarse insult. &ldquo;You are
    being paid&mdash;and heavily paid, in order that you should do as you are
    told. When Madame la Marquise gave you the orders for to-night, she did not
    reckon on M. de Maurel standing in the way of M. de Puisaye&rsquo;s plans.
    No one can prevent his coming here anon, we know, but his presence here&mdash;alone&mdash;cannot
    possibly interfere with any of our plans; therefore, it rests with you to
    see that no harm comes to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again that muffled laugh, coming from the Lodge, grated ominously on Fernande&rsquo;s
    ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Leroux cynically, &ldquo;if it rests with me to
    see that no harm comes to the man whom I hate most in all the world, we may
    as well reckon that Bonaparte will have one Marshal less by to-morrow wherewith
    to beat the Prussians.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will find,&rdquo; retorted Fernande, who was determined not
    to allow a hideous sense of foreboding to paralyse her courage, &ldquo;that
    if you disregard Madame de Mortain&rsquo;s orders ... if you touch but a
    hair of M. de Maurel&rsquo;s head, my father and all our chiefs will exact
    the fullest reprisals from you. And, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, Leroux,&rdquo; she
    added in more persuasive tones, &ldquo;will you reflect for one moment? What
    is there to gain by an act of violence which will redound with unmitigated
    severity against you? Our chiefs will disclaim any participation in such
    an outrage, and you will be left to bear the utmost consequences of your
    own act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at her for a moment, and his attitude now became so insolent,
    that, much against her will, a burning flush overspread Fernande&rsquo;s
    cheeks. After a while he gave a low chuckle and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are, of a truth, in a sad quandary&mdash;eh, my girl?&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;You dare not go to your sweetheart and tell him to keep out
    of my way, for fear that he might smell a rat and interfere with your precious
    friends&rsquo; plans. At the same time, I for one do not see what else there
    is left for you to do. Go to him by all means and see if you cannot persuade
    him to remain quietly at home with you&mdash;no harm would come to him then,
    I promise you that&mdash;and he wouldn&rsquo;t be wasting his time, either.
    But if he chooses to come here and try any of his arrogance upon me, then,
    by the name of Satan, there&rsquo;ll be trouble ... that is all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While the abominable wretch spat out his hideous insults, his ugly face,
    by the dim light from above, appeared distorted by a significant leer. Fernande
    now was almost overcome with horror&mdash;not at her own helplessness, for,
    of a truth, she was ready to brave the villain to the last&mdash;but at the
    utter failure of her appeal, and at the certainty that, strive how she might,
    nothing would move him from his fell purpose. The man meant murder&mdash;dastardly,
    cowardly murder&mdash;against a defenceless man; his whole attitude proclaimed
    it, his words, his awful sneers. And Fernande, feeling now like a poor captive
    beast on the leash, knew that she was bruising her pride, her heart, her
    hands against the bond of impotence which she was powerless to tear asunder.
    The sense of horror had gradually crept into her innermost being&mdash;it
    was paralysing her limbs and her will.</p>
  <p>But suddenly the man paused; the impudent leer fled from his face, giving
    place to an expression of tense excitement. He put up his hand as if to enjoin
    silence, then placed a grimy finger to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;  he whispered.</p>
  <p>And Fernande, straining her ears to listen, caught the clicking sound of
    an iron latch and the creaking of a gate upon its hinges.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; said Leroux curtly.</p>
  <p>At once and with sudden impulse Fernande had drawn back hastily out of the
    circle of light into the dense shadow cast by the tall storehouse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must not see me here,&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; riposted Leroux dryly. &ldquo;But &rsquo;tis
    too late, my wench, to run that way,&rdquo; he added, seeing that Fernande
    was ready to fly. &ldquo;You would fall straight into his arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, without any warning and before she had time or desire to scream, he
    seized her wrist, and drawing quite close to her, he whispered in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have just two minutes in which to make up your mind, my girl.
    Go to the Lodge now, at once, and wait there; he&rsquo;ll go in after you.
    Talk to him, persuade him, do anything you like. We don&rsquo;t want to hurt
    him ... curse him!... unless he interferes with us. I&rsquo;ll let my mates
    out by the back door, then lock you both in together in the Lodge&mdash;eh?
    And you and he would be quite safe and snug,&rdquo; he added, with a chuckle
    which was far more offensive than any words he might utter, &ldquo;while
    we do your party&rsquo;s work out here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With an exclamation of loathing, Fernande managed to disengage her wrist,
    and a savage oath escaped the vile creature&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, which is it to be?&rdquo; he queried fiercely. &ldquo;Am I
    to speak with the Mar&eacute;chal or are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With an almost superhuman effort Fernande contrived to conquer the feeling
    of sheer physical nausea wherewith this abominable wretch inspired her, and
    she even succeeded in saying almost calmly under her breath:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are to act on the message which I brought you from Madame la
    Marquise. She and my father, M. de Courson, will hold you responsible for
    the life of M. de Maurel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tshaw!&rdquo;  he exclaimed contemptuously.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly, as the imminence of the catastrophe appeared to come nearer
    and nearer the while that firm footstep, still a few m&egrave;tres away,
    dragged along the flagstones of the yard, Fernande suddenly felt all her
    pride falling away from her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux!&rdquo;  she cried, and she was nothing but an humble suppliant
    now. She would have gone down on her knees had she thought to mollify him
    by this act of self-abasement.  &ldquo;Leroux! you would not sully your hands
    and our cause by such an abominable crime....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the whispered words died upon her lips, a hot, evil-smelling hand was
    summarily pressed against them, and a raucous voice murmured in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence! He&rsquo;ll hear you! Silence, I say, or I&rsquo;ll strangle
    you first and shoot him after. Now, then, if you don&rsquo;t want him to
    see you, slip away round the storehouse; while he argues with me, you can
    run as far as the gate&mdash;and you may thank your stars that I don&rsquo;t
    happen to have the time or the wish to deal more harshly with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He pushed her roughly away from him, and she, feeling faint and sick, was
    only just able to totter back against the protecting wall of the building.
    Leroux had already turned his back on her, and suddenly through the gloom
    she perceived de Maurel&rsquo;s tall figure coming at a quiet, moderate pace
    across the quadrangle, swinging as he walked a safety lanthorn which he carried.</p>
  <p>There was no time now for further pleadings, protests, admonitions; there
    was no time even to think. Fernande&rsquo;s mind was in a whirl, out of which
    only one thought remained clear: that she would stay and save Ronnay de Maurel
    even now if she could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They will not dare ... while I stand by,&rdquo; was the one distinct
    impression which she retained in the midst of her chaotic emotions. She had
    just time to withdraw within the shelter of a projecting piece of masonry,
    from whence she could still see Leroux standing in the full light of the
    tower lamp, defiant and expectant, not twenty paces away from her, and de
    Maurel approaching slowly, swinging his safety lanthorn in his hand.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter &nbsp;21<br>
    The Crash Of The Storm</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>He wore his working blouse and a cap upon his head. In addition to the safety
    lanthorn he carried a bundle tied up in a handkerchief.</p>
  <p>He hailed Leroux as soon as he came near.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So now, my man,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis time you
    went.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux did not move. He stood with legs wide apart, his hands buried in
    the pockets of his breeches. The light from the clock-tower above lit up
    the top of his shaggy head, his wide shoulders and the tip of his nose. De
    Maurel had approached, quite unconscious apparently of the glowering looks
    which Leroux cast upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had best get to the compound,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;before
    the rain comes down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And quite unconcernedly he walked past Leroux and continued to advance toward
    the Lodge. The man watched him from over his shoulder, and when de Maurel
    had reached the steps of the Lodge, he said sullenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>De Maurel calmly shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the use of all that obstinacy?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
    argued everything out this afternoon. You had best go quietly now, my man
    ... or there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo;  riposted Leroux with a sneer. &ldquo;I doubt not
    but that there will be trouble this night, M. le Mar&eacute;chal....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>His first instinctive terror at sight of the man whom he feared above all
    others was gradually falling away from him. He had turned on his heel and
    was now facing the open window of the Lodge, through which he could feel,
    even if he could not see, his mates, who were there ready to stand by him,
    if necessary, if it came to an open conflict between himself and the employer
    whom he was pledged to betray. The sense of their presence close by gave
    him a measure of defiance and of courage.</p>
  <p>De Maurel stood quite still for a moment or two, then he retraced his steps
    and came back to within a m&egrave;tre or so of where the man was standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are contemplating mischief, Leroux,&rdquo; he said with his accustomed
    calm. &ldquo;Someone has been egging you on to one of your attacks of futile
    rebellion, which you must know by now, invariably lead to more severe measures
    being taken against you. You know how lenient I can be, but also how severe.
    This night&rsquo;s work can only end in disaster for you ... the gallows
    probably, unless you realize that submission even at this eleventh hour will
    be your best policy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well spoken, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; retorted Leroux,
    with a sneer; &ldquo;but let me tell you that the hour has gone by when your
    arrogance and your threats had the power to cow me. To-day I am a desperate
    man, and desperate men are not apt to count the costs of their actions. I
    will not vacate the Lodge to-night, and unless....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and shrugged his shoulders. De Maurel had thrown down his bundle
    and transferred the lanthorn to his left hand, whilst with his right he drew
    a pistol from beneath his blouse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put away that weapon, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; said Leroux, &ldquo;it
    will avail you nothing. There are twenty of us inside the Lodge, all well
    armed. Twenty others overpowered your night-watchmen half an hour ago. We
    are expecting a fresh contingent of our mates from the compound at any moment.
    Resistance or bluster on your part were, indeed, worse than futile. You have
    run your head into a noose this time, my fine gentleman, and your threats
    are about as useful as the pistol which you have in your hand. And if it
    comes to that,&rdquo; he added with a savage oath, &ldquo;I, too, of late
    have learned how to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a rapid movement he drew a pistol from his belt; but before he had
    time to level it, de Maurel had fired. The man uttered a convulsive cry of
    rage; his left hand grabbed at his shoulder, while his weapon fell with a
    clatter to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have shot me, you devil!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;<i>A
      moi</i>, my mates!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The pistol shot and Leroux&rsquo; raucous cry had drowned a woman&rsquo;s
    call&mdash;a call of warning and of agonized terror: &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; but
    not before de Maurel&rsquo;s keen ear had perceived it, and even while an
    evil-looking rabble came pouring out from the Lodge the call was repeated,
    and the next moment a woman&rsquo;s slender form was interposed between him
    and the foremost group among the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, save yourself,&rdquo; came in a frenzied murmur
    in his ear, and a pair of hands clung to his arm with the strength of unspoken
    anguish. &ldquo;Into the shadow ... quick ... they&rsquo;ll not touch me
    ... only save yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice, the touch, sent a tumultuous flood of passion seething through
    de Maurel&rsquo;s veins. Overhead the thunder crashed and a vivid streak
    of lightning showed him a brutish, menacing gang of miscreants advancing
    towards him, their faces misshapen and distorted with the fulsomeness of
    their own savagery and malignant anticipation of triumph. There was a score
    or so of them, and the light from the clock-tower glinted on the steel of
    muskets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>A moi</i>, my mates!&rdquo; shouted Leroux once again at the top
    of his voice, and in response there came from left and right the sound of
    tramping of many feet; and within a few seconds the open space in front of
    the great storehouse was filled with a moving, oscillating crowd, the numbers
    of which could only be vaguely guessed at in the gloom. The light from above
    caught the outline here of a face, there of a square shoulder, always of
    a musket, a pistol, or even a knife held tightly in a rough, grimy hand.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Instinctively de Maurel had stepped back into the shadow. Perfect calm had
    immediately followed that sudden hot wave of passion which had filled his
    heart and brain at the moment that he became conscious of Fernande&rsquo;s
    presence so close to him.</p>
  <p>He had but a few seconds wherein to act, wherein to disengage himself with
    almost savage violence from her dear clinging arms, and to force her into
    the shadow behind him. A few seconds wherein to whisper to her in desperate
    tones of appeal and of command: &ldquo;While I parley with them, run to the
    gate ... they&rsquo;ll not see you.... Fernande, in the name of God, go!...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He placed himself in front of her, his back to the storehouse; he had her
    life and his own to guard or to sell as dearly as he could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, Fernande,&rdquo; he commanded once again. He would have picked
    her up in his arms and run with her into safety had he dared. But the brutes
    were armed with muskets, and a stray shot meant for him might easily have
    reached her. He covered her with his body, praying with all his might that
    she might obey and seek safety while there was yet time, yet knowing all
    the while, with an intuitive conviction born of his own tumultuous passion,
    that she was resolved to remain by his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, Fernande,&rdquo; he implored.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go,&rdquo; she replied quietly; and he, feeling her
    so near him, hearing her voice quivering with emotion, with anguish for him,
    counted life well lost for these few rapturous seconds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I do anything?&rdquo; she asked with perfect calm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  he replied. &ldquo;There are at least a hundred
    against us, and the alarm bell is above the Lodge, the chain-handle just
    by the door.... Those cowardly brutes have cut us off from any chance of
    help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Indeed, the crowd was pressing closer round him now; wherever he looked
    he could see faces on which the lamp from above cast a lurid glow&mdash;faces
    rendered grotesque by the flickering light and the dense shadows which hid
    eyes and mouth and accentuated nose and chin&mdash;faces in which menace
    and hatred had been fanned into open revolt by bribery and greed, and execration
    of all discipline and authority. De Maurel knew them all individually. Even
    through the gloom he could distinguish the ringleaders&mdash;the malcontents
    with whom last year he had had many a tussle&mdash;whom the more iron rule
    of the military representatives had goaded into this senseless and abominable
    treachery.</p>
  <p>De Maurel&rsquo;s quick eye had soon enough measured the odds that were
    against him; of a truth, they were overwhelming. Nothing but a miracle could
    save him if these men did, indeed, contemplate murder, of which he had little
    doubt. The great question was how to save Fernande&mdash;his brave, beautiful,
    exquisite Fernande, who was standing so magnificently by him, whose heroism
    and courage filled him with as much wonder as her beauty and tenderness had
    filled his heart with love. Forgotten were the humiliation and the bitterness
    of a twelve-month ago; forgotten was her cruelty, the hurt she had done to
    him; she was standing by him now&mdash;shoulder to shoulder&mdash;his friend
    in this hour of difficulty, his comrade at the moment of peril.</p>
  <p>Oh! if he only had the strength, the wits to keep those maddened wolves
    at bay, the whole world would not wrench the memory of this blissful night
    from out his heart again.</p>
  <p>But there was no time even to think of happiness or of the future; the present
    lay there before him, grim and hand in hand with death. The few seconds&rsquo; respite
    while he stood facing the murderous crowd&mdash;eye to eye and silently&mdash;were
    already gone; the men were gathering more menacingly around him. What their
    ultimate purpose was he had as yet only vaguely guessed. On this, before
    everything, he wanted to be quite clear&mdash;definite knowledge on the point
    would then help him how to act.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, my men, is it?&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Open
    mutiny, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may call it that, an it please you,&rdquo; said one of the men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hatched during my absence&mdash;ready against my home-coming ere
    I had time to realize the treachery that was brewing. I ought to have guessed,
    I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leroux, with a wound in his shoulder that was bleeding profusely, was in
    the forefront of the pack, supported on either side by one of his mates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he said huskily, &ldquo;you might have guessed that
    men would not put up indefinitely with tyranny and oppression. We are not
    dogs, nor yet savage brutes to be kept to our task with threats of punishment.
    Those men who were here, who went two days ago&mdash;curse them!&mdash;were
    ready to use the lash on us had they dared!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you dared not rebel while they were here! Were you frightened
    of the lash?&rdquo;  retorted de Maurel contemptuously. &ldquo;You waited
    for my return. Did you think I should be a weaker fool than they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were not ready then. We are ready now,&rdquo; came from one of
    the men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ready for what?&rdquo; queried de Maurel. &ldquo;What do you hope
    to gain by this senseless mutiny? To overpower the watchmen for one night
    and run riot through the factories? To-morrow must bring reprisals. Ye know
    that well enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow you&rsquo;ll no longer be here, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; sneered
    Leroux, who, though losing blood freely, had still sufficient strength left
    to maintain his position as ringleader of the gang. &ldquo;To-morrow you&rsquo;ll
    not be here,&rdquo; he reiterated roughly, &ldquo;to browbeat and threaten
    us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean to kill me, I know,&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel coolly. &ldquo;But
    my death will avail you little. Reprisals will be all the more severe. Think
    you the law will let you escape? I am not a man who can be assassinated and
    then thrown into a ditch without causing some stir. Where will you hide when
    your Emperor himself will demand from you an account of what you have done
    with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! when we have done with you, my fine Marshal of France,&rdquo; replied
    Leroux, with an insolent laugh, &ldquo;there will be no Emperor. We are working
    for the King&mdash;not for Bonaparte ... and when we hold the factories and
    foundries in the name of the King ... why, there&rsquo;s little we&rsquo;ll
    have to fear from the Emperor; and, moreover....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A terrific clash of thunder drowned the rest of his words, while the lightning
    literally tore the dark clouds asunder. Some of the men&mdash;more superstitious
    than the rest&mdash;instinctively crouched back, muttering blasphemies&mdash;pushing
    those behind them back, too, so that the entire human mass seemed suddenly
    to be heaving and then receding like the scum of sea-waves upon the ebbing
    tide; a gust of wind swept across the quadrangle, driving dust and dried
    leaves before it. Some of the men cursed, others hastily crossed themselves,
    with a vague remembrance of past devotions long buried beneath the dark mantle
    of crime.</p>
  <p>The silence which ensued was absolute. It lasted less than ten seconds,
    perhaps, during which hardly a man dared to breathe&mdash;so absolute was
    it, that the click of every firearm striking against its neighbour was distinctly
    audible, as was the soughing of the wind in the silver birches on the wooded
    heights behind the factory. Something of a nameless terror had crept into
    the bones of these godless miscreants. By that vivid flash of lightning they
    had seen their master standing alone unflinching before them&mdash;against
    the background of the huge storehouse&mdash;his massive figure appearing
    preternaturally tall, his face pale and determined. His head was bare to
    the winds and the storm, and it was turned full upon them, and neither in
    the dark, deep-set eyes nor round the firm mouth was there the slightest
    sign of fear. And they had caught sight of the slim silhouette of Fernande
    de Courson standing behind him, her graceful form seeming ethereal, like
    that of a protecting angel.</p>
  <p>And for the space of those ten seconds de Maurel had just time to look on
    the situation squarely and with a clearer understanding than before. With
    his clumsy words, Leroux had in an instant revealed to him something of the
    dark treachery which had brought this mutinous crowd together&mdash;something
    of the murky undercurrent of intrigue which was driving the torrent of discontent
    to the flood of open rebellion. So this was the history of Leroux&rsquo; defiance?
    this was the key to the riddle which had puzzled de Maurel when first he
    realized that these senseless brutes were actually not only in organized
    rebellion against him, but intent on murder&mdash;a stupid, purposeless and
    useless murder, which in itself would carry immediate discovery in its train,
    and with it the absolute certainty of terrible reprisals and penalties.</p>
  <p>But now the whole thing became clear. It was his mother and her party who
    had engineered this trickery, and Heaven alone knew how near they were to
    succeed in the abominable project!</p>
  <p>And in a flash he seemed to see every phase of the intrigue: his factories
    and foundries in the hands of these dastards, whilst the Royalist bands marched
    on La Frontenay. There were other details, of course&mdash;plots and counterplots&mdash;at
    which it was impossible to guess. Only the facts remained&mdash;the facts
    which confronted him now, together with this murderous pack of hungry wolves
    and the muskets which were levelled against him.</p>
  <p>For his own life he cared less than nothing; many a time had he faced Prussian
    muskets as he faced those of a set of mutinous ruffians now. A few minutes
    ago he had felt one thrill of exultant happiness when Fernande&rsquo;s arms
    clung around his shoulders, and her sweet body lay against his breast in
    her endeavour to shield him against his aggressors. He was more than content
    that that one supreme moment of delight should be the last which this world
    held for him&mdash;more than content to go to his eternal sleep with the
    sweet memory of her last caress to be his lullaby.</p>
  <p>But his life had suddenly assumed an importance which he himself never granted
    it before. He alone, at this moment stood for the protection of these mighty
    engines of warfare around him, of the materials which his Emperor needed
    for overcoming the enemies of France. The very instant that he&mdash;Ronnay
    de Maurel&mdash;fell, they would become the prey of traitors, the prey of
    those who concerted with the foreigner against their country, who trafficked
    with Prussia, with Austria, with Russia, in order to force upon the people
    of France a government and a King whom they abhorred. At this very hour,
    perhaps, a band of Royalists was on its way to La Frontenay. It was all so
    simple&mdash;so absolutely, so perfectly, so hellishly simple! If he fell,
    they would reach the factories and the foundries, and these murderous traitors
    here would deliver his patrimony into their hands&mdash;the patrimony which
    he devoted to the service of France&mdash;the new guns, the small-arms, the
    explosives, the stores ... everything. If anon he lay with shattered head
    or breast on the threshold of this precious storehouse, which he had been
    powerless to protect, the cause of freedom, of the Emperor and of his armies,
    would receive a blow from which it could only recover after years more of
    fratricidal combat and more streams yet of bloodshed.</p>
  <p>This he owed to his mother, to his brother, to his kindred, who had fanned
    the flame of hatred and rebellion against him, whose hands were raised against
    their country, whom they professed to love, and who had coolly and callously
    decreed his death because he stood in their way. With the very wealth which
    he had placed at his mother&rsquo;s disposal, she had paid these brutes to
    betray and to murder him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And Fernande?</p>
  <p>At Leroux&rsquo; words he had felt her quivering behind him; he had heard
    the moan which escaped from her lips. Fernande knew of the treachery as she
    had known of his danger, and, knowing of his deadly peril, she had come here
    in order to share it with him. That thought, as it flashed before him, lent
    de Maurel&rsquo;s entire soul a courage and an exultation which was almost
    superhuman. As the thunder clashed above him, and the lightning tore the
    dark clouds asunder, it seemed to him as if God Himself, in His glory, had
    deigned to reveal Himself, to give him the strength and the power that he
    needed, the guidance which comes as a divine breath from Heaven in the supreme
    hour of a man&rsquo;s life, when Death and Duty and Love stand at the parting
    of the ways and beckon with unseen hands.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The silence that ensued had only lasted a moment. Already the men were recovering
    from their brief access of terror; some of them were shaking themselves like
    curs after a douche. They all drew nearer to one another, satisfied to feel
    one another&rsquo;s support and grasping their muskets more determinedly
    in their hands.</p>
  <p>De Maurel had turned once more to Fernande.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means death, my beloved,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she replied quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Questions and answers came in rapid succession. His hand closed upon hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In my heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I kiss your exquisite hands,
    your feet, your hair, your lips. You forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was not a quiver in her voice; for one second her fingers rested in
    his, and they were firm and warm to his touch. They were made to understand
    one another, these two; their courage was equally undaunted; they both looked
    on death without a tremor. He would have given his life bit by bit for her,
    but at this hour, when the needs of France demanded a sacrifice so sublime
    that none but an heroic heart could have conceived it, not even the thought
    of his beloved came between him and his determination.</p>
  <p>La Frontenay must be saved for the Emperor and for France at all costs&mdash;even
    at the cost of that one life which was more precious to him than his own,
    more precious than all the world, save France. And with one pressure of her
    slender hand she yielded up her will&mdash;her life to him. For this one
    supreme moment&mdash;a moment which held in it an infinity of love and passion&mdash;they
    met one another soul to soul. Hand in hand, in the face of death, this second
    was for them an eternity of ecstasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You love me, Fernande!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until death,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then pray to God, dear heart,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He alone
    can save us now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he faced the crowd of cut-throats once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, my men,&rdquo; he said, speaking coolly and quietly. &ldquo;For
    the last time let me tell you how you stand. As far as I can see, there are
    about fivescore of you standing there before me, and you think that you hold
    my life in the hollow of your hands. And so you do, in a measure. Your muskets
    are levelled against me, and even if I were to sell my life very dearly and
    blow out the brains of a few amongst you, you would have small work to lay
    me low in the end. You have been lured to this treachery by promises, and
    bribery; you have listened to insidious suggestions of treason. But let me
    tell you this. Others before you have listened to promises which came from
    that same quarter, and their bones lie mouldering now in forgotten graves.
    You think that if you delivered these works into the hands of M. de Puisaye
    and his followers you would be rendering such a service to the Royalist cause,
    that that effete and obese creature who dares to call himself King of France
    will inevitably come to the throne which his forbears have forfeited, and
    that he will reward you handsomely for any service you may have rendered
    him. But, believe me, that even if this night a few bands of rebellious peasants
    took possession of La Frontenay and its works, their triumph and yours would
    be short-lived. No one in France at this hour wants a Bourbon king; the army
    worships the Emperor, the people adore him, and with the army and the people
    against you, what do you think that you can do? La Frontenay is not the only
    armament factory in France; think you that you will cripple the Emperor because
    you deliver our stores into the hands of his enemies? Take care, men, take
    care,&rdquo; he added more earnestly; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis you who have run
    your heads into a noose, and with every outrage which you commit this night
    that noose will become tighter round your necks, and you&rsquo;ll find that
    I&mdash;your master&mdash;will be more menacing and more fearsome to you
    dead&mdash;murdered foully by you&mdash;than ever I was in life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His powerful, rugged voice rose above the murmur of the storm. Some of the
    men listened to him in sullen silence; the magnetic influence which &ldquo;the
    General&rdquo;  had exercised over them in the past was not altogether gone;
    his powerful personality, his cool courage, the simplicity of his words,
    reacted upon their evil natures, and also upon their cowardice. There was
    a vast deal of common sense in what M. le Mar&eacute;chal was saying, and
    they, after all, had only been promised a hundred francs apiece for an exceedingly
    risky piece of work. But there were some ringleaders among them who expected
    to get far more out of their treachery than a paltry hundred francs; they
    relied on de Puisaye&rsquo;s vague promises of freedom, on his assurance
    that unconditional pardon for past infractions against the law would be granted
    to them by a grateful King. They&mdash;and, above all, Leroux&mdash;felt
    also that they were committed too far now to dare to draw back, and even
    while de Maurel spoke they broke in on his words with sneers and taunts,
    and, above all, with threats.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to think, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; said Leroux in husky
    tones&mdash;for he was getting feeble with loss of blood&mdash;&ldquo;you
    seem to think that I and my mates are here to murder you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why else are you here?&rdquo; rejoined de Maurel coolly. &ldquo;You
    do not suppose, I imagine, that I am like to vacate the place and leave you
    to work your evil will with my property?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twere the wisest thing to do,&rdquo; retorted one of the men. &ldquo;Eh,
    mates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; came with a volley of savage oaths from every side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; added a voice
    from the crowd, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll see that neither you nor your sweetheart
    come to any harm!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, you blackguard,&rdquo; thundered de Maurel fiercely, &ldquo;or,
    by God, I&rsquo;ll pick you out of the crowd and shoot you like the dog that
    you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; broke in Leroux
    roughly; &ldquo;the men have no quarrel with you. But cease to defy and threaten
    them, or by Satan there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The trouble will come, my men, if you persist in this insensate mutiny.
    Throw down your muskets now at once, and go back to your compounds while
    there&rsquo;s yet time, and before the consequences of your own folly descend
    upon your heads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shout of derision greeted these words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The consequences of your folly will descend on your head, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; sneered
    Leroux. &ldquo;Get out of our way. We have parleyed enough. Eh, my mates?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! enough talk,&rdquo; some of them cried, whilst others added
    fiercely: &ldquo;Put a bullet through him and silence his accursed tongue
    at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pierre Deprez, I know you,&rdquo; said de Maurel loudly. &ldquo;Now
    then, all of you, for the last time&mdash;throw down your muskets&mdash;hands
    up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There came another shout of derision, wilder than the first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark at him!&rdquo; cried Paul Leroux scornfully. &ldquo;Even now
    he thinks that he can order us about&mdash;just as if we were a lot of craven
    curs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a lot of craven curs! And since you choose to be deaf to
    the voice of persuasion you shall listen to that of power. Down with your
    muskets! Hands up!... &rsquo;Tis the second time I&rsquo;ve spoken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may speak an hundred times, we&rsquo;ll not obey,&rdquo; retorted
    one of the men. &ldquo;The days of obedience are past; the place is ours....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the third and last time ...&rdquo; began de Maurel.</p>
  <p>Before the word was out of his mouth a shot was fired at him out of the
    crowd. The sound appeared as the signal for the breaking down of the last
    barrier which held these men&rsquo;s murderous passions in check.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis our turn to command,&rdquo; shouted Leroux excitedly. &ldquo;Throw
    up your hands, M. le Mar&eacute;chal, or....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down with the muskets!&rdquo; cried de Maurel in thunderous accents,
    that reached to the furthermost ends of the vast quadrangle, &ldquo;or by
    the living God whom you have outraged, I&rsquo;ll bury myself and you and
    your dastardly crime in one common grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a movement as rapid as that of the lightning above he swung the safety
    lanthorn against the wall behind him, and the protecting glass flew shattered
    in every direction, leaving a light naked and flaring, on which the storm
    immediately seized and tossed about in every direction. Above him towered
    the huge edifice which contained fifty thousand barrels of explosives. Immediately
    on his right was a narrow entrance into the building, to which a couple of
    stone steps gave access. In the space of a second he had run up those steps,
    his shoulder was against the door. The flame danced around him and lit up
    his stern face, which was set in a grim resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If one shout is uttered,&rdquo; he continued in a sonorous and resounding
    voice, &ldquo;if another shot is fired, if one of you but dares to move,
    I break open this door, and within ten seconds, long before any man can find
    safety in flight, the first barrel of gunpowder will be aflame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Overhead the thunder crashed&mdash;the storm raged in all its fury, and
    in the great quadrangle there was a sudden silence as in the city of the
    dead. Fivescore men were held paralysed with the horror of what they saw,
    spellbound by the might and power of a man who knew not fear; inert by the
    near sight of a hideous death. And while the crowd stood there, meek and
    obedient, quivering with terror like a pack of wild beasts under the lash
    of the tamer, he added with withering scorn:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you thought that you could filch from me that which I hold in
    trust for the Empire of France! You fools! You wretched, slinking, cowardly
    fools!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, M. le Mar&eacute;chal!&rdquo; came in an awed
    whisper from one or two men in the forefront of the crowd&mdash;&ldquo;in
    God&rsquo;s name throw away that light!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not until you have thrown down your muskets!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A hundred muskets fell with a dull clatter to the ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The light, M. le Mar&eacute;chal! the light...!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now one of you ring the alarm bell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The light...!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  he called aloud, so that the night air rang with
    his sonorous voice. &ldquo;The alarm bell, I said. Pierre Deprez&mdash;you!
    The others stand at attention. Hands up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One man slunk away from the rest, and, shrinking, walked slowly in the direction
    of the Lodge.</p>
  <p>The naked light of the lanthorn flickered in the storm; every moment it
    seemed as if it must catch the edge of de Maurel&rsquo;s blouse or the woodwork
    round the door. One hundred pairs of eyes were fixed in frenzied terror upon
    him, yet so potent was the feeling of horror which held the men in thrall,
    that not one of them dared to move if only to stretch out his hand toward
    that light which threatened them all with such an appalling death.</p>
  <p>A moment or so later the first clang of the alarm bell reverberated through
    the manifold sounds of the storm. It was followed almost immediately by the
    multisonous hooting of sirens in the distance and the peal of the alarm bell
    from the foundry half a kilom&egrave;tre away.</p>
  <p>And as the measured sounds of the bells and the sirens swelled to one majestic
    resonance, drowning now the roll of thunder and the soughing of the stormy
    blast, it seemed&mdash;for the space of one supreme second&mdash;that the
    men would repent them of their terror; for one second it seemed as if they
    would gather up their weapons again, and, throwing all prudence to the winds,
    rush and overcome that man who&mdash;single-handed&mdash;held them so completely
    in his power.</p>
  <p>De Maurel, standing beside the door a step or two above them, saw the first
    sign of this reaction&mdash;the unmistakable oscillation of a crowd when
    it is moved by one common impulse. He felt the one weak spot in his armour&mdash;the
    possibility of his being struck even now by a chance musket-shot, so that
    not even with a dying gesture could he accomplish that which he was so grimly
    resolved to do. And without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, even as like a
    wave the crowd swayed towards him, he lifted one corner of his linen blouse
    and held it to the flame; another second and the woodwork would most inevitably
    be ablaze.</p>
  <p>A cry of horror rose from a hundred lips; the crowd swayed back&mdash;the
    supreme second had gone by; and coolly, with his free hand, de Maurel extinguished
    the flame on his blouse. Then he threw back his head and a loud laugh broke
    from his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  &rsquo;tis to such cowards,&rdquo; he said loudly, &ldquo;that
    French men and women would entrust the destinies of France!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Five minutes later the quadrangle was seething with men. Mathurin had been
    the first to reach the precincts of the factory with the armed watchmen from
    the foundries; he was the first to recognize his master still standing with
    his back against the wall of the powder-magazine, holding a naked, wind-tossed
    light in his hand. There was no time for puzzlement or surprise; something
    of what had actually happened rose as a swift yet vivid picture before the
    loyal overseer&rsquo;s mind. The crowd of mutineers was not difficult to
    overpower&mdash;surrounded by the watchmen, they gave in without a struggle.
    They were still dazed with the fright which they had had and made no attempt
    at resistance. At any rate, until they were well in hand, de Maurel did not
    move from his post. But he had put down the lanthorn and stamped out the
    light with his heel; after that, he stood quite still, only giving a few
    directions now and again in his resonant voice to Mathurin and his capable
    coadjutors. The watchmen of the factory, who had been surprised, overpowered
    and imprisoned in the Lodge before de Maurel&rsquo;s advent on the scene,
    were soon released, and their numbers added materially to the easiness of
    the task.</p>
  <p>Soon the mutineers, in orderly array, were mustered up in the quadrangle
    preparatory to being marched back to their compound. Order reigned once more
    within the vast precincts of the factory. The excitement of a while ago,
    the shouts, the threats, the tumultuous cries of rage, of hatred and of fear,
    had given place to quick words of command, to brisk comings and goings, to
    measured tramps of feet and methodical click of arms. Overhead the thunder
    still rolled at intervals, and now and again the sky was rent by a flash
    of lightning; but the brunt of the storm had spent itself in the two terrific
    crashes which had proved de Maurel&rsquo;s most faithful allies in arousing
    the superstitious terror of those ignorant dastards. A warm, soft rain began
    to fall, further damping the ardour of the gang of rebels, as they filed
    past with hunched-up shoulders and shuffling footsteps&mdash;like whipped
    curs that feared more severe punishment yet to come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter &nbsp;22<br>
    Heaven And Earth</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Then at last de Maurel was able to turn to Fernande.</p>
  <p>He came down the steps of the storehouse, and his eyes, so long dazed by
    the flicker of the naked light, searched for her in the gloom.</p>
  <p>She had not moved from the spot which he had originally assigned to her,
    and he found her there, leaning against the wall, within the shelter of the
    recess formed by the framework and the steps of the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I can carry you home, my beloved,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
  <p>After the nerve-rending emotion of a while ago, Fernande felt a sudden slackening
    of all her muscles, a numbness which invaded heart and brain. While de Maurel
    had stood facing the murderous crowd, with her life and his and that of all
    these men in his hand, while he was there resolved to annihilate his entire
    patrimony rather than to surrender it to the enemies of his Emperor, she
    had felt only conscious of one desperate longing, which was to be held tightly
    in his arms and to meet death with her lips touching his.</p>
  <p>That she loved him with her whole heart, with every fibre of her body, and
    all the fervour of her soul, she had known since that day in the woods, when
    he had almost wrenched an admission of her love from her, and only Laurent&rsquo;s
    intervention had frozen the avowal on her lips. When&mdash;silent and cold&mdash;she
    had then been forced to part from him, she had done so believing that he
    would never forgive her for the shame which she had put on him, and that
    his love for her, tumultuous and passionate as was his whole nature, had
    quickly enough turned to hate. During the year that ensued, when she felt
    that never in life perhaps would she ever see him again, she had realized
    that, unknowing, she had loved him from the hour when first he lifted her
    in his strong arms and carried her through the woods, the while the birds
    twittered overhead, and she could watch his face and the play of emotion
    and of passion in his deep-set eyes through the cool veil of a sheaf of bluebells.
    She had loved him then, even though in the weeks that followed she often
    thought that she hated him; by the time that true knowledge came to her it
    was too late.</p>
  <p>Since then the irrevocable had happened: she had become Laurent de Mortain&rsquo;s
    promised wife, and a gulf now lay between her and the man whom she loved,
    which nothing but death could have helped them to bridge over. In the hour
    of that deadly peril, the unspoken word of a year ago had come to her lips;
    it had come, now as then, in response to his own compelling will, to that
    triumphant possession of her which already a year ago had nearly thrown her
    in his arms. &ldquo;You love me, Fernande?&rdquo; he had asked, and, face
    to face with the actuality which she had thought lay buried deep down in
    her heart, she could not deny its truth without perjuring her soul. And when
    he whispered in her ear: &ldquo;It means death, my beloved!&rdquo; she had
    been ready to throw herself in his arms, to ask for that one last kiss which
    would have made death both welcome and sweet. She felt then as if she were
    being lifted up on a huge wave of light to a glorious empyrean above, where
    her body fell away from her, and soul and spirit swooned in the enchantment
    of a divine ecstasy. She felt then that she was no longer mortal, that she
    had reached a state which was akin to that of the angels. She felt that sublime
    rapture which alone makes of Man a true child of God.</p>
  <p>But now the danger was past; the tumultuous excitement of a while ago, the
    wild ecstasy of love in the face of death, had yielded to the sober reality
    of everyday life. It seemed almost as if, when de Maurel finally stamped
    out with his heel the naked light which threatened annihilation, he had,
    at the same time, extinguished the flame of passion which was searing Fernande&rsquo;s
    soul. With the last dying flicker of that light, exultation which had carried
    her to the giddy heights of bliss folded its wings, and she came down to
    earth once more. It had been a steep and vertiginous descent, and she felt
    sore, bruised and dazed, groping blindly for the light which had so suddenly
    gone out of her life and left her lonely and cold. The mystic veil wherewith
    love had enveloped her vision of reality in this past hour, was being slowly
    torn from before her eyes; and the world appeared before her, not as she
    had seen it a while ago, through the blinding light of an overmastering passion,
    but as it was now in its dull and grim positiveness.</p>
  <p>Gradually the thought of Laurent first, then of her father, then of de Puisaye,
    of her cause, and of her King, penetrated into her brain.</p>
  <p>Duty, honour, loyalty, began to whisper in her ear, and soon their voices
    succeeded in drowning the still insistent murmur of love.</p>
  <p>Laurent!</p>
  <p>All this while she had forgotten him; nay, not only him, but her father
    and her King, her kindred and her cause. While she allowed swift passion
    to course through her veins, while she yielded to the delight of Ronnay&rsquo;s
    voice, of his nearness, of the love-light which gleamed in his eyes, her
    father and Laurent were on the high road between Mortain and Domfront and
    Tinchebrai, still secure in the thought that the projected coup had been
    successful, and that de Puisaye was even now on his way to take possession
    of La Frontenay and its accumulated wealth of arms. She pictured them both&mdash;her
    father and her betrothed&mdash;weary and footsore, risking their lives without
    a murmur, in order to accomplish the task which their chiefs had assigned
    to them to do; she pictured them defeated in their purpose&mdash;the garrisons
    of Domfront and Mortain on the qui vive&mdash;de Puisaye surprised with his
    force ... the rebel army surrounded ... scattered ... annihilated ... her
    father and Laurent fugitives or dead!... whilst she stood here oblivious
    of all save of the man whom she loved.</p>
  <p>She dared not think of what would happen within the next few hours&mdash;she
    hardly dared to think of her father and of Laurent; but now that their loved
    image once more flitted across her mental vision, she endured the tortures
    of bitter self-abasement. God had manifested His will. He had stood by the
    brave man who, all alone and undaunted, had known how to defend his heritage
    and the cause of his Emperor and of France. And she&mdash;Fernande&mdash;seeing
    the pack of murdering wolves around him, had yielded to a moment of frenzied
    horror at a crime which was nigh to being committed before her eyes.</p>
  <p>In her heart she had betrayed her people when that moment of madness wrung
    an avowal of love from her lips. She had betrayed her kindred when she interposed
    herself between their sworn enemy and the murderer&rsquo;s bullet which would
    have laid him low. And she still betrayed them now when, instead of flying
    back to them on the wings of loyalty and of love, she lingered here, if only
    for a few brief minutes, savouring the bitter-sweet delights of the inevitable
    farewell.</p>
  <p>Was there ever blacker, more hideous treachery?</p>
  <p>The light from the lamp above showed her Ronnay quite clearly, his brown
    hair taken back from the low, square forehead, the firm jaw and sensitive
    mouth, the toil-worn hands and linen blouse whereon the charred corner still
    bore mute and eloquent testimony to the unflinching heart that beat beneath
    its folds. And, above all, it revealed to her those eyes of his of a deep
    violet-blue, wherein passion and tenderness had kindled an all-compelling
    flame, and she knew that duty, loyalty, honour, compelled her to fly while
    there was yet time, and as far away as she could, lest the magnetism of his
    love drew her back to his arms once more.</p>
  <p>Her place now was by the side of Laurent and of her father&mdash;in the
    midst of her friends at this hour, when black failure had dashed to naught
    all their dearest hopes. At La Frontenay, at Courson, at Mortain, there would
    be tears to quench and wounds to heal&mdash;God grant that a veil of mourning
    be not spread over all the land!&mdash;and she Fernande must be there to
    comfort and to soothe.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>All these thoughts and emotions coursed so swiftly through heart and brain
    that they left her dazed, bewildered, with limbs icy cold and teeth chattering,
    the while her head felt as if it were on fire. Reaction had set in; the excitement
    had been so intense, when death and passion fought for mastery over her entire
    soul, that the sudden relaxation of her nerves nearly caused an utter collapse
    of every one of her faculties.</p>
  <p>It required an almost superhuman effort to regain complete possession of
    herself, to collect her thoughts, to chase away the last shreds of the dream.
    It would require a greater effort still to wrench herself away from this
    spot where she felt that henceforward her heart would remain buried. For
    the moment it meant gaining power over her limbs, which seemed disinclined
    to render her service, and over her head wherein tumultuous thoughts still
    refused to be marshalled in orderly array it meant, in fact, waiting for
    an opportunity to slip away as soon as she could. She knew in which direction
    lay the postern gate, and she knew her way back to La Frontenay. If she only
    could reach the ch&acirc;teau within the next half-hour, some means might
    yet be found to acquaint de Puisaye of what had occurred. She wondered vaguely
    how much de Maurel knew at this hour of what was in preparation over by Mortain,
    or what he could do if he knew everything.</p>
  <p>The sight of the crowd still moving or standing, compact and busy, all round
    the storehouse maddened her. These men were impeding her way to the postern
    gate; they stood in the way of her getting to La Frontenay in time to send
    a runner over, even at this hour, to de Puisaye. It was nearly two hours
    since she left home&mdash;an eternity!&mdash;over half an hour since the
    first hooting of the sirens must have roused the countryside; and she still
    was so shaken, so numbed, so bruised, that she hadn&rsquo;t it in her to
    make a dash through the crowd, to push her way through all these men who
    would intercept her and would draw de Maurel&rsquo;s attention to her movements.</p>
  <p>If he captured her and brought her back, if he refused to let her go, would
    she have the physical strength to resist? Oh, for a moment&rsquo;s darkness,
    an instant of silence, which would cover her flight!</p>
  <p>Then at last the opportunity came. The groups around the storehouse gradually
    dispersed; the way lay clear as far as the angle of the building beyond which
    was darkness and solitude. Mathurin was engaging de Maurel&rsquo;s attention,
    and he&mdash;Ronnay&mdash;was standing half turned away from her. She gave
    one last look round her&mdash;one last look at the man whom she loved, and
    whom mayhap she would never in life see again, and in her heart she spoke
    a last, fond farewell. But as surely as a magnet draws to itself a piece
    of steel, so did this look of love from her compel and draw his gaze. Before
    she had time to move, he was down the steps and standing in front of her,
    so that he barred the way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I can carry you home, my beloved,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He put out his arms ready to take hold of her. The wild excitement of the
    past half-hour had left no impress upon his iron physique save in a certain
    pallor of the cheeks and a stiffening of the firm jaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would have given my life&rsquo;s blood, drop by drop,&rdquo; he
    said simply, &ldquo;to have spared you all that. You do believe me, Fernande,
    do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She could not reply. The instinct to fly, to run away, to close her ears
    to his voice, her eyes to his gaze, was so insistent, that she could have
    screamed with longing and a maddened feeling of impotence. By an impulsive
    gesture of self-protection she put up her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; she said, trying to speak coldly, indifferently,
    even though her voice sounded hoarse and choked, and she could not control
    the nervous chattering of her teeth and the trembling of her limbs. &ldquo;Yes,
    yes! of course I&rsquo;ll believe you, <i>mon cousin</i>!... You did what
    was right ... and I.... But now I entreat you to let me go home.... My aunt
    will be so anxious and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you are cold and overwrought,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;Curse
    those brutes,&rdquo; he added, with a sudden access of primitive savagery, &ldquo;curse
    them for the evil their treachery has wrought!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as he saw that she suddenly shrank away from him and drew her cloak
    closer round her, he chided himself for his roughness. &ldquo;I am a brute,&rdquo; he
    said gently,  &ldquo;and am for ever begging your forgiveness. My beloved,
    will you not trust yourself to me? You must be so tired ... and the rain
    is coming down. We could be at La Frontenay in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The events of the past fateful hour seemed to have faded from his ken. It
    seemed as if he had never stood there&mdash;a few paces away&mdash;that naked
    light in his hand, threatening destruction to a crowd of mutineers, destruction
    to himself, to his patrimony and to his beloved. He was just the same as
    he had always been&mdash;half clumsy, wholly compelling&mdash;whenever Fernande
    met him in the woods, and there was nothing between them save a still unavowed
    passion. She looked round her helplessly in vain search for a means of escape.
    She could not&mdash;dared not&mdash;speak for the moment. If she did, she
    knew that she must break down. She had gone through too much to have full
    power over her nerves; she felt unutterably weary, even though she knew that
    so much still lay before her, and though she was firmly resolved to play
    a loyal part to the end. In her heart she called out to him: &ldquo;Yes!
    take me in your arms, my beloved; let me nestle against your shoulder; care
    for me, comfort me! The world is too difficult for my weak hands to grapple
    with!&rdquo; And she had to close her eyes and to hold her lips tightly pressed
    together, or the heartrending cry would certainly have escaped them.</p>
  <p>How long she remained standing thus silent and with eyes closed, she did
    not know&mdash;a minute perhaps&mdash;perhaps a cycle of ages. During that
    time she fought for mastery over her nerves and over her senses, and in the
    fight she felt herself growing strange and old, with every emotion in her
    dead, and only the determination subsisting that he, too, must be made to
    remember that she was tokened to his brother, and that never, never while
    all three of them lived must the past hour be recalled again.</p>
  <p>And de Maurel, the while, remained beside her, waiting patiently.</p>
  <p>That was his way! Vehement as were his passions, tumultuous when they broke
    through the barrier of self-restraint, he had with it all the supreme virtue
    of infinite patience; in wrath, as in love, he always knew how to bide his
    time. Perhaps he guessed something of what went on behind those blue-veined
    lids on which he was aching to imprint a kiss. He could not see her face
    clearly, only just the delicate outline of her against the dark background
    of the wall, and occasionally a glint of gold when the light from above caught
    the loose tendrils of her hair.</p>
  <p>When at last her fight was won, and nerves and senses fell into line with
    her determination to be loyal to Laurent in the spirit as well as in the
    letter, she felt as if every emotion in her was dead&mdash;as if she never
    would again be able to laugh and make merry, to cry, to love, or to hate&mdash;as
    if she would henceforth be just a callous, heartless, unfeeling thing without
    even the capacity for sorrow.</p>
  <p>She looked at Ronnay and endured his glance without a tremor, and at last
    she was able to speak, knowing that there would be no quiver in her voice
    now to betray the agony of what she suffered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a truth, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she said, with an indifferent
    little laugh, &ldquo;it is passing kind of you to offer to be my beast of
    burden once again, but I assure you that I would not care to become quite
    so ludicrous a spectacle as you suggest before good old Mathurin and all
    your work-people. Believe me, I would far sooner go back to La Frontenay
    on my own feet. It would not be very dignified&mdash;would it?&mdash;for
    the future Marquise de Mortain to be carried along the road like a bundle
    of goods.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He said nothing for a moment or two, nor could she, by the dim light, read
    very clearly in his eyes whether her words had conveyed to him the full meaning
    which she intended, until he said quite simply: &ldquo;Ah! I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A curious ashen colour overspread his face like that of a man suffering
    great physical pain.</p>
  <p>And Fernande&mdash;poor Fernande!&mdash;with a forced laugh plunged the
    knife still more deeply into the gaping wound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgotten, <i>mon cousin</i>?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How could you
    have forgotten that I am your brother&rsquo;s promised wife? Did you not
    tender me your congratulations yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, of course; I understand,&rdquo; he murmured vaguely, and
    he passed his hand once or twice mechanically across his brow. Then suddenly,
    with that rough directness which was so characteristic of him, he added simply: &ldquo;But
    as long as life lasts, my beloved, I shall thank God on my knees for the
    one glimpse of Heaven which He gave me this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a great deal, <i>mon cousin</i>,&rdquo; she rejoined coldly
    and firmly, &ldquo;that both you and I must forget after this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he retorted. &ldquo;I, for one, shall have to forget
    that my mother and my brother armed the hands of assassins against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively she called out: &ldquo;It is false!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true, Fernande,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly, &ldquo;and you
    know it. Some of my men who have just arrived from Domfront say that the
    woods beyond Mortain are alive with rebels. That murderous dastard Leroux
    has already betrayed the various threads of de Puisaye&rsquo;s latest intrigues.
    In order to try and save his own skin, which he will not succeed in doing,&rdquo; he
    continued grimly, &ldquo;he has chosen to tell us all he knew&mdash;that
    my brother Laurent is on the high road at this hour with a gang of armed
    Chouans at his heels; so is M. de Courson. Another gang is on its way to
    these works in order to reap the fruits of Leroux&rsquo; treachery. But our
    alarm bells have set the garrison of Domfront afoot; couriers are on their
    way to warn the commandants of Mortain and Tinchebrai. This comes of bribing
    a coward to become a traitor,&rdquo; he concluded harshly; &ldquo;the disasters
    of this night will lie at the door of those who trafficked with assassins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Fernande no longer listened to him. Her dream had, indeed, vanished&mdash;vanished
    beyond recall, and she was back in the midst of all the calamity, the sorrow
    which would follow on the mistakes of this night. Indeed, the pitiless cowardice
    which had sent a brave man to face a band of murderers, alone and unwarned,
    had already received its awful punishment. Everything had been foreseen in
    de Puisaye&rsquo;s plans, everything had been thought out and arranged ...
    save this: that one man, single-handed, would cow and dominate a crowd of
    murderous rebels!</p>
  <p>Now there was nothing left but to stand shoulder to shoulder, and trust
    to God that the small armies under de Puisaye, de Courson and Laurent de
    Mortain, escaped with their lives. There was nothing left to do but to tend
    the wounded and bury the dead. Fernande&rsquo;s very soul ached now with
    the longing to be back at La Frontenay, and the magnitude of her desire gave
    her just the strength which she needed. Swift as a hare, she took advantage
    of a slight movement on his part and managed to slip by him out of her corner.
    And she had started to run towards the postern gate ere he succeeded in overtaking
    her at the angle of the storehouse and once more barring her way.</p>
  <p>This time he seized her in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Fernande?&rdquo; he cried peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo;  she retorted. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You cannot go alone. The roads are unsafe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not without me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go! My place is with those I love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a moment his arms dropped down to his side and she was free. But the
    violence with which he had seized hold of her had made her unsteady on her
    feet; she tottered back a little, and then had to stand still a moment while
    she recovered her balance. The spell of his arms round her was upon her still;
    the dream voices of a while ago called out to her from afar ... a last lingering
    farewell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Even so, an you will allow me,&rdquo; he said, after a moment or
    two, and his voice sounded cold and toneless; &ldquo;even so I would like
    to escort you home. The sirens will by now have alarmed half the country-side&mdash;a
    vast number of men will be on their way hither&mdash;there will be a crowd
    upon the road&mdash;some of the men may be rough. Those who ... those whom
    you love,&rdquo; he added with a harsh laugh, &ldquo;would not wish you to
    go to them alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he continued more gently, and his voice became full of tender yearning: &ldquo;Think
    you, my dear, that I do not understand? Why, there is nothing that you might
    think, or feel, or say, to which my heart would not immediately respond.
    You want to be at this time with those ... with those whom you love; that
    is only natural, and in accordance with your sweetness and your kind and
    loyal soul. Your heart now is at La Frontenay. Let me take you thither. I
    swear to you that I will not come nigh you, that I will not speak to you
    unless you grant me leave. So I entreat you let me come with you.... I would
    not else know a moment&rsquo;s peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;but indeed, indeed,
    there is no cause for anxiety. Wrapped in my cloak I shall be quite safe,
    and the passers-by will be too busy to think of molesting me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is my company, then, so distasteful to you, that you are so anxious
    to rid yourself of me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She felt her eyes filling with tears, but still she contrived to say firmly: &ldquo;It
    were best that I went alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; he rejoined coldly.</p>
  <p>He stood aside, and as she moved away from him, he called loudly: &ldquo;Mathurin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; came from a distant corner of
    the quadrangle, and hurrying footsteps drew quickly near in answer to the
    master&rsquo;s call. Fernande, the while, busied herself with her cloak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mathurin,&rdquo;  said de Maurel curtly, as soon as the overseer
    was in sight. &ldquo;Detail two of the men whom you can best trust&mdash;Henri
    Gresset and Michel Picart, if you can spare them&mdash;to escort Mademoiselle
    de Courson back to the ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, M. le Mar&eacute;chal,&rdquo; replied Mathurin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell them to await Mademoiselle at the postern gate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It shall be done, M. le Mar&eacute;chal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Mathurin saluted and turned on his heel. It was not his place to question
    or to show surprise. Even in the most remote cell of his brain there was
    not room for a rebellious or a disloyal thought. He had his orders and at
    once he set about to execute them, and a moment or two later his voice was
    heard calling to Gresset and to Picart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you at least allow me to walk with you as far as the gate?&rdquo; asked
    de Maurel, after the man had gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; she replied. Then, with sudden unconquerable
    impulse, she added in a tone of agonized entreaty:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father ... and Laurent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he said with an impatient sigh.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have influence,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;you can save them
    if you have the will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From the consequences of their own treachery?&rdquo; he retorted
    harshly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treachery?&rdquo;  she protested hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let us call it folly. If Leroux&rsquo; coup had succeeded the heritage
    which I hold in trust for France would have been wrenched from me with the
    help of assassins and of traitors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father ...&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my brother,&rdquo; he added grimly. &ldquo;Both caught probably
    this night in arms against their country&mdash;condemned to be shot as traitors....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As traitors,&rdquo; he reiterated firmly. &ldquo;A year ago the Emperor
    granted an unconditional pardon and amnesty to M. le Comte de Courson and
    to M. le Marquis de Mortain ... and every day since then these loyal gentlemen
    have worked and plotted to hurl him from his throne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father ...&rdquo; she pleaded once again. And she added under
    her breath: &ldquo;You said just now that you could understand ... everything.
    And M. de Courson is my father....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And M. de Mortain, your future husband,&rdquo; he broke in with a
    derisive laugh and a shrug of his broad shoulders. Then suddenly a swift
    wave of passion seemed to sweep right over him&mdash;a wave of rebellion
    against Fate, against his destiny, against all the misery, the sorrow, the
    endless desolation which that fact stood for. &ldquo;Ah, Fernande!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed hoarsely, &ldquo;how can you trust me so completely, yet give your
    love to another man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew in her breath with a little moan of pain. He had hurt her by these
    words more surely than she had ever hurt him, for she, on her side, had never
    thought to doubt his love. She believed in it more than ever before, now
    that she knew that this parting must be for always. But she felt that she
    had his answer&mdash;his promise to help her father and Laurent if he could.
    Almost she was ashamed to have appeared before him in the end as a suppliant,
    yet proud in her heart that she had gained so much in the cause which she
    had pleaded; proud in the fact that Love held him so completely in its thrall,
    that no base thought, no mean desire for vengeance, had a place beside it
    in his heart.</p>
  <p>Now there was nothing more to be said. The last word had been spoken between
    them, the last save the one which rose to their lips now ere they parted,
    but which must henceforth and for ever remain unsaid.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>She pulled the hood of her cloak over her head, and then turned to go the
    way she had come just half an hour ago. The clock-tower was just striking
    eleven. At different points of the vast quadrangle small patrols of watchmen
    could be perceived making their rounds, seeing that everything now was well
    and safe. The last of the mutineers had been marched out through the main
    gates, the tramp of heavy feet was even now dying away in the distance.</p>
  <p>The silence and quietude of a perfectly ordered organization was once more
    descending on Ronnay de Maurel&rsquo;s princely heritage, whilst in the heart
    of its owner there raged a tempest of sorrow and of longing which nothing
    on earth could ever still.</p>
  <p>But he walked silently by her side, and though she was aching to get home
    as quickly as may be, she went along slowly, because she could hear him dragging
    his wounded leg more painfully than he had been wont to do.</p>
  <p>It was a matter of two or three minutes only ere the postern gate, with
    its tiny light above, was in sight. Each side of it a man was standing at
    attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear cousin,&rdquo; she said, speaking as lightly as her
    aching heart would allow, &ldquo;and thank you. I shall, indeed, feel quite
    safe under the protection of those stalwarts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>She paused, and for a moment it seemed as if she would hold her hand out
    to him. They were some twenty paces still from the gate&mdash;alone and with
    the darkness hiding them from every view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande!&rdquo;  he called, in a voice which held a world of misery,
    of regret and of passion in its breaking tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must not tarry,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Laurent ... your brother
    ... will be anxious about me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with that she turned and ran quickly to the gate. The two men fell in
    behind her. Just for one brief second the tiny light from above glinted upon
    an aureole of gold. The hood had slipped down from her head, and she raised
    and slightly turned her face for one instant, just as she went through the
    gate.</p>
  <p>And thus he saw her fair profile outlined by the flickering light, the line
    of nose and lips and the exquisite curve of her throat. A few drops of moisture
    clung to the loose tendrils of her hair and glistened like tiny diamonds
    in a setting of living gold.</p>
  <p>Then she passed out of his sight into the darkness beyond.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter &nbsp;23<br>
    An Hour&rsquo;s Folly</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Madame la Marquise de Mortain had spent the evening shut up in her own room.
    At seven o&rsquo;clock, and then again at nine, Annette had brought her some
    food on a tray. She ate it mechanically, feeling neither hunger nor fatigue.
    She did not know that Fernande had gone out, nor did she inquire after her.
    Of a truth, all thought of the young girl, of her own household, of everything,
    in fact, save the momentous events which were to occur this night had faded
    from her mind. After the solemn warning which she had given Fernande she
    felt no anxiety as to what the latter might do. The girl was undoubtedly
    under the spell of an unexplainable infatuation; but Madame la Marquise,
    self-absorbed and as callous of anyone else&rsquo;s feelings as she was of
    her own, put it all down to childish exaltation and somewhat unhealthy romanticism;
    marriage with Laurent would, she was sure, soon effect a cure. In the meanwhile
    Fernande would certainly do nothing to jeopardize de Puisaye&rsquo;s plan
    of campaign, now that Madame had put it so clearly before her, that M. de
    Courson&rsquo;s own life would be seriously imperilled if Ronnay de Maurel
    got wind of what was in the air.</p>
  <p>Thus did Madame la Marquise dismiss from her mind all thoughts of her niece.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But she strove in vain to do likewise with those of her son. His face haunted
    her during those hours of lonely vigil in the privacy of her own room, while
    she waited for the first breath of news which would come wafted on the wings
    of the storm from the foundries to the Ch&acirc;teau of La Frontenay. She
    had steeled her heart against Ronnay&mdash;her eldest born&mdash;the son
    of the man whom she had hated beyond every other human creature on this earth.
    She had hated Ronnay during all the years that he was kept away from her;
    she had hated him when first she saw him again&mdash;a stranger to herself
    and to her kindred, an enemy to her caste. And when something indefinable
    in his character compelled her admiration and respect, she shut her ears
    to the call of Nature, to the insistent call of child to mother&mdash;that
    sweet, imperative call, which was all the more potent in this case as it
    had remained unspoken.</p>
  <p>Entirely against her will, she could not help but see herself&mdash;her
    own character&mdash;reflected in Ronnay far more truly than in Laurent; she
    saw in him her own unbendable will, her energy, her impatience of restraint:
    and, above all, she saw in him that same worship of a political ideal&mdash;even
    though the ideal differed from her own&mdash;and the same readiness to sacrifice
    everything at its shrine.</p>
  <p>And because there was so much in him that was akin to her own temperament,
    she continued to hate Ronnay de Maurel even though she no longer could despise
    him. To-night she was able to envisage coldly the possibility of his falling
    a victim to political schemes in which she had a hand. There was no compunction
    in her heart, no pity. In Ronnay she saw only the enemy of her cause, the
    traitor to his King. She felt like the incorruptible justiciary of old, who
    condemned his own son to the gallows when that son had offended against the
    laws of God; and if at times in the silence and loneliness which encompassed
    her while she watched and prayed, a feeling of softness or a pang of remorse
    knocked at the portals of her heart, she dismissed them resolutely, and soon
    both softness and remorse were consumed in the fire of her indomitable enthusiasm
    and energy.</p>
  <p>And the hours went by leaden-footed. Madame, in her mind, was able to trace
    every movement of the Royalist army on its march from Mortain to Tinchebrai,
    to Domfront, to Sourdeval, to La Frontenay; she reckoned the hours and counted
    the minutes, ere she could assume with any certainty that Laurent had reached
    Domfront, M. de Courson, Mortain, and that de Puisaye had arrived at the
    factories. By that time Leroux would have reckoned with de Maurel, if, indeed,
    the latter had put his threat into execution and attempted to interfere in
    the defence of his own property, at the very hour when the blow for the seizure
    of the factories would have to be struck. By midnight de Puisaye&rsquo;s
    men should be at La Frontenay and in undisputed possession of all the armament
    works; an hour later two contingents of them would be on their way to Domfront
    and back to Mortain, to relieve Laurent and M. de Courson and help them to
    complete the capture of the garrisons there.</p>
  <p>After ten o&rsquo;clock the lonely watcher began to strain every nerve in
    a wild endeavour to catch the first sound of distant firing, or see the first
    lurid glow that would illumine the sky. The storm then was at its height
    and vivid flashes of lightning, accompanied by terrific crashes of thunder,
    lit up for a second at intervals the park of La Frontenay and the heights
    far away in the distance, with the dusty main road winding its way like a
    pale-coloured riband through the woods and the villages scattered on the
    plain.</p>
  <p>Madame stood by the open window in her boudoir, and to her overwrought fancy
    it seemed that the whole landscape was peopled with the armies of the King;
    that from Domfront and Mortain, from the valleys and the hills, there poured
    down toward the factories a victorious horde of Royalists who already held
    half the country-side in their power. Her heart was filled with a great joy&mdash;she
    felt like intoning a triumphant hymn of praise.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>She could no longer stand still, but started pacing up and down the room
    like a caged panther. She had twisted her handkerchief into a tight, damp
    ball, and now and again she put it to her lips, else she would have screamed
    aloud in the agony of her suspense.</p>
  <p>She carried the lamp into her bedroom, which opened out of the boudoir,
    leaving the latter in complete darkness, so that she might see more clearly
    out of the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Puisaye should be nearing the factories by now,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and
    Laurent should be well on his way to Domfront at this hour. Oh, God!&rdquo; she
    added, in a fever of passionate excitement, &ldquo;for one brief moment of
    second sight!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Just then there came a knock at her bedroom door.</p>
  <p>Madame thought it might be Fernande, or else Annette bringing her more food
    which she did not want, and impatiently she called: &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door was thrown open; she could see it from where she stood, and she
    turned, thinking that it must be Annette. The next moment she gave a cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ran into the next room, her heart and mind suddenly assailed with a
    horrible foreboding. Laurent was standing on the threshold, pale, haggard,
    trembling visibly. His clothes were soiled, his boots muddy, his eyes looked
    dazed and feverish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent, in the name of God, what has happened?&rdquo; queried Denise
    de Mortain as calmly as she could, after she had dragged Laurent into the
    room and closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>He staggered to a chair and threw himself into it, in an obvious state of
    physical exhaustion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Fernande?&rdquo; were the first words which came to his
    lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande?&rdquo;  queried Madame with a frown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    know. In her room, I think. But never mind about Fernande now. Tell me, in
    God&rsquo;s name, why you are here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande is not in her room,&rdquo; he retorted savagely, and, wearied
    though he so obviously was, he jumped up from his chair and stood facing
    his mother with hands clenched, eyes glowing and cheeks aflame. &ldquo;Where
    is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Madame as firmly and unconcernedly
    as she could. &ldquo;She may be as impatient as I am and, unable to sit still,
    she may be wandering about somewhere in the house or round the gardens. I
    don&rsquo;t know, I tell you,&rdquo; she added fiercely. &ldquo;Laurent,
    I insist upon knowing what your presence here means at this hour, when I
    thought you on the way to Domfront.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She tried to force him to look her squarely in the eyes. There was something
    so awful, so paralysing in the terror which was invading her whole being,
    that she dared not yet face the thoughts which at sight of Laurent had rushed
    wildly through her brain. She wanted to force an explanation from him, for
    she felt now that anything he said must be simpler, more intelligible than
    the horrible surmises which froze the very blood in her veins. But Laurent
    would not meet her searching gaze. Instead of this, he threw himself back
    into the chair, and, burying his head in his hands, he burst into a passionate
    flood of weeping.</p>
  <p>He was weak, exhausted, footsore, his nerves were obviously strained to
    breaking point. Denise de Mortain&rsquo;s cold heart melted at the sight
    of his grief, but she made no movement to soothe him. The puzzled frown settled
    more deeply between her brows, and after a while, when Laurent&rsquo;s paroxysm
    had somewhat subsided, and he leaned his head in utter dejection and weariness
    against the back of the chair, she tapped her foot impatiently against the
    ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent,&rdquo;  she said more quietly after a while, &ldquo;you
    must tell me what all this means. You must try and collect yourself as quickly
    as you can and try to explain to me why you are here&mdash;and in this state&mdash;wildly
    calling for Fernande, when I, your mother, thought you at Domfront engaged
    in the execution of your duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s first duty, Mother,&rdquo; he retorted fiercely, &ldquo;is
    to watch over the treasure which God has placed in his hands. Something told
    me that a wolf was prowling round my fold, and I came to guard what was mine
    and to shoot the wolf ... if I could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He spoke more coherently now. The violent paroxysm of weeping had eased
    the tension on his nerves. The look in his eyes was more full of anger, but
    less wild, and though heavy sobs still shook his frame from time to time,
    and a hot, feverish flush glowed on his cheeks and on his forehead, he was,
    on the whole, more master of himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you explain more clearly what you mean?&rdquo; queried Madame
    la Marquise coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that ever since I parted from Fernande
    two days ago, torturing doubts have racked me till I thought my brain would
    burst. I have been on the threshold of frenzy, enduring torments of hell,
    the while de Puisaye and M. de Courson and all the others talked and man&oelig;uvred,
    and drilled and discussed plans, for the thousand thousandth time. Oh!&rdquo; he
    continued vehemently, &ldquo;I fought against my own thoughts, against my
    fears, against that lashing, flaying, maddening doubt. I fought against it
    till my head was in a whirl, and I began to marvel if, indeed, I was not
    insane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; exclaimed Madame, in deeper perplexity than before. &ldquo;In
    Heaven&rsquo;s name, why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you deny, Mother,&rdquo; he riposted hotly, &ldquo;that you,
    too, have felt doubts about Fernande?&mdash;that you, too, have watched the
    play of emotion on her face, the quiver of her mouth, the soft look in her
    eyes, the moment my brother Ronnay&rsquo;s name is mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you deny it?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>Then, as she remained silent and merely shrugged her shoulders with well-affected
    indifference, he continued with the same vehemence: &ldquo;Ah, you see, you
    cannot deny it! You cannot! You know that my doubts and fears are not the
    outcome of feverish hallucinations! Oh, my God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
    put his hand up to his throat as if he were choking, &ldquo;if only I could
    kill him with mine own hands....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deny nothing, Laurent,&rdquo; interposed Madame calmly,
    and her harsh, stern voice acted like an icy douche on the young man&rsquo;s
    fierce passion. &ldquo;I think that Fernande is foolish, childishly romantic.
    Something about de Maurel&rsquo;s personality has stirred her imagination.
    But there&rsquo;s nothing more in it than that, and....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why is she not here to-night?&rdquo; he broke in savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say that she is not here. But how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo;  he began, speaking slowly and measuredly, and Denise
    de Mortain had no cause to complain now that her son did not look her squarely
    in the face&mdash;&ldquo;because two hours ago I saw Fernande stealing out
    of the ch&acirc;teau, wrapped in a dark cloak and alone, and making her way
    across the park. I did not want her to see me, so I stole to the gates and
    there watched for her coming. I wished to know whither she was going and
    I was determined to follow her. I watched and I waited, marvelling why she
    tarried. She did not come, and then I realized what a fool I had been. Whilst
    I had been standing on guard outside the great gates, she had slipped out
    by the side door in the wall, and I did not know whither she had gone. I
    was ready to dash my head against the iron gates; and there I stood, stupid,
    semi-imbecile, marvelling what I should do. Suddenly a passer-by came along
    and I hailed him. I asked him if he had seen a lady on the high road walking
    unattended and closely wrapped in a dark cloak. He answered me yes, and pointed
    the way she went. I thanked him, and as soon as his back was turned I started
    to run in the wake, as I thought, of Fernande. Then I came to a cross-road,
    where there was a sign-post, one arm of which bore the legend: &lsquo;La
    Frontenay,&rsquo; and the other, &lsquo;La Vieuville.&rsquo; La Vieuville,
    where my brother dwells! I spelt out every letter. I saw that it was distant
    five kilom&egrave;tres. La Vieuville! Fernande had gone to La Vieuville to
    betray us all to Ronnay de Maurel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is false, I&rsquo;ll swear,&rdquo; exclaimed Madame, &ldquo;and
    you, Laurent, are mad to imagine anything so monstrous against the girl whom
    you profess to love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mad!&rdquo;  he riposted. &ldquo;Of course I am mad! Did I not tell
    you that I had become mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were you doing outside the gates of this ch&acirc;teau at nine
    o&rsquo;clock to-night when....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I should have been at Mortain,&rdquo; he broke in with a strident
    laugh, which seemed to go right through his mother&rsquo;s heart like a knife. &ldquo;At
    Mortain, drilling a few oafs in the use of muskets which they haven&rsquo;t
    got. What was I doing here? Did I not say that I was watching over my property?
    I could not stay away, Mother,&rdquo; he cried wildly. &ldquo;I could not!
    I suffered too much. I was going mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&mdash;my son&mdash;Laurent Marquis de Mortain, preferred to
    turn deserter?&rdquo; she asked coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have yet to learn how it comes that when my son is under orders
    from his chiefs, at the hour when the destinies of his King and his country
    are at stake, how it comes that he has deserted his post.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I left my men in charge of young de Fleurot, my most able lieutenant.
    I only wanted to speak with Fernande&mdash;only to see her for five minutes.
    I was here&mdash;outside the gates at nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I could have
    seen her and spoken with her and be back at my post long before now. Even
    so, there is no harm done. Our contingent was not due to start until midnight.
    I have arranged with de Fleurot&mdash;in case I was detained&mdash;that he
    shall start at the appointed hour, and I would pick up the company at the
    cross-roads less than a kilom&egrave;tre from here and not more than three
    from Domfront. But I should have been back at Mortain long before now,&rdquo; he
    reiterated testily, &ldquo;only when I saw Fernande stealing out of the park
    like a pert wench going to meet her gallant, I lost my head and I followed
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the way to La Vieuville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had she been to the ch&acirc;teau?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one could tell me. The ch&acirc;teau was shut up and dark. I hammered
    on the door. No one replied. I would have broken in the door, but it resisted
    my every onslaught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I lay in wait for some time&mdash;my pistol in my hand. If I had
    seen him, I would have shot him ... him and Fernande too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did you wait?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know ... half an hour perhaps&mdash;perhaps more. No
    one came. The ch&acirc;teau was deserted. Somewhere in it, no doubt, Gaston
    de Maurel, that old reprobate, lay dying. But I realized that Fernande was
    not there, so I came away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came back here,&rdquo; he replied savagely. &ldquo;I am here now
    to ask you where is Fernande?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you are here, my son,&rdquo; rejoined Denise de Mortain harshly, &ldquo;at
    the post of dishonour, while your father and kindred are fighting for France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But now at last she turned on him with all the fury of a tigress roused
    to wrath. She had interrogated him coolly, firmly, smothering the horror
    and the indignation which she felt. But the floodgates of her emotion would
    no longer be kept back; they broke into a torrent of unbridled vituperation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Traitor! deserter!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How dare you remain here
    another minute? How dare you whine and fret before me, while every moment
    of the night is fraught with danger for your King and his cause? How dare
    you run on the high roads after a wench, like a jealous, love-sick swain,
    while your King hath need of every ounce of energy, of courage which you
    possess. Out of my sight, craven deserter! and pray to God that He may grant
    you grace to atone for your treachery with your blood!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother ...&rdquo; he protested firmly, as, stung by her words as
    with a lash, he had jumped to his feet and made a desperate effort to pull
    himself together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not another word,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;When you have redeemed
    your cowardice by prodigies of valour, when you have held Domfront for your
    King in the face of overwhelming odds, you may come to me again ... but not
    before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned her back on him without another look and swept out of the room,
    leaving him standing there miserable, dejected, a hot flush of shame on each
    cheek as if she had struck him there. Once in the darkened boudoir, she tottered
    as far as the open window. Her knees were giving way under her. She leaned
    against the window-frame and with her hand clung desperately to the heavy
    curtain. Not a breath of air came from outside; the storm was at its height&mdash;vivid
    flashes of lightning tore the heavens asunder and the thunder crashed continuously
    overhead. A great sob broke from Denise de Mortain&rsquo;s throat. She had
    suffered this night the keenest torture, the deadliest ignominy, which heart
    of woman can endure; she had seen her beloved son&mdash;the one cherished
    idol of her loveless heart&mdash;sunk to a level of degradation from which
    nothing could ever raise him again.</p>
  <p>She had seen him the prey of a base and futile passion, tortured by insensate
    jealousy which caused him to forget the most elementary dictates of honour.
    Desertion at the hour preceding the battle was infamy so heinous, that in
    her heart Denise de Mortain would have been vastly happier if they had brought
    Laurent to her on a stretcher&mdash;dead.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>She stared out into the night, and suddenly she perceived a sound which
    came to her straining ears above the roll of thunder, from the direction
    of La Frontenay&mdash;a sound which at first brought a frown of deep puzzlement
    to her brow and then an icy feeling like the grip of death to her heart.</p>
  <p>At the same time a slight noise behind her caused her to turn sharply round,
    and she saw Laurent standing under the lintel of the communicating door.
    He stood with his back to the light, so she could not see his face, but only
    the silhouette of him, the graceful, well-proportioned figure, the straight
    and slender limbs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going now at once, Mother,&rdquo; he said coldly, though his
    voice sounded hoarse and choked, and as he spoke he passed his hand once
    or twice across his brow. &ldquo;You are quite right, I deserve all you say.
    But my reason had fled from me&mdash;I was not fully conscious of mine actions.
    Thank God that it is not too late to redeem my folly. In any event, I can
    meet de Fleurot at the cross-roads, and we&rsquo;ll be at Domfront soon after
    midnight....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is too late, my son,&rdquo; she broke in calmly&mdash;&ldquo;too
    late for a de Mortain to do aught but die like a hero, even if he have lived
    his last hours like a coward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Mother?&rdquo; he queried with a frown, for, indeed,
    for the moment he thought that it was his mother&rsquo;s turn to feel her
    brain unhinged. She had remained standing by the window, and now a flash
    of lightning showed her to him for one brief instant, a rigid, menacing figure,
    like that of a Sybil presiding over his destiny, her head thrown back, her
    hand grasping the curtain; her face was the colour of ashes, and her eyes,
    large and glowing, were fixed denouncingly upon him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis futile to take on such tragic airs,&rdquo; he added irritably, &ldquo;just
    because I chose to spend my time on the high roads rather than cool my heels
    in the ditches of Mortain. I have told you that there&rsquo;s no harm done&mdash;that
    de Fleurot is in charge&mdash;that I shall pick him up on the way to Domfront&mdash;that
    I shall still lead our contingent just as it was arranged. I tell you that
    there&rsquo;s nothing lost....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything is lost, my son,&rdquo; she replied coldly; &ldquo;even
    your honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as he made no reply, but with a shrug of the shoulders quietly turned
    to go, she called out peremptorily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively he paused on the threshold. From far away, in the direction
    where lay the factories of La Frontenay, there came through the intermittent
    hush of the storm the loud clang of a bell, followed immediately by the shrill
    hooting of a siren.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The alarm bell and the sirens at the factories,&rdquo; said Denise
    de Mortain slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Laurent, as, rooted to the spot, he remained
    standing for one short second, straining his ears to listen. &ldquo;What
    can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That the unforeseen has occurred,&rdquo; she rejoined harshly, &ldquo;and
    that there are two traitors in our family, my son&mdash;you and Fernande.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; he cried, horrified to hear his mother put into words
    that which he himself had dared to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fernande de Courson has betrayed her King in order to save her lover,&rdquo; continued
    the Marquise, as she pointed an accusing finger in the direction whence the
    hooting of sirens and the continuous clang of alarm bells rose above the
    confused sounds of the storm. &ldquo;And whilst friends and kindred prepare
    to conquer or to die for their faith, Laurent de Mortain goes philandering
    after a petticoat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the sting of her last words had not the time to reach him. Already he
    had run to the door, tearing it open as he ran; the next moment his scurrying
    footsteps were heard echoing all through the silent ch&acirc;teau&mdash;along
    the vast corridors, down the monumental staircase and across the marble hall,
    until the clang of the great glazed doors proclaimed that he was out of the
    house.</p>
  <p>Then Madame leaned out of the window as far as she could. She could still
    hear Laurent running down the perron steps and at full speed along the gravelled
    drive. Once the lightning lit up the whole extent of the park, the trees,
    the paths, the flower-beds, and the tall iron gates in the distance; but
    she could not see Laurent. He was already far away.</p>
  <p>The sound of sirens and alarms had not ceased. Over there around Mortain
    men were making ready to fight or die for their King. One of the last efforts
    for restoring an effete Bourbon to his throne was about to be drowned in
    a sea of bloodshed. The unforeseen had happened&mdash;what it was the lonely
    watcher could not conjecture, but she fell on her knees beside the open window,
    and, burying her head in her hands, she moaned and prayed: &ldquo;God, my
    God! grant that he may die fighting; do not punish one moment&rsquo;s folly
    by a lifelong disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter &nbsp;24<br>
    After The Storm</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>It was close upon midnight when Fernande made her way to Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s
    boudoir. She found her there, on her knees still, her hands folded and stretched
    out over the window-sill, her head buried in her arms.</p>
  <p>The rain was coming down in torrents. Fernande herself, on her way home,
    had been drenched to the skin. But this was not the time to think of wet
    and cold, of health or of prudence. She had thrown down her cloak in the
    hall and at once went up to her aunt&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>The boudoir was dark, only from the next room there came the feeble rays
    of reflected light from the lamp. With a cry of burning anxiety Fernande
    ran to Madame. Denise de Mortain had knelt before the open window ever since
    her son&rsquo;s flying footsteps had ceased to resound through the ch&acirc;teau;
    she had knelt here absolutely prostrate with grief, her heart tortured with
    the desire to see her beloved son killed rather than openly disgraced. Fernande,
    as she bent over her, could feel that her arms and shoulders, her hands and
    her hair were soaked through. With gentle words and persuasive strength she
    tried to drag her away from the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she said appealingly, &ldquo;it is I&mdash;Fernande.
    Won&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She felt a shiver going right through Denise&rsquo;s kneeling form; she
    racked her brain in wonderment as to what had caused this utter moral collapse
    in a woman who was always so full of indomitable energy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante!</i>&rdquo; she reiterated more firmly, &ldquo;I pray
    you listen to me. There is something which I must tell you now&mdash;at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She managed gradually to raise Madame up in her own strong young arms, and
    to lead her to a chair close by. Denise was only half conscious. She sat
    in the chair, with her head rolling from left to right against its back,
    her eyes closed, her hands inert. Fernande ran into the bedroom. She brought
    in the lamp and a towel, and she dried Madame&rsquo;s face and hands and
    wiped the moisture from her dress and hair. Then she took the cold, numb
    hands in hers and began chafing them, rubbing the fingers, trying to infuse
    life into them with her warm breath.</p>
  <p>After a while consciousness began to return. The head ceased its weird rolling,
    and lay quite still against the back of the chair. A certain degree of warmth
    communicated itself to the fingers and an occasional tremor shook the pain-wearied
    frame.</p>
  <p>Then Madame la Marquise opened her eyes. For a moment or two she looked
    round her dazed, and still held in the arms of semi-consciousness. She looked
    straight into the lamp, and the pupils of her eyes slowly contracted until
    they appeared like small pin-points, with the iris round them steely and
    pale.</p>
  <p>Then her gaze fastened itself on Fernande&mdash;first on the hem of her
    gown, wet and muddy after the long tramp through the rain; then it wandered
    up by degrees to the girl&rsquo;s slender, white hands, with the delicate
    fingers interlaced and the diamond ring&mdash;Laurent&rsquo;s gift&mdash;gleaming
    in the lamplight.</p>
  <p>Then she met the girl&rsquo;s blue eyes fixed compassionately, tenderly
    upon her. In a moment full consciousness returned to her. She drew herself
    up, and, leaning her hands against the arms of the chair, she was able to
    struggle to her feet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i> ...&rdquo; began Fernande gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; queried Madame la Marquise coldly, &ldquo;and
    what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively Fernande put out her arms: the strange query, the raucous
    timbre of the voice, struck with unexplainable terror into her heart&mdash;something,
    she thought, had happened during her absence&mdash;something awesome and
    terrific, which had unhinged this woman&rsquo;s cool and powerful brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; reiterated Denise de Mortain coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Fernande gently, &ldquo;do
    you not know me? I am Fernande&mdash;I have just come home and found you
    here....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you are not Fernande,&rdquo; broke in Madame harshly&mdash;&ldquo;not
    my niece, Fernande de Courson, the daughter of my dear, dear brother. You
    are a ghoul!&rdquo; she cried excitedly, &ldquo;a monster ... a hideous abortion
    ... a de Courson turned traitor.... I do not know you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still Fernande did not realize the truth. She was convinced now that the
    excitement of the day and the weary watching throughout the evening had acted
    banefully on Denise de Mortain&rsquo;s brain. That she was unnerved there
    could be no doubt; there was an unnatural glow in her eyes, and the pallor
    of her cheeks was almost ghost-like. The young girl, genuinely alarmed, made
    a movement in the direction of the bell-pull. She and Annette could, at any
    rate, put Madame to bed ere a high fever brought on any further complications.
    But before she could reach the bell Madame had interposed calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am neither ill nor insane,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But this is
    my room, and I order you out of it. Go! Out of my sight&mdash;now&mdash;at
    once&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; protested Fernande, who, of a truth, felt
    so bewildered that she did not know what to think, what to say, what to make
    of this extraordinary, this appalling situation. &ldquo;Something has unnerved
    you,&rdquo; she continued with calm dignity. &ldquo;An you will not allow
    me to attend to you or to ring for Annette, I had best retire until you are
    in a fit condition to listen to what I have to say. But I warn you that it
    is urgent. Every second wasted in this unexplainable misunderstanding may
    mean danger ... if not worse ... to my father and to our friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your treachery,&rdquo; retorted Madame quietly, &ldquo;has already
    wrought all the evil and brought untold danger to all our friends and death
    to a great many&mdash;to your father, perhaps, to Laurent, certainly. There
    is nothing that you can say to me now which can avert the awful catastrophe
    for which you and you alone are responsible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo;  exclaimed Fernande. &ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you! The surprise coup planned by de Puisaye has failed. The
    alarm was given at the armament works an hour and a half ago; since then
    there has been continuous firing in the direction of Mortain. The garrison
    there has been aroused, that of Domfront, too, no doubt. Some of our contingents
    have been surprised. They are selling their lives dearly at this hour. Your
    father is probably fighting over there. Who is it, then, who has betrayed
    us to Ronnay de Maurel and delivered our brave little army into the hands
    of our enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; protested Fernande loudly.</p>
  <p>Light had suddenly broken on the hideous mystery which had confronted her
    when she first entered this room. She understood everything now&mdash;her
    aunt&rsquo;s prostration, her despair, the semi-insanity which was overclouding
    her brain, making her see lurid phantoms of treachery. She&mdash;Fernande&mdash;was
    suspected of having betrayed her father, her lover, her friends; and Madame
    la Marquise, clinging to that abominable thought, was rapidly losing all
    sense of justice, of reasoning and of right. The girl&rsquo;s very soul was
    outraged at the monstrous accusation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dared you harbour such abominable thoughts of me?&rdquo; she
    cried indignantly.</p>
  <p>A strident laugh broke from Denise de Mortain&rsquo;s throat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you prefer it if I thought that you had stolen out of the ch&acirc;teau
    to-night&mdash;and alone&mdash;in order to meet a swain behind the nearest
    hedge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was Laurent&rsquo;s estimate of you; and I&mdash;like a fool&mdash;thought
    he must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laurent was here&mdash;to-night,&rdquo; continued Madame, as she
    came a step or two nearer to Fernande, and the words&mdash;hot, passionate,
    fierce&mdash;came tumbling through her lips.  &ldquo;For two days he was
    tortured with thoughts of your treachery. I tell you he seemed nearly mad.
    To-night he could hold out no longer. He deserted his post&mdash;he, who
    is the soul of honour! He came here, just in time to see you steal out of
    the ch&acirc;teau like a flirty wench. An hour and a half ago the alarm bell
    from the factories clanged through the night. Laurent was here then, pouring
    out his heart in bitterness and in misery. But the sound recalled him to
    his duty, which he had forgotten while thinking of you. He went back in order
    to redeem the hour of folly which led him to desert his post. He went back
    in order to die fighting beside my brother and his friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; moaned Fernande, as she covered her face with
    her hands.</p>
  <p>Even while she allowed the torrent of Madame&rsquo;s unjust reproaches to
    break over her innocent head, she had already realized the hopelessness of
    her own situation, the hopelessness of it all. Guiltless as she knew herself
    to be, she almost understood, and was nigh to forgiving Madame&rsquo;s horrible
    suspicions of her. The awful seed of the dastardly murder projected against
    a defenceless man had, indeed, borne bitter fruits of disaster and of shame;
    and she, who had tried to avert one awful catastrophe, had unknowingly precipitated
    another. By her absence from home to-night she had left Laurent at the mercy
    of his mother; and he, with the guilt of desertion upon his conscience, was
    left to face her until, driven to desperation by the harshness and the cruelty
    which still glittered in Denise de Mortain&rsquo;s eyes, he had rushed off,
    blindly perhaps, to his death.</p>
  <p>An overwhelming pity for this hard, callous woman suddenly filled Fernande&rsquo;s
    sensitive heart. All that she herself had suffered, all that she was yet
    destined to suffer, was as nothing compared to the bitterness of self-reproach
    which anon must assail the mother of Laurent&mdash;the mother of Ronnay de
    Maurel: and when, exhausted by the vehemence of her own eloquence, Madame
    la Marquise fell back into her chair, panting and overwrought, Fernande drew
    near to her, despite her vigorous protest, and knelt affectionately by her
    side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she said gently, while tears of sweet compassion
    gathered in her eyes, &ldquo;you have been passing cruel and unjust to me,
    and just for a moment I felt nothing but anger against you. But since you
    have told me about Laurent, I feel that I can understand. Before the God
    who made me, I swear to you that I had no hand in warning our enemies of
    what was intended. How could I have, seeing that my own dear father&rsquo;s
    life was involved in the affair? I went to the factory to-night with the
    sole intention of staying Leroux&rsquo; hand from committing a dastardly
    murder&mdash;a murder, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; she continued with firm energy, &ldquo;that
    despite victory, despite the utmost triumphs, would for ever have sullied
    our cause and weighed us all down with bitter self-reproach. Had Leroux listened
    to me, I still believe that M. de Maurel would never have suspected what
    was in the air; it was Leroux&rsquo; threats, Leroux&rsquo; attitude, which
    put him on the scent. I was there; I saw it all. When Leroux, with his wild
    and menacing talk, had given away the best part of M. de Puisaye&rsquo;s
    plan, Ronnay de Maurel&mdash;your son, <i>ma tante</i>&mdash;stood with a
    naked light in his hand ready to blow up the entire factory rather than let
    it fall into our hands. Leroux and his mates were cowed; they were poltroons
    as well as fools, and M. de Maurel forced one of the men to ring the alarm
    bell. That is what happened at the La Frontenay works, <i>ma tante</i>. The
    hooting of the sirens roused the neighbouring villages and the garrison of
    Domfront. I escaped out of the factory as soon as I was able; since then
    I have been on the high road, tortured with fears as to what has happened
    to my father and what to Laurent. But by all that I hold most dear, <i>ma
    tante</i>, what I have told you is the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame had listened in silence, at first with averted head and with a look
    of sullen obstinacy on her face. She would have given much to remain unconvinced.
    The burning indignation which she had felt at Laurent&rsquo;s conduct had
    to vent itself on the innocent cause of it. After a while she looked into
    Fernande&rsquo;s face with a piercing, searching gaze. She would have liked
    to hold the girl&rsquo;s soul naked before her eyes, and to search within
    its innermost recesses for a sign of guilt or even of weakness. But it was
    impossible to look for long into the sweet, earnest face and the limpid blue
    eyes which were the true mirrors of candour and of purity, and to affect
    doubt which no longer could exist. In her heart Madame knew that Fernande
    spoke the truth. Everything that she said bore the impress of actual facts
    witnessed and faithfully recorded. Madame was bound to admit it, but she
    was far too self-willed and obstinate to do so generously&mdash;and, above
    all, she knew that never as long as she lived would she forgive Fernande
    de Courson for having been the cause&mdash;however innocent&mdash;of Laurent&rsquo;s
    unpardonable conduct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be the truth,&rdquo; she said grudgingly&mdash;&ldquo;it is
    the truth, no doubt, since you are prepared to swear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you still doubt me, <i>ma tante</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. But one thing, my girl, is certain&mdash;and that is if Laurent
    had not seen you stealing out of the ch&acirc;teau&mdash;if he had spoken
    for five minutes with you&mdash;he would have gone straight back to his post,
    and would not now be under the suspicion of having deserted his men in the
    hour of danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this senseless accusation Fernande made no reply. What would have been
    the use? She could not have convinced Madame that it was Laurent&rsquo;s
    insensate jealousy which had been the primary cause of his undoing. Except
    for those few brief seconds, when she boldly faced a horrible death beside
    the man whom she loved, she had not harboured one disloyal thought of Laurent,
    or spoken one disloyal word. Her love for Ronnay de Maurel she could not
    destroy; it had its roots in the innermost fibres of her heart. She was no
    more responsible for that feeling than was Denise de Mortain for her callousness
    or Laurent for his vehement temper. All that she could do to wrench herself
    away from its influence she had done; and in the process she had plucked
    out her heart-strings and martyrized her very soul. In the lonely walk from
    the factories to the ch&acirc;teau she had fought against the veriest thought
    of rebellion; she had sacrificed her whole life, her every hope of happiness
    on the altar of unimpassioned loyalty. Whenever she met Laurent again she
    could look him fearlessly in the eyes, she could grasp his hand in all honour
    and friendship. The image of Ronnay de Maurel lay buried deep down in her
    heart, and to the memory of that one mad and rapturous moment she had bidden
    an eternal farewell.</p>
  <p>Now when she felt Madame&rsquo;s cold enmity enveloping her as with an icy
    mantle, she felt how desperately far from her would happiness lie in the
    future. On the merest threshold of her life she saw the endless years that
    were in store for her, between a man who would for ever torture her with
    his turbulent passion and a woman who would paralyse her with relentless
    animosity. The catastrophe of this night&mdash;and God alone knew yet its
    full extent&mdash;would always be laid at her door. She saw this in Denise
    de Mortain&rsquo;s every look, in the scornful stiffening of her whole attitude,
    as she drew herself away from the slightest contact with her niece; and after
    a moment or two of silence, the involuntary appeal broke from the poor girl&rsquo;s
    lips: &ldquo;Will you always hate me like this, <i>ma tante</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise looked at her coldly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Always is a long time,
    and it is impossible for any human mind to know if it will ever forget. But
    this I do know, that never with my consent will you become my daughter. If
    Laurent is spared this night, I shall devote every hour, every moment of
    my life, to parting him from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will remain unjust to the last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unjust?&rdquo;&mdash;and Denise de Mortain shrugged her shoulders
    calmly. &ldquo;Love and hate are never just, and I could never dissociate
    you from the memories of this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose from her chair, her whole attitude now one of cool indifference.
    Ever since she had accepted Fernande&rsquo;s explanation she had made desperate
    efforts to regain the mastery over her nerves and to conceal every outward
    manifestation of the burning anxiety which she felt. At last she had succeeded,
    but the struggle had left her weary and wellnigh spent. Her face was pale,
    her eyes circled with purple, and there was a feeble quiver round her bloodless
    lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be hours,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;and it may be days,
    ere we get authentic news. What do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To start for Courson at daybreak,&rdquo; replied Fernande with equal
    calm. &ldquo;I must be on the spot in case my father is able to return there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I will remain here until I know that both he and Laurent are
    safe. But remember,&rdquo; she added, and something of the old domineering,
    managing tone crept back into her voice, &ldquo;that the peace and quietude
    of the past year are at an end; that once more we are on the branch, once
    more we stand with one foot on the way to exile. For the next few days there
    will be perquisitions, molestations, arrests. The infamous police of Bonaparte
    will not be slow to avenge the scare it has received this night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall be ready to follow my father whenever or wherever he may
    want me,&rdquo;  rejoined Fernande coldly.</p>
  <p>For a moment it was on the tip of her tongue to tell Madame that Ronnay
    de Maurel would look after the safety of her father and of Laurent. She had
    his promise, and he was not a man to leave a stone unturned ere he fulfilled
    that promise. Though her heart was aching with anxiety, she felt comforted
    in the thought that the one man who could help those she cared for, by standing
    by them at this hour, would do it whole-heartedly, and would throw into the
    scales of any pending reprisals the whole weight of his influence and of
    his wealth.</p>
  <p>But it would have been worse than futile to mention de Maurel&rsquo;s name
    again now. Madame, in any case, would refuse to be comforted, and the floodgates
    of her resentment would certainly break out afresh. She&mdash;Fernande&mdash;was
    sorely in need of quietude; she felt that she could not endure another scene.
    She was desperately sorry for her aunt; Madame&rsquo;s anxiety for Laurent
    must be positively heartrending, but nothing could be gained by further recriminations,
    further reproaches, which only helped to embitter these hours of suspense
    and of dread.</p>
  <p>Fernande felt confident that de Maurel would send her news as soon as he
    knew anything definite; until then many weary hours would go by, she knew,
    but at least let them go by in peace. Her hope rested in God and, next to
    Him, in the loyalty and the power of the man who loved her so selflessly.</p>
  <p>So she bade her aunt a formal good night, and with a great sense of relief
    she went quickly to her room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Denise de Mortain, too, was glad to find herself alone once more. She drew
    the chair to the open window and sat down, prepared to wait. Though she was
    so tired that she could hardly move, she felt that she could not rest. The
    house was very still now; all the servants had long since gone to bed. They
    were a set of faithful but utterly stupid peasants from the village, and
    had no notion of what went on outside the park gates. Matthieu Renard and
    Annette knew, and they remained on the watch. Old Matthieu would not go to
    bed until he could bring Madame la Marquise some news which would comfort
    her, and Annette waited where she could hear the bell, in case Madame wanted
    anything.</p>
  <p>Madame, sitting by the open window, peered out into the night. The firing
    sounded more distant now and more intermittent; the rain had ceased and the
    darkness was less intense. Overhead large patches of star-studded indigo
    appeared between the fissures in the clouds. The weary watcher, gazing out
    into nothingness, her eyes aching with sleeplessness and many unshed tears,
    fell anon into a semi-wakeful languor, while the early hours of the morning
    sped leaden-footed by.</p>
  <p>Suddenly something woke her to full consciousness. She sat up, shivering
    a little; the morning air struck fresh and cool against her face. Through
    her torpor-like sleep she had been conscious of the swift gallop of a horse
    on the hard road drawing rapidly nearer. Now she was fully awake, she could
    hear the clatter of the hoofs&mdash;someone was coming along at break-neck
    speed&mdash;bringing news probably. She jumped to her feet; the horse had
    been brought to a halt outside the gates; the next moment she heard a murmur
    of voices and then the sound of footsteps coming up the drive.</p>
  <p>Madame, leaning out of the window, called out peremptorily: &ldquo;Who goes
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she received no reply. Whoever had arrived at this early hour had gone
    into the house. Through the dream-like recollections of what she had heard,
    it seemed to Denise that the voice of Fernande had mingled with that of two
    men, one of whom might have been old Matthieu.</p>
  <p>She rang the bell violently. Then she looked at the clock. It was close
    on five.</p>
  <p>After a few minutes there was a knock at the door, and in response to an
    impatient &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; it was opened, and Fernande, pale, obviously
    tired to death, and with dark circles under her eyes, came into the room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; queried Madame, in a voice broken by fatigue and
    nerve-strain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the overseers from the armament works, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; replied
    Fernande, &ldquo;with a message from M. de Maurel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I desire no message from M. de Maurel,&rdquo; said Madame curtly; &ldquo;let
    him tell you what he wants and go back the way he came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is another man with him, <i>ma tante</i>,&rdquo; hazarded Fernande,
    after some hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;one of our people&mdash;a prisoner with
    news of M. de Puisaye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame waited a moment or two, frowning, debating between her pride which
    prompted her to refuse to see an emissary of de Maurel, and the agony of
    suspense which was near to killing her. Anxiety gained the victory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let the men come up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande went, and a minute or two later she returned followed by two men,
    one of whom was Mathurin, chief overseer of the de Maurel smelting works.
    Both men looked as if they had ridden hard. Mathurin&rsquo;s coat and hat
    were covered with dust; the other&mdash;a true type of the Chouans, of those
    who had fought under de Frott&eacute; and Cadoudal&mdash;was dressed in a
    tattered blouse and ragged linen breeches; the soles of his boots had parted
    from their uppers; he was unkempt and unwashed. Fernande closed the door
    behind them, then she slipped round behind Madame to the corner by the open
    window, where she could feel the fresh morning air and rest her aching head
    against the heavy curtain. Mathurin had already told her briefly what he
    had been sent to say: his orders were to see Mademoiselle de Courson first,
    and then Madame la Marquise if she asked for him. Fernande, ensconced beside
    the window, unseen by her aunt, could safely indulge in the luxury of tears
    and of silence.</p>
  <p>When the men entered, Madame la Marquise had looked for a moment keenly
    and searchingly at the old Chouan. She was ready and eager to catch the slightest
    movement or flitting glance which might have been meant for a signal. She
    felt anxious and puzzled, marvelling why de Maurel had sent a messenger to
    her&mdash;at this hour&mdash;and what was the meaning of this prisoner brought
    hither to speak with her. Then she turned haughtily to Mathurin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who has sent you?&rdquo; she queried peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal Comte de Maurel,&rdquo; replied Mathurin, after
    he had touched his forelock with every mark of respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; asked Madame again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chief overseer at the smelting works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did M. de Maurel send you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal thought Madame la Marquise and Mademoiselle
    de Courson would be anxious to know what had happened last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she said coldly, &ldquo;what did happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our alarm bells and sirens went off at half-past ten, Madame la Marquise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that&mdash;I heard them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The mutineers, with Paul Leroux at their head, have been arrested
    by our watchmen. Leroux confessed that he had been bribed to murder M. le
    Mar&eacute;chal, and to deliver the armament works into the hands of a band
    of Royalists under M. de Puisaye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did M. de Maurel order you to say this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He desired Madame la Marquise to know that Leroux was a coward as
    well as a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leroux&rsquo;  personality.... Who is Leroux, by the way?... does
    not interest me. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our sirens aroused the garrison of Domfront. The commandant sent
    over one of his officers with a small detachment of infantry to see what
    was amiss. He only thought of fire or of a mutiny among the convicts, and
    he was ready to send us help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal interrogated Leroux in the presence of the
    officer. Leroux made a clean breast of all he knew. M. de Maurel then sent
    his own couriers from the works to Domfront, to Tinchebrai, and to Mortain,
    warning the different commandants against possible attacks from roaming bands
    of Chouans. Within a couple of hours all the garrisons were afoot and in
    touch with one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This man here, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; said Mathurin, indicating
    his companion, &ldquo;will be able to tell you better than I can what happened
    in the ranks of the Chouans. He fell a prisoner in our hands early in the
    night. M. le Mar&eacute;chal had ridden over to Mortain, and I was with him
    when this man was brought in a prisoner. M. le Mar&eacute;chal questioned
    him, and then gave him over into my charge.  &lsquo;Take the fellow over
    to La Frontenay, Mathurin,&rsquo; he said to me. &lsquo;Madame la Marquise
    de Mortain and Mademoiselle de Courson will want to hear what he has to say.&rsquo; So
    we both got to horse and rode hither as fast as we could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Madame determinedly. &ldquo;Leave the man
    here with me. I desire to speak with him alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mathurin, at the peremptory command, appeared to hesitate. &ldquo;Madame
    la Marquise ...&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Ah  &ccedil;&agrave;</i>,&rdquo; she retorted haughtily, &ldquo;has
    M. de Maurel sent you here perchance as my jailer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mathurin, thus challenged, did not know what to say. Madame la Marquise
    had a way with her which imposed her will on every one around her. The worthy
    overseer was certainly not vested with powers to gainsay her wishes. He was
    a shrewd man, loyal to the depth of his simple heart and ready to be hacked
    to pieces for M. le Mar&eacute;chal; he would have defied an army of haughty
    ladies if he thought any harm could come from a private interview with this
    ill-conditioned old rascal; but in this case prudence and conciliation was
    perhaps the wisest course. And somehow he felt that Mademoiselle de Courson&rsquo;s
    presence was, in any case, a safeguard against any further intrigues against
    his master. So after an imperceptible moment of hesitation he made a curt
    obeisance and backed out of the room, closing the door behind him.</p>
  <p>Far be it from me to suggest that good old Mathurin listened at the keyhole,
    but I make bold to assert that very little of Madame la Marquise&rsquo;s
    private conversation with the old Chouan escaped him.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>As soon as the door had closed on Mathurin, Denise de Mortain turned to
    the man and said, speaking curtly and rapidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your name is Jean Blanchet. I know you. Well, tell me quickly everything
    you know. When was the alarm given in your camp?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At about half-past eleven, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; replied the
    man. &ldquo;I and six of my mates were patrolling the approaches of the town,
    when we heard a rumour that the garrison inside the city was astir. News
    had arrived, so &rsquo;twas said, that bands of Chouans were preparing a
    surprise attack. M. de Puisaye had his headquarters in the Cerf-Volant woods
    south of the town; there was only just time to run and warn him of what was
    in the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Puisaye at once ordered the alarm to be sounded. Within ten
    minutes the whole camp was afoot and M. de Puisaye then commanded the retreat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  exclaimed Madame. &ldquo;Without striking a blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would have been the use?&rdquo; retorted the man with a shrug
    of the shoulders. &ldquo;We had next to no arms, and to make a stand would
    have meant fighting against at least two companies of infantry and a battery
    of artillery, which could easily have cut us to pieces even before reinforcements
    came from Tinchebrai and Domfront. There is a half-battery of artillery at
    both those places, and we knew by then that all the garrisons round were
    in touch with one another. To have made a stand,&rdquo; reiterated the man
    gruffly, &ldquo;would have meant useless bloodshed. M. de Puisaye was alive
    to that. He chose the wiser course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not the most heroic,&rdquo; murmured Madame, under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had a lot of undisciplined, ill-fed, ill-clothed men to look after.
    What could he do? Now if we could have equipped ourselves at the factories
    of La Frontenay ...&rdquo; he added with a harsh laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Madame impatiently. &ldquo;And M. de
    Puisaye has retreated&mdash;whither?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not know. To Avranches, I should say. The way was open, and,
    in any case, his losses would be very slight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And....&rdquo;  A name was on Madame&rsquo;s lips; she checked herself.
    She did not dare to speak it&mdash;not before this man ... in case....</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And M. de Courson?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Courson must be with M. de Puisaye, I think. I believe M. d&rsquo;Ach&eacute; is
    with him and M. Prigent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then at last anxiety could hold out no longer. Madame had made heroic efforts
    to appear calm, but now the hoarse query broke from her lips: &ldquo;And
    M. le Marquis de Mortain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was it her own fevered fancy? But it seemed to her as if the man hesitated
    for a second or two ere he replied; he twisted his cap between his fingers,
    and a shock of unruly hair falling over his forehead hid the expression of
    his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Puisaye sent orders to M. de Mortain,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;to
    defend the rear in case the commandant of the garrison got wind of the retreat
    and sent a company in pursuit. But M. de Mortain was not at his post then.
    M. de Fleurot was in command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame leaned her weight against the chair close by; she passed her tongue
    once or twice over her parched lips. The man was evidently determined not
    to meet her eye.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo;  she asked after a while, &ldquo;was the firing which
    I heard in the direction of Mortain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. de Fleurot,&rdquo; replied Blanchet curtly, &ldquo;fighting a
    rearguard action and covering the main retreat. I was in his company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ... what was the result ... of the action, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say. I was taken prisoner quite early. I only heard rumours
    afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That our small contingent was entirely cut up ... there were some
    prisoners taken ... but it is generally believed that scarce a man escaped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ... has anything been heard of M. de Puisaye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Madame la Marquise, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or of M. de Courson, or any of the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. But,&rdquo; added Blanchet significantly, as he nodded in the
    direction of the door, &ldquo;I believe that Mathurin there knows something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You think ...&rdquo; began Madame involuntarily. Then she paused;
    something in the man&rsquo;s look&mdash;furtive and compassionate&mdash;froze
    the words upon her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; she asked under her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for certain, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>It meant another struggle against resentment and against pride. But, in
    any case, the present uncertainty was unendurable. Denise de Mortain felt
    that she would have gone on her knees to the devil himself if he brought
    her authentic news of Laurent. She went boldly to the door, and, opening
    it, she called:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mathurin! Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your orders, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>
  <p>He came back into the room, reluctantly this time. He was a good fellow,
    with wife and children of his own. Temperamentally and traditionally he hated
    these Royalists&mdash;packs of rebels and intriguers, he called them&mdash;and
    he knew this haughty lady had plotted against her own son&mdash;M. le Mar&eacute;chal&mdash;whom
    he adored; but there was something which he had yet to tell her, and in his
    own rough way he shrank from the task, feeling nothing but pity for her,
    because of what she was doomed to suffer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The prisoner tells me,&rdquo; began Madame la Marquise, as calmly
    as she could, &ldquo;that you can give me news of M. le Marquis de Mortain,
    my son. Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; replied the man slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  she asked, &ldquo;why did you not give me that news
    at once?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus commanded, Mathurin could not help but obey as quickly as possible.
    He shifted from one foot to the other, and a look of real pity softened for
    a moment the rugged lines of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you must know that
    after the fight with M. de Puisaye&rsquo;s rearguard we had several prisoners
    in our hands. M. le Mar&eacute;chal took the trouble to interrogate each
    one separately. When he had finished, he ordered me to accompany him, and
    together we went to the spot where the affray had taken place. It was on
    the edge of the wood. It was then about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning
    and the dawn was breaking. The place was littered with dead. I counted over
    sixty myself, among them young M. de Fleurot, whom I knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;  said Madame la Marquise quietly, for the man had paused.
    She knew well enough what he was about to tell her. He looked her straight
    in the eyes. They expressed a query, and he nodded silently in reply. A low
    moan of pain broke from Madame&rsquo;s lips; she pressed her handkerchief
    to her lips to smother a louder cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal found M. le Marquis de Mortain lying amongst
    the dead,&rdquo; said Mathurin slowly after a while. &ldquo;He told me to
    tell Madame la Marquise that M. Laurent must have died like a hero; he had
    a broken sword in his hand and three bullet wounds in his chest.... M. le
    Mar&eacute;chal lifted him up in his arms and carried him to his horse. I
    helped to lift the body into the saddle, and M. le Mar&eacute;chal ordered
    me to ride back to Mortain as fast as I could and to send out half a dozen
    men to him at once. &lsquo;When you have done that, Mathurin,&rsquo; he said
    to me, &lsquo;go to La Frontenay as quickly as may be, take the prisoner
    Jean Blanchet with you, and see Madame la Marquise de Mortain and Mademoiselle
    de Courson. Tell them that I have conveyed M. le Marquis to the Ch&acirc;teau
    of Courson, and that there I will await their pleasure.&rsquo; And that is
    all, Madame la Marquise,&rdquo; concluded Mathurin clumsily, for, indeed,
    he felt overawed by the look of hopeless grief which had spread over Madame&rsquo;s
    marble-like face. &ldquo;M. le Mar&eacute;chal ordered the carriole to be
    sent for Madame la Marquise. It should be here by now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he had finished speaking she gave him a stately nod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you, good Mathurin,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I pray
    you go back to your master now and tell him that Mademoiselle Fernande and
    I will be at the Ch&acirc;teau of Courson within the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She appeared like a statue, pale and unbending. One slender hand rested
    on the back of the chair to steady herself; the other closed tightly over
    her lace handkerchief. The kerchief round her shoulders looked less white
    than her cheeks: the golden light of a summer&rsquo;s morning crept in through
    the narrow window. A glorious sunshine followed on the storm of the night;
    the warm rays glinted on Madame&rsquo;s white hair, on her pale forehead
    and on the rings upon her fingers. Mathurin, who had been in Paris in the
    hot days of the Terror, remembered, as he looked on her, the martyred Queen
    going to her death.</p>
  <p>He gave a sign to Jean Blanchet. He would not have dared to say another
    word; he felt the majesty of this overwhelming grief, and, having made a
    profound obeisance, he and the old Chouan went out of the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>Fernande&rsquo;s arms were round the unfortunate woman who had sunk half-swooning
    into the chair.</p>
  <p>So this was the end of it all: the sequel of so many intrigues, so many
    hopes, of the carefully-laid plans and the certainty of victory. Laurent,
    with his tempestuous, impulsive nature, had atoned with his life for his
    one hour of folly; the small band of Royalists was dispersed, its leaders
    fugitives; and a proud and self-willed woman would henceforth be destined
    to eat out her heart in vain remorse and regret. Callously she would have
    sacrificed one son, even whilst God decreed that He would take the other.
    Laurent de Mortain had fallen a victim to the dastardly attempt planned against
    his brother, just as much as to the unreasoning jealousy which had made him
    desert his post and forfeit his honour.</p>
  <p>Madame la Marquise was a broken old woman now; even her hatred against Fernande
    was swallowed up in the immensity of her grief. She allowed the young girl
    to attend on her, to find her mantle and hood, and then gently to lead her
    downstairs. She could not bring herself to speak to her, however; in her
    heart, beside the bitterness of self-reproach, there lurked the dull resentment
    against the woman who had ruled over her son&rsquo;s heart until the hour
    of his death.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later the two women, sitting side by side in the carriole,
    were driven rapidly to Courson.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter &nbsp;25<br>
    The White Pigeon</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Fernande waited in the hall below while Madame la Marquise went upstairs
    to see the last of her son. Half a dozen men from the La Frontenay works
    formed a guard of honour for the dead.</p>
  <p>It was impossible even for Fernande, who knew her aunt so well, to guess
    at what Denise de Mortain felt. Her heart was so little capable of grief,
    that it was doubtful whether she really mourned Laurent, or whether pride,
    in that he died a hero&rsquo;s death, acted as a soothing balm upon her sorrow.
    When half an hour later she rejoined her niece in the small boudoir downstairs,
    she appeared outwardly quite calm, and talked of nothing but the new plans
    which already were seething in her brain, and which were destined to retrieve
    the mistakes of the night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;De Puisaye was wise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not to jeopardize his
    forces. They are practically intact, ready for a coup which must in the near
    future be successful. We fell into many grave errors this time, and we shall
    now stand in the happy position of being forewarned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande thought it best to say nothing. What had been the use of arguing
    that Marshal de Maurel was also forewarned now?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have not given up the idea of a possible seizure of the La Frontenay
    works,&rdquo;  Madame went on in her cold and placid way, just as if all
    her schemes of the past twelve months had not culminated in the death of
    the one being in the world whom she had professed to love; &ldquo;but I still
    think that my own original idea when I first came to Courson last year, of
    being in open amity with my son Ronnay, was the wisest after all. I must
    speak with your father and with de Puisaye about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Fernande kept back, with difficulty, an exclamation of horror. More schemes!
    more intrigues! more tortuous by-paths! Was the whole of her young life to
    be linked indissolubly to this endless chain of treachery? Was she to be
    passively acquiescent&mdash;a tool, where need be&mdash;whenever plots were
    hatched that revolted her every sense of loyalty and of truth? Fortunately
    for her, Madame was too deeply engrossed in her own calculations to pay much
    attention to her, and after a while she&mdash;Fernande&mdash;was able to
    escape out of the boudoir where the atmosphere had already become stifling.</p>
  <p>With aching heart she bade a final adieu to Laurent&mdash;the companion
    of her childhood, the man for whom she had such a tender affection and whom
    she had never loved, but also the man to whom she would have remained rigidly
    true, despite all that he would have made her suffer.</p>
  <p>Then she went out into the park.</p>
  <p>Yet another year of neglect had gone over the terraces and the walks. It
    looked perhaps a shade more tangled, a shade more forlorn. The heavy rain
    of the night before had broken down the slender, unpruned twigs of the roses,
    and the paths were littered with young branches torn from the parent trees.
    The scent of wet earth mingled with the fragrance of heliotrope and white
    acacia; there was a riot of bird-song in the old chestnuts and a hum of bees
    in the avenue of limes.</p>
  <p>Fernande instinctively had wandered to the postern gate which gave on the
    apple-orchard. It was ajar, and she pushed it open and wandered out on the
    wet grass and under the apple-trees, already weighted down by the wealth
    of young fruit.</p>
  <p>From the village distant a kilom&egrave;tre or so from the park gates there
    came the sound of a clock striking seven. The air was redolent with the scent
    and savour of an early summer&rsquo;s morning. Fernande breathed it in with
    delight. The wet leaves of the apple-trees sent down an occasional shower
    of raindrops over her hair as she passed, and now and then she stooped to
    pick a sprig of brilliant-hued wild sorrel or a clump of snow-white marguerites.</p>
  <p>How lovely was the world! Why should men and women plot and scheme to make
    it hideous with their own passions and their manifold treacheries?</p>
  <p>As Fernande left the orchard behind her and struck a narrow path that wound
    its way through some ripening wheat-fields, a lark rose from the ground close
    by, and its gladsome song filled the lonely wanderer&rsquo;s heart with a
    sudden joy. She looked around her and recalled every phase of that journey,
    which she had taken a year ago in the strong arms of the man who knew so
    well how to love. From him there had never come reproach, mistrust, misunderstanding.
    Even at the hour when she had hurt him most deeply, he told her that he understood,
    and if&mdash;after the events of the past night&mdash;they were destined
    to be for ever parted from one another, she would still retain the certainty
    that in his great and simple heart he would never harbour one bitter thought
    against her. Her friends and kindred, her own father, her promised husband,
    had hatched a dastardly and murderous plot against him, and for her sake
    he had found it in his heart to gather his dead brother in his arms, and
    bring him in honour and loving gentleness to his last resting-place.</p>
  <p>And Fernande, with a sudden gesture of heartfelt longing, stretched out
    her arms in the direction where the young birch and chestnut of La Frontenay
    woods gleamed through the golden haze of this midsummer morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take me, my beloved,&rdquo; she murmured under her breath; &ldquo;let
    me rest in your strong arms again. Let me forget the world and its intrigues
    and its treachery within the safe harbour of your sheltering love!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>She wandered on, almost like a sleep-walker in a happy dream; her feet and
    the hem of her gown were soaked through with the sweet-smelling raindrops
    that still clung to the grass; the wet branches of the young chestnuts beat
    against her face as she plunged into the coppice. Her lips were parted in
    a strange, elusive smile, and her eyes gazed into the distance, right through
    the thicket, as if a compelling voice was calling to her from afar.</p>
  <p>A soft breeze stirred the branches of the mountain-ash overhead, the scent
    of elder and acacia went to her head like wine.</p>
  <p>He was waiting for her beside the silent pool, and as soon as she saw him,
    she knew that he had called to her, and that the compelling power of his
    love had drawn her to him, through park and orchard and fields, in answer
    to his call.</p>
  <p>She stood still on the other side of the pool, and for a moment they looked
    across at one another, with the banks of moss and meadowsweet between them
    and a whole world around of love and trust and promise of happiness. No words
    could be spoken between them, because there was so much still that must part
    them for a while. He understood that well enough, for he always understood;
    but she had come to him on this the first morning, when his every thought,
    every feeling, had called to her to come, and now he would be satisfied to
    wait&mdash;that was his way&mdash;to wait and bide his time, knowing by the
    look in her eyes, by the unspoken avowal on her sweet lips, that she would
    come again.</p>
  <p>The breeze sighed among the branches of the trees, the birch whispered to
    the larch, the chestnut to the oak, and a gentle ripple stirred the twigs
    of the meadowsweet. And from somewhere within the bosom of the silent pool
    there came the soft and melancholy call of a number of wood-pigeons.</p>
  <p>And to this man and this woman, who stood here in a world of their own,
    a world peopled with angels and fairies and sprites, and with everything
    that is most fair and most exquisite, it seemed as if from out the pool there
    rose something ethereal, luminous and white, something that was so sacred
    and pure, that it rose straightway heavenward, and was soon merged with the
    fleecy clouds overhead, whilst the call of the fairy pigeons was stilled.</p>
  <p>The trance-like vision lasted only a moment. De Maurel slowly dropped on
    his knees, and above the murmurings of the wood Fernande heard the voice
    of the man she loved calling to her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will come to me, my beloved?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she replied: &ldquo;Very soon!&rdquo;</p>
