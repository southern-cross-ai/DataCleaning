  <p align="center"><i>The Saturday Evening Post, May 28, 1904<br>
  Illustrated by Martin Justice</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;KINK&rdquo; MARTIN&rsquo;S Odyssey is neither epical nor of record,
  yet the snatches I had gleaned at camp-fire and round-up interested me demoralizingly.
  Now, after two years, I came upon him again, crowding the edge of the frontier,
  pioneer by habit, pirate by instinct; lax of morals, lusty of heart.</p>
  <p>I had walked the eight miles from camp, hoping, yet doubting, that this
  Diogenes Martin, Paragon, was my old pal of the vagabond days. It was so,
  but I marked a great change in the man. Reminiscence is dear to my heart,
  however, and I spoke of the past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, do you remember that salted mine in Sonora, that time we took&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He interrupted me hastily, flushing a painful red, and shifting uneasy glances
  at the Jap cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on outside in the sun,&rdquo; he said awkwardly; &ldquo;I can
  talk better in the open,&rdquo; and I followed, marveling, to a seat where
  below us stretched the gravelly creek-bed, ripped and furrowed by the sluices.
  There floated to us softly the rush of waters, the rattle of pick and shovel,
  and the bountiful language of men in a tail-race.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t mention them old days in company,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You
  know I&rsquo;m respectable now.&rdquo; He paused, and I knew that within
  him was the telling of a strange tale &mdash;removed, perhaps, from the
  paths of propriety, but true, and as I listened it grew upon me that morals
  are mainly a matter of latitude and longitude, anyway.</p>
  <p>I felt that he lacked the ancient rippling depravity, seeming burdened by
  a shamed and hesitating rectitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was run out by rats,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, they run
  me from Kansas to &rsquo;Frisco, and then off the map&mdash;so I came to
  Alaska.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe here,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;there aren&rsquo;t
  any in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any back there, either: that was the trouble.
  You see, me and a man misdignified by the appellation of Percival Pillie
  evolved something unique in the way of procuring the &lsquo;panga,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mazuma,&rsquo; money. This here Pillie don&rsquo;t act like
  he sounds&mdash;not largely. He&rsquo;s been affiliated with colleges, horse-racin&rsquo; and
  patent-medicine shows till he&rsquo;s infested and overrun with poetry, politeness
  and peculiar modes of gettin&rsquo; the goods. He&rsquo;s united to the idea
  that the Pillie family lost all the money in the world and folks are forcin&rsquo; it
  back on him as legatee. His gray pulp ain&rsquo;t never curdled on him yet,
  and he realized about this date that rats afforded a virgin field of profit,
  unsullied by the touch of commerce; hence the Pillie Patent Rat Eradicator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It comprised a piece of atmosphere surrounded by wire in such proportions
  that once havin&rsquo; blindfolded and backed a rat into it he&rsquo;d stay
  there; otherwise, its ingenuities wasn&rsquo;t much. We made up a wagon load
  of &rsquo;em, also a zinc tank that fitted the bed of my covered wagon, and
  hit the trail out into the ruralities&mdash;at least, I did. Pillie was a
  week ahead sellin&rsquo; cologne, lightnin&rsquo; rods, and Happy Hints
  to the Housewife, in calf, five volumes, includin&rsquo; one ladies&rsquo; solid
  chased gold watch&mdash;that is, the watches was solid, clean through, and
  Pillie was chased quite frequent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here was our Moody-operandus: Pill traveled on schedule. At a foreordained
  spot our routes intersected, so &rsquo;bout dark I&rsquo;d drive up in my
  prairie schooner to the farmhouse where he stabled his sample-case, and camp
  in the road out front. After supper Percy and the farmer would wander forth
  and into conversations with me, during which symposium Pillie would make
  sarcastic allusions at my rat-traps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would claim it was an invention that seduced sick rats out of bed
  and into captivity; no matter what strength of character they had my trap
  would go out an&rsquo; get &rsquo;em. Such statements connived to aggravate
  acute incredulities in Pillie, complicated with controversy, and infectious
  to the hay-digger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d offer demonstration, also the laying on of wagers; the
  farmer would claim a foul, because he&rsquo;d never seen a rat on the ranch,
  and didn&rsquo;t like me to get the worst of a bet. I&rsquo;d state that
  absence made the trap work stronger, and if there wasn&rsquo;t any rats on
  hand it would breed &rsquo;em. I assured &rsquo;em, however, that rats was
  omnipresent, like mortgages.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d place some traps in the barn and go to sleep, with the
  money in the old man&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a nickel-plated scheme, all right &mdash; all I kicked on
  was havin&rsquo; my rest broke by gettin&rsquo; up at midnight to fill the
  traps with nice live rats out of the zinc tank in the wagon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had no trouble sellin&rsquo; all the eradicators we cared about
  on a small margin&mdash;say five hundred percent.; but that was too measly
  slow, so we put the patent on the market.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pillie would conspire with the farmer to take advantage of my ignorance
  and &ldquo;job&rdquo; me out of the patent; they&rsquo;d go in on halves.
  Patents brought from two hundred up, accordin&rsquo; to Pillie&rsquo;s ideas
  of what the man had &mdash;we let her go once for twenty dollars, as a mark
  of affection for a friend. We didn&rsquo;t care much what we got as long
  as we sold enough of &rsquo;em; there was patents for everybody.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Other drawbacks was the long drives after a deal, and our inability
  to work the same territory twice. We did good, legitimate business, though,
  gettin&rsquo; ahead slowly, till we sold a man whose brother, back at Fort
  Scott, had bought the patent a month before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It transpired that Pillie&rsquo;s Patent Rat Eradicator had a patentee
  in seventeen adjoining counties, and so, as I stated, I came West. The rat
  odor stuck to me, however. I was ratified so thorough I found it advisable
  to keep moving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day I recognized the sheriff of Fort Scott on the street, and
  as there was only one steamer leaving &rsquo;Frisco that afternoon I happened
  into Alaska. I&rsquo;d have preferred Honolulu. There&rsquo;s inspiring openings
  for high-class Christian graft among the Kanakas,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kink&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with the fire of rhapsody.</p>
  <p>He bore on his person the unmistakable marks of prosperity. They showed
  in the neatness of his open-necked flannel shirt and the splendor of his
  wide, wide Stetson, He displayed no wealth of fringed &ldquo;chaps&rdquo; and
  ornate spurs, as of old, for in the mud country hip-boots are ubiquitous;
  but his thighs were brown in corduroy, unfailing symptom of success.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You look like a winner,&rdquo; I remarked,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you heard about me? No? Well, say, I&rsquo;m a Swede
  for luck. It was this way: You know, stowaways ain&rsquo;t generally overburdened
  with financial resource, and when I was drug out of the hold of that ship
  they put me to work as cabin-boy, makin&rsquo; beds, Lord! me, thirty-five
  years young, jugglin&rsquo; sheets, when all I know along them lines is beddin&rsquo; down
  horses and the &lsquo;cowboy tuck.&rsquo; Ever try the &lsquo;cowboy tuck&rsquo;?
  You and your bunky lay flat on your backs; when you count three you lift
  your legs up high and lower &rsquo;em together, so the blanket folds underneath
  your feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, amongst my clienteel was a sad eyed little woman that I took
  a shine to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; says I one day, speakin&rsquo; through the
  environments of a nude feather pillow I had between my teeth, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
  only a workin&rsquo; girl, but in spite of the difference in our stations
  I want to say that if you&rsquo;re in trouble and need a friend just push
  that button once and you&rsquo;ll have two hundred-weight of gristle and
  cow-puncher at your service. Don&rsquo;t ring twice; that means ice water.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2000521h-images/image03.jpg" width="533" height="750"></p>
  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Say! she broke down and told me a pitiful story, how she&rsquo;d
  put all her money in a minin&rsquo; scheme of one Abramski. The thief claimed
  he had a lot of rich ground at Nome and had organized The Promised Land Placer
  and Prospecting Company, gettin&rsquo; her in on the ground floor, or through
  the basement window. At the last minute she decided to come along on her
  own account for fear she&rsquo;d be buncoed, and she&rsquo;d just begun to
  see indications that her aspirations was goin&rsquo; to be realized. I&rsquo;d
  have coppered her investment myself, because I was sure Abramski hadn&rsquo;t
  ever been as close to Alaska as he was at that minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was sure of it, too, when we landed, but I helped her pitch her
  tent and get settled. Then I took a pasear out into the hills prospecting,
  I was gone a week, and when I got back I was handicapped with two dollars
  in currency and the kind of an appetite you remember as a boy: one that makes
  brass filings taste like a breakfast food. I investigated the odors emanatin&rsquo; from
  the North Star restaurant till I decided to get rid of all this money, so
  as to start fresh and unhampered. I took a private box, and ordered a double
  sirloin, with fittings complete, ready for installation,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As I was diminishin&rsquo; my last visible means of support, under
  a pressure of about three pounds to the square mouthful, two Swedes come
  into the next box and ordered supper. From their talk I knew there was something
  big in the air. One of them was too excited to pronunciate; just gummed his
  language up and snowballed his partner with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gathered that they&rsquo;d been out prospecting and struck it rich,
  on located ground. They&rsquo;d looked up the records, and found the claim
  belonged to a Riley Murtagh, so now they were scourin&rsquo; the camp to
  hand him a mess of potash for his birthright, if you choose to look at it
  scripturally. Neither one knew him by sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I recalled the poet&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;There is a knot tied in
  the affairs of men which taken in time saves nine,&rsquo; and I thinks: &lsquo;Kink,
  you&rsquo;re a blamed idiot to go bustin&rsquo; over the hills for gold when
  kind Swedes bring it to you at meals.&rsquo; After I&rsquo;d got my two
  dollars loaded F. O. B. I stepped out and accosts the cashier. He was a little
  Irishman with pugnacities enrolled amongst his facial habiliments:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Those Laplanders in the next box have been castin&rsquo; aspersions
  at me, not knowing I could hear,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;In the interest of
  Ireland and the Marquis of Queensberry rules would you mind introducin&rsquo; me
  when they come out? My name is Riley Murtagh.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure not,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Tis a graand name. You take
  your choice, leavin&rsquo; me the little one.&rsquo; He began appropriatin&rsquo; munitions
  of war in the nature of cups and crockery. &lsquo;Put some in your pockets,&rsquo; says
  he; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll come handy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When they appeared he remarks, full of insultments:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hey, Riley Murtagh, it&rsquo;s the fine job for an Irishman I have,
  takin&rsquo; money away from Swedes.&rsquo; </p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is your name Murtagh?&rsquo; says one of &rsquo;em in the
  disembowled dialects of Sweden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; says the cashier; &lsquo;Riley Murtagh, me old
  friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then come with us,&rsquo; and out we went, leavin&rsquo; my
  sponsor burdened with bile and ballasted with dishes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After considerable elocution on weather and prospects one of &rsquo;em
  says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you got any mining claims?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure! lots of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where &rsquo;bouts?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I named over several creeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got anything on Glacier Creek you&rsquo;d like to sell?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aha,&rsquo; thinks I; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s on Glacier, eh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll sell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much do you want?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hundred.&rsquo; says I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d tear his pants gettin&rsquo; the money. After
  he&rsquo;d counted out ten banknotes I says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the balance: the other ninety-nine thousand
  one hundred?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What d&rsquo; you mean?&rsquo; They got excited, and their
  language began to sour on &rsquo;em again like clabber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, a hundred thousand dollars, of course,&rsquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They went up in the air so that I had to stand on a chair and hook &rsquo;em
  down with the poker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See here, gents,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t flim-flam
  Riley Murtagh. I was in the next box to you in the restaurant to-night, and
  heard all you said. Now, give me the full particulars and maybe I&rsquo;ll
  let you have a &ldquo;lay&rdquo; on the claim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were pretty decent when they saw it was all off, and took me
  into a back room. I came out of there a half-hour later, my knees weak as
  the fold in a napkin, and my optics protrudin&rsquo; like the Aunt-Annie&rsquo;s
  of a crab. It was big&mdash;so big it scared me and made me sick,
  sick at the spot I&rsquo;d squandered the two dollars on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wabbled down street and claimed sanctuary in Joe Deacon&rsquo;s
  place, leanin&rsquo; agin&rsquo; the bar pale and disfiggered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Joe,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;do you know a Riley Murtagh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure! that&rsquo;s him now,&rsquo; indicatin&rsquo; the sweeper,
  who was wettin&rsquo; down the sawdust an the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Murtagh,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I see a location notice
  of yours up on Glacier Creek the other day. I&rsquo;m a tenderfoot lookin&rsquo; for
  a place to prospect, What&rsquo;ll you take for your claim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thousan&rsquo; dollars.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must be injured to the head.&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
  give you five hundred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take you! Cash deal, of course?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, cert.,&rsquo; says I, fingerin&rsquo; a brass key, all
  I had in the world. &lsquo;Pay you this evenin&rsquo;.&nbsp;Just
  give me an option till dark.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Op&mdash;nothin&rsquo;.&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;money don&rsquo;t
  talk with me&mdash;it shouts. This sellin&rsquo; claims on conversation money
  don&rsquo;t tickle my funnybone. If nobody else takes her first she&rsquo;s
  yours.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Realizin&rsquo; the situation offered opportunities for reflection,
  I took a walk. First thing I knew I&rsquo;d landed at the little lady&rsquo;s
  tent. She was full of homesickness and joy at seein&rsquo; me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to fail,&rsquo; she says, her lip trembling,
  and little rainstorms comin&rsquo; into her vision. &lsquo;Mr. Abramski laughs
  at me. He says he&rsquo;s forgotten what he did with his mine; thinks he
  must have misplaced them&mdash;now he&rsquo;s going to buy a town lot and
  build a drygoods store. I&rsquo;ll never get my money back. I know it.&rsquo; She
  had cold feet right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;ll take you in partners with me,&rsquo; says
  I. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re in on all I&rsquo;ve got little pal.&rsquo; If she&rsquo;d
  a&rsquo; called me I&rsquo;d been forced to give her half my clothes. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to close a big deal to-night,&rsquo; says I, kind of sang fraudulently,
  and before leavin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d hot-aired her spirits up considerable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went back to Deacons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Joe, have you got a town lot?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sure! the one next door.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Let me borrow it this afternoon, will you? There&rsquo;s a
  Jew up street with a roll that pains him like a bad tooth. I won&rsquo;t
  hurt the lot.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to it.&rsquo; says he with animations. &lsquo;Bury him
  deep enough so I won&rsquo;t be bothered, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well. Abramski didn&rsquo;t remember me, and I had no difficulty
  sellin&rsquo; him the lot, also three thousand feet of Oregon Pine, for six
  hundred cash. We examined the records to see everything was straight. It
  was&mdash;&lsquo;Lot thirteen, block C, Front Street, Joseph O Donnell Deacon,
  locator&rsquo;&mdash;my name. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I paid Murtagh at three o&rsquo;clock, with a hundred to the good.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look a-here.&rsquo; said Deacon when I&rsquo;d explained the
  lot transaction. &lsquo;The Jew is legitimate prey, of course, and I don&rsquo;t
  object to lettin&rsquo; him own the ground for a while to help you, but I
  don&rsquo;t want him sawin&rsquo; up them boards.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Enough said!&rsquo; says I, so after dark I packs the lumber
  around back of Joe&rsquo;s saloon, and piles it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Next morning, before day, I&rsquo;m hittin&rsquo; the trail to Glacier
  Creek, incumbered with a bill of sale of The Honest Injun bench claim, likewise
  a pick, pan and shovel. As I pass the lady&rsquo;s tent I yells:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for our mine, partner. You&rsquo;ll find two twenties and
  a ten under the door &mdash; your share of the first cleanup.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever made a strike, kid? It&rsquo;s a wonderful sensation, dreamy
  and Edmond Danteslike. I&rsquo;d been so wrapped up in financiering the enterprise
  I hadn&rsquo;t rightly allowed my realizations to soak in, but as I got close
  to the claim my courage oozed out of me. I had to button my suspenders to
  my spirits to keep &rsquo;em up; I was the Heavy-Hearted Kid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fake,&rsquo; I kept sayin&rsquo;, prepared for
  a disappointment. &lsquo;Fortune ain&rsquo;t addicted to favorin&rsquo; the
  upright this way; some scoundrelly Swede&rsquo;ll get the goods while the
  honest miner works his hands to the bone tradin&rsquo; real estate, and grows
  moral callouses toting lumber.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I found the Swedes&rsquo; shaft all right, and give up hope. It wasn&rsquo;t
  five foot deep, and consisted of poverty-stricken red dirt, lookin&rsquo; like
  the ground blushed for me. Anybody that had placer mined a minute could tell
  that gold had more self-respect than to be incriminated in such a layout.
  I didn&rsquo;t need to pan it for a test.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Says I, &lsquo;By diggin&rsquo; two feet more off of one end it&rsquo;ll
  be big enough to bury &rsquo;em both. If I ain&rsquo;t a successful miner
  I&rsquo;m a terrible bit as a grave-digger.&rsquo; and I commenced the visible
  indications of a double Swede funeral.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was pickin&rsquo; away close to the bed-rock when something gleamed
  in the dirt. It&rsquo;s a sensation you don&rsquo;t get but once in a lifetime,
  and I knew I was a rich man before I had grabbed the dirt up. The colors
  lay in the clay like currants in a pudding. After I&rsquo;d jabbed the pick
  in my foot to see I wasn&rsquo;t somnambalatin&rsquo; I stood shoulder deep
  in that hole and swore, while the sweat dreened off of me in little freshets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My excitements had sort of coagulated when I got back to town, and
  I was ready for business when I see Abramski make a run at me with a weapon
  in his hand. He&rsquo;d found out about the lot, and ran amuck. It was a
  shiny little popgun he&rsquo;d borrowed, and bein&rsquo; a hammerless it
  didn&rsquo;t discommode his epiglottis like a real gun would when I rammed
  it down his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pinned him agin&rsquo; a door, mellering up his Adam&rsquo;s apple,
  and inserted my knee amongst his dyspepsia kind of casual. At the same time
  I explained I was Miss Walling&rsquo;s attorney in fact and fiction, and
  had took a change of venue with her investments, liquidatin&rsquo; her stock
  in The Promised Land Placer and Prospecting Company, investin&rsquo; it for
  a half interest in The Honest Injun bench claim instead. I said that if he
  wanted to make trouble I&rsquo;d get her permission to nail his hide up on
  the wall and let the sun dry it. Strange how domesticated he got; due in
  part, perhaps, to a diet of Smith and Wesson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the play came up,&rdquo; said Kink, &ldquo;The Honest
  Injun, as you see, is workin&rsquo; night and day, a livin&rsquo; example
  of merited success and the application of modern methods.&rdquo; He indicated
  the rows of laboring men beneath us.</p>
  <p>As he ceased speaking he consulted a huge silver watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to meet the little lady in town at three o&rsquo;clock;
  then we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to select a diamond the size of a mud-turtle.
  If you&rsquo;re here Saturday I&rsquo;d like you to stand up with me and
  give me away. First time I was ever married, and I get took with gooseflesh
  horrible every time I think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I squeezed his brown hand, and he added with a strain of anxiety;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; her the biography of this deal,
  nor anything about the old days on the range. She&rsquo;s from Boston, you
  know&mdash;back where my mother come from &mdash; and she thinks I&rsquo;m
  decent. Somehow I feel different about rat-trapping the American farmer and
  such things now. I ain&rsquo;t proud of myself, and if she ever found it
  out&mdash;&rdquo; His big face burned redly under its tan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s romantic, too; she&rsquo;s changed the name of The Honest
  Injun to The White Knight in my honor. Do you s&rsquo;pose anybody could
  have told her about my old habit of turning night into daytime? She&rsquo;s
  got a sign nailed over the bunk-house yonder, too, with this motto: <i>Sans
  p&egrave;re and sans reproche</i>, which I gather means without father or
  mother&mdash;you see, we&rsquo;re both orphans.&rdquo;</p>
