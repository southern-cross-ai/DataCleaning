  <p>I have often wondered if I should live to see the time when I could relate
  this story of an uncrowned King of France without wounding the susceptibilities
  of those whose families were involved in the various phases of the amazing
  drama. Details of the story came to me in a curious way and for years I was
  under a promise not to publish what had been revealed to me, and now that
  I am free to do it, I wonder if the story will be believed. There will be
  many, I know, who will doubt it, and I am ready to admit that some of the
  happenings are so strange and so fantastic that they seem to belong to the
  realm of fiction rather than that of history.</p>
  <p>But let me tell you how those happenings came to be known to me. On our
  last visit to Hungary, some time before the war, my husband and I spent a
  few days in Vienna in the house of a relative, an old uncle whose age was
  anything between eighty and a hundred; he was a dignified, courtly old man,
  who in his day had been an important personage in the entourage of the Emperor
  Francis Joseph. He had reached his anecdotage without impairing his memory
  and his sense of humour, and many were the stories both grave and gay with
  which he entertained us, stories of the brilliant and tragic court of pre-war
  Vienna, of persons and events, of the beautiful Elisabeth, of Napoleon and
  Eug&eacute;nie, of Bismarck and Palmerston, of young Disraeli as he was then,
  of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort. He had known them all, not only
  officially, but intimately.</p>
  <p>The subject, however, which engrossed him most and on which he could talk
  by the hour, was that of the Bourbon cause in France. Royalist to the soul,
  he had, even as a young student, been passionately interested in the mystery
  which, to this day, has surrounded the personality of the little Dauphin,
  son of the martyred King Louis XVI and the equally tragic Queen Marie Antoinette.
  My old uncle was one of those who were convinced that the child did not die
  in the Temple prison, as the revolutionary government had declared, but that
  he was rescued through an agency that has remained anonymous and conveyed
  to Austria, where he lived for years, and subsequently married and had a
  son. It was about this son that the old man loved to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The rightful King of France, my dear,&rdquo; he would declare emphatically, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
  no getting away from it. If he had been a different type of man, he would
  have been crowned at Rheims, and the whole destiny of Europe would have been
  mapped out differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I liked to draw him out, for the subject was an engrossing one. &ldquo;There
  is no more tragic figure in the history of the world,&rdquo; the old man
  would say in his cultured well-modulated voice, &ldquo;than that of the Dauphin,
  this child born and nurtured amidst the pageants and luxuries of Versailles,
  idolised and petted until the age of five, then torn from the embrace of
  his parents and his kindred, martyred and buffeted under the domination of
  rough and cruel warders, tools of the revolutionary government, who desired
  his death, connived at it, even though they did not actually murder him,
  asserted that the boy was dead, even though they knew perfectly well that
  he had been rescued from prison and taken to Austria. This last fact is too
  well known now to need emphasising: it has been admitted on almost every
  side. His own family knew it: his sister, the Duchesse d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me,
  confessed to her knowledge of it on her death-bed. The two Bourbon Kings,
  Louis XVIII and Charles X, were well aware of the fact that their nephew
  was alive&mdash;their nephew who was the only legitimate King of France;
  nevertheless, they usurped the throne which was rightfully his, and he was
  classed by his own kindred in the same category as the batch of adventurers
  who sprang up like mushrooms at the time, all claiming to be the Dauphin
  rescued from the Temple prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment, leaning back in his chair, his tired old eyes seeming
  to gaze into a dim and romantic past.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Emperor,&rdquo; he said after a few moments&rsquo; silence, &ldquo;had
  proof positive of the rescue. He knew, none better, that the only rightful
  King of France had lived for years the life of a recluse in the beautiful
  mountain district of Carinthia, that he subsequently married and had a son.
  To this son the Emperor Francis Joseph always referred as Louis XIX, King
  of France, until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until what?&rdquo; I insisted, for the old man had paused once more,
  his thin, firm lips tightly closed as if to guard a secret that had very
  nearly escaped them. Aware of my eagerness, flattered perhaps by the earnestness
  with which I listened to him, he took my hand and patted it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all written down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; I queried at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By Cardinal Beneventy. You remember him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I certainly did; as a child I had seen the cardinal, for he was a friend
  of all my family. He died in the middle &rsquo;eighties at a very advanced
  age.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He kept a diary. Made notes,&rdquo; the uncle went on; &ldquo;when
  he died, he bequeathed all his papers to me. You shall read them some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo; I begged.</p>
  <p>He shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not till after I&rsquo;ve gone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then you shall
  have them. But,&rdquo; he added solemnly, &ldquo;not unless you give me
  your word of honour that you will not publish their contents till twenty
  years after my death. I know what you fiction writers are&mdash;any game
  is good enough to fall to your gun. But there are men and women alive to-day,
  friends of mine, who were involved in the tragedy of King Louis XIX. They
  would resent it, if secrets were disclosed that were never meant for publicity.
  So you must give me your solemn promise, my dear, or His Eminence&rsquo;s
  diary shall be buried with me in my coffin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I gave the required promise. This was in 1912. The following year I received
  a registered packet from a firm of solicitors in Vienna. With it came a letter
  telling me that the old uncle was dead. The packet contained a bundle of
  papers carefully held together by a purple ribbon and half a dozen seals.
  There was also a letter, a few affectionate lines written to me by the old
  man less than a week before he died. Below his signature there was a postscript: &ldquo;If
  you break your promise, my ghost will haunt you, and ill-luck will dog your
  future career.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Funny old man, wasn&rsquo;t he? I kept my promise, of course, and kept it
  so rigidly that I never broke those seals until the twenty years had gone
  by. This was last year. The papers were as the old uncle had said, portions
  of a diary kept by His Eminence Cardinal Archbishop Beneventy, together with
  a few letters and some loose notes and memoranda set down by him at different
  times, but chiefly round about 1860. The first cursory glance revealed these
  to me as documents of extraordinary interest. A series of events had here
  been put on record by a man of unimpeachable integrity, and though I admit
  that the whole story sounds like romantic fiction, I don&rsquo;t see how
  it is possible to doubt its truth. His Eminence was not the type of man who
  would, for a moment, give credence to hearsay. He was Cardinal Archbishop
  of Esztergom and was at one time Papal Legate in Berlin, in Vienna and in
  Paris. Thus he was mixed up in all the political intrigues of the day: he
  had, as it were, his delicate fingers on the pulse of every actor who took
  part in the drama which had its beginning in the rescue from the Temple prison
  of the Dauphin, son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.</p>
  <p>The letters and the notes were yellow with age, the writing difficult to
  decipher. It took me days of patient sorting, of reading and re-reading and
  piecing together the fragments of the diary, before I was able to bring order
  into chaos. In his notes His Eminence speaks at great length of the rescue
  of the Dauphin by the mysterious stranger who brought him to the Benedictine
  monastery of Gm&uuml;nd in Carinthia where he lived and ended his days. His
  Eminence was only a child at the time, but the event made a very deep impression
  on his mind, an impression which he subsequently jotted down in his diary.
  It is from these fragments that I constructed the first part of my narrative.
  From the moment that he was old enough to understand what he had witnessed
  on that memorable occasion, the Cardinal Archbishop kept in close touch with
  Louis XVII, the son of the martyred King, and rightful King of France, and
  through his memoranda and certain letters I was able to trace various events
  in &ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s&rdquo; life: his marriage to the Spanish lady
  and the birth of his son. Other events are historically unimportant.</p>
  <p>It is what happened subsequently, after the death of Louis XVII, that is
  so amazingly interesting. I was able, through various entries in His Eminence&rsquo;s
  diary, to follow the drama step by step and I have taken the liberty of forming
  from these fragments a coherent story&mdash;the life story not of the rescued
  Dauphin himself, for that was uneventful, but that of his son, known to a
  narrow but intensely loyal circle of royalists as Louis XIX.</p>
  <p>I must here renew my profession of faith in the absolute truth of that story
  from beginning to end. The foundation of it rests on the testimony of a distinguished
  statesman, and of a cleric of the highest possible standing. All I have done
  was to alter some of the names and to add a few unimportant details. The
  diary and His Eminence&rsquo;s letters are, of course, in Hungarian, but
  Hungarian is a very lissom language and I had no difficulty in translating
  some of the extracts verbatim. Others I have used as the basis for the development
  of the story, because in several instances they are too full of irrelevant
  matter to bear quoting <i>in extenso</i>. Both in the diary and in the letters
  I found vivid pen portraits of the uncrowned King of France, of his half-brother,
  and of their Spanish mother, Madame la Princesse de Bourbon; and I need not
  insist on the identity of the distinguished statesman and diplomatist, thinly
  veiled under the pseudonym of Count Friesen.</p>
  <p>I wish I could also have retained some of the Cardinal&rsquo;s mordant comments
  on the people with whom he came in contact, mostly people of high repute
  in the political and artistic world, and some of august rank. But as in many
  instances, near relatives of such personages are still alive to-day, I have
  omitted all passages which might give offence.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Book1"></a>Book 1<br>
  Introductory</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>On a cold winter&rsquo;s morning in the year 1794 the Reverend Prior of
  the Dominican order at Gm&uuml;nd stood in the porch of the monastery church.
  The monks, fifty or sixty in number, were grouped in a semicircle around
  him. Their heads and shoulders under the black hoods were lost in the surrounding
  gloom; only their white robes caught a glimmer of the pale blue light of
  early dawn, as did also the knuckles of their toil-worn hands, clasped tightly
  in prayer.</p>
  <p>The church clock struck seven. Thin flakes of snow fell from a leaden sky.
  The wind came moaning and soughing over the snow-clad Styrian Alps and the
  pine trees on the foothills sighed and shivered and bent their stately crests
  to the blast. Above the sighing of the trees and the soughing of the wind
  rose the monotonous voices of the monks chanting their morning orisons. But
  all the while that they mumbled their prayers, those men in the long white
  robes, with hands reverently clasped, seemed to be straining their ears as
  if to catch a sound&mdash;the rumble of coach wheels perhaps&mdash;the jingle
  of harness, or the crack of a whip. They prayed, but, intent and eager, they
  also listened, and the Prior appeared to be listening too, more eagerly than
  they. It was very cold. The snow fell thicker and faster as slowly the grey
  dawn chased away the lingering gloom of night.</p>
  <p>And suddenly the Prior straightened his tall figure, the black hood fell
  back from his tonsured head. He craned his neck, listening more intently
  than before. The murmured prayers of the monks became a mere jumble of incoherent
  words, for they, too, were craning their necks and listening. Listening!
  From the remote distance there had come the scarcely perceptible sound of
  coach wheels and the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs on the hard, frozen road.</p>
  <p>The monks continued to mumble prayers, but they only did it with their lips.
  Mechanically. Inwardly every man was murmuring: &ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; and &ldquo;At
  last!&rdquo; Only the rigid discipline of self-effacement prevented these
  men from running out into the snow; from running out in order to lessen the
  distance and the time that separated them from that coach. But the Prior
  was still standing motionless in their midst. His tall, erect figure looked
  soldierly even beneath the voluminous, effeminate white robes. And not until
  the Prior gave the word would any of those men have dared to move. All they
  did was to crane their necks and to keep their eyes fixed on one spot in
  the landscape&mdash;the edge of the forest, where the winding road emerged
  out of the thicket.</p>
  <p>The rumble of coach wheels gradually became more distinct and all at once
  a heavy coach, drawn by four bays, came out of the thicket, travelling at
  a round pace up the road. It appeared and disappeared alternately in and
  out of clumps of fir trees and intervening cottages, with harness jingling
  and leather creaking, until, after a few more minutes of anxious waiting,
  it came rattling on the cobble-stones of the precincts and came to a halt
  in front of the church porch.</p>
  <p>The Prior alone advanced to meet it. A groom jumped down from the box seat
  and opened the carriage door. A tall man in a magnificent caped coat stepped
  out of the coach. He had a child in his arms. The Prior approached and took
  the child from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is tired now,&rdquo; the tall stranger said, &ldquo;but he has
  borne the journey remarkably well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Prior held the child in his arms, closely pressed to his breast; a limp,
  emaciated little body it was, wrapped in a thick rug; a pale face with sensitive
  mouth, drooping pathetically at the corners; closed eyes circled with purple,
  and fair, lank hair falling over the forehead. The Prior gazed on the sleeping
  child in a kind of ecstasy, whilst two tears coursed down his furrowed cheeks.
  The snow fell on his tonsured head and covered his shoulders. His lips moved
  in soundless prayer.</p>
  <p>The monks began to chant in unison the hymn which Simeon the Jew intoned
  close on eighteen hundred years ago:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The tall man gave a light laugh. He took off his hat and glanced down on
  the child with a look of wonderful tenderness. He drew the rug more closely
  round the small body which he had saved from torture and death at peril of
  his life. &ldquo;Poor little mole!&rdquo; he murmured in English. Then he
  turned and went back to the coach. He had entered it and given the order
  to start before the Prior or any of the monks seemed to be aware that he
  was actually going. It was only after the groom had slammed the carriage
  door to, and the horses with much snorting and pawing and jingling of harness
  started to go, that the Prior seemed to wake out of his trance-like state
  and to become alive to the duties of hospitality. But it was too late. The
  coachman had cracked his whip. Before the Prior had time to take a single
  step forward the coach was on the move, and he remained standing there with
  the child still in his arms, and the snow covering his head and shoulders,
  while the coach clattered away on the hard road and was soon lost to view.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The monks filed into the church preceded by the Prior carrying the child.</p>
  <p>The monks chanted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For mine eyes have seen thy salvation . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Prior went up the aisle and laid the sleeping child on the altar steps.</p>
  <p>Through a side door the students of the seminary came filing in. Little
  black-robed figures of varying ages and sizes: lean, overgrown lads of seventeen
  and eighteen, schoolboys with a look of perpetual hunger in their bright
  eyes, and little people hardly out of babyhood who were led by the hand by
  one of the fathers. They were the seminarists, future abb&eacute;s, bishops
  and perhaps cardinals&mdash;French, Austrians, Poles, Hungarians, Spaniards,
  but mostly French and Austrian&mdash;all boys of noble birth, for the seminary
  of Gm&uuml;nd catered exclusively for the younger sons of aristocratic houses
  who either had a religious vocation or were compelled to go into the Church
  for family reasons. Among the tiny tots was Louis Beneventy, the son of the
  great Hungarian general who fought for Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in the
  wars of succession, a bright-eyed, sturdy little fellow, future Cardinal
  Archbishop of Esztergom, Papal Legate and Primate of Hungary, but not yet
  five at this time.</p>
  <p>He remembered it all throughout his long life. The high altar a blaze of
  lights and groaning under a mass of white lilies and carnations from the
  rich hothouses of the monastery. The fathers, in their white robes, lined
  up in the elaborately carved mahogany pews, their shiny, tonsured pates reflecting
  the sanctuary lights. Then the tall, soldierly Prior at the foot of the altar
  steps, and the sleeping child wrapped in a rug stretched full length on the
  topmost step, his fair hair lying in a tousled mass about his forehead. The
  boys filed past the sanctuary rails while the organ loft murmured an exquisite
  voluntary of Palestrina. As they passed they made genuflexion, paying reverent
  homage partly to the altar of God, but partly, also, to the sleeping child&mdash;the
  King of France&mdash;Louis XVII by God&rsquo;s own grace.</p>
  <p>They filed two by two down the aisle to the corner of the church allotted
  to them. Here they knelt on the hard stone floor, and clasped their hands
  which were blue with cold. A solemn silence fell upon the congregation while
  the organ continued its scarce audible murmur of exquisite harmonies. There
  were no laymen or outsiders present, only the monks and the young seminarists:
  less than a hundred and fifty people all told. They were all on their knees
  now, hands clasped, heads bent, their lips moving in whispered prayer.</p>
  <p>Then all at once they rose to their feet. The organ gave forth a terrific
  crash, like a note of exultation, and the monks chanted the Te Deum &ldquo;We
  praise thee, O God . . . !&rdquo; The Prior remained standing at the foot
  of the altar steps, his arms outstretched, his eyes fixed upon the altar.
  Roused by the music, the child stirred, and raised himself on his elbow;
  he stared about him with eyes still heavy with sleep. What he saw was so
  different to what he had looked on of late&mdash;the dreary, dank prison-cell,
  the broken furniture, the dirt and the squalor, that no doubt the poor little
  mole thought that it was all a dream&mdash;a dream of those beautiful days
  of long ago, the luxury of Versailles, the pageants, the ceremonies when
  he, the royal Dauphin, was the centre of a crowd of sycophants and worshippers.
  Dazzled by the lights he closed his eyes again and turning over, went back
  to sleep.</p>
  <p>The King of France slept while a crowd of worshippers gave thanks to God
  that he had been saved from his enemies and from the hands of all that hated
  him and his kin.</p>
  <p>The picturesque scene remained impressed on the mind of Cardinal Beneventy
  from the age of five to his dying day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The years rolled on. Louis XVII, King of France, spent them in obscurity
  within the peaceful walls of the monastery at Gm&uuml;nd.</p>
  <p>For reasons which are not all to their credit, his relatives, including
  his only sister, chose to ignore his existence. In spite of proofs&mdash;some
  of them absolutely irrefutable&mdash;they professed disbelief in the boy&rsquo;s
  escape from prison, and openly accepted the revolutionary government&rsquo;s
  account of his death and burial. In point of fact, they classed the legitimate
  head of their house with the numerous impostors who at this time sprang up
  like mushrooms, all claiming to be the one and only Dauphin, son of Louis
  XVI and Marie Antoinette, escaped from the Temple prison. This was a deliberate
  as well as a monstrous act of injustice, for the Bourbon family knew well
  enough that the real Louis XVII was alive, but they put their attitude down
  to political necessity, and to the question of physical fitness. Undoubtedly
  the maltreatment which the young King had suffered as a child and the many
  horrors which he had witnessed did impair his health; those who knew him
  best went so far as to say that his mind was slightly affected. Be that as
  it may, Louis XVII himself made no move to establish his claim to the throne,
  even though he had a number of faithful adherents and many friends who worked
  ceaselessly on his behalf. His two uncles were successively crowned Kings
  of France as Louis XVIII and Charles X respectively. The first died childless;
  the eldest son of the other was also childless and the second was murdered.
  France for the best part of the nineteenth century was in a perpetual state
  of political turmoil. One revolution followed another; one form of government
  after another was set up and swept away. Charles X, the last of the Bourbon
  kings, was driven into exile. Still the family clung to its original policy
  and continued to ignore its legitimate head, in spite of the fact that his
  sister, the Duchesse d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, made a solemn declaration on
  her death-bed that she had known all along that her brother was alive. Perhaps
  it was impossible after the lapse of time to go back on that policy. Too
  many lies had been told in the past, too much injustice perpetrated. To confess
  to these would have brought about humiliation and discredit. And so Charles
  X, going into exile, abdicated in his own name and that of his eldest son
  in favour of his grandson, the Duc de Bordeaux, and he it was whom the royalist
  party, and what was left of the Bourbon family, acknowledged as their legitimate
  King Henri V by the grace of God, and secretly hoped and prayed for the death
  of the recluse of Gm&uuml;nd, their one and only rightful King.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Close on forty years had gone by since the Prior of the Dominican order
  at Gm&uuml;nd had laid the rightful King of France on the altar steps of
  the monastery church, while the monks sang a Te Deum to Almighty God. Forty
  years, during which many sanguine expectations led to bitter disappointment
  and many fervent hopes ended in frustration. True, there were some loyal
  hearts who never lost faith in the ultimate triumph of the cause, and men
  like Cardinal Beneventy continued to toil in that cause, for they believed
  in its righteousness as they did in that of their religion. He it was who,
  after his enthronement as Archbishop of Esztergom and Primate of Hungary,
  brought pressure to bear on the Emperor of Austria and on the Pope on behalf
  of the claims of Louis XVII, both from the political and the financial point
  of view.</p>
  <p>But time went on. Louis XVII passed from youth to middle age. When scarcely
  fifty he seemed an old, old man, delicate in health, dispirited and disillusioned:
  repudiated by his nearest kin, with an ever-diminishing number of adherents,
  overshadowed by impostors, he appeared content to live his life in solitude
  and peace, cared for by the monks. He had a serious illness about this time
  and was tended through it by a highly skilled nurse, the sister of one of
  the probationers. This lady who was destined to play such an important part
  in the subsequent history of the Bourbons was Spanish by birth. She was the
  widow of an English army officer named Bertrand and had one child, a baby
  boy, named Cyril, whom she brought with her to Gm&uuml;nd. She had learned
  the art of sick-nursing in England, and it was generally conceded that her
  skill and devotion saved the life of the illustrious patient on that occasion.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Cardinal Beneventy made note of all these events in his diary and among
  the entries relating to this particular period I found two which are extraordinarily
  interesting, because they reaffirm the truth and authenticity of the subsequent
  drama. In one of these notes he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady Bertrand has certainly an excellent influence over His Majesty&rsquo;s
  health and spirits. He seems much brighter: more cheerful. He sleeps better
  and enjoys the food which this devoted lady prepares for him with her own
  beautiful hands. I thank God for her advent amongst us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lady Bertrand! She was the widow of the English army officer. The sister
  of one of the probationers at Gm&uuml;nd! She was the trained nurse and devoted
  lady who came to take charge of the august sufferer and helped him to regain
  his health and spirits!</p>
  <p>The second entry is more remarkable still. It is dated nine months after
  the other. As a matter of fact, it is the keystone on which rests the whole
  edifice of this amazing chronicle. To all appearances it is the rough draft
  of what was evidently a circular letter which His Eminence addressed to various
  noblemen and gentlemen in France, Austria and Italy, who were affirmed Legitimists.
  It runs thus:</p>
  <p class="note">My dear Friend<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to apprise you that His Majesty Louis
 XVII by the grace of God King of France and of Navarre has this day contracted
 holy matrimony with Inez di Gama, widow of Sir Mark Bertrand, late Captain
 of Artillery in the English Army. I had the privilege of pronouncing God&rsquo;s
 blessing upon this union on Thursday last the 17th of May in the Priory Church
 of Gm&uuml;nd. His Majesty deigned to sign the register with his own hand.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am my dear friend<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brother
 in God<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis
 Beneventy, Archbishop.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gm&uuml;nd,
May 21st, 1833.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>For some years after this (he did not receive the Cardinal&rsquo;s hat till
  much later) Archbishop Beneventy&rsquo;s entries in his diary and records
  of events connected with the fortunes of Louis XVII are very scrappy. There
  are many references to the activities of the widowed Duchesse de Berry on
  behalf of her son the Duc de Bordeaux, whom one section of royalists looked
  upon as their only legitimate King, and His Eminence&rsquo;s mordant wit
  does not spare that adventurous and unfortunate lady; indeed, he seems to
  have derived a certain grim satisfaction from her repeated failures in her
  son&rsquo;s cause.</p>
  <p>Only here and there could I find a few notes concerning Louis XVII and his
  family&mdash;not many, but they are important.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A son has been born to His Majesty the King of France. God be praised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had the joy of holding Monsieur le Dauphin at the baptismal font.
  He has been given the names of Louis, Antoine, Marie, Charles, Aim&eacute;.
  Tears came to my eyes when they rested on the future King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty is in failing health. The devotion of the Queen Consort
  to him is marvellous to behold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Dauphin has been sick with measles and is making a slow
  recovery. Alas! he has inherited His Majesty&rsquo;s weak physique. Outwardly
  he is the image of his mother, but has nothing of her strength of character
  or of her ambition. Sometimes I wish he was more like his half-brother. Young
  Bertrand is a fascinating boy. He too is the very image of his mother, but
  in character as well as in looks. I am sorry for the child as His Majesty
  detests him, and even his mother seems to have little love for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This is the first reference I found in His Eminence&rsquo;s papers to this
  Cyril Bertrand, and I was left to guess who he was. Later on, however, the
  Cardinal speaks of him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Bertrand shows that he has English blood in his veins, for
  he is a very fine horse-man, and an athlete. He seems very fond of Monsieur
  le Dauphin, and does his best to brighten his life for him and to infuse
  in His Royal Highness a love of outdoor games. Monsieur le Dauphin, I am
  sorry to say, does not respond very readily to his half-brother&rsquo;s affection.
  He thinks him rough and rude. The boys are extraordinarily alike, both being
  so like their mother. But in character they are very different. Young Bertrand
  is only two years older than Monsieur but is much broader in build and much
  stronger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s health has become very precarious. He has had
  a serious h&aelig;morrhage. The Queen Consort has sent to Vienna for Professor
  Scanzoni, the greatest authority on lung trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Bertrand has developed a rare talent for painting. I do my
  best to encourage it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have suggested to His Majesty that young Bertrand be sent to Vienna
  to study painting under Piloty. But the Queen Consort opposed this strenuously,
  and His Majesty said some very bitter things about the lad. Strange how the
  unfortunate boy is disliked by the royal family. I must say I like him. He
  has some very lovable qualities, though I quite see that his English brusqueness
  and arrogance must often jar on His Majesty&rsquo;s sensitiveness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Professor Scanzoni has diagnosed lung trouble in His Majesty. He
  declares there is no immediate danger to that precious life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand has run away from home. No one knows what has become of
  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s illness has taken a turn for the worse. Special
  prayers are daily offered up for him in every Catholic church throughout
  France and Austria.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The final entry in this set of diaries is dated the 15th of February, 1849.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King is dead. Long live the King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis XVII was dead. To every diehard royalist, his son was now Louis XIX,
  King of France.</p>
  <p>Strangely enough after that momentous entry, there is a gap of eleven years
  during which His Eminence seems to have lost touch with the head of the royal
  family of Bourbon. At any rate, during those eleven years there is not a
  single reference to the King of France or to the Queen Mother in any of his
  notes, letters and diaries. There was nothing that gave me the slightest
  clue as to what happened after the death of Louis XVII, what became of his
  widow, or where His Majesty Louis XIX spent those intervening years. Of &ldquo;young
  Bertrand&rdquo; too, not another word.</p>
  <p>For many days I was left wondering whether my romantic story would have
  to come to an inconclusive end. Then suddenly, when I had almost despaired
  of disentangling the threads of this &ldquo;strange and eventful history,&rdquo; I
  came across the loose notes dated 1860, which gave me all the data I could
  possibly wish for.</p>
  <p>And that is how the rest of the story came to be written.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b><a name="Book2"></a>Book 2<br>
  How It All Began</b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>When next you are in Paris and happen to go one day up the Rue de Clichy&mdash;the
  street which is on the left of the large church of La Trinit&eacute;&mdash;you
  will come, just before you reach the Place, on a new block of buildings,
  which look strangely incongruous in this old quarter of the city. They are
  a portion of the improvements which &ldquo;le grand Pr&eacute;fet&rdquo;&mdash;as
  Baron Haussmann was universally called&mdash;designed for the transformation
  of the ancient, insalubrious town into a Ville Lumi&egrave;re&mdash;ultra-modern,
  elegant, exquisite, but no longer picturesque, save in those out-of-the-way
  parts, which are sedulously avoided by the sightseer.</p>
  <p>But in this year 1860 Haussmann had not yet tackled the problem of Montmartre,
  and where that block of new buildings now stands, there was a kind of Bohemian
  backwater beloved of artists and poets and of the under-dog. It was known
  as the Cit&eacute; du R&eacute;aumur, and consisted of a square courtyard
  hemmed in by low buildings, all in a more or less dilapidated condition.
  A tumbledown archway gave access to the square. Exactly facing the archway
  there was a row of studios with tall windows on which lay the grime of ages.
  On the inside of each window there was a dark curtain hanging from an invisible
  rod, all crooked and torn. These curtains looked as if nothing on earth would
  induce them to move either up or down, but as the film of dirt on the windows
  effectually shut out the interior of the studios from the gaze of the curious,
  this inefficacy of the curtains did not seem to matter very much. On the
  right of the courtyard, at right angles to the studios, there was a row of
  shops, in the windows of which there was a display of miscellaneous articles
  such as no one could possibly want, boots that didn&rsquo;t look as if they
  could fit any human foot, chignons that no self-respecting woman could possibly
  wear, pots of paste and bottles of liquid that defied usage, ribbons of colours
  that would never match or tone in with any gown. The stories above the shops
  were occupied respectively by a cobbler, a tailor, a dealer in scrap iron,
  a chimney sweep, and a barber. The dealer in scrap iron and the cobbler were
  guilty of the various noises peculiar to their trade; the tailor worked cross-legged
  on his table, in silence; the chimney sweep gave one loud cry of &ldquo;Ramoneur,&rdquo; when
  he emerged from his lair soon after dawn every morning; but no one ever seemed
  to enter the shops down below, the front doors of which were in the possession
  of frowsy ill-conditioned cats.</p>
  <p>Facing these shops, on the left of the courtyard, there was an eating-house
  which called itself, grandiloquently, Restaurant des Trois Rois. It had the
  reputation of serving once a week for dinner, the best cassoulette Normande
  to be had in Paris. On that one evening in the week the passer-by who had
  been curious enough to venture under the crumbling masonry of the archway
  would be rewarded for his temerity by seeing some of the greatest men in
  the world of art or literature squaring their elbows to large platesful of
  cassoulette which they consumed by the uncertain light of gas burners hissing
  behind round wire cages. That same venturesome passer-by would see at one
  of the tables by the window Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, painter of ethereal
  womanhood, burying his shaggy moustache at intervals in large tankards of
  beer, and opposite to him Horace Vernet in an old military coat, his chest
  covered with decorations, his white hair tousled, his chin unshaved, ogling
  the few women who from time to time dropped into the restaurant for a square
  meal. He would see Gustave Flaubert, whose recently published <i>Madame Bovary</i> had
  shocked the sensibilities of provincial France, discussing the respective
  merits of Saint-Emilien and Ch&acirc;teau-Yquem with Octave Feuillet, whose <i>Roman
  d&rsquo;un Jeune Homme Pauvre</i> had set the young ladies of two continents
  dreaming of romance.</p>
  <p>And in a corner at a small table, sitting by himself, Alexandre Dumas, the
  man with the fleshy lips and flat nose which betrayed his negroid origin;
  whilst in the far corner of the salle the young &rsquo;uns, very quiet, very
  modest, gazing in respectful silence on their elders who had already &ldquo;got
  there&rdquo;: Alphonse Daudet with the leonine head, the shabby velvet coat
  and delicate hands, and young Zola, saturnine, obstinate, with the shoulders
  of a butcher and a fist fashioned ready to smite.</p>
  <p>They came and went, ate and drank copiously, engrossed in the important
  business of feeding and enjoying life. They entered the crowded salle without
  taking notice of anyone else there, though they were all friends, comrades
  together; but in the Restaurant des Trois Rois nobody ever greeted anybody
  else: the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> just came in, sat down at their accustomed
  table and ordered their cassoulette without paying attention to any of the
  other customers. This was Bohemia <i>par excellence</i>. The motto above
  the entrance door might easily have been: &ldquo;Abandon your manners all
  ye who enter here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all wore shabby coats, and trousers immensely wide at the hips and
  tapering down into a tight band round the ankles, greasy black hats with
  pointed crowns and huge flat brims. They wore their hair long and their beards
  shaggy. They knew nothing about collars, and their ties were large and floppy.
  They talked with their mouths full and ate peas with their knife. They were
  rough, uncouth, quarrelsome, vulgar if you like, but they were giants, these
  men, giants whom the world did not ignore, and whom posterity will never
  forget.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien!</i> Cyril, <i>mon petit, &ccedil;a va</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man who spoke had just come in. Contrary to the usage of the place,
  everyone turned to look at him: he was small and malformed, with legs that
  were too short and hands that were too big. His eyes were small and his forehead
  narrow; his lips were thin and betrayed obstinacy allied with pride. He had
  entered the room with an air that commanded attention, crossed the salle
  over to a far corner where a young man who wore a very shabby velvet coat
  with shirt open wide at the neck, sat eating all alone. The newcomer hung
  up his hat and without more ceremony dragged a chair to the table and sat
  down opposite the young man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Comment &ccedil;a va?</i>&rdquo; he reiterated.</p>
  <p>The other shrugged and replied dolefully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Oh! pas tr&egrave;s bien, Monsieur Ingres, vous savez.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; the great little man retorted, &ldquo;I rather liked
  that portrait, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young man blushed furiously at this praise from the great master, but
  before he could frame a single word Jean Auguste Ingres had called the waiter
  and become absorbed in the study of the bill of fare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No cassoulette for me to-day, <i>mon vieux</i>,&rdquo; he said with
  a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Monsieur Ingres,&rdquo; the waiter protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said no cassoulette,&rdquo; the old artist reiterated. &ldquo;What
  else have you got?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And thereafter there followed a long discussion between the painter of &ldquo;La
  Source&rdquo; and the waiter as to what should take the place of the classical
  dish.</p>
  <p>The young man at the table was apparently forgotten. He waited in vain for
  another word from the master.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Outside it was raining hard. One of those storms of wind and rain for which
  springtime in Northern France is ingloriously famous. There had been a few
  warm days in March and the beginning of April had been lovely, but now this
  treacherous month was going out like a roaring lion, with bitter blasts and
  cold douches in his train, and the young buds on the chestnut trees which
  had taken a premature peep at the spring, shivered and shrivelled inside
  their gummy husks.</p>
  <p>Every time a fresh customer entered the restaurant a blast of cold air swept
  right through the room. But as the room was very much overheated and the
  atmosphere, consisting of the fumes of hot food, and of drink mixed with
  perspiring humanity, escaping gas and Camembert cheese, had become very rank,
  the blast of cold air had its merits.</p>
  <p>The dinner-hour was coming to an end, the little terrines stood mostly empty
  on the tables; empty wine bottles lay on their sides; the waiter brought
  steaming cups of coffee along, and went the round with an immense bottle
  of Armagnac covered with the dust and cobwebs of ages. Tongues were now loosened.
  The talk for the most part among these artists and workers was of one another.
  Abuse of each other&rsquo;s work, disparaging remarks, sarcastic comments
  marked the real admiration which all these great men had for one another.</p>
  <p>At the table by the window Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix was sipping his coffee,
  into which he had tipped a large glass of <i>Fine</i>. He nodded in the direction
  where old man Ingres sat eating <i>Tripes &agrave; la mode de Caen</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen Ingres&rsquo;s work this year?&rdquo; he remarked to
  Horace Vernet, his table companion, and went on with a shrug: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  think it is bad, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Horace Vernet gave a jump and nearly swallowed a piece of goose the wrong
  way. When he had done coughing and spluttering he exclaimed hotly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not bad? Not&mdash; Man alive, are you mad or drunk? Ingres is the
  greatest artist of our century&mdash;the greatest genius France can boast
  of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Delacroix did not endorse this opinion apparently, for he remarked, with
  a slightly contemptuous lift of his bushy eyebrows:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you such an admirer of his draughtsmanship as all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; Vernet replied with an equal measure of contempt: &ldquo;Ingres
  draws like a defective chimney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You like his colour then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Vernet shrugged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ingres&rsquo;s colour?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Ingres&rsquo;s
  colour always reminds me of a half-baked <i>brioche</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not going to say that his grouping&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of his grouping. His &lsquo;Apotheose de Hom&egrave;re&rsquo; reminds
  one of the inside of a pantechnicon van.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Delacroix could not help laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like his drawing, his colour or his composition,&rdquo; he
  said lightly, &ldquo;and yet you call him the greatest artist of the century.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; his friend retorted conclusively, &ldquo;he is. There
  is no getting away from that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he turned his full attention once more to his cassoulette.</p>
  <p>A moment or two later he looked over his shoulder and spoke to Alexandre
  Dumas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just imagine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that fellow Delacroix, whose
  women&rsquo;s legs always look like the hambones of an ill-fed pig, daring
  to pass remarks on old Ingres&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jealousy perhaps,&rdquo; quoth old Dumas, who had listened to the
  discussion with a twinkle in his beady black eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say,&rdquo; Vernet asserted. &ldquo;Now look at me. I haven&rsquo;t
  a spark of jealousy in my composition, and I am always ready to pay homage
  to the genius of my colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to have a talk with Gustave Flaubert, while Delacroix spoke in
  his turn across to old Dumas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor old Vernet,&rdquo; he remarked with a shrug. &ldquo;He thinks
  he can paint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dumas, that prince of malice, made no comment on that. He half rose from
  his seat and cast a searching glance across the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you looking for anyone?&rdquo; Delacroix asked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am looking for Ingres. I am longing to ask his opinion of your
  latest picture at the Salon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ingres rose from the table just then without as much as a nod to his young <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> and
  came across the room, with a cup of coffee in his hand. He came to a dead
  halt beside the table at which Delacroix was still sitting. He said without
  any preamble, and at the top of his voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Draughtsmanship, Delacroix, is the glory of art; to neglect it is
  to dishonour what we all worship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was so excited over this pronouncement of his, that his hand shook and
  he upset his coffee, not only over the table but all over Vernet&rsquo;s
  numerous decorations. But this did not worry him in the least. He put down
  his coffee cup, strode rapidly back across the room, picked up his hat and
  clapped it on his head and went out of the restaurant without a glance or
  a nod to anybody. Vernet was still engaged in wiping the coffee off his medals.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old camel,&rdquo; he shouted at the top of his voice, as Ingres disappeared
  through the swing doors.</p>
  <p>Such was the Restaurant des Trois Rois in the Cit&eacute; du R&eacute;aumur,
  in this memorable year 1860.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>The rain had turned to a regular hailstorm by now. Hailstones as big as
  peas were driven by the wind against the windows of the restaurant, making
  a noise like a volley of shrapnel. The wind howled down the chimney of the
  traditional iron stove that stood in the middle of the room.</p>
  <p>Every time a customer went out by the swing doors, he had to cling to his
  hat and bend his head to the blast. The air that came rushing into the overheated
  room made everyone shiver and curse.</p>
  <p>The young man in the far corner was sipping his coffee. The great man had
  not deigned to speak to him again. It was a way he had, had old Ingres, throwing
  a word of praise to a youngster as he would throw a bone to a dog, and leave
  it at that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>, Cyril, <i>mon petit, &ccedil;a va</i>?&rdquo; and
  then: &ldquo;I rather liked that portrait.&rdquo; That, from the great master,
  was more than he usually bestowed, and Cyril Bertrand, smoking his rank <i>caporal</i>,
  dwelt happily on the recollection of it all. A dog licking a succulent bone,
  so he thought of himself. His face lit up with a smile that was not altogether
  happy. Such a good-looking face it was! Pity he wore his hair so long and
  left his beard unkempt. But that was the fashion in Montmartre, a tidy head
  or a clipped beard would have been put down as intolerable coxcombry, and
  the consequences would have been almost disastrous to the wearer. Cyril&rsquo;s
  hair and beard were of a wonderful warm chestnut colour, seldom met with
  in Northerners. Yes, he was a good-looking boy, was Cyril Bertrand, the aspiring
  portrait painter, whose work the great Ingres had &ldquo;rather liked.&rdquo; Women
  had told him before now that he was good-looking. They liked his eyes, which
  were dark, and always seemed to express&mdash;so they said&mdash;much more
  than other men&rsquo;s words. They also liked his hands, which were singularly
  well shaped, and had a firm grip which sent pleasant thrills down one&rsquo;s
  spine. But no one knew much about him. Nothing really. As far as anyone knew
  he had started life as a boy in Ingres&rsquo;s studio, cleaning the great
  man&rsquo;s palette at close of day, and washing his brushes. Presently he
  took a studio in the Cit&eacute; du R&eacute;aumur and sent a picture to
  the Salon which was rejected. Nothing unusual in this. Greater men than he
  had begun their artistic career in this way. He earned a pittance by designing
  hats and dresses for one of the big emporiums on the Boulevard. Twice a year
  he sent a picture or two to the Salon, but these invariably came back to
  the studio, accompanied by the usual polite rejection slip: &ldquo;The Committee
  regrets . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But these recurrent failures did not affect Bertrand&rsquo;s good temper.
  He was a gay, cheerful sort of fellow, who apparently did not ask much of
  life, or perhaps was content to wait for an opportunity. His sunny disposition
  made him popular in this shiftless, thriftless crowd of Bohemians: pleasantly
  boisterous in his cups, he was always ready for any prank, and could always
  be found in the thick of a row with the <i>gendarmerie</i>. The models adored
  him. Mimi, the cheeky little blonde known as the pocket Venus, declared that
  though M&rsquo;sieu Bertrand was rather queer she would sooner sit to him
  than to any other artist. When he was in funds he would give you bonbons
  and flowers and a dinner at a restaurant, but when money was tight or work
  pressing&mdash;oh, la, la!&mdash;M&rsquo;sieu Bertrand was just a slave-driver.
  As Mimi said, you never knew how to take him, he had such funny fads and
  fancies, such as his love for the English. Why? Mimi couldn&rsquo;t say.
  Nor could anyone else. And lots of people and things he hated for no particular
  reason that one could see: the Bonapartes as a family, all the Bourbons and
  the whole of the royalist party; and if you happened to mention Spain or
  the Spaniards, why, he positively seemed to see red. But there, Mimi concluded
  and shrugged her pretty shoulders: &ldquo;<i>Que voulez-vous?</i> Those artists!
  Oh, la, la!&rdquo; She had had to do with them all her life. She was none
  the worse for their tantrums.</p>
  <p>Of late, so Mimi and the other models declared, Cyril Bertrand had been
  more than usually &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; It couldn&rsquo;t be that his head
  got turned through his recent success: that wasn&rsquo;t M&rsquo;sieu Bertrand&rsquo;s
  way. And yet, it was funny. That was just the word. Funny. Ever since he
  had painted that portrait of Mademoiselle Christophe, and got a really big
  price for it. Ever since he had been patted on the back by the art critics
  who had seen the picture and been told by them that he was a coming man,
  Cyril Bertrand had been different. For one thing he was much more silent
  than he used to be. Silent at times. At others boisterously gay, but with
  a gaiety that always appeared forced. And if anyone spoke to him while he
  was at work, or during a meal, he would start and stare, as if he had been
  suddenly wakened out of a dream.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>In a way Mimi and the others were right. Cyril Bertrand was a different
  man since he had painted the portrait of V&eacute;ronique Christophe. It
  had been such a wonderful episode in his life. At first, when he got the
  commission and before he started to work, he only looked on it as a stepping-stone
  to artistic success. If it was a success it was going to mean a great deal
  to him: his foot had barely reached as yet the lowest rung of the ladder
  of fame, but if he succeeded with that portrait, it would mean climbing,
  climbing, till one got to the top&mdash;or very nearly. That is all he thought
  about&mdash;at first.</p>
  <p>It had been a great piece of good luck in the first instance to get the
  commission. Albert Christophe, said to be the richest financier in Europe,
  took a fancy one day to a picture hung in the autumn exhibition of the Salon.
  The picture was signed Cyril Bertrand. Some little time after that Monsieur
  Christophe called on the artist at the studio in the Cit&eacute; du R&eacute;aumur
  and offered him a commission to paint the portrait of Mademoiselle V&eacute;ronique
  Christophe, his daughter. She could, he said, only give the artist three
  sittings, because most of her time was occupied with social engagements,
  but the sittings could be of long duration and Monsieur Christophe was prepared
  to pay 7,000 francs for the picture. Bertrand did not know at first whether
  he should laugh, or throw the visitor out of the room, for he thought that
  the offer was a cruel joke perpetrated on a poor youngster who had never
  seen so large a sum as 7,000 francs. But Monsieur Christophe did not look
  the sort of man who would perpetrate any kind of joke on anyone and within
  the next five minutes the offer had been accepted and the bargain concluded.</p>
  <p>The portrait was now finished. The great Ingres had seen it and said that
  he &ldquo;rather liked it.&rdquo; Monsieur Christophe had paid 7,000 francs
  for it and pronounced it to be an excellent likeness of his daughter. Most
  of the money and the letter that accompanied it were still in Cyril Bertrand&rsquo;s
  pocket-book, but at times he would wonder if the whole thing had been real,
  and not just a dream. A dream? Those three days early in March when spring
  was in the air and he had sat opposite the most beautiful woman on God&rsquo;s
  earth, and had striven with all his might to render on canvas some of her
  charm, her smile, her youth; something of her personality, which at times
  appeared almost spiritual and at others so very, very feminine and desirable&mdash;were
  those three days a dream? He had worked more strenuously during those days
  than he had ever worked before. She had only given him the three sittings,
  as promised, but she sat for four hours each time; four hours with only two
  very short intervals.</p>
  <p>The moment she came into his studio she seemed to him the most beautiful
  woman he had ever seen in all his life. She was little more than a child,
  and that was her greatest charm. The youthful look of a schoolgirl taking
  her first glance at life. An hour later he knew for a certainty that she
  was the one woman in the world he would ever love. A child and yet a woman.
  A woman who was still a child. They didn&rsquo;t talk much during the sittings;
  for one thing Bertrand was never alone with her; there was always the chaperon,
  without whom no girl in her position would have been allowed outside her
  own home. But he felt somehow that she understood his mood, and the feverishness
  with which he worked, so as to make the most of the blessed hours she was
  able to spare him: and she was a perfect sitter; immobile, but always alive.
  Her eyes were alive; her mouth; her exquisite hands. Her smile never became
  set; her glance never turned into a stare.</p>
  <p>When she needed a rest, she would jump down from the platform and come across
  to his easel; she would stand behind him, while he continued to work; rubbing
  in the background or touching up a bit of drapery. Her presence there, so
  close, intoxicated him. His hand shook, very slightly. But he never looked
  round at her. Heaven alone knew what would have happened if he did, for by
  this time he was madly in love. Fortunately for his self-respect and his
  self-control, the chaperon was always there.</p>
  <p>She seldom passed a remark on the picture and he never asked her if she
  liked it or not. She did say once, in a quaint, grown-up kind of way: &ldquo;You
  have the makings in you of a great artist, Monsieur Bertrand.&rdquo; She
  was standing behind him at the moment, sipping a glass of wine, for she had
  been sitting for nearly two hours straight on end and was very tired. He
  had a wild desire then to throw down his palette and his brushes, to put
  his arms round her, and to say: &ldquo;I have the makings of a great lover
  if you will trust yourself to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The madness of it all! V&eacute;ronique Christophe, the daughter of the
  multimillionaire, was as far removed from the penniless artist as were the
  stars. But despair in matters of the heart is not part of the equipment of
  youth&mdash;not when youth is in love. Cyril Bertrand began to dream dreams.
  He would send the picture to the Salon and it would be hung on the line;
  eulogistic articles on the rising young artist would then appear in newspapers
  and magazines. Lucrative commissions would come pouring in. After which those
  dreams took on more definite shape. A penniless youngster could not, of a
  certainty, aspire to the hand of the richest heiress in France, but a great
  artist could&mdash;a man like Ingres, for instance. Even an international
  financier, a multimillionaire, would be proud to have an Ingres or a Delacroix
  for a son-in-law. And so when the blessed hours were finally over, he took
  to work in real earnest. Heavens above, how he worked! He worked, so as,
  in time, to become such a great artist that when he entered a room or a restaurant,
  people would whisper to one another: &ldquo;Do you see that man who has just
  come in? That is Cyril Bertrand, the greatest artist of the age. He married
  V&eacute;ronique Christophe, the daughter of the financier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The madness of it all! The blessed, blessed hours spent in dreaming!</p>
  <p>He sent the picture to the Salon. It was hung on the line. Eulogistic articles
  about the coming young artist appeared in newspapers and magazines. And Cyril
  got himself a dress suit and took to accepting invitations to parties in
  the hope of seeing V&eacute;ronique Christophe, of having perhaps the great
  luck of a few words with her. He seldom had. She was always surrounded by
  a crowd of young men: smart men, rich men, men with high-sounding, aristocratic
  names. He went to the opera and sat at the back of the <i>parterre</i>, in
  a seat from which he had a good view of the box in which she sat. He tried
  to gather up courage to go up and pay his respects. Other men did. Monsieur
  Christophe&rsquo;s box was always full of callers, during the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>.
  But Cyril was shy: he felt that he was clumsy, uncouth, ignorant of the ways
  of the world. His ready-made dress suit didn&rsquo;t fit him: his tie was
  never straight. He hated his long hair and shaggy beard, but you couldn&rsquo;t
  have your hair cut or your beard trimmed if you valued your position in Montmartre.</p>
  <p>At last he made up his mind that, come what may, he would conquer his cowardice.
  They were giving Rossini&rsquo;s new work <i>Semiramis</i> at the opera.
  He booked his usual seat in the <i>parterre</i> and determined that he would
  go up to the Christophe box after the first act. He took great pains with
  his tie, and dragged an uncompromising comb through his hair. It was mid-July
  and very hot. Paris had been sweltering all day. Everyone was out of doors.
  The theatres were doing very little business, and this was the last night
  at the opera. But the Emperor and Empress had promised that they would be
  present, so fashionable Paris was sure to be there too. So it was. But the
  Christophes were not there. Nor were they at the last performance of <i>Atalie</i> at
  the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise the next evening, nor at the reception
  at the Italian Legation on the Thursday. Cyril put all his work aside and
  strolled out to the Bois at the fashionable hour. V&eacute;ronique was not
  there. He wandered up and down the Rue de Varennes, keeping the Christophe
  mansion in sight. She never came. At last, devoured with anxiety, maddened
  by disappointment, he threw diffidence to the wind and rang the bell of the
  grandiose house where she lived. He had been too deeply absorbed in his own
  thoughts and longing to notice that the mansion had a &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; air.
  A man in shirt sleeves and baize apron answered the bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur left for Baden-Baden a week ago,&rdquo; he informed the
  visitor, &ldquo;and Mademoiselle would join him there in a few days. She
  was staying with a relative till then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When will they be back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man shrugged. He didn&rsquo;t know. Monsieur and Mademoiselle were seldom
  in Paris before November. Sometimes for a few days on their way to their
  ch&acirc;teau for the shooting. But he really didn&rsquo;t know. He wished
  the visitor a very good afternoon.</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand turned away from the door, like a man who has just been denied
  access into Paradise. Baden-Baden! The one place in the world in which he
  would never willingly set foot. A few days ago he would have said that he
  would sooner die than go to Baden-Baden. His mother lived there, and his
  half-brother who was, to many, the King of France. No! nothing would have
  induced him&mdash;a week ago&mdash;to go to Baden-Baden.</p>
  <p>But he went.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Baden-Baden!! small city of beauty, of luxury and of dreams! of smart men
  and beautiful women!</p>
  <p>From all accounts it must have been one of the gayest and most fashionable
  summer resorts in Europe in those days. One spoke of Baden-Baden then as
  one does of Monte Carlo to-day. It was the precursor, the parent of Monte
  Carlo. Fortunes were lost and won in the gaming-rooms; thousands were spent
  in diamonds, dresses and furs. Snobs entertained royalty, and royalty&mdash;some,
  that is&mdash;accepted hospitality, and bestowed gracious smiles indiscriminately
  on duchesses, or millionaires, or professional beauties, so long as they
  knew how to dress and how to order a dinner.</p>
  <p>A perfect galaxy of elegancies, of notabilities, of financiers and snobs
  of all degrees thronged the beautiful parks for which the little city was
  renowned, and trod the velvety smoothness of its incomparable lawns. All&mdash;or
  nearly all&mdash;the greatest names in Europe were inscribed on the registers
  of the fashionable hotels. No less a name than that of Napol&eacute;on III,
  Empereur des Fran&ccedil;ais, figures on one of these, side by side with
  that of Eug&eacute;nie Imp&eacute;ratrice. Leopold I, Roi des Belges, honoured
  the Hotel Messmer with a lengthy stay year after year, as did also King William
  I of Prussia and Queen Augusta. Otto Prince of Bismarck spent several weeks
  every summer in Baden-Baden, so did that super-Parisian the Duc de Morny,
  and the eccentric Princesse Metternich, with her starchy lord.</p>
  <p>Then there were the notabilities in every branch of art, princes of finance
  and kings of industry: Ernest Meissonier invariably rented a studio for the
  season in the Werder Strasse, and Puvis de Chavannes could be seen daily
  drinking the waters at the Hot Springs, his sketch-book temporarily tucked
  away in his pocket. Henri Murger, already a very sick man, was polishing
  up the final chapters of his <i>Vie de Boh&egrave;me</i>, whilst Giacomo
  Meyerbeer capped his many eccentricities one summer by appearing on the promenade
  dressed in woman&rsquo;s clothes and riding a donkey. Mme Rachel, the great
  tragedienne, had her young granddaughter Sarah Bernhardt with her one summer,
  the year that Victorien Sardou wrote his <i>La Patrie</i> expressly for her,
  and there was a very lovely young Italian, by name Adelina Patti, who could
  be seen daily in the sylvan glades of Lichtenthal, dreaming, no doubt, of
  coming triumphs whilst gazing with good-humoured envy on the world-famous
  Jenny Lind.</p>
  <p>And all day long in forest walks and down the river bank it was perpetual
  chattering and laughter, as if a bevy of birds had been let loose on this
  enchanting corner of God&rsquo;s earth. At all hours of the day restaurants
  or caf&eacute;s were crowded, and there was loud popping of champagne corks
  and great rattle of crockery and silver; at all hours save for an hour or
  two in the afternoon, when, tired out with pleasure and drowsy with good
  cheer, men of the world and women of fashion, crowned heads and creative
  minds sought in their respective hotels or apartments the quietude of sleep.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Should you ever go to Baden-Baden these days, remember to take a short walk,
  following the avenue with the fashionable shops that are so very attractive
  until you come to the Leopold&rsquo;s Br&uuml;cke. Turning your back on the
  Kurhaus you can then cross the bridge and linger a few moments in order to
  look along the exquisite vista of the Lichtenthal All&eacute;e, with its
  fine old trees and rich <i>parterres</i> of flowers. If you then look to
  your right you will see, on the slope of the hill, a number of villas nestling
  coquettishly in bosquets of trees. Their names will bring to your mind pleasant
  memories of distinguished people who owned or rented them in the palmy days
  of Baden-Baden, before M. Louis Blanc&rsquo;s roulette wheels and baccarat
  tables were banished from Germany by Imperial government decree and found
  refuge and a warm welcome on the shores of the Mediterranean. You will note,
  among others, the Villa Augusta and the Villa Metternich, the Villa Rossini
  and, curiously enough, the Villa Montecarlo, which name must surely have
  been prophetic, as Monte Carlo had not yet been thought of those days.</p>
  <p>Tucked away more snugly than any of the others, the Villa Elisabeth is to-day
  hardly visible from the road: only its red-tiled roof still peeps discreetly
  above a grove of flowering chestnut trees, now grown to a great size. But
  in the middle of last century its terraces afforded gorgeous views over the
  river, the valley and the distant mountains. It was rented every year about
  this time by an elderly lady and her son, whose names were officially given
  as M. le Prince de Bourbon and Mme la Princesse, but it was an open secret
  that M. le Prince was none other than the rightful King of France, Louis
  XIX by the grace of God, grandson of the martyred King Louis XVI and of Marie
  Antoinette; own son, in fact, of that most tragic personage in all history,
  the Dauphin of France, otherwise Louis XVII. Enthusiastic royalists, not
  only in France but all over Europe, knew well enough that the Dauphin was
  rescued from the Temple prison, by an anonymous hero and brought to Austria;
  they also knew that he lived to middle age, that he married a lady of Spanish
  birth and had a son, who, in their eyes, and before God, became after his
  father&rsquo;s death, King of France by right divine.</p>
  <p>But in the fashionable French coterie which was always very conspicuous
  at Baden-Baden&mdash;they pronounced it Badenne-Badenne&mdash;these facts,
  true or false, gave no one a headache. Napol&eacute;on III was now firmly
  established on the Imperial throne; Paris under his reign and the sway of
  Eug&eacute;nie had become so brilliant that no one wished to be troubled
  with royalist pretenders and legitimist claims to the throne of France. There
  had been pretenders already whose claims were as fantastic as their personality
  was unkingly, so why worry about this one, who was probably as unauthentic
  as the others? But the society butterflies&mdash;male and female&mdash;were
  nevertheless sufficiently interested in Louis de Bourbon, as he was officially
  called, to make him welcome in their intimate circles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; remarked on one occasion the lovely Duchesse de Mouchy,
  who was known to be very exclusive in her choice of acquaintances. &ldquo;One
  cannot be so particular when one drinks purgative water at Badenne-Badenne
  as one is in Paris or in one&rsquo;s own ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And for the past four or five years Louis, King or no King, had been one
  of the most popular figures in the fashionable world of the chic watering-place.
  He was affable; he was well-bred and did not overdo the airs and graces of
  a reigning sovereign. The ladies liked him because he was young and good-looking&mdash;the
  image of his mother, so said the frequenters of that lady&rsquo;s salon&mdash;and
  had a certain grand air about him, distinctly reminiscent of the Bourbons.
  He had slender aristocratic hands, with which he liked to pinch a rosy cheek
  now and then or tweak a shell-like ear. He was not averse to hearing a naughty
  story whispered by a pretty woman&rsquo;s lips; knew how to turn a neat compliment
  to a lady, or silence with an epigram any ribald remark as to his royalist
  pretensions. The fact that he was obviously delicate in health only added
  to his attractions, for his face, innocent of moustache or fashionable whiskers,
  was of an interesting pallor, and he had the listless manner of a pampered
  invalid. He looked well on a horse, played a good game of whist and was quite
  a good dancer. In a word, M. le Prince de Bourbon, as some persisted in calling
  him, or His Majesty the King of France, as his intimates insisted, was undoubtedly
  a social success. He was seen on most days&mdash;when the weather was fine&mdash;in
  the Kurhaus or the Trinkhalle, and most evenings either at the opera or in
  the gaming-rooms, where he played high and lost with unruffled good humour,
  always impeccably dressed, always charming to the ladies and amiable with
  the men. &ldquo;Pity,&rdquo; the latter said, &ldquo;that owing to his pretensions
  he is not allowed to live in France. He would be a great asset in Parisian
  society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On the other hand, in his own salon in the Villa Elisabeth, Louis was King
  of France and nothing less. Perhaps this was due to his mother&rsquo;s influence.
  Under her eye he observed the most rigid etiquette. On occasions he held
  formal receptions, when he would receive his guests sitting on a high, gilt
  chair that looked very like a throne. The ladies filed past him and swept
  their curtsies right down to the floor, their voluminous crinolines billowing
  round them like balloons, while the bows which the men made before him were
  not unlike genuflexions and partook more of reverence than of simple courtesy.
  They wore their decorations and some came in full-dress uniform. It was considered
  a great privilege to kiss the royal hand.</p>
  <p>On those occasions Madame, the King&rsquo;s mother, sat beside him on a
  chair placed slightly lower than his. Though past middle age she was still
  a very handsome woman; a marvel of dignity combined with graciousness. She
  was that rare and beautiful thing, a fair Spaniard; her hair, which was turning
  grey, showed signs of having been a warm coppery gold. But her eyes were
  real Spanish eyes, dark, velvety, and must, in youth, have been very alluring.
  She spoke French with a marked Spanish accent.</p>
  <p>Who she was by birth nobody knew. In vain did patrician fingers turn over
  the pages of the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>; the worthy compiler of that social
  Bible was cryptic on the subject. &ldquo;Louis XVII,&rdquo; he says in Part
  I of the <i>Almanach</i>, &ldquo;King of France and of Navarre, only <i>s.</i> of
  Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette of Austria. <i>B.</i> 1785. <i>Suc.</i> his
  father 1793. <i>M.</i> 1833 Inez di Gama, widow of Sir Mark Bertrand, captain
  in the English army, and has one son.&rdquo; Of Inez di Gama and Sir Mark
  Bertrand, not another word, nor did any of Madame&rsquo;s friends know anything
  for certain.</p>
  <p>Friends? Madame la Princesse de Bourbon had very few friends. Only one person
  was ever admitted to what might be termed her intimacy. This was Count Friesen,
  who was chancellor at the Austrian Embassy in Paris under Prince Metternich.
  He often came over to Baden-Baden during the summer season, whenever he was
  on leave, and was a frequent visitor at the Villa Elisabeth.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>All this was so during the years previous to 1858. But since then things
  had been rather different. Madame la Princesse de Bourbon was installed,
  as usual, at the Villa Elisabeth, but Monsieur le Prince was hardly seen
  at all in Baden-Baden. It was generally understood that his health was none
  too good and that his physicians had advised a lengthy stay in Switzerland.
  Certain it is that in the past two years he had only paid very infrequent
  and short visits to his mother, and that while these visits lasted he hardly
  ever went out. He was no longer seen riding down the All&eacute;e, and the
  gaming-rooms at the Kurhaus saw him no more.</p>
  <p>The fashionable coterie, as soon as it began to assemble for the season,
  wagged its head, and predicted the early demise of the young man: &ldquo;These
  Bourbons have no stamina,&rdquo; they said, and quickly forgot him. The Bonapartes
  and anti-royalists, on the other hand, declared that Madame la Princesse
  de Bourbon was wallowing in Austrian intrigues for the restoration of her
  son to the throne of France, and that Louis himself spent most of his time
  now over the border in Alsace where, if the Emperor&rsquo;s police caught
  him, he would soon be sent to cool his heels, as Napoleon himself had done
  in his day, in the fortress of Ham.</p>
  <p>Be that as it may, one thing was certain and that was that Baden-Baden had
  seen nothing for the past two years of the uncrowned King of France. But
  another circumstance in the private life of Madame la Princesse de Bourbon
  was puzzling the gossip-mongers far more than the absence of her son, and
  soon sent their tongues wagging nineteen to the dozen. This was the fact
  that Madame, who was known to be so very exclusive as to whom she admitted
  to her intimacy and so particular as to the houses she frequented, had recently
  paid a visit to Baron Albert Christophe, the great international financier,
  in his sumptuous Villa Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. She went round his picture
  gallery, which was famous throughout Europe. She invited him to call at the
  Villa Elisabeth. Fair gossips said that she had done all this at the instance
  of Count Friesen, as Baron Christophe was of Austrian nationality. Friesen
  did not deny the soft impeachment. He only smiled and said something very
  charming to the fair questioner, as diplomats are in the habit of doing when
  the fair one is indiscreet.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The pretty chatterers in Baden-Baden had still more to gossip about when
  they perceived that a certain intimacy seemed thereafter to be established
  between the austere Princess and the Austrian financier, and when Madame
  was actually seen driving down the All&eacute;e, sitting beside Baron Christophe
  in his magnificent <i>cal&egrave;che</i>, tongues wagged more furiously than
  they had ever done before and there was no end to the tittle-tattle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the third time this week,&rdquo; one lady declared with
  a solemn nod of her pretty head in the direction where the <i>cal&egrave;che</i> was
  fast moving out of sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in the wind, you may be sure,&rdquo; commented
  another.</p>
  <p>And the smart Duchesse de Mouchy, who was always in the van of gossip-mongers,
  added with a twinkle of her fine eyes: &ldquo;Milliards in the wind, I should
  say, my dear. What can one talk to a financier about, except finance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ladies were horrified. They never talked finance. Not with anyone. Not
  even with Baron Christophe. Finance was not ladylike. Besides, what kind
  of financial talk could a Princesse de Bourbon carry on with that Austrian?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo; somebody queried vaguely.</p>
  <p>The Duchesse shrugged and looked as wise as any pretty woman can look. She
  said: &ldquo;Well! A milliard or so would be very useful to the Bourbons.
  They say that Louis would stand a very good chance just now, for the Emperor
  is not as popular as he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah! Christophe wouldn&rsquo;t be such a fool as to finance any wild-cat
  schemes of that sort,&rdquo; a stout, florid man asserted pompously; a man
  with jet-black hair carefully brought crescent-wise over his ears, and jet-black
  whiskers not altogether innocent of dye. He had once been something in the
  Ministry and was generally supposed to be in the know.</p>
  <p>The lively Duchesse de Mouchy, whose pretty mouth uttered more scandal in
  an hour than any journalist could invent in a week, gave the ex-Minister
  a playful prod with her tiny parasol.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will explain then, my friend,&rdquo; she said with a
  knowing twinkle in her bright eyes, &ldquo;why Madame la Princesse de Bourbon
  goes out driving thrice a week with Monsieur Albert Christophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you ask me&mdash;&rdquo; a young man began sententiously. He was
  correspondent to the Paris <i>Figaro</i>, and what gossip he did not know
  was certainly not worth knowing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would as soon ask you, Duprat,&rdquo; the Duchesse put in lightly, &ldquo;as
  anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Duprat bowed from the waist. He evidently took the remark as a compliment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I would remind you, ladies,&rdquo; he said, addressing the smart
  throng collectively, &ldquo;that old Christophe has a daughter whom he adores.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A very lovely daughter,&rdquo; the pompous Ministerial personage
  put in with a sigh: &ldquo;Just out of the schoolroom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the richest heiress in Europe,&rdquo; sighed another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all know that,&rdquo; came in a chorus which filled the air very
  much like the chattering of a swarm of parrakeets.</p>
  <p>Duprat was now the centre of attention. He knew such a lot, the young scandal-monger!
  So he resumed, complacently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You also know, dear ladies, that the old man is worth a couple of
  milliards, at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is why I ask you,&rdquo; the Duchesse concluded. &ldquo;Why
  this intimacy? Christophe is not likely to give his only child to a penniless,
  dispossessed prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I agree; but a milliard or two can easily turn a dispossessed prince
  into&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, measuring his effect. He had reason to be satisfied with the
  attention he commanded, for the chorus of pretty parrakeets was raised once
  again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into what?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Into a King of France,&rdquo; young Duprat said solemnly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; were
  some of the exclamations that greeted this amazing suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why impossible?&rdquo; retorted the correspondent of the <i>Figaro</i>. &ldquo;Thrones
  and kingdoms have been bought before now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the French Treasury has an enormous deficit this year,&rdquo; someone
  commented gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With the Empress so wildly extravagant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If old Christophe were to put down a milliard there&rsquo;s no knowing
  what the government might not do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo; a fair chatterer gasped, unable
  apparently to get any further; another gossip-monger, however, came to her
  rescue by putting in the unspoken words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that Albert Christophe wants to buy a royal husband
  and the crown of France for the lovely V&eacute;ronique?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is what it comes to,&rdquo; replied young Duprat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quelle horreur!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the pretty Duchesse: &ldquo;a
  Jewess!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Albert Christophe is not a Jew, Madame,&rdquo; a deep-toned, earnest
  voice broke in gravely. &ldquo;He is a financier. An Austrian. But not a
  Jew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Count Friesen, chancellor of Embassy at the Austrian Legation, who
  had spoken. He was greeted effusively. Room was made for him to join the
  smart assembly, for Hugo Friesen was very popular in Baden-Baden society;
  though no longer in his first youth he was extraordinarily good-looking and
  gave very smart dinner-parties at the Kursaal; dinner-parties at which if
  one was privileged to be invited, one met the &eacute;lite of cosmopolitan
  society.</p>
  <p>Baron Christophe&rsquo;s elegant equipage drove by once more just then at
  a rapid pace. Carriage &agrave; la Daumont. Silver harness. Sombre but very
  elegant livery. Two elderly people reclined on the cushions. Madame la Princesse
  de Bourbon, statuesque with a single note of colour in her black attire,
  a crimson flower tucked into her chignon under her hat, and a small thin
  man, with sharp features, shrewd dark eyes and thin compressed lips, the
  man who was said to control the destinies of Europe by the mere tightening
  and loosening of his own purse-strings: Albert Christophe, the multimillionaire.</p>
  <p>Somehow the whole turn-out was impressive; the beautiful equipage with its
  air of unostentatious wealth, and the two elderly occupants whose aims and
  destinies set the smart gossip-mongers talking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is the beautiful V&eacute;ronique now?&rdquo; one of these
  asked, turning to Count Friesen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Staying with a relation in Vienna, I understand. She will be here
  soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the future King of France?&rdquo; the Duchesse asked, not without
  a touch of malice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for ages,&rdquo; one of the ladies said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one has seen him for the past two seasons. They say he spends
  his time in France, doing secret propaganda for his cause. Isn&rsquo;t that
  so, Friesen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the diplomat assured the ladies that he didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has gone to court the lovely V&eacute;ronique.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or to make arrangements for his coronation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or both, since one will depend on the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; the Duchesse now exclaimed irritably. &ldquo;<i>La
   reine V&eacute;ronique.</i> The thought of it gives me goose-flesh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But there were a good many in the crowd who murmured, thinking of the beautiful
  daughter of the multimillionaire: &ldquo;She would make an exquisite Queen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hearing which, a man who had been sitting on the fringe of the crowd, all
  by himself, rose so abruptly that he knocked over his chair and drew from
  his nearest neighbour a black look and the epithet &ldquo;<i>maladroit</i>.&rdquo; He
  was a tall, well-built man, who would have been good-looking but for the
  shock of hair of a warm chestnut colour which hung over his forehead and
  seemed to have successfully defied comb and brush, and an unkempt moustache
  and beard which disfigured the lower part of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know who that was?&rdquo; someone in the crowd asked no one
  in particular.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have noticed him before. He always reminds me of someone. I can&rsquo;t
  think of whom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strange you should say that,&rdquo; Count Friesen put in thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
  had just the same feeling a moment ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is an unlicked cub at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As usual young Duprat, the correspondent of the <i>Figaro</i>, who always
  knew everything, was able to throw light on the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That unlicked cub,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be a world celebrity
  one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, my dear Monsieur Duprat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I forget his name,&rdquo; the young journalist went on, &ldquo;but
  his portrait of Mademoiselle Christophe in the Salon this spring was one
  of the pictures of the year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I remember the portrait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The work of a genius!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the society butterflies continued to flutter their wings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do try and remember his name, Duprat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you bring him to my reception to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pretty heads were turned to catch another glimpse of the &ldquo;unlicked
  cub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But he had already disappeared.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Men like Cardinal Beneventy saw the hand of God in the events that succeeded
  one another so rapidly on a certain balmy summer&rsquo;s night in Baden-Baden.
  But philosophers said that it was the Fates who did it all. The Fates, said
  they, always take a hand sooner or later in the game which we call life,
  and it is they who cut the thread and thrum of our destiny.</p>
  <p>Have it which way you like. Certain it is that when Cyril Bertrand, the
  rising young artist from Paris, came to Baden-Baden&mdash;the place which
  he detested above all others in the world&mdash;and hunted about for suitable
  lodgings, he finally found what he wanted on the top floor of a small pension
  up the hill. As it happened&mdash;shall we say as God willed, or as the Fates
  decreed?&mdash;a young <i>prima donna</i> named Aline Saint-Amand, who was
  then the star of a caf&eacute;-concert at Strasbourg, but had secured an
  engagement to sing in <i>Il Barbiere</i> at the Baden-Baden opera&mdash;had
  booked a suite of rooms on the first floor of that same pension. This, however,
  is by the way, as Mademoiselle Saint-Amand&rsquo;s engagement did not take
  effect till the end of July. The fact is only mentioned here because that
  simple coincidence happened to be the keystone of the amazing romance which
  Cardinal Beneventy&rsquo;s diary has revealed, and which, but for that coincidence,
  would perhaps have changed the destinies of half the civilised world.</p>
  <p>But let the events, as they occurred, speak for themselves. This was the
  beginning of July and Cyril Bertrand was installed on the top floor of the
  Pension Eglantine, and spent his time gazing on V&eacute;ronique by day,
  whenever he caught sight of her, and dreaming of her by night.</p>
  <p>She arrived in Baden-Baden a week or so after he did. After that he saw
  her almost daily riding or driving in the All&eacute;e. He saw her at the
  Kurhaus and at the opera. She was entirely unconscious of his presence. Never
  once did she glance in the direction where his ears were strained to hear
  the sound of her voice, or his eyes to catch the expression of her face.
  To him she was the one woman in the world, who meant for him more than life,
  more than all the treasures of this earth, more than fame. To gain her love
  he would have bartered his soul, as Doctor Faust had done to gain his Gretchen.
  But to her&mdash;to the beautiful, the wealthy, the popular daughter of the
  multimillionaire he was nothing. Nothing at all. An obscure artist who had
  painted her portrait and been paid for doing it. Nothing more. The three
  days of intimacy spent in the Montmartre studio were completely erased from
  the tablets of her memory.</p>
  <p>So much was obvious to the poor fool who worshipped her. Nevertheless he
  stayed on in this place which he detested; he stayed on, although the torture
  of seeing daily the woman he worshipped and never receiving as much as a
  glance of recognition from her, was sometimes more than he thought he could
  bear. He stayed on even after he had learned from the society parrakeets
  who sat about under the trees in Lichtenthal All&eacute;e, that his half-brother
  would soon be crowned King of France with the help of Baron Christophe&rsquo;s
  millions, and that his marriage with V&eacute;ronique was part of this bargain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will make a beautiful queen,&rdquo; the chatterers had remarked,
  little guessing that by their cackle they were tearing a man&rsquo;s heart
  out of his breast. If they had guessed they wouldn&rsquo;t have cared. Indeed
  it would have delighted them. Made them laugh at the presumptuous fool, &ldquo;the
  unlicked cub,&rdquo; who had dared to raise his eyes to the daughter of the
  millionaire.</p>
  <p>He detested the place because his mother lived in it&mdash;his mother who
  hated him&mdash;and his half-brother who looked down on him as a lout and
  a plebeian. How could he help detesting it when V&eacute;ronique remained
  so obviously unaware of his presence? He should have gone back to Paris and
  set to work to consolidate his position in the art world, to make a name
  for himself, and in hard work to forget his dreams and his folly. But he
  stayed on just because he could from time to time catch sight of her in the
  fashionable All&eacute;e, in the Kurhaus or at the opera, and because now
  and then he could hear the ripple of her laughter and the sound of her voice.
  What a fool he was! What a fool! He knew it and was breaking his heart over
  his folly. As a matter of fact he was just a man in love and he didn&rsquo;t
  know&mdash;and there was no one to tell him&mdash;that the folly of love
  is wiser than all the wisdom of the ages.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Those who knew V&eacute;ronique Christophe intimately always spoke of her
  as romantic. &ldquo;That lucky girl,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;She has everything,
  beauty, wealth, charm, and so romantic!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That is just what V&eacute;ronique was: romantic. In those 1860&rsquo;s
  romanticism was still held to be an agreeable quality in the young, and the
  young derived a great deal of happiness out of their romanticism. Especially
  the young women. They revelled in their dreams and in their illusions. The
  knights of their imaginings accomplished doughty deeds, and love was nothing
  if not undying. They looked on life as one long vista of halcyon hours spent
  in the arms of a faithful and ardent lover. Of course they experienced disappointments.
  Some of them at least. But they were happy while they dreamed, whereas nowadays
  there are no disappointments certainly, but only because there are no such
  things as dreams and no illusions.</p>
  <p>There was a time&mdash;it only lasted a very little while&mdash;when V&eacute;ronique
  Christophe dreamed of those three days in the Montmartre studio. She had
  liked the peace of that ill-furnished, rather airless room, with its smell
  of paint and of turpentine. Quaint sounds that were heard nowhere else in
  the city came wafted in through the badly fitting windows; the cry of the
  chimney sweep from over the way, of &ldquo;chairs to mend,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pots
  and pans.&rdquo; And she liked to watch the artist at work on her portrait,
  his eyes glowing with the excitement of creation, and that trick he had of
  brushing his unruly hair back from his forehead; she caught herself wondering
  what his face would be like without that ugly, ill-kempt beard and moustache
  which hid the expression of the mouth and the shape of the chin.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique often thought of the artist&mdash;afterwards&mdash;when
  she left Paris to stay with relations in Austria. It was quiet there and
  she had plenty of time to think and to dream. She had seen the portrait again
  when it was hung in the Salon and she had heard and read most of the favourable
  comments upon it, spoken by competent critics. Eventually it would find a
  place of honour in the Christophe mansion in the Rue de Varennes. But she
  had never set eyes on the artist again. Once or twice when there was talk
  of art and pictures at his dinner-table Baron Christophe had made some remark
  about &ldquo;the hirsute painter&rdquo; of his daughter&rsquo;s portrait,
  and then added: &ldquo;I wonder what has become of him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And V&eacute;ronique also had wondered.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>But that was in June. Presently July came along and V&eacute;ronique went
  on to Baden-Baden to join her father there for the summer season. She had
  never been in Baden-Baden before. The place with its gaiety and its beautiful
  surroundings delighted her. The social world, congregated in the fashionable
  watering-place, at once claimed the beautiful and wealthy heiress, and so
  the dreams of the Montmartre studio, its peaceful atmosphere, its odours
  and its quaint sounds, flew away on the intoxicating strains of the Kurhaus
  orchestra.</p>
  <p>At this time V&eacute;ronique knew nothing yet of her proposed marriage
  to the dispossessed King of France, although the question had already been
  mooted between her father, Madame la Princesse de Bourbon and Count Friesen,
  the Austrian diplomat. The latter was acting on behalf of his Emperor who
  desired the marriage because of the financial support it would give to the
  cause of the Bourbon restoration, a cause which he had very much at heart.
  Madame la Princesse, though fully conscious of the necessity of this financial
  support, still demurred. She dubbed the proposed marriage of her son and
  a commoner a misalliance, and found it repellent to her ambitious ideals.
  But she had not yet seen V&eacute;ronique Christophe.</p>
  <p>The first time she saw her was early in July at the opera. It was the first
  night of Meyerbeer&rsquo;s <i>Robert le Diable</i> and the audience was more
  than usually smart. The Emperor and Empress were present, so were Prince
  and Princess Bismarck and the King of Prussia. V&eacute;ronique was sitting
  in her father&rsquo;s box, and during the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i> she was
  surrounded by a bevy of young men, the cream of the <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> of
  Europe, all crowding round the beautiful and wealthy heiress as flies will
  round a honey-pot. Count Friesen pointed her out to Madame.</p>
  <p>Madame put up her glasses and took a long look at the girl. No doubt she
  was very, very beautiful; soft brown hair, eyes of a deep violet blue, lips
  that promised paradise in a kiss. All that was very well; Madame gave whole-hearted,
  if somewhat grudging admiration to this perfect product of God&rsquo;s creation;
  but the thought of a King of France, and that King her son, condescending
  to marry a Mademoiselle Christophe remained for her a revolting thought.
  A morganatic marriage, yes! Why not? With, of course, the Christophe milliards
  to back it. But the crown of Marie Antoinette? No! Unfortunately Count Friesen
  had repeatedly declared that nothing short of a crown for his daughter would
  induce Baron Christophe to part with his millions.</p>
  <p>Madame put down her glasses and turned to her friend. She put the same questions
  to him which she had asked dozens of times before:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Baron Christophe is still of the same mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He replied gravely: &ldquo;Still of the same mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the girl? What does she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She knows nothing yet. But as soon as she has had the honour of being
  presented to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think she will say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will conform to her father&rsquo;s wishes, of course. It is not
  given to every woman to wear a crown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame sighed and remarked dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I suppose she is ambitious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that V&eacute;ronique Christophe is ambitious
  in the way you mean, Madame; but she is very young and decidedly romantic,
  and the future, as her father has planned it, will appeal to her not so much
  for its glamour, as for its romance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame put up her opera glasses again and took another long look at V&eacute;ronique.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She certainly is very beautiful!&rdquo; was her dry comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will be the most beautiful queen,&rdquo; Count Friesen declared
  warmly, &ldquo;France ever had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But this tribute did not soothe the lady&rsquo;s ruffled nerves. She said
  testily: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t imagine former Kings of France, Friesen,
  lending themselves to such a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Former Kings of France, Madame,&rdquo; the Austrian remarked with
  a light shrug, &ldquo;did not live in a democratic age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hate democracy,&rdquo; Madame retorted in her harsh, throaty French. &ldquo;We
  owe it to our cousin Louis Philippe who thought to win popularity by going
  about Paris unattended and carrying an umbrella. The Parisians retaliated
  by dethroning him and sending him back to England, where no doubt he found
  his umbrella more useful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And abruptly she returned to the subject which obsessed her: &ldquo;It does
  seem awful, you know, Friesen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This marriage, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Necessity knows no laws, Madame,&rdquo; the diplomat rejoined tactfully, &ldquo;not
  even those which govern royal marriages. But why awful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King of France&mdash;and the daughter of Albert Christophe&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A man of unimpeachable integrity,&rdquo; Count Friesen said with
  emphasis, &ldquo;and of European reputation. And after all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused abruptly and pressed his lips together. The words that had nearly
  escaped him had best be left unsaid. What he had been on the point of saying
  was: &ldquo;After all, Louis XVII King of France married you, Inez di Gamba,
  a trained nurse, the daughter of a Nobody, the widow of an English army officer.
  Then why shouldn&rsquo;t Louis XIX marry V&eacute;ronique Christophe, the
  daughter of a multimillionaire.&rdquo; But Friesen was too much a diplomat
  to allow words to run away with discretion.</p>
  <p>Madame drew a quick, impatient sigh.</p>
  <p>She said: &ldquo;If only your Emperor would help us, or His Holiness, we
  would have no need to contemplate this marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My Emperor and His Holiness have troubles of their own,&rdquo; the
  Austrian rejoined gravely. &ldquo;Neither can afford to deplete his Treasury,
  while war is in the air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the claims of blood,&rdquo; Madame argued with vehemence, &ldquo;the
  blood of your great Empress Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and of your beautiful
  Marie Antoinette which flows in my son&rsquo;s veins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more the good-humoured ironical smile flitted round the mouth of the
  tactful diplomat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas, Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the claims of blood are not
  so powerful as those of the pocket. You have the Emperor&rsquo;s moral support.
  Everything that diplomacy can do will be done, you may be sure; and if the
  King of France does succeed in regaining his throne, diplomacy will do everything
  possible to keep him there. But initially you need money for your campaign&mdash;a
  great deal of money&mdash;and Albert Christophe is willing to provide that,
  under a condition which you must admit is not difficult to fulfil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But are you quite certain, Friesen,&rdquo; Madame insisted, &ldquo;that
  a morganatic marriage won&rsquo;t satisfy Baron Christophe? We could bestow
  an important title on the girl&mdash;a duchy . . . !&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Friesen shook his head emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will satisfy Christophe except the
  crown for his daughter. If he is assured of that . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The day that the marriage contract between Mademoiselle V&eacute;ronique
  and Louis XIX, King of France, is signed, Christophe will place half a milliard
  in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are certain of that, Friesen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As certain as that I am alive, Madame,&rdquo; the Austrian assured
  her. &ldquo;Please have no doubts about that. To begin with, Christophe
  is a man of his word, or he would never have reached the position which he
  holds. And then&mdash;well!&mdash;&rdquo; and the diplomat gave a knowing
  little smile&mdash;&ldquo;to see one&rsquo;s daughter crowned Queen of France
  is worth a few millions when one has so many.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame said nothing more for the moment. Her fine eyes roamed from Baron
  Christophe&rsquo;s box to the <i>parterre</i> down below. The call-bell was
  now tinkling. The audience was filing back into the house. Count Friesen
  rose to take his leave. Madame extended a gracious hand to him. He kissed
  it, bowing very low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When may I have the honour,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;of presenting
  Mademoiselle Christophe to your Highness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His tone was firm and insistent. Madame gave a little shudder, sighed and
  withdrew her hand. She was clever enough to know that in the end she must
  give in. Count Friesen was her friend, but he was above all the servant of
  his Emperor; and the Emperor of Austria desired this marriage because of
  the financial support it would give to the Bourbon cause, which he had at
  heart. &ldquo;Necessity knows no law,&rdquo; Friesen had said, and also: &ldquo;Former
  Kings of France did not live in a democratic age.&rdquo; He was quite right,
  and Madame la Princesse, who dreamed of the Tuileries for her son and his
  coronation at Rheims, could only bow to the inevitable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will receive Mademoiselle Christophe to-morrow,&rdquo; she said
  at last, &ldquo;but warn Christophe not to say anything to his daughter
  till I give him word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With this, Count Friesen appeared satisfied. He finally took his leave.
  Already the conductor had given the warning tap-tap on his desk. The orchestra
  struck the first note of the introduction to the next act. The Austrian felt
  that he had every reason to be satisfied with the result of his diplomacy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soon the wedding bells will be ringing,&rdquo; he said to himself,
  and rubbed his fine aristocratic hands contentedly together.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>The very next day Baron Christophe and his daughter V&eacute;ronique were
  duly invited to take tea at the Villa Elisabeth, and the Baron had the honour
  of himself presenting his daughter to Madame la Princesse de Bourbon. V&eacute;ronique
  had been thrilled at the idea of this presentation. Austrian by parentage,
  French by birth, and convent-bred, she was above all royalist by conviction.
  Like a true Legitimist she believed in the divine right of kings, and to
  her, there was in France but one legitimate King, the grandson of Louis XVI.</p>
  <p>The curtsy which she made to Madame la Princesse was deeper far than the
  one she had made before the Empress Eug&eacute;nie; this had been perfunctory.
  A command curtsy which could not be avoided if one wished to take one&rsquo;s
  proper place in the social world of Paris. But the one before the mother
  of the King of France was prompted by loyalty and an almost religious deference.
  Madame&rsquo;s austerity relaxed almost immediately. Already she had appreciated
  from afar V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s beauty and refinement, but in addition
  to that, the girl&rsquo;s vitality, her youth and her <i>joie de vivre</i> made
  a strong appeal to the mother of a sickly and effeminate son.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique Christophe radiated health and youth. &ldquo;She will put
  life into him,&rdquo; the mother thought, and was extraordinarily gracious
  on this first occasion. Count Friesen had indeed cause to be gratified with
  the turn events were taking. He watched with immense satisfaction the intimacy
  which developed between Madame la Princesse de Bourbon and V&eacute;ronique
  Christophe after that first interview. The middle-aged, embittered, disillusioned
  woman took kindly to the young girl on the threshold of life. V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s
  enthusiasm and loyalty were as balm to a soul who had seen so much time-serving,
  such improbity and selfishness, who had witnessed faithlessness and apostasy.
  Soon she found herself confiding in the girl and talking to her by the hour
  of her plans and projects for the future. All sorts of wonderful things would
  happen when Louis was King of France. There would be Versailles and the Tuileries
  and the coronation at Rheims. His Holiness the Pope, she said, would come
  over for that, and place the crown of St. Louis on the head of Louis XIX.
  The Emperor of Austria would come too. In fact, there would be a retinue
  of honour composed of all the crowned heads in Europe.</p>
  <p>And V&eacute;ronique listened to it all, spellbound. She was thrilled to
  her heart&rsquo;s core. Her romanticism had found satisfying food at last.</p>
  <p>But still Madame demurred. Baron Christophe said nothing of the marriage
  project to his daughter, and Madame did not speak the word, the final word
  that would clinch the bargain. Not until that day when she and V&eacute;ronique
  sat together on the terrace of the Villa Elisabeth, from which they had a
  beautiful view over the All&eacute;e as far as Lichtenthal, and they saw
  the Emperor and Empress drive by in their <i>cal&egrave;che</i>. Madame,
  as usual, had been talking of Versailles and the Tuileries.</p>
  <p>She said: &ldquo;One can give splendid receptions at Versailles. It is a
  wonderful place for entertaining. The grand staircase you know, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have never seen it, Madame,&rdquo; the girl remarked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; Madame admitted na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;but I
  can just imagine how beautiful it will be, with all the great ones of the
  earth crowding to pay their respects to my Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She dwelt lovingly on her idea that the Pope would come to Rheims specially
  in order to place the crown of St. Louis on her son&rsquo;s head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said with a shrug, &ldquo;Pius VII crowned
  that upstart Bonaparte&mdash;a miserable parvenu, not fit to lick my Louis&rsquo;s
  shoes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have been to Rheims,&rdquo; the girl murmured excitedly. &ldquo;It
  will be beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can almost hear the organ pealing the Te Deum; can&rsquo;t you,
  dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; V&eacute;ronique replied with a smile, &ldquo;and I can
  hear the people cheering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That is when it all happened. In the distance people could be heard cheering.
  The clamour could be distinctly perceived, coming at first from far away,
  and then growing louder and louder as it drew near. With the sound of the
  cheers came that of the rumble of wheels, the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs
  and the jingle of harness. V&eacute;ronique jumped to her feet and ran to
  the balustrade. From here she had a view over the long All&eacute;e from
  the Kurhaus, right away as far as the beautiful Lichtenthal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Napol&eacute;on and Eug&eacute;nie,&rdquo; she said to Madame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The common upstarts,&rdquo; Madame murmured contemptuously.</p>
  <p>A magnificent Deaumont came thundering by. From everywhere the crowd had
  collected to watch the Imperial progress. Most people cheered. A few waved
  hats or handkerchiefs. Napol&eacute;on III was at the height of his popularity
  and Eug&eacute;nie at the zenith of her beauty. She looked radiant sitting
  in her carriage, with her huge skirts of pale shot silk billowing around
  her, its numberless flounces and frills overflowing on to the knees of her
  Imperial lord. A tiny hat, all lace and flowers, sat on her huge fair chignon,
  and in her gloved hand she held a diminutive parasol which cast a soft pearly
  shadow over her face.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique sighed and turned back to Madame, whose glowering eyes
  and set lips betrayed the storm of bitterness and wrath which was raging
  inside her. Her trembling fingers were tearing away at her lace handkerchief.
  V&eacute;ronique came back to her and knelt down at her feet. She placed
  her soft, cool fingers over Madame&rsquo;s trembling hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be for long,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please God, it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Madame retorted vehemently.</p>
  <p>She was making an effort to control herself, to mask her agitation and to
  still the trembling of her hands. In a measure she succeeded. She held on
  to V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s hands, seeming to derive comfort from them. After
  a time she looked down at the young, eager face that was held up to her with
  so much sympathy and understanding; her dark, restless eyes seemed to be
  searching the girl&rsquo;s very soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I trust you, V&eacute;ronique?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; V&eacute;ronique protested gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, I have so few friends whom I can really trust,&rdquo; Madame
  went on; and there was a note of pathetic wistfulness in her harsh voice
  now. &ldquo;There is Friesen, of course. He has our cause almost as much
  at heart as I have. But one longs to talk to a woman sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You would make me very proud, Madame,&rdquo; the girl said softly, &ldquo;if
  you would confide in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Madame did not begin to speak at once. She sat still for quite a long
  while, no longer looking down on the girl at her feet, but gazing out into
  vacancy. After a time she spoke, but more to herself than to the girl. Her
  lips moved but her thoughts seemed far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At no time since my dear husband&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has
  the political world been so favourable for us. The Bonapartes are fast losing
  their popularity at home. They are hated everywhere abroad. The English never
  could bear them. The King of Prussia is only waiting for an opportunity to
  declare war against them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and suddenly looked down again on V&eacute;ronique and once more
  that searching look came into her restless eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only we had the money . . .&rdquo; she murmured and drew a deep,
  long sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure my father&mdash;&rdquo; V&eacute;ronique began impulsively.</p>
  <p>But Madame didn&rsquo;t let her go on. She continued talking, as if to herself,
  or to some imaginary person on whom the eyes of her turbulent soul were fixed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can succeed. . . . We must. . . .&rdquo; She reiterated more than
  once. &ldquo;The whole army would rally round the flag. The old fleur-de-lys
  which has led France to glory. The garrison of Strasbourg is ours to a man.
  What we want is money&mdash;money&mdash;to carry on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With her clenched hand she pointed in the direction where the magnificent <i>cal&egrave;che</i>,
  the beautiful Empress and the cheering were already lost to view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that Bonaparte,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how he schemed
  and planned to get to the throne. He schemed and planned and succeeded in
  the end&mdash;and what is he?&mdash;just a beggarly upstart sitting on the
  mightiest throne in Europe&mdash;the throne that rightly belongs to my son&mdash;Louis
  XIX, King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whenever Madame la Princesse got herself strung up with excitement, her
  voice grew almost shrill and the guttural tones of her Spanish accent became
  more harsh. V&eacute;ronique squatting on her heels followed her every movement,
  as she jumped to her feet and stalked up and down the terrace, no longer
  trying to master her agitation. The girl herself was no less excited. The
  whole atmosphere evoked by Madame&rsquo;s passionate tirade sent the young
  blood surging up to her cheeks. Her active brain was already at work, wondering
  how she could help, what her father would do when she begged and begged.
  Up to now she had said nothing, she had kept her enthusiasm for the cause
  of the Bourbons, as well as her friendship for Madame carefully hidden in
  her heart. But if things were coming to a head then father must help&mdash;and
  would help, she was sure, if he knew just how she felt about it. There was
  nothing father wouldn&rsquo;t do, if she only begged earnestly enough.</p>
  <p>Louis XIX! King of France! Louis the Well-Beloved!! With folded hands and
  with eyes fixed above, V&eacute;ronique uttered the most ardent prayer she
  had ever sent up to God!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord of Lords! King of Kings! Give success to the cause of Thy anointed!&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>5</b></h3>
  <p>After that day Madame no longer withheld her consent. She gave the word
  and Baron Christophe told his daughter of the project he had formed for her.
  Marriage with Louis de Bourbon; her marriage portion, half a milliard, with
  more to follow, wherewith to finance the royalist cause; and finally the
  coronation at Rheims, His Holiness placing the crown of St. Louis on the
  head of the legitimate King of France and the crown of Marie Antoinette on
  that of V&eacute;ronique herself.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique was tongue-tied at this news. Well she might be! Queen
  of France! She was to be Queen of France! This was surely the most stupendous,
  the most unbelievable thing that could happen to any woman. She closed her
  eyes trying to visualise what it all meant. In thought she heard Madame la
  Princesse reiterating all the wonderful things that would happen when Louis
  was King of France. She tried to visualise Versailles and the Tuileries;
  the pageants, the receptions; the grand staircase; the ladies with their
  diamond tiaras, the distinguished men in court dress and uniform. She tried
  to visualise the wonderful cathedral where former Kings of France had been
  crowned: the high altar, a mass of flowers, the tall candles, the gorgeous
  copes, the incense, and His Holiness the Pope holding the crown of Marie
  Antoinette in his hands.</p>
  <p>Oh, it couldn&rsquo;t be real! It couldn&rsquo;t! It was all a dream! Father
  was mocking her! She would presently wake and realise that it was all a dream.</p>
  <p>Father took hold of her hands and drew her to him on his knee. She opened
  her eyes and looked into his face. Right into his eyes. They had a glow in
  them. A glow she had never seen in them before. Love, excitement, triumph,
  they were all there in those kind, deep-set eyes, which had never held a
  harsh look for her, nor one of deceit. He murmured quite softly: &ldquo;My
  little V&eacute;ronique! Queen of France!&rdquo; Her eyes pleaded: &ldquo;Is
  it really true?&rdquo; And he nodded in confirmation. After that she felt
  inclined to cry. She was very young and her nerves had received a rude shock.
  She laid her head on father&rsquo;s shoulder and cried, and cried, and laughed,
  while his kindly hand&mdash;the hand that had forged the millions which would
  buy a crown for his daughter&mdash;gently stroked the young, dearly loved
  head.</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>And for Cyril Bertrand there came after that the same sort of miserable
  days which he had already experienced in Paris. He haunted the All&eacute;e
  and the Kurhaus, he walked out to Lichtenthal, he hung about outside the
  Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, but never a sight of V&eacute;ronique
  did he have. She was not to be seen in any fashionable restaurant; she was
  not in church on Sunday; she was not at the opera. It was like those dark
  days in Paris, only much, much worse, because wherever he went, wherever
  he heard chattering and gossip, her name was always mentioned, and always
  in close association with that of his half-brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear, I know it for a positive fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The most amazing thing that has ever happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The engagement will be officially announced before the end of the
  season.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;V&eacute;ronique Christophe and the legitimate King of France!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Queen V&eacute;ronique!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the proud ladies of the old r&eacute;gime would then shudder and murmur: &ldquo;<i>Quelle
   horreur!</i>&rdquo; whilst those who were more philosophical or perhaps
   more practical&mdash;especially the men&mdash;would shrug shoulders and
   declare: &ldquo;Better than these Bonapartes at any rate! An Austrian financier
   and a Corsican attorney! . . . Where&rsquo;s the difference? And here at
   any rate there will be a milliard to keep the crown well gilded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand could not close his ears to all that gossip. He would have
  liked to. He would have wished that it had all been mere tittle-tattle, without
  a word of truth in it. His adorable, adored V&eacute;ronique, and that backboneless
  weakling his half-brother. Crown or no crown, it was an outrage! Louis was
  just as capable of loving as he was of performing acrobatic feats. His V&eacute;ronique
  indeed! She was Cyril&rsquo;s V&eacute;ronique! His, by all the ties which
  his worship of her had forged around her exquisite personality. He conceived
  the mad notion of abducting her, forcing his way into the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se,
  of throwing his arms round her and carrying her away; away to some desert
  island where there could be no talk of this monstrous marriage, which he,
  the lover, felt could only mean lifelong unhappiness for her.</p>
  <p>But it was no use forcing his way into the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se,
  for she was no longer there. Baron Christophe, after he had broken the news
  to his daughter, had sent her away to her relations in Austria. He thought
  it best that she should be away for a short while from Baden-Baden, where
  her ears might at times be offended by the tittle-tattle of her friends,
  whether good-natured or otherwise. Also he knew from experience that Madame
  la Princesse was both capricious and queer-tempered. Her manner to V&eacute;ronique,
  after the engagement had been finally decided on, was anything but cordial,
  far different to what it had been at first. On the whole it was best that
  the girl should go away for a time, and presently an official meeting could
  be arranged between her and her fianc&eacute;! Louis had been kept away by
  his mother all this time. Madame was no more sure of him than Christophe
  was of her. Both thought it best that the young people should only meet when
  their future had been irrevocably sealed.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>It was after V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s departure that Madame summoned her
  son to Baden-Baden. He came, because to humour his mother in small things
  was to take the line of least resistance, but he also came for another cogent
  reason which Madame did not for the moment guess.</p>
  <p>The reason was the young French singer, Aline Saint-Amand, who had secured
  an engagement at the Baden-Baden opera, and who was making her d&eacute;but
  there in Rossini&rsquo;s <i>Il Barbiere</i> on a certain balmy evening at
  the end of July. The occasion was a brilliant one. The smart little theatre
  was packed to overflowing. Rossini himself, the composer <i>&agrave; la mode</i>,
  had lauded the young d&eacute;butante to the skies, declaring that she was
  the finest interpreter of Rosina he had ever heard. She certainly was the
  prettiest, a fact which may have influenced the old <i>maestro&rsquo;s</i> estimate
  of her performance. But the publicity which this estimate gave to Mademoiselle
  Saint-Amand had certainly worked wonders for her. For the past week not a
  seat could be had in the theatre for love or money. The Emperor Napol&eacute;on
  and the Empress had already left Baden-Baden, but there was still a large
  crowd of rich and distinguished people left, and they mustered that night
  at the opera in full force. Prince Bismarck was there with his wife. Madame
  la Princesse de Bourbon was in a box, and so was Princess Metternich and
  the Duchesse de Mouchy. Baron Christophe was with friends, and there was
  a large contingent present from the musical and artistic coterie.</p>
  <p>In one of the proscenium boxes Rossini sat with a group of sycophants round
  him, all prepared to split their white gloves in an outburst of vociferous
  applause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Bravissima, Alina mia!</i>&rdquo; the old composer shouted at
  the top of his voice at the end of the big aria in the second act, and leaning
  half out of the box he threw an immense bunch of flowers to the young <i>prima
  donna</i>.</p>
  <p>Meyerbeer shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;<i>Regardez donc ce vieux maniaque</i>,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;<i>Il est gaga, ma parole!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will spoil her for us,&rdquo; Behrer, the manager of the theatre,
  declared, haunted by the knowledge that an outstanding success on the part
  of a d&eacute;butante invariably meant a large increase in salary.</p>
  <p>When at the fall of the curtain Mademoiselle Saint-Amand came forward to
  acknowledge a further ovation from the audience, a shower of bouquets fell
  at her feet, and among these there was one entirely composed of white lilies.
  It had been hurled from the left proscenium box by Louis de Bourbon, otherwise
  Louis XIX, King of France. Seeing which, Madame, his mother, sitting in her
  box, clutched her fan so tightly that the mother-o&rsquo;-pearl sticks broke
  in her hand.</p>
  <p>A kindly voice in the rear of the box said with good-natured raillery: &ldquo;What
  a pity! It was such a pretty fan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Friesen was paying his respects to Madame during the <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i>.
  He had watched her growing irritability with an ironical smile on his good-looking
  face. The smashing of the inoffensive fan, the tap-tap of an impatient foot
  showed that the lady&rsquo;s nerves were being put to a severe strain.</p>
  <p>She pointed with her broken fan to the proscenium box, where the uncrowned
  King of France had risen from his seat, after he had split his gloves with
  the violence of his applause. The audience was filing out and he with them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is going to the Saint-Amand&rsquo;s loge,&rdquo; Madame said acidly.</p>
  <p>Friesen shrugged, as much as to say: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The King of France&mdash;!&rdquo; Madame murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kings of France, Madame,&rdquo; the Austrian put in with his knowing
  little smile, &ldquo;have always been like other men, rakes at heart. Great
  kings like Louis XIV&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But not in public, Friesen,&rdquo; Madame protested. &ldquo;Not before
  the public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the diplomat retorted dryly, &ldquo;I suppose the correct
  procedure in those days was for His Majesty to intimate to the lady of his
  choice that he desired her company in his own <i>cabinet particulier</i>.
  The lady came, but I don&rsquo;t know that it was any more dignified than
  the present democratic way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me of democracy, Friesen,&rdquo; Madame said
  irritably, &ldquo;you know I hate it. Louis had no business to be here at
  all. He made some excuse for not coming into my box. But Heaven only knows
  who is shouldering him now in the crowds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The diplomat made no reply to this. Perhaps he thought that further talk
  on the subject would, anyhow, be useless. It might even further embitter
  Madame&rsquo;s ill-temper. So after a few moments&rsquo; pause he talked
  of other things, and presently the call-bell sounded, and the audience filed
  back into the theatre. Madame&rsquo;s fine eyes roamed enquiringly over the
  crowd of fashionably dressed young men. His Majesty the King of France was
  not among them. However, before she could utter the sharp words which obviously
  hovered on her lips, the conductor had given the warning tap-tap on his desk,
  and the orchestra struck the first note of the introduction to the third
  act. The Austrian rose to go.</p>
  <p>Madame said: &ldquo;Let me see you again presently, Friesen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At your service, Madame,&rdquo; he rejoined, and kissed the hand
  which was graciously extended to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the theatre then,&rdquo; Madame concluded, &ldquo;at the villa.
  I want to tell you just what we have planned.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>But when Count Friesen presented himself at the Villa Elisabeth after the
  theatre, he found Madame still in a high state of irritation. As soon as
  he came into the room and before she even gave him her hand to kiss, she
  said testily: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come in yet, Friesen. That Saint-Amand
  girl has bewitched him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Austrian, however, only shrugged, as much as to say: &ldquo;What if
  she has?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which he asked: &ldquo;Where did His Majesty first meet her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wily diplomat knew that Madame&rsquo;s nerves could always be soothed
  by a reference to Louis de Bourbon as &ldquo;His Majesty.&rdquo; But this
  time she refused to be mollified and replied curtly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At Strasbourg,&rdquo; then she added: &ldquo;She was singing there
  in a caf&eacute;-concert. No one thought much of her. But Louis moved heaven
  and earth to get her an engagement here. I don&rsquo;t know how he managed
  it&mdash;Behrer is, I think, a friend of his&mdash;or else it was that old
  Rossini. Anyway, he got her the engagement, and this is the result!&rdquo; A
  servant in livery brought coffee and liqueurs just then. Madame sat down
  and took a cup. Friesen noted that it shook&mdash;very slightly&mdash;in
  her hand. Standing in front of her he gazed at the picture she presented
  with undisguised admiration. He thought she looked magnificent. In black
  as usual. Folds and folds of black velvet trimmed with bows and incrustations
  of satin were spread over her huge crinoline. The bodice was cut very low.
  It had puffed sleeves edged with black lace. And rising out of these sable
  trappings her splendid shoulders and opulent bust looked as if they were
  carved in ivory. A fine woman, Friesen thought, hard and tenacious. A capable
  tool for the working of Austrian foreign policy, a policy which was all for
  peace. The Bonapartes, with their ambition and inherited militarism, were
  a perpetual menace to the peace of Europe. A young Bourbon king&mdash;this
  Louis who was rather effeminate and in delicate health&mdash;would be the
  bulwark of pacifism. And this austere woman, his mother, was far too shrewd,
  Friesen thought, to launch her son into military expeditions that could only
  end in disaster. She was ambitious for the dynasty, but not for military
  glory. He studied her agitation. He admired her for this, for he knew how
  excitable she was, and how capricious. A creature of moods. She would take
  failure badly, he thought, for she was a regular Spaniard. Even now, in the
  presence of a servant, she could not entirely disguise her impatience. Her
  foot tap-tapped against the floor. She took a sip of coffee, then put the
  cup down. Picked it up again. Took another sip. And all the while her fine
  dark eyes followed the servant&rsquo;s movements. One could see how impatient
  she was to be rid of him, and that a peremptory order for him to go hovered
  on her lips.</p>
  <p>A fine woman, yes! An enthusiastic ally and an ambitious one, but could
  she be trusted to act prudently and wisely if she were called upon to face
  failure? Friesen wondered, and thoughtfully stirred the coffee in his cup.</p>
  <p>At last the servant left the room. Madame drew a deep sigh of relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, Friesen,&rdquo; she said more calmly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
  let us talk any more of that tiresome baggage. Sit down and listen to me.
  Have some of that Chartreuse. It is very good. Listen, Friesen! I want you
  to know what we have planned. Then if you have any suggestions to make .
  . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen sat down. He still had the cup of coffee in his hand. He stirred
  and stirred the coffee in the cup. Thoughtfully. Expectantly.</p>
  <p>Madame leaned back against the sofa cushions. She said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know that Louis has spent a great deal of time in Strasbourg
  this summer. I wished him to feel his way among the garrison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen nodded, intimating that he knew this. Madame went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! we know now that the garrison is ours to a man. Don&rsquo;t
  doubt it, Friesen. I know what I am talking about. The men are not only loyal,
  they are enthusiastic. The garrison is made up of two regiments of the line,
  one regiment of cavalry and the 3rd regiment of artillery. We have a beautiful
  fleur-de-lys standard on order and it is absolutely certain that these regiments
  will rally round the old flag. As soon as everything is ready Louis will
  go back to Strasbourg. He will harangue the men. Their shouts of &lsquo;<i>Vive
  le roi!</i>&rsquo; will find their echo all over France&mdash;&rdquo; She
  sighed; the sigh sounded like one of longing, and she said: &ldquo;I wish
  I could be there to hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Austrian sipped his coffee. Put his cup down on the table. Asked: &ldquo;You
  had not thought of going yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame said: &ldquo;No! It would not be wise. If I went too, the authorities
  would become suspicious. So far we have been able to keep Louis&rsquo;s movements
  secret&mdash;but it is difficult for a woman to cross the frontier unobserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Friesen murmured &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; and thought, but didn&rsquo;t
  say: &ldquo;Especially a lady like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis always crosses the Rhine at Kehl by the pontoon bridge,&rdquo; Madame
  went on; &ldquo;there is little if any risk there.&rdquo; She paused. One
  might have thought that she was measuring her effect. But she was no actress.
  She meant every word she said. Her plans had the object of gaining a crown
  for her son, and there was no play-acting in the way she unfolded them before
  her friend. She was actually unconscious of the admiration which he had for
  her, physically. Her purpose was to put into him some of the enthusiasm for
  Louis&rsquo;s cause which animated her, so that he, in his turn, should communicate
  it to his Emperor, to His Holiness the Pope and to the whole of Europe. She
  had long since ceased to be aware that even now, in middle age, she was still
  beautiful. Excitement added lustre to her dark eyes, and a strangely compelling
  tone to her voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At Strasbourg,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;Louis will meet General
  Ruffo and Colonels de Bruc and Noyant and we have great hopes that General
  Avelane, who commands the 3rd army corps, will also declare himself openly
  on our side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen said: &ldquo;A man like that would certainly be a great asset when
  your big coup comes off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will come off, Friesen. Do not doubt it for a moment. I don&rsquo;t.
  I have the faith that moves mountains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Count Friesen picked up a glass of Chartreuse, sipped it and put it down
  again. He said dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So long as it moves the 3rd army corps . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Madame took no notice of this remark. Friesen was such a kind friend,
  always deferential and sympathetic: these last rather cruel words of his
  must have escaped him against his will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After Louis has harangued the garrison,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;Colonel
  Noyant will go to the Pr&eacute;fecture with a squad. He will order the Pr&eacute;fet
  to surrender. They will probably find him in bed, having his morning coffee,&rdquo; Madame
  continued na&iuml;vely, &ldquo;so he will be at their mercy. As soon as Noyant
  has dealt with the Pr&eacute;fet he will march his squad to the Mairie and
  arrest the Mayor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo; Madame reiterated tartly. &ldquo;You
  exasperate me, Friesen. Can&rsquo;t you see that by holding Strasbourg we
  have in our hands the key to Paris and to France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By holding Strasbourg&mdash;yes!&rdquo; the old diplomat mused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis will leave Avelane there in command of the garrison. He will
  march back openly to the frontier with his staff officers and a military
  escort. The men will await his return at the frontier, but their officers
  will change into civilian clothes and cross over the border with him. I,
  in the meanwhile, will have everything ready here for the signing of the
  marriage contract, and for receiving His Majesty the King of France and his
  staff in a fitting manner. After the signing of the contract and with Christophe&rsquo;s
  milliard in his pocket His Majesty will return to Strasbourg, place himself
  at the head of the 3rd army corps and march to Paris, followed by the acclamations
  of a multitude happy to see once more the rightful King of France come into
  his own at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame grew more and more excited while she talked. She had made her profession
  of faith. For her, the success of her plan was a dead certainty. And while
  she spoke, her voice grew louder and more harsh. The guttural Spanish accent
  became more and more pronounced. Her dark eyes glowed. She rose and paced
  up and down the room. Then sat down again, holding herself erect, throwing
  out her fine bust and squaring her shoulders, while the rings on her fingers
  and the bracelets on her wrists glittered in the candle-light as she threw
  out her hands in widely sweeping gestures to emphasise some point or other.</p>
  <p>Friesen sat silent and thoughtful. He was a diplomat of the old school,
  shrewd and tactful. It was impossible to guess what went on exactly behind
  the mask of high breeding and detachment which his good-looking face usually
  wore.</p>
  <p>It was only when Madame appeared to be waiting for him to say something
  that he asked her when she thought of putting her plan into execution.</p>
  <p>She replied: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet&mdash;as soon as possible, of
  course, though there is still a lot to think of and to arrange. But I want
  to hurry things on now that we have got Christophe and the girl in the right
  mood&mdash;Louis must start for Strasbourg to-morrow or the next day&mdash;I
  don&rsquo;t want him to get deeper in the clutches of that Saint-Amand girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She broke off abruptly and then went on with a kind of desperate insistence,
  her dark eyes searching her friend&rsquo;s face as if to force him to put
  his thoughts into words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I have told you, Friesen, is only the main outline of our plans;
  but you do realise, don&rsquo;t you, that our last louis will go towards
  paying for it all? It must be followed immediately by the signing of the
  marriage contract and Christophe&rsquo;s milliard to help us carry on. Immediately!
  You understand? The wedding can then take place in Paris, and the coronation,
  please God, immediately after.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew a long, deep sigh. &ldquo;Anyhow, my friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;before
  the year is out, this nightmare of Empire and the Bonapartes will be over
  and we shall witness the crowning at Rheims of Louis XIX, King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God grant it, Madame,&rdquo; the Austrian put in fervently.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>It was after this that Madame&rsquo;s mood suddenly changed. She was like
  that. Hot tempered one moment, cool the next, enthusiastic, irritable; it
  was impossible to know how to take her. It was a bitter mood that now apparently
  seized her all of a sudden, for she gave a quick, impatient sigh, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What we want is energy, Friesen.&rdquo; And she reiterated this two
  or three times: &ldquo;Energy&mdash;energy&mdash;the determination to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Friesen protested, &ldquo;His Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A charming young man, eh?&rdquo; Madame broke in, in a tone of biting
  sarcasm. &ldquo;Most popular at a dance or a dinner-party&mdash;so good-looking&mdash;so
  amiable! But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She broke off and the expression of her face hardened to something that
  was almost cruel. She appeared restless; jumped once more to her feet, went
  over to the window and threw it open. At once the distant strains of the
  Kurhaus orchestra playing the latest dance tune, came floating in, dreamy,
  languorous, frivolous, a strange accompaniment to this talk of conspiracies
  and the destinies of France. Friesen sat in silence, his folded hands pressed
  between his knees. And Madame la Princesse suddenly turned from the window
  and came back to him. She sat down again on the sofa, smoothed down the voluminous
  folds of her dress, picked up a fan from the table at her elbow, and began
  to ply it in an agitated kind of manner. She was obviously nervy. Thoughts&mdash;strange
  thoughts and reminiscences&mdash;were running riot in her brain. And all
  at once she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have never seen my eldest son, have you, Friesen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Austrian looked politely astonished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I had another son?&rdquo; she broke in harshly. &ldquo;My first
  husband was an Englishman, you know. As handsome as a marble statue carved
  by Phidias, and as cold. His idol was Wellington, and I need not tell you
  what that name means to us Spaniards! Mark was self-opinionated and arrogant,
  looked on a woman as little better than his dog or his horse. When I rebelled
  at his exactions he treated me like a disobedient slave, horse-whip in hand.
  I don&rsquo;t know now if I adored or hated him. I gave him a son, the handsomest
  boy, Friesen, you have ever seen in all your life. I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame&rsquo;s pale, hard face now wore an almost terrifying expression
  of malevolence. Her words, spoken with the guttural Spanish intonation, sounded
  like the angry growl of a wild cat at grips with its prey. Count Friesen
  felt extremely uncomfortable, didn&rsquo;t know which way to look or what
  to say. In all his diplomatic experience he had never encountered so great
  a fury in any woman. Madame now picked up a lace handkerchief. She crushed
  it into a damp ball, then started pulling it to pieces. Presently she went
  on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He ran away from home nearly twelve years ago; after he had helped
  himself to as much of my money as he thought he would require. Three years
  later I saw him again. He brought me back the money which he had stolen&mdash;borrowed
  he called it. Friesen!&rdquo; Madame continued, making a visible effort to
  subdue the harshness of her voice. &ldquo;He was the handsomest boy I had
  ever seen; nineteen years old, and the very image of me. And so like His
  Majesty, except for his stature, which is magnificent, just like his father&rsquo;s.
  And, like his father, cold, arrogant, self-willed&mdash;but a man, Friesen!&mdash;a
  man!&mdash;a man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more Madame was silent. The Austrian, not knowing what was expected
  of him, would have given a handful of gold for an excuse to slip away. But
  Madame seemed for the moment unaware of his existence. At last he ventured
  to ask:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have not seen the young man since, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she replied curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what became of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not directly. But Cardinal Beneventy, whom I think you know, seems
  to have kept in touch with him. I asked him a question once about Cyril,
  and His Eminence then said that the boy had studied painting in Paris and
  was on the way to making a name for himself in the art world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cyril, did you say, Madame?&rdquo; Friesen asked. &ldquo;Your son
  isn&rsquo;t Cyril Bertrand, is he, the young artist who had that beautiful
  portrait of Mademoiselle Christophe in this year&rsquo;s Salon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does he paint portraits?&rdquo; Madame asked coldly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The art world of Paris knows Cyril Bertrand by reputation, I can
  assure you. I have never met him, but the cognoscenti talk of him as a young
  man of great promise. No less a man than Jean Auguste Ingres has spoken very
  highly of him. And to think that Cyril Bertrand is brother to His Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only half-brother,&rdquo; Madame put in curtly. &ldquo;Cyril is English,
  remember. I know that to my cost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which, in her usual capricious way, Madame la Princesse allowed the
  conversation to drift into other channels. Pictures. The opera. The health
  of Henri Murger and the eccentricities of Meyerbeer. It seemed as if she
  wished to dismiss deliberately from her mind all thoughts of her two sons,
  whose respective personalities had each the power to exacerbate her nerves.
  Also it was getting late. Count Friesen presently rose to take his leave,
  and wishing the lady a respectful good night, he bent his back nearly double
  before her. No one could be more deferential to dispossessed royalty than
  this representative of the most ancient empire in Europe. He kissed the hand
  that was graciously extended to him. It was still a beautiful hand, but Friesen
  could not help thinking, while he held it, how ruthlessly it could strike,
  if it had the will.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>A few minutes later he was standing under the marquise outside the front
  door of the Villa Elisabeth. The major-domo who had seen him out stood rigid
  as a statue behind him. Friesen lit a cigarette. His thoughts ran on the
  interview he had just had with that masterful woman upstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Masterful and vindictive,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;a modern Medici
  or Borgia. How she hates that son of hers. She hates him because he is fine
  and strong, and because her favourite, who is a descendant of effete kings,
  is nothing but a weakling. Ah, well! weakling or no, my Emperor wants him
  on the throne of France, so we must all help to get him there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Count Friesen descended the perron steps whistling the latest waltz
  of Johann Strauss, the strains of which came up to him, together with the
  scent of heliotrope and late roses from the Kurhaus gardens down below.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>But during this selfsame hour after the theatre, the uncrowned King of France
  was settling the destinies of his throne and country in his own way. While
  his austere mother and the Austrian diplomat were discussing the possibilities
  of a <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> which would restore to him the crown
  of his forebears, Louis de Bourbon spent his time in sitting, figuratively
  speaking, at the feet of Aline Saint-Amand and telling her in language of
  varying eloquence how adorable she was, and how little he cared about royal
  thrones and the crown of St. Louis, if they should prove to be insuperable
  obstacles to the fulfilment of his most ardent desire. Whereupon, just to
  please him and because she did feel flattered by the passion which she had
  aroused in this interesting young man with the kingly air and somewhat mysterious
  personality, she asked the obvious question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what is your Majesty&rsquo;s most ardent desire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nor was there the slightest suggestion of irony in her use of the august
  title.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can you ask?&rdquo; His Majesty retorted, and added rapturously: &ldquo;To
  have you entirely for my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aline Saint-Amand occupied a suite of rooms in a modest pension high up
  on the hill, with beautiful views over the Lichtenthal All&eacute;e and the
  river to the edge of the forest far away. The two of them had been sitting
  opposite one another at the table, having supper. He, in a state of fervid
  adoration, ate next to nothing. His eyes&mdash;the eyes of a man in delicate
  health&mdash;purple-rimmed and feverish, were fixed upon every mouthful which
  she conveyed to her adorable lips. She was hungry. She was young and she
  worked hard, both at her music and at other things, and she ate a hearty
  supper.</p>
  <p>But now that the waiter had cleared the table and gone off, they both rose,
  she to fall in a graceful attitude in a corner of the sofa, and he to sit
  as close to her as she would let him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once you are King of France, my Louis,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;the
  humble little opera singer will be nothing to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would give up more than the throne of France,&rdquo; he rejoined
  earnestly, &ldquo;rather than lose you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The retort came, quick and not without asperity:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about V&eacute;ronique Christophe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! V&eacute;ronique&mdash;!&rdquo; was Louis&rsquo;s curt comment
  on this, and he gave a shrug just to show how indifferent the matter of V&eacute;ronique
  Christophe was to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; Aline continued with a doleful little sigh, &ldquo;that
  old Christophe has set his heart on his daughter being Queen of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us waste time,&rdquo; he entreated, &ldquo;by talking
  about old Christophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has millions, so they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I adore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing that money can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she concluded
  with another and deeper sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are the most beautiful creature on God&rsquo;s earth,&rdquo; he
  murmured dreamily.</p>
  <p>Aline&rsquo;s eyes were of that very rare colour&mdash;real china-blue.
  They were liquid eyes, large and fringed with long lashes. Her eyebrows went
  up slightly at the corners, near her small, up-tilted nose, giving her glance
  a perpetually appealing expression&mdash;so attractive to a man, especially
  if he is not of the herculean type. The knowledge that he is being called
  upon to defend and protect a lovely, helpless creature, gives him a feeling
  of power and of pride. Aline Saint-Amand always gave the impression that
  she was weak and helpless and in need of protection, and Louis, delicate
  in health as he was and somewhat effeminate physically, felt a man when she
  turned her appealing eyes on him, and adored her for the sense of strength
  their appeal gave him. She had beautiful soft hands with which she would
  toy with his hair or pat his wan cheeks. And when he felt her perfumed fingers
  against his face he would fall into a melting mood, close his eyes and say
  or do anything in the world she wished. Most undoubtedly he would have renounced
  all his rights to the throne of France if she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would the world be to me,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;without
  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now Aline Saint-Amand was one of the few women who could pout and not lose
  her charm. She had studied the art in front of her mirror because she knew
  that a pretty pout was calculated to melt a man&rsquo;s obdurate heart quicker
  than anything, especially if it was allied to tearful, appealing china-blue
  eyes. In the present case this alliance was peculiarly successful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say that, my Louis,&rdquo; she said in a broken voice, &ldquo;but
  I know that your head is full of plans&mdash;you protest&mdash;you swear
  you love me&mdash;but you do make plans&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by plans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plans to leave me&rdquo;&mdash;and two tears contrived to escape
  from those liquid eyes and coursed down the velvet cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;and
  become King of France, when you will be as far above me as the stars, and
  as unattainable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make those plans,&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;my mother
  does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same thing, my dear!&rdquo; she said tearfully; &ldquo;they
  are all made so as to part you from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I need not go,&rdquo; the young man said, and a sulky, obstinate
  look marred for the moment the delicate charm of his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; the girl asked. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Strasbourg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew a long deep sigh and murmured ecstatically: &ldquo;Strasbourg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew her as close to him as he could and she nestled against his shoulder. &ldquo;The
  place,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;where I spent the happiest days of my
  life, where first we met, Aline, and we learned to love one another. I cannot
  think what it will be like without you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why must you go?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is part of their plan, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know nothing, my Louis. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell. I am to meet a lot of old bores there,
  Colonel This and General That. There is to be a lot of flag-wagging and I
  am to harangue the garrison. The men will shout &lsquo;<i>Vive le roi</i>,&rsquo; and
  follow me. A flag embroidered with fleur-de-lys is already on order. Oh!
  they have thought it all out and planned everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They? Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! my mother for one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aline was silent for a moment or two. She snuggled up to him closer, always
  closer, so that her face was hidden from him by her soft, fair hair, which
  brushed against his cheek. He felt weary and dispirited, and conscious of
  the weakness of his will. He felt like a bird caught in a trap. He didn&rsquo;t
  want crowns and thrones or even milliards. All he wanted was Aline and a
  life of ease and quietude.</p>
  <p>After a time Aline said as gently as she could, though she felt great sobs
  of self-pity rising to her throat:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And when you have done all that, my Louis, and when the men have
  shouted &lsquo;<i>Vive le roi</i>,&rsquo; you will put your dear name to
  the contract of marriage with V&eacute;ronique Christophe. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis made no reply. He leaned his head back against the sofa cushions.
  He was tired. Tired and bored with that crowd of pompous middle-aged men
  and ex-soldiers who were all over him; who wanted him to do wonderful things
  for his country&rsquo;s sake, wonderful things which invariably meant getting
  up early in the morning or haranguing a lot of flat-faced soldiers who, as
  often as not, when he had finished, did not know if they ought to shout &ldquo;<i>Vive
  le roi</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Vive l&rsquo;empereur!</i>&rdquo; Above all,
  he was tired of his mother&rsquo;s domination, her perpetual interference
  with his pleasures, her opposition to his desire for this lovely girl, whom
  he longed to have for wife, so that he could cuddle her soft, yielding body
  and rest his tired head against her sweet-scented shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Angel,&rdquo; he murmured dreamily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us talk
  any more of those tiresome projects. I would so much rather be making love
  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The silence in the room, the warmth of this lovely summer&rsquo;s night,
  the mellow light of the wax candles, suited his mood. Through the open window
  came the faint sound of the Kursaal orchestra playing the lovely &ldquo;Blue
  Danube&rdquo; waltz. He closed his eyes. Aline disengaged herself gently
  from his arms, and looked straight at him for a moment or two. There was
  a strange look in her eyes. Was it love? Well! perhaps! Indecision certainly,
  and compassion; something of ambition too, for even as an uncrowned king,
  Louis de Bourbon would be a desirable husband. Princesse Louis de Bourbon
  would sound well, and would open for her those social doors which were still
  closed against an obscure young <i>prima donna</i>. And Louis assuredly was
  a tender and fascinating lover. While she continued to gaze on him her look
  hardened a little. Indecision slowly gave way to obstinacy. There was no
  weakness of will in Aline Saint-Amand. If she wanted anything very badly,
  she would soon see that she got it. If she wanted Louis de Bourbon to throw
  over the crown of France, Baron Christophe&rsquo;s milliards and V&eacute;ronique,
  she could make him do it in spite of his tyrannical mother and Austrian intrigues.
  The question was, did she really want him? A woman&rsquo;s caprice is the
  most puzzling thing in all the world, a riddle to which even she herself
  has not always got the key. At this moment Aline Saint-Amand certainly did
  not know her own mind. Time, she decided, and her own impulse would guide
  her. She rose and went across the room to where glasses and one or two bottles
  were ranged on an old-fashioned sideboard. Louis half opened his eyes, and
  lazily followed her movements. She was standing with her back to him, her
  white muslin dress billowed round her over a huge crinoline; round her waist
  she had an immense sash of blue silk ribbon which cascaded down her back
  to the edge of her skirt. Her chignon, made up of a mass of small curls,
  looked like live gold in the candle-light; just above her small ear she had
  pinned a large white camellia. She was adorable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back to me,&rdquo; Louis murmured softly. And Aline came back.
  She had a glass in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tokay,&rdquo; she said, and held the glass out to him. &ldquo;Count
  Zichy sent me a case of it, straight from his vineyards in Hungary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis took the glass and drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nectar!&rdquo; he commented.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another glass?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took the glass from him and refilled it at the sideboard. He drank that
  down too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nectar!&rdquo; he reiterated and set his glass down. &ldquo;Now come
  and sit down by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put out his hands and she put hers in them. He dragged her down to his
  side. He no longer looked sleepy: his eyes were shining and there were two
  pink spots on his cheeks. The heady Hungarian wine had roused him from his
  lethargy.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Cardinal Beneventy declares that it was God&rsquo;s will that Cyril Bertrand
  should make up his mind to go for a long walk on that same balmy summer&rsquo;s
  night. Yet one wonders if God cares about the petty scramblings and fussiness
  of His creatures. Their comings and goings must, in His sight, be so like
  those of a colony of ants whom we, the proud lords of creation, think nothing
  of scattering and crushing under foot. One wonders. The greatest poet-philosopher
  of all times says that &ldquo;there is a destiny that shapes our ends.&rdquo; Perhaps
  he is right. Who knows?</p>
  <p>Certain it is that if Cyril Bertrand had not gone for a long walk that night,
  things would not have happened as they did, and the whole of contemporary
  history would have had to be written quite differently. He wandered out along
  Lichtenthal and past Geroldsau as far as Malschbach, and so back up the hill
  to the pension where he lodged. It was late when, after the long climb, he
  came in sight of the unpretentious house tucked away behind a group of acacia
  trees still in full bloom. Their graceful white pendants sent waves of sweet
  odour through the air. Overhead banks of heavy clouds were driven by a soft
  westerly breeze across a sky of intense indigo blue. Between the clouds myriads
  of stars blinked and peeped. Stars of every colour of prismatic light, red,
  green, violet. And amidst them, queen of them all, the waning moon, the colour
  of honey, veiled or revealed her light as the clouds passed over her face
  and drifted away again.</p>
  <p>Cyril came up to the low wall which formed the boundary between the road
  and the small garden of the pension. A few steps more brought him close to
  the entrance gate. Looking round he saw a man and a woman standing just inside
  the gate. They were locked in one another&rsquo;s arms, evidently exchanging
  a fond good night. Cyril stepped back, discreetly, into the shadow of the
  trees. The moon at the moment was unveiled and very bright. Her light shone
  golden on the loving couple. The woman&rsquo;s face was turned up to the
  light. It was Aline Saint-Amand&rsquo;s face; eyes closed, lips parted, nostrils
  quivering, all in an ecstasy of love. Cyril could not see, at first, who
  the man was; his face was buried in the hollow of the girl&rsquo;s neck,
  between her throat and chin. All Cyril could see was a mass of chestnut hair,
  very like his own.</p>
  <p>The embrace lasted a long time. Cyril got impatient. He gave a discreet
  cough, and Aline responded with a little cry. She disengaged herself from
  her lover&rsquo;s arms, gave him her two hands, which he covered with kisses.
  She then turned and walked rapidly up the garden path to the house; and as
  she walked she sent a volley of trills and scales through the silence of
  the night. The man, whoever he was, remained standing by the gate for a moment.
  He seemed rather unsteady on his legs, Cyril thought, for he swayed forward
  once, and then passed his hand across his forehead. Cyril had no wish to
  meet him, so he waited quietly a few moments longer in the shadow of the
  trees, until the ardent lover should have recovered his senses sufficiently
  to open the gate and go away. Aline in the meanwhile had gone into the house;
  her bird-like notes could still be heard through the open windows. A couple
  of minutes later she appeared at one of those windows and looked up at the
  moon. Her face and bust were flooded by the honey-coloured light. Her lover
  down by the gate put out his arms and murmured: &ldquo;Aline! Come back!&rdquo; But
  probably she did not hear him, for she drew back from the window and pulled
  the curtains together, and these were so thick that not even her shadow could
  be seen upon them.</p>
  <p>Then only did the man turn. With a rather unsteady hand he opened the entrance
  gate. And Cyril Bertrand saw that Aline Saint-Amand&rsquo;s ardent lover
  was his half-brother Louis. At first he didn&rsquo;t believe his eyes. The
  whole thing was so staggering! So impossible! Louis, his half-brother, was
  not only the future King of France, he was also the future husband of V&eacute;ronique,
  the most perfect of God&rsquo;s creatures, the woman whom he should have
  worshipped as he would a goddess. And here he was, committing a sacrilegious
  act on this balmy night, beneath the light of a lover&rsquo;s moon. He was
  betraying V&eacute;ronique, a divinity, in the arms of another woman.</p>
  <p>It was unspeakable, monstrous, incredible! So monstrous that it kept Cyril
  for many minutes rooted to the spot, unable to move. Kept him there until
  he heard the click of the latch and the gate swing back on its rusty hinges.
  Until he heard a man&rsquo;s footsteps moving away into the distance down
  the hill. Then only, and as if impelled by a blind impulse, did he start
  to follow those footsteps down the hill. What he was going to do, he didn&rsquo;t
  know. What he wanted to do was to take that liar, that betrayer by the throat
  and so hold him while he poured invectives, reproaches, insults into his
  face. Whether he would end by killing him, like the vermin that he was, Cyril
  didn&rsquo;t know. He felt in a dangerous mood, and there was an unpleasant
  blood-red mist before his eyes. And now a heavy bank of clouds drifted slowly
  past, and veiled the light of the moon. Cyril hurried along in the darkness,
  down the hill in the wake of those footsteps; the footsteps of the man whom
  he longed to seize by the throat. Demons of hatred and murder were at grips
  with his soul. He had been nurtured in hatred. Hatred had lorded it over
  his childhood. His mother hated him, his step-father had hated him; this
  half-brother of his, the effeminate weakling, had always hated him. He had
  been fed on hate, been encompassed by hate, until distance and a new life
  made up of loneliness and privations had at any rate brought him a measure
  of peace.</p>
  <p>But grim hatred&rsquo;s many offsprings were rearing their heads now. The
  male instinct to kill an enemy urged him on. Like David in the Psalms, he
  could&mdash;had his mind been clear enough for prayer at this moment&mdash;have
  asked God that his enemy&rsquo;s days be few, and that when he shall be judged,
  he be condemned and his very prayers become sin. Only Cyril did not think
  of David or the 109th Psalm just now. He was simply hurrying down the hill
  so as to overtake the man who had lied to V&eacute;ronique.</p>
  <p>And all at once he saw the man stagger and heard a curious sound, like the
  groan of an animal in distress. Louis had stumbled against a loose stone.
  He felt himself falling, uttered a feeble cry for help, and came down on
  his knees. He would have measured his length on the stony ground had not
  strong arms been suddenly thrown round him; he didn&rsquo;t know whose they
  were, for it was quite dark. The cool air after the hot room and the pungent
  Hungarian wine had turned him sick and giddy. He was losing consciousness
  and closed his eyes just as he felt himself lifted up from the ground and
  carried quickly down the hill.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>It is generally said that women&rsquo;s actions are illogical and unaccountable
  even to themselves. Impulse guides them. Caprice rules them. But when men&rsquo;s
  actions are ruled by impulse, they become just as illogical, as unexplainable
  to their own selves, as those of the more volatile sex.</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand never could account to himself for his action at the moment
  when his brother, the man whom a moment ago he felt he hated to the point
  of wishing to murder him, fell on his knees and gave a pitiful groan, calling
  feebly for help. The same blind impulse which had prompted him to follow
  in Louis&rsquo;s footsteps, with clenched fists ready to seize him by the
  throat, suddenly urged him to throw his arms round that pathetic fellow-creature,
  who looked so weak and so helpless and who groaned like an animal in pain,
  to lift him from the ground and to carry him along the dark tree-bordered
  avenue to the Villa Elisabeth lower down the hill.</p>
  <p>The hand of God, says Cardinal Beneventy. Well, of course! Who dares doubt
  it? The Something Fine, the Something Tender which is in almost every soul
  must come from God, be that God the God of the Christians or of the Jews,
  of Hindoos or Chinamen.</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand then, carrying the inanimate body of his brother, came to
  the grille of the Villa Elisabeth, where he knew that his mother lived. Here
  he stopped, trying in the dark to find the latch of the gate or else the
  bell. There was no light over the grille, and the one under the glass marquise
  before the front door only shed a feeble light on the perron and the top
  of some marble steps. Cyril was swearing inwardly at the want of light when
  the front door of the villa was suddenly opened and two men came out on the
  perron. Their forms were silhouetted against the brilliant light inside the
  hall. One of them was obviously a servant; the other Cyril knew well by sight.
  It was Count Friesen, the Austrian diplomat, whom he had often observed at
  the opera in Madame&rsquo;s box or in the midst of the fashionable throng
  in the All&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>Count Friesen lighted a cigarette, and came down the perron steps whistling
  the latest waltz of Johann Strauss. Just at the moment the bank of clouds
  drifted away and the waning moon once more flooded the small garden of the
  Villa Elisabeth with her honey-coloured light. The Austrian covered the intervening
  space between the villa and the grille with quick, elastic steps, and came
  to a dead halt at the gate when he found himself face to face with a tall,
  hirsute, rather wild-looking, hatless creature whose arms were weighted with
  a limp bundle that did not look unlike a dead man. His first impulse was
  to shout peremptorily: &ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; while his hand went to
  his hip-pocket to feel for the revolver which he always carried with him.</p>
  <p>Receiving no response to his &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he shouted more loudly
  and more peremptorily: &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What
  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril replied curtly: &ldquo;He fell down in the road. I picked him up and
  brought him along. I know he lives here. At least his mother does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At first sound of Cyril&rsquo;s voice Count Friesen gave a start. He peered
  at him through the ironwork of the gate. For a long, long time after Cyril
  had finished speaking the Austrian stood there looking at him. The moon was
  very bright and he could see every line of the strong, handsome face half
  hidden by the shaggy beard, and crowned with an unruly shock of chestnut-coloured
  hair. Cyril returned his glance, frowning, wondering why Friesen, whom he
  didn&rsquo;t know except by sight, should be scrutinising him in such a curiously
  intent way. He said gruffly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not a burglar, nor a beggar. I want to take him in there, that&rsquo;s
  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly, with a kind of mechanical movement, Friesen opened the gate and
  Cyril stepped into the garden. The Austrian never took his eyes off him.
  He seemed like a man hypnotised. The major-domo came hurrying down the drive.
  He had heard the sound of voices. Friesen heard him coming, but still kept
  his eyes fixed on Cyril. As soon as the man was close enough to hear he called
  to him and gave him a few quick orders:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty fainted in the road. This gentleman fortunately was passing
  by and brought him home. Do not alarm Madame la Princesse, but see that His
  Majesty is immediately put to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The major-domo was too much upset to do more than murmur feebly: &ldquo;<i>Oui</i>,
  Monsieur le Comte!&rdquo; He made to take the inert body of his royal master
  in his arms, but Cyril would not allow him to do that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry him to the villa,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
  <p>He followed the major-domo along the drive, up the perron steps and into
  the hall. Louis was slowly returning to consciousness. Cyril put him down
  in an arm-chair, and, without bestowing another glance on him or the major-domo
  he turned on his heel and went back to the grille.</p>
  <p>Count Friesen was still there, leaning against the gatepost and smoking
  a cigarette. He took a step forward as soon as he saw Cyril approaching.
  Cyril frowned at sight of him; he would have gone past him without a word,
  but Friesen stood deliberately in his way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to tell me who you are, you know,&rdquo; he said courteously,
  but very firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; Cyril replied, &ldquo;that I am not a beggar.
  The man fell down and I picked him up. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know all that,&rdquo; the Austrian rejoined quietly, &ldquo;and
  as a matter of fact I need not have asked. Your name is Cyril Bertrand, isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; the other retorted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I count Jean Auguste Ingres among my friends,&rdquo; the other replied
  gravely.</p>
  <p>In a moment the glum expression fled from Cyril&rsquo;s face. A look of
  boyish eagerness came into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He spoke of me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In enthusiastic terms. He says you have a great future before you.
  . . .&rdquo; And Friesen added with a smile: &ldquo;If you will only work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo; Cyril murmured. &ldquo;Fancy his
  remembering a botcher like me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t speak of you as a botcher. And Jean Auguste Ingres
  is not lavish with his praise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril said nothing more. He remained absorbed in the happy memories the
  name of the great artist had evoked; the blessed, blessed hours in the studio
  at Montmartre; the portrait which Ingres had &ldquo;rather liked.&rdquo; Of
  everything else he appeared unconscious. In the distance a church clock struck
  midnight. The night now was wonderfully peaceful and silent. The Kurhaus
  orchestra had already ceased to play, and the fashionable throng had gone
  home to bed. The air was perfectly still, sweet scented with the intoxicating
  odour of acacia and heliotrope. It was the sort of night when even pagans
  turn their thoughts to the possibility of a creative God. The golden moon
  brought into bold relief the marble balustrades and ornamental vases that
  adorned the Villa Elisabeth and painted their shadows a deep indigo. Count
  Friesen glanced up to a row of windows, where the lamps had just been lighted
  and shadowy forms could be seen against the blinds, passing to and fro. His
  Majesty was, according to orders, being put to bed. The diplomat gave a quick,
  impatient sigh and then turned once more to the somewhat wild-looking but
  essentially manly figure before him.</p>
  <p>He sighed again and said after a moment or two:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Monsieur Bertrand. I am afraid it is getting late. But we must
  meet again; that is,&rdquo; he added graciously, &ldquo;if you will allow
  me to come and see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; Cyril rejoined, &ldquo;but I have only
  a small room in a second-rate pension.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I ask where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Villa Eglantine, higher up this hill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Then you have a charming house-mate, I think. The young singer
  who created such a furore in Rossini&rsquo;s opera this evening, Mademoiselle
  Saint-Amand.&rdquo; Then, as Cyril offered no remark to this, he went on
  with his usual courtesy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me keep you standing here any longer. You are an
  early bird on these lovely mornings no doubt. But I shall probably come and
  knock at your door some time to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll talk of our mutual
  friend in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so they parted. But they did not meet again the next day. In the early
  morning Count Friesen received a summons from Vienna and he was obliged to
  leave Baden-Baden for the Austrian capital by the noonday train. He sent
  a regretful apology to Monsieur Bertrand at the Villa Eglantine. Nor did
  these two meet till many days had gone by, and many, many events had occurred
  which neither of them, not even the shrewd diplomat, foresaw at the hour
  of parting.</p>
  <p>The hand of God, said Cardinal Beneventy. The inexorable Fates, declared
  the unbelievers&mdash;those who believed in the Fates and not in God. Who
  shall say if the Great Creative Spirit does really intervene in the petty
  affairs of men, or merely allow the forces which some call the Fates to take
  a hand in the game which men call life?</p>
  <p>None of us will ever know until it is too late to tell the others&mdash;those
  whom we have left behind&mdash;and they probably would not believe us even
  then.</p>

  <p>Letter despatched by special courier from His Majesty Louis XIX by the grace
  of God King of France to Madame his mother:</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strasbourg,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September the 12th, 1860.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madame and
 Beloved Mother,
  <p class="note">The kindest woman on earth is writing this under my dictation
  as I am so tired I can hardly hold a pen. We are still in Strasbourg, in a
  most uncomfortable inn which calls itself the Hotel des Colonies, supposed
  to be the best in the town. I hardly closed my eyes these past two nights.
  The bed is hard and narrow, the sheets coarse and the pillow feels as if it
  were stuffed with potatoes. Both mornings I have been up at dawn. The first
  day they brought me a flag which they said you had ordered. It was white and
  embroidered with fleur-de-lys. Then a crowd of old curmudgeons turned up and
  we held a preliminary conference in a stuffy room in the hotel. The whole of
  my staff was present; you know their names better than I do. They talked a
  lot, and in the intervals of talking, they sniffed and coughed and blew their
  noses. I only listened. As a matter of fact it was no use my saying anything
  as they had settled it all among themselves. At dawn the next day we were to
  take possession of the headquarters of the 12th regiment of artillery, then
  march to the other end of the town and occupy those of the 38th of the line.
  Then a detachment of troops were to go to the Pr&eacute;fecture under the command of Colonel
  Ruffo&mdash;I think that is his name&mdash;and arrest the Pr&eacute;fet and
  any other members of the municipality who were not friendly to us. Nobody
  was quite clear as to what we should do after that, whether we should proceed
  at once to St. Di&eacute; where General Avelane, Commander-in-Chief of the
  district, was presumably waiting for us with two regiments of artillery,
  three of cavalry and two regiments of infantry&mdash;so, at least, they all
  hoped; or whether we should stay where we were and send a courier to General
  Avelane to join us with his regiments in Strasbourg. Also whether we should
  issue our royal proclamation straight away or wait till we got to Paris.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Interminable discussions followed which wearied me to death. In fact
  the conference lasted the whole day, with very short intervals for exceedingly
  scrappy and abominably cooked meals. They were in the midst of a heated discussion
  when the last of four candles guttered and flickered out. No other candle
  could be procured at that hour. We were in total darkness, and the conference
  was dissolved. This morning again at dawn another Colonel whose name I forget,
  went, in full dress uniform, to artillery headquarters and ordered the adjutant
  to muster the men. I arrived a quarter of an hour later. The whole regiment
  was in the courtyard under arms; the band was there in full force. The Colonel
  with sword drawn stood in the centre of the quadrangle. Another fellow in
  uniform walked in front of me carrying the flag, and behind me stalked Ruffo
  looking very uncomfortable in a uniform which was much too tight for him.
  As soon as I came to a halt the Colonel spoke to the men:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Soldiers!&rsquo; he shouted at the top of his voice, &lsquo;the
  French Empire no longer exists. Napol&eacute;on the usurper has fallen. God
  save the King!&rsquo; This of course was a lie, unless Napol&eacute;on has
  recently fallen from his horse or down the staircase. But anyway the men
  responded with a loyal shout: &lsquo;<i>Vive le roi!</i>&rsquo; I said a
  few words to them about St. Louis and my grandfather. The band struck up
  the &lsquo;Marseillaise,&rsquo; which selection seemed to me a singular
  want of tact, but I suppose they meant well. I took hold of the flag. A young
  lieutenant came forward and knelt on one knee. I gave him the flag, and the
  men again shouted &lsquo;<i>Vive le roi!</i>&rsquo; A few at the back of
  the square made a mistake and shouted &lsquo;<i>Vive l&rsquo;empereur!</i>&rsquo; I
  don&rsquo;t think they all knew who I was.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It was still dark and very cold. We marched through
      the town, with the band playing the march from <i>Le Proph&egrave;te</i>,
      and the young lieutenant&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know his name&mdash;waving the flag about.
  Some of the windows in the streets were thrown open and men in their night
  caps and women with tousled hair looked out to see what the noise was about.
  We reached the headquarters of the line regiment. An old General&mdash;whose
  name I think is Louvelu&mdash;was in the yard in full-dress uniform ready
  to receive me. Ruffo whispered something in my ear about its being wonderful
  that the General had declared himself openly on our side. But I was not surprised
  because I knew that Mademoiselle Saint-Amand had worked for this end. Did
  I tell you that she never left my side during the whole of this trying day?
  From dawn till noon she was with us, marching, shouting, talking to the officers
  and encouraging them.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The 38th regiment was as enthusiastic in shouting &lsquo;<i>Vive
   le roi!</i>&rsquo; as the artillery. I had no idea Napol&eacute;on and
   the Empire were so unpopular. The General offered us d&eacute;jeuner for
   which I was thankful as I had had nothing all morning except a cup of very
   bad coffee. While we were at meal, Ruffo detailed twenty men to go with
   him to the Pr&eacute;fecture. They intended to arrest the Pr&eacute;fet,
   the sous-Pr&eacute;fet and I don&rsquo;t know whom else; but they didn&rsquo;t
   succeed. It seems the Pr&eacute;fecture was strongly guarded by troops&mdash;I
   don&rsquo;t know what troops&mdash;and Ruffo and his men had to come back.
   He said that he wished to avoid an armed conflict at this stage of our
   expedition.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;After d&eacute;jeuner there was another dreary, interminable conference,
  at which it was finally decided that we should send a courier to St. Di&eacute;,
  telling General Avelane to bring his regiments along here to Strasbourg.
  They all said that it would be safest for me to remain where I was. It seems
  they had information that the whole countryside is simply infested with spies
  of Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s secret police, bent on getting hold of me and
  shutting me up in some fortress or other. By this time I was so tired that
  I would certainly have collapsed altogether, had it not been for the kindness
  and attention bestowed on me by Mademoiselle Saint-Amand, whose devotion
  to me will electrify the whole of France, when it becomes known.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;She says, and I feel she is right, that what I want now is rest,
  or by the time Avelane turns up I shall not be fit for anything. Her home
  is not far from here at Steigand. She has a house there and a secluded garden.
  She has kindly invited me to spend a few days there with her, because she
  feels that in the quietude of the country, she can nurse me back to health
  and strength. I have decided to accept this generous invitation and we leave
  for Steigand in an hour&rsquo;s time. We shall drive down in the berline
  as it is only a matter of thirty kilometres, and we must live in hopes that
  Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s spies won&rsquo;t be on our track. I am sure that
  a lengthy sojourn in a fortress would be the death of me. As soon as I hear
  that General Avelane has arrived at Strasbourg, which should be in three
  days&rsquo; time at latest, I will return there and in every way carry out
  the programme which you have mapped out for me. I know you have arranged
  that I am to meet Mademoiselle Christophe at a reception which you propose
  to give at your villa on the 23rd, that is eleven days from now. Frankly
  that marriage with the Austrian flapper appeals to me less and less as time
  goes on, in spite of its attendant milliard. It will be a great sacrifice
  to make for a problematical crown.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;<i>Au revoir, maman.</i> I will send you a telegram
      as soon as I am back at Strasbourg. I could then leave for Baden-Baden
      on the day following. If you don&rsquo;t hear from me by the 17th at latest, you may conclude that
  Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s spies have got me, and that I am either a prisoner
  in their hands, or that I have been killed by them and left in a ditch.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Your dutiful son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>When the long letter was written and the envelope duly addressed, the beautiful
  hand that had penned it all was stiff and tired. It had to be kissed, and
  kissed again and fondled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How good you are to me,&rdquo; the weary King of France murmured
  ecstatically; whereupon the beautiful hand patted his cheek, and stroked
  his hair, and the appealing blue eyes threw him a look which sent him straight
  to heaven.</p>
  <p>Aline smiled to herself, as well she might. This King of France was not
  going to break his heart, if he lost his throne. She folded the letter, put
  it in its envelope, and then said in a matter-of-fact, business-like tone
  of voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about getting it sent at once to the post.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ring for the valet, my beloved,&rdquo; His Majesty rejoined dreamily&mdash;and
  added, putting out his arms. &ldquo;Come and sit by me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will in a moment,&rdquo; she responded, and blew him a kiss with
  the tips of her fingers; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll see about this letter first.
  It is very important, you know. No, don&rsquo;t ring,&rdquo; she went on,
  when Louis stretched out an arm in the direction of the bell-pull. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  sooner go myself. Put your feet up, and have a rest. I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before he could protest again, she had skipped out of the room.</p>
  <p>Louis gave a great sigh of contentment. He stretched his long, lean body
  out on the sofa, and gave his thoughts free rein. At last all this marching
  and parading would be over&mdash;for a few days at least&mdash;and this stay
  in this impossible hotel where his meals were badly cooked and badly served,
  and the wine was like vinegar. In a few hours he would find rest and peace
  in the house of his adorable Aline. She would minister to him like a perfect
  angel. His bed would be lovely and soft; his morning coffee like nectar and
  ambrosia. Five, perhaps six days of bliss before the awful moment when he
  must leave her and be presented to his future wife. Oh! if it were not for
  the Christophe milliard and that miserable crown of France, which he didn&rsquo;t
  really want, how happy he could be with Aline. But there was his mother!
  And all those old curmudgeons. Between them they would make life impossible
  for him. And Louis fell to wishing&mdash;praying almost&mdash;that Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s
  spies did get hold of him and shut him up, out of the way of his mother and
  the curmudgeons and the Christophes, and keep him locked up till there could
  no longer be a question of this hateful marriage. Then he could let Baron
  Christophe and his daughter and all Jew financiers and old curmudgeons go
  to the devil, and he could be free to marry Aline.</p>
  <p>Was she not the most adorable thing on earth? She looked adorable just now
  with her little feet peeping out from under the arc of her crinoline, like
  a pair of wee mice . . . and then her eyes . . . her mouth . . . her kiss
  . . . !</p>
  <p>Thus dreaming of Aline, His Majesty the King of France fell comfortably
  asleep.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Outside the room Aline Saint-Amand came to a halt, leaning against the door,
  one hand still resting on the knob, the other closed over the letter which
  she had written at Louis&rsquo;s dictation. She looked down on it, obviously
  troubled and uncertain. Frankly at the moment she didn&rsquo;t quite know
  what she was going to do. She was not sure of herself, nor what she really
  wanted.</p>
  <p>Even in these dim and unlovely surroundings she made a picture which would
  have gladdened the heart of any lover of beauty. The gas bracket above her
  head threw fantastic lights and shadows on her corn-coloured hair, her velvet-clad
  shoulders and huge, unwieldy skirt. Not even the egregious fashion of the
  day, the ridiculous crinoline, the tight bodice and over-trimmed dress, could
  detract from the grace of her figure and the perfect line of her pose. Her
  lips presently parted in a smile, even though the troubled look still lingered
  in her blue eyes. At one moment those eyes filled with tears. She gave a
  kind of impatient shrug and with the back of her hand she brushed the tears
  impatiently away.</p>
  <p>After that, she went downstairs.</p>
  <p>The way down led into the hall of the hotel. On the right were large swing
  doors, glass-panelled with the legend painted on them in gilt letters: <i>Entr&eacute;e
  du caf&eacute;</i>. Aline, still holding the letter in her hand, pushed open
  the swing doors and went in. Immediately opposite another swing door gave
  on the Place outside. On each side of this door there was a deep recess,
  backed by tall windows, and in each recess there were leather-covered seats
  and a table. On the right was the counter on which stood the usual array
  of bottles, glasses, mugs and the tea and coffee urns. The cashier, an obese
  woman of the type usually met with in French caf&eacute;s, presided over
  a desk, on which rested an immense ledger. She was busy knitting when Aline
  entered the caf&eacute;, and only gave a casual look to the newcomer. There
  were leather-covered seats ranged round the other walls, and in front of
  the seats a row of tables. In the centre of the room there were more of these
  seats and more tables and chairs. The Caf&eacute; des Colonies could apparently
  accommodate fifty or more customers, but at this hour it appeared almost
  deserted. Only at one of the tables in a corner of the room, was there a
  party of men playing dominoes and drinking ale, and the only waiter present
  stood talking to the fat woman at the desk.</p>
  <p>At first it seemed to Aline that there was only that one party there, but
  presently she spied a man sitting alone in one of the recesses by the opposite
  door. She made straight for him. He was dressed in dark clothes, and leaned
  his elbows on the table. He had a tray of coffee things in front of him and
  was smoking a cigar. He had his head turned away at the moment, looking out
  on to the Place, where passers-by loomed out of the darkness, hurried past
  and disappeared once more in the night. At sound of the swish of Aline&rsquo;s
  skirts over the tiled floor the man looked round quickly and rose. He pulled
  a chair straight, inviting her to sit, which she did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Coffee? It is quite good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, thank you,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
  <p>She rested her elbow on the table and her head on one hand. Her fingers
  were buried in the masses of her chignon. She suddenly felt very tired and
  closed her eyes; her pretty mouth drooped at the corners.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you would have a glass of <i>Fine</i>,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;it
  would do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head, but he took no notice of that and called to the waiter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A glass of <i>Fine</i> for Madame,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
  <p>The waiter brought the brandy and poured some out into a small glass; he
  would have taken the bottle away again, but the man curtly ordered him to
  leave it.</p>
  <p>Mechanically Aline picked up the glass, sipped the brandy, made a wry face
  and put the glass down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will do you good,&rdquo; the man reiterated, &ldquo;you are tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I am,&rdquo; Aline said listlessly. &ldquo;I worked all
  through August and since then I have been on the go over this business for&mdash;let
  me see&mdash;nearly a fortnight&mdash;I am not used to that sort of racket
  and I haven&rsquo;t slept a wink since we&rsquo;ve been here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t regret it, my dear,&rdquo; the man commented dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; Aline retorted. She took another sip of
  brandy. Her hand, which still held Louis&rsquo;s letter, rested on the table.
  The man pointed to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>She dropped the letter on the table. &ldquo;A letter,&rdquo; she replied
  curtly, &ldquo;he has written to his mother. At least, he dictated it. I
  wrote it. Four pages, my good Toulon. I believe I have got writer&rsquo;s
  cramp from it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man Toulon picked up the letter. The envelope was not gummed down. He
  took the letter out and read it through; then put it back in its envelope,
  gummed it down, and slipped it in his coat pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No harm in it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it mustn&rsquo;t go just
  yet. I&rsquo;ll post it all in good time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He finished his coffee and took a pull at his cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now about the money,&rdquo; he said a moment or two later.</p>
  <p>She looked up at him, and the troubled, tearful look came into her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a dirty game I am playing, Toulon,&rdquo; she said with a melancholy
  little smile; &ldquo;he is such a nice boy&mdash;just like a child&mdash;and
  he trusts me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear friend,&rdquo; Toulon retorted with some impatience, &ldquo;you
  are not going to hurt him. No more are we. Listen to me,&rdquo; he went on
  gravely: &ldquo;Does that nice boy, as you call him, wish to be King of France,
  or does he not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Aline replied after a second&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t think he does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does he want to marry V&eacute;ronique Christophe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time the answer came without any hesitation. &ldquo;No! I am sure he
  does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then?&rdquo; And Toulon shrugged and turned up his hands
  in the manner peculiar to Latin races.</p>
  <p>Aline made no reply at all this time. She sat with her arms folded over
  the table, and stared out of the window into the busy Place outside. People
  coming and going. Men in uniform, men in town coats, men in blouses. Women
  dressed in the latest mode and women with shawls over their heads. Now and
  then a cab or a carriage went clip-clopping over the cobble-stones.</p>
  <p>Rain had begun to fall, in heavy drops which the autumn squall drove against
  the window panes. From time to time a customer would come into the caf&eacute;,
  holding on to his hat, and as the door swung round the draught would sweep
  through the overheated room and flutter the waiter&rsquo;s apron, or the
  pages of the cashier&rsquo;s huge ledger.</p>
  <p>The man Toulon put down his cigar, touched her arm with the tips of his
  fingers, forcing her to look straight across to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just recollect a moment, my dear,&rdquo; he said suavely, &ldquo;what
  it is I am asking you to do. You will leave here in an hour&rsquo;s time,
  shall we say? You will be on your way to your charming house at Steigand.
  Somewhere along the road your berline will be met by a police patrol. Your
  coachman will be ordered to halt. An officer in uniform and a couple of men
  will come to the door of the carriage. You will scream and faint, or otherwise
  behave in the manner peculiar to ladies of sensitive nerves, while the officer
  will request Monsieur le Prince de Bourbon to descend. If he offers resistance&mdash;which
  I am sure he won&rsquo;t&mdash;the men will lay hands on his august person.
  But they are not going to hurt him. I give you my word of honour that they
  won&rsquo;t. There will be another carriage on the spot, and he will be conveyed
  to the fortress of Dyck, where he will be made most comfortable and be looked
  after with paternal care, but only for a few days&mdash;say a fortnight at
  most. You will then proceed on your way to your house at Steigand, where
  you will be laid up with an attack of nerves, following on the shock which
  you will have sustained. To every enquiry, every question put to you, you
  will give the same answer; that you know <i>nothing</i>, beyond the fact
  that your berline was stopped on the high road, by whom you know not; that
  you fainted with terror, and when you came to, His Majesty the King of France
  had disappeared. Nobody will believe you, of course. They will all think
  that you two turtle-doves have eloped together. The Christophe marriage will
  be broken off, which is what we both want; I because it will leave the Bourbons
  penniless to continue their campaign, and you because you can then marry
  the nice boy yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Toulon paused after this long peroration which he had delivered from end
  to end in a smooth, unctuous voice. Nor did he indicate by the slightest
  glance that he had noted the heightening colour in her cheeks while he put
  the matter so clearly and succinctly before her, or the rising glow of excitement
  in her eyes. He waited a moment or two now, in order, probably, to allow
  his words to sink in. He took up his cigar and relighted it. He poured himself
  out a glass of <i>Fine</i> and sipped it. His movements all the time were
  deliberately slow. Finally he added in conclusion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, too, my lovely friend, that for your simple acquiescence
  in this little game, you will receive the very handsome reward of twenty-five
  thousand louis. A marriage portion, my dear,&rdquo; Toulon added significantly, &ldquo;not
  to be disdained even by a prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aline drew a deep sigh. Her eyes were really glowing now. She put her hands
  up to her cheeks, which were burning hot. She said: &ldquo;You have a way
  of putting things before one, haven&rsquo;t you, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shrugged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only wanted you to realise how simple is the whole affair. You
  took to exaggerating the importance of your role in it. Remember, my dear,&rdquo; he
  added gravely, &ldquo;that I could carry the whole thing through without
  your help, and if I ask it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she broke in, speaking now as determinedly as he did
  himself, &ldquo;it is because you want, first of all, to keep the whole
  thing a secret. What you want, in fact, is my silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I not ready to pay half a million for it?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is worth it,&rdquo; she responded with sudden vehemence, &ldquo;and
  you know it. If I were to bruit the whole thing abroad, Baron Christophe
  would soon mobilise his milliards to get Louis out of your clutches, not
  to mention the Emperor of Austria. Bribery can do a lot, and when Louis is
  out of Dyck and back in Baden-Baden, where will you be, my friend? Just where
  you are now, scheming and plotting to get him back again. But you wouldn&rsquo;t
  find it so easy another time, with no Aline Saint-Amand to help you, would
  you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he admitted dryly. &ldquo;As you say, I should
  be where I am now. Even the crown of France would be where it now is, but
  Louis de Bourbon would still be on the eve of being united in holy matrimony
  to V&eacute;ronique Christophe in exchange for her papa&rsquo;s milliards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, when at these last words of his, spoken in a harsh and sarcastic tone,
  Aline&rsquo;s appealing blue eyes filled with tears, and some of the colour
  fled from her velvety cheek, he went on, suave and honey-tongued once more:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There! there! don&rsquo;t let us quarrel. We both have need of one
  another. I want you to be my little friend, my ally, all for your good, and
  the good of our mutual friend, Louis. I want your silence, so that I can
  keep him out of the way, until that marriage is broken off, and you want
  the twenty-five thousand louis which will enable you to marry the penniless
  prince. Come!&rdquo; he went on and stretched out his hand to her across
  the table: &ldquo;Which is it to be, friendship or rivalry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, she put her hand in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friendship,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I am not cut off from communicating with Louis while he is at
  Dyck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall write to him every day,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;and
  I will see that he gets your letter; and every day the governor of the fortress
  shall send a courier over to you with a report or a letter from the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I agree,&rdquo; she said finally and conclusively.</p>
  <p>He raised her hand to his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will never regret it,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;When do you
  start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In half an hour,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Louis&rsquo;s
  letter to his mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will post it&mdash;let me see&mdash;this is Tuesday&mdash;I will
  post it Friday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; was her last word to him, after which they parted,
  the best of friends.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>In the boudoir of the Villa Elisabeth, Madame sat shivering in front of
  the fire. She had read her son&rsquo;s letter through three times. It had
  come by post a quarter of an hour ago. The date on the letter was the 12th.
  To-day was the 16th. Four days! And the postmark was undecipherable. But
  no letter from Strasbourg would be four days in the post. A delay, yes, of
  twenty-four hours. But not four days. Madame had spent these four days in
  an agony of anxiety, waiting for this letter, whilst Louis had idled away
  his time, at this place&mdash;Steigand&mdash;in the arms of an abominable
  baggage. And how astute he had been over this whole affair, throwing dust
  in his mother&rsquo;s eyes. Madame remembered how, before he left, he had
  said to her: &ldquo;Do not worry if you get no news from me. My correspondence
  will certainly be watched, so I shall not write.&rdquo; And she had agreed
  to this measure of prudence, though she knew that to be without news would
  mean for her an agony of suspense.</p>
  <p>And now this! The first time she read the letter through she did not understand
  it. Louis could never have written it, so she thought at first. She read
  it through again, and then once more. After which she rang for her secretary,
  Monsieur Noc&eacute;, and asked him to go over at once to the Hotel Stephanie
  and beg Count Friesen to come over and see her at his earliest convenience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell His Excellency, my good Noc&eacute;,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
  an important letter has come from His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Noc&eacute; gone, she sat down and waited. There was nothing to do but to
  wait. The poor woman felt just as if she had received a heavy blow on the
  top of her head. For the moment, she was quite dazed, wondering whether she
  was crazy or dreaming. She held her son&rsquo;s letter crumpled in her hand,
  and stared down at it as if it were something weird and ununderstandable.
  Her son&rsquo;s letter. A letter written or dictated by the King of France,
  speaking of events on which rested not only the future of his country and
  of his throne, but the destinies of the whole world. A letter flippant in
  tone, full of cheap sarcasm and childish complaints&mdash;the letter of a &ldquo;penny-a-liner&rdquo; written
  for a third-rate comic journal! Madame read it through again, in the spirit
  of a wounded man gloating over his hurt.</p>
  <p>When Count Friesen came, obedient to her call, he found her sitting on the
  sofa with that crumpled letter in her hand, her face the very mask of despair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read this, Friesen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;read it!&rdquo; and held
  the letter out to her friend. He took it from her and went over with it to
  the window, for the afternoon was drawing to a close and the light was waning.</p>
  <p>When he had finished reading he smoothed out the creases in the paper, folded
  up the letter and held it for a moment or two in one hand, tap-tapping the
  other with it. Madame said nothing for a long time. A lackey came in, put
  fresh logs on the fire and went out again. Though September was young yet,
  it was cold and damp to-day. The fire blazed up and lit up Madame&rsquo;s
  rigid figure on the sofa. Her face was expressionless, more cold and dead-looking
  than marble. Friesen moved towards her, and at the sound of his footsteps
  she looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me what you think, Friesen,&rdquo; she said dully. &ldquo;I
  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Austrian drew a chair close to her and sat down. He still had the letter
  in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throw that abominable thing in the fire,&rdquo; Madame said with
  sudden vehemence. &ldquo;I shall go mad if I see it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Count Friesen did not throw the letter into the fire. He slipped it
  inside his coat pocket while Madame was looking another way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the Emperor were to see it,&rdquo; she went on after a moment
  or two, &ldquo;I should die of shame.&rdquo; And then she questioned him
  in a tone akin to despair: &ldquo;What are we going to do, Friesen? What
  are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is very little we can do, Madame,&rdquo; the Austrian replied, &ldquo;except
  wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she echoed with intense bitterness. &ldquo;Wait for
  a telegram which will not come. Oh! that woman, Friesen. That woman! Why
  does God allow a chit like that to thwart the destiny of France? I knew she
  would be our evil genius. You remember I told you, that night at the opera.
  She has bewitched His Majesty and is making a fool of him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused a moment, and then asked a little more calmly: &ldquo;What is
  your idea about General Avelane? Do you think he will join in with his army
  corps&mdash;or will he go back on his word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never actually gave it,&rdquo; was Friesen&rsquo;s dry comment. &ldquo;Did
  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not. But do you think we can count on him&mdash;? Do
  you?&rdquo; she reiterated insistently, as if she longed to hear something,
  a word, that would put courage into her.</p>
  <p>But Friesen said nothing. It was impossible to put into words what was going
  on in his mind. Impossible to tell this ambitious and doting mother that
  the insuperable barrier to the success of her schemes was Louis himself.
  How could a cause have the least chance of success with so supine, so self-indulgent
  a weakling at its head?</p>
  <p>Madame continued to murmur softly, as if talking to herself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-day is the sixteenth . . . Saturday. . . . A week from to-day
  Louis and V&eacute;ronique Christophe are to meet. . . . She expects it.
  . . . Christophe is ready. . . . Saturday next. . . . Eight days. . . . And
  if Louis is not here, Friesen,&rdquo; she suddenly cried, almost screamed,
  at the top of her voice, &ldquo;what will happen then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen sat quite still, moodily staring into the fire. What he saw in the
  flickering flames was not encouraging. All he said was: &ldquo;You will surely
  receive a telegram, Madame, before the day is out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to speak cheerfully, reassuringly, to infuse, into what he said,
  hope which he was far from feeling. He was intensely sorry for this woman&mdash;so
  full of energy and ambition and cursed with a son who at such a moment could
  write such a letter. He himself had a good deal at stake in this affair;
  a diplomat&rsquo;s pride in the success of an important political move. The
  Emperor of Austria desired the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France
  for many reasons: sentimental reasons, family reasons as well as political
  necessities, but he had no faith in the man whom the French Legitimists had
  proclaimed as their King; his cause had been greatly discredited by his mother&rsquo;s
  various schemes and expeditions, all of which had ended in disaster. She
  was old now and disheartened; had not moved on her son&rsquo;s behalf for
  nearly thirty years; it would be difficult, if not impossible, to revive
  enthusiasm for a cause that was now admittedly forlorn. So thought His Majesty
  the Emperor of Austria, who for various reasons desired the restoration of
  the Bourbons, and turned his attention to the somewhat effete but perfectly
  legitimate grandson of Louis XVI.</p>
  <p>Count Friesen, on the other hand, had perhaps more selfish desires on the
  subject. If he succeeded in winning hands down in this elaborate political
  game, planned and undertaken by him under the very nose of his chief, the
  astute Metternich, it would mean a brilliant future for him, whilst failure
  might lead to obscurity. But with him it was a case of personal ambition.
  For this woman success or failure meant life, and more than life&mdash;the
  future of France and of her son. And no one knew better than Count Friesen
  how near failure was at this hour.</p>
  <p>There was a discreet knock at the door. The lackey came in again. This time
  with the lamps. Madame ordered him impatiently away. She wanted the darkness
  at this moment, she wanted to hide the many conflicting emotions that showed
  all too plainly on her face. Hope, fear, bitter, bitter disappointment, scorn
  for one she loved more than anything in the world, rage against fate that
  had made him weak and futile. Not even this friend, this ally, this partner
  in all her schemes, should know what she felt at this hour. The humiliation.
  The awful, awful shame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better go now, my friend,&rdquo; she said after a
  time. &ldquo;We can do nothing now, can we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only wanted you to know. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must hope for the best,&rdquo; he said encouragingly, and rose
  to take his leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The best?&rdquo; Madame murmured drearily. &ldquo;While we sit and
  wait to hear whether that grasping jade has slackened her hold on him. Not
  much best in that, is there, Friesen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a shudder and drew nearer to the fire. She felt very cold. Stared
  into the flames. Rubbed the palms of her hands one against the other. She
  seemed to have forgotten Count Friesen&rsquo;s presence altogether, and he
  stood by, waiting, uncertain whether to say something more or leave her alone
  with her thoughts. He gave a discreet cough. She pulled herself together,
  and stretched out her hand, which Friesen kissed. It was very cold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in later,&rdquo; he said in the end, &ldquo;to see
  if you have further news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a kind friend to me, Friesen,&rdquo; Madame said impulsively. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know what I should do without you. Give up hope, perhaps, which
  I haven&rsquo;t done yet. God is not going to let us down because of the
  knavery of a greedy hussy. He has too much sense of humour.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Outside the front door, under the marquise, Count Friesen lighted his cigarette
  and mused:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a woman! Heavens above, what a woman! If the Duchesse de Berry
  had half her brains she would have got her son on the throne of France before
  now. But this Spanish Amazon . . . By gad! What can the Almighty have been
  thinking of when He gave her that contemptible son? That other one now!&rdquo; he
  added, musing, as he went rapidly down the drive and presently came to the
  gate where, some six weeks ago, he had first met and parted from that curious,
  arresting personage, who was so like the King of France. Outwardly, that
  is. The same features, the same colour of eyes and hair. But what a contrast
  in other ways to the effete weakling whose latest monkey trick had effectively
  lost him his crown. And the diplomat called to mind Madame&rsquo;s significant
  words when she had spoken to him of her eldest son: &ldquo;But a man, Friesen,
  a man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Truly the decrees of Providence are often quite ununderstandable.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Count Friesen went back to the Villa Elisabeth in the evening. He found
  Madame sitting by the fire, gazing into the flames. He wondered if she had
  moved at all during the last few hours, if she had just sat there all this
  time gazing into the flames, seeing pictures there, perhaps, of a royal crown,
  a throne, the face of her son, or that of a fair and lovely girl&mdash;the
  grasping jade who had been chosen by God to thwart the destinies of France.</p>
  <p>There had been no telegram and it was too late by then to expect one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wire may have been delayed,&rdquo; the Austrian said, trying
  to appear hopeful. &ldquo;I will be at the post office when the bureau opens
  in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It would have been useless to talk of rest to this troubled spirit. Friesen
  went away with a heavy heart. It was pathetic to see this ambitious woman
  nerving herself to face failure. Her whole life had been a failure, but this,
  he felt, the last, would finally break her. He hoped that she had an efficient
  maid who would look after her and that she would get some sleep.</p>
  <p>The telegraph office opened for business at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
  Count Friesen was on the spot punctually to the minute, asking if a telegram
  had come overnight for Madame la Princesse de Bourbon. None had come. He
  waited in the bureau for over an hour in case one came through. None came.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Madame greeted him with the words: &ldquo;Something will have to be done,
  Friesen, or I shall go mad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something shall and will be done, Madame,&rdquo; the diplomat responded. &ldquo;Before
  I went to the telegraph office, I had already made up my mind, that if there
  was no wire from Louis before midday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Madame broke in dully; and she added,
  with bitter sarcasm: &ldquo;The King of France is enjoying a well-earned
  rest in the villa of Mademoiselle Saint-Amand at Steigand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that is where I shall be to-morrow,&rdquo; Friesen said gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friesen!&rdquo; Madame exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I said, Madame. There is a train for Strasbourg at three
  o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. I shall go by that, and to-morrow I shall hire
  a carriage, drive to Steigand, find the villa, and bring His Majesty triumphantly
  back to Baden-Baden with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You really think of doing that, Friesen?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; he replied with a kindly smile. &ldquo;We
  must have him here <i>co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te</i>. Saturday next will
  be on us before we know it, and we are not going to put such an outrage on
  Mademoiselle Christophe as not to produce her royal fianc&eacute; at the
  appointed time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Friesen, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Madame exclaimed,
  and for the first time for many hours a wave of colour flooded her cheeks
  and a hopeful glow lit up her dark eyes. &ldquo;You are right! Oh! so right!
  You mustn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she went on steadily, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t
  think of going to Steigand myself. What kept me back was the certainty that
  my going there would be no use. No use whatever! In affairs like these, a
  mother&rsquo;s role always turns to ridicule. Can you see me imploring that
  hussy to give me back my son, and France her King?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She jumped to her feet, as alert as a young girl, now that this hopeful
  vista had been opened out before her. She paced up and down the room. Up
  and down. Then came to a halt before her friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would do this for us, Friesen,&rdquo; she
  said, and her harsh Spanish voice quivered slightly with emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of ridicule,&rdquo; he rejoined smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t allow that baggage to practise her wiles on you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I am too old a stager for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll fight you with all sorts of weapons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of any of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will bring Louis back here? To me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise you, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And when a quarter of an hour or so later, the diplomat took his leave,
  he was saying <i>au revoir</i> to a woman wholly transformed from the dejected,
  despairing one of a short while ago. Madame, buoyed up by hope, looked twenty
  years younger than she had done yesterday. Her eyes were bright, her lips
  moist and red; there were two bright spots on her cheeks. But for her sense
  of dignity she would have thrown her arms round this kind friend&rsquo;s
  shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks.</p>
  <p>The day was fine. Neither rain nor autumn wind. A brilliant sunshine spread
  a mantle of gold over the trees of the Lichtenthal All&eacute;e, and threw
  myriads of sparkling diamonds over the rippling stream. It was, in fact,
  one of those beautiful late summer or early autumn days, when trees and flowers
  seem to rouse themselves from the first sense of drowsiness caused by long
  days of drought and heat, and display in all their gorgeousness those treasures
  of colour and of fragrance, of which a pitiless sun had vainly tried to deprive
  them. In the formal beds of the All&eacute;e, crimson dahlias flaunted their
  showy petticoats above pyramids of vivid green, petunias unfurled their crumpled
  skirts and late roses hid their enfeebled hearts in the depths of sweet-scented
  petals.</p>
  <p>Madame had thrown open the window of her boudoir, which commanded a view
  over the drive. She called to her friend when she saw him hurrying along
  towards the gate. He looked back and waved to her with a gesture that in
  itself was expressive of hope.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Bois-Joli&rdquo; was the name of the small property which Mademoiselle
  Saint-Amand owned on the main road between Martaban and Steigand, some thirty
  kilometres south-west of Strasbourg. The house was of the usual style found
  in the country districts of France, two-storied, white-washed, grey-shuttered,
  surrounded by a small garden none too well kept and enclosed by a low wall
  with a grille which gave directly on the road.</p>
  <p>Count Friesen alighted from the coach which he had hired at Strasbourg.
  He had made an early start, had lunched at Martaban, and arrived at his destination
  soon after two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Everyone in the neighbourhood,
  it seems, knew &ldquo;Bois-Joli.&rdquo; The driver had made no difficulty
  in finding it, and when his fare looked somewhat dubiously at the unpretentious
  house and asked: &ldquo;Is this Mademoiselle Saint-Amand&rsquo;s place?&rdquo; he
  answered: &ldquo;But yes, monsieur. Mademoiselle Saint-Amand has lived here
  all her life. Her father and mother both died in this very house. It came
  to Mademoiselle through them, and she always comes down here when she is
  not singing at the opera. Ah, monsieur!&rdquo; the man went on with enthusiasm, &ldquo;you
  should hear her. A nightingale, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen ordered the man to give his horses their nosebags and to wait for
  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall not be long,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I want to get back
  to Strasbourg to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can take Monsieur back as far as Martaban,&rdquo; the driver responded. &ldquo;Monsieur
  can then hire a berline there for the rest of the distance. My horses wouldn&rsquo;t
  be up to the double journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen said &ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; and turned back to the grille. It was
  on the latch, and going through it he found himself in a small garden, with
  the front door of the house immediately opposite. He paused a moment with
  the vague notion of getting into the atmosphere of the place. The house certainly
  was unpretentious. It did not suggest a place where a lady of the town might
  entertain an exalted personage. The paths would have been better for some
  weeding; the creepers over the trellised arbour should certainly have been
  cut; the shutters badly needed a coat of paint. Nevertheless there was something
  distinctly attractive about the place. It had atmosphere. Poesy. Romance.
  Above all it had an all-pervading serenity. Friesen crossed the garden path
  feeling that he would have a tough fight to drag Louis out of this abode
  of peace in order to fling him back into a world of turmoil and politics,
  of high finance and conventional alliances, all presided over by his austere
  mother.</p>
  <p>He rang the front door bell. It gave forth a hollow jangle, almost as if
  it resented being disturbed out of its habitual quietude. The door was opened
  by a stout middle-aged woman, the regular type of Alsatian peasant, large-proportioned,
  flat-faced and smiling from ear to ear. Just by looking at her, Friesen,
  who, like all Austrians was a connoisseur in culinary matters, knew by instinct
  that she was an excellent cook. She seemed to exude an air of good food and
  well-constructed sauces. Some cooks do. She was rather confused on seeing
  an elegantly dressed gentleman at the door. She picked up the corner of her
  apron and folded it up crossways, as if she wished to show to this high-hatted
  visitor that she wore a clean blue print dress underneath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Monsieur will excuse me,&rdquo; she murmured even before Friesen
  had time to open his mouth; &ldquo;the valet de chambre is out, and Marie
  is dressing, that is why I&mdash;But what can I do for Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can just show me in,&rdquo; Friesen replied, smiling benevolently
  at the old body; &ldquo;and tell Mademoiselle Saint-Amand that Count Friesen
  desires the honour of presenting his respects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will, Monsieur. At once. Mademoiselle is in. Will Monsieur give
  himself the trouble to enter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She waddled off, leaving Friesen standing in the hall. He put his hat down
  on the table, took off his overcoat, and looked about him, as he had done
  in the garden. The house too had atmosphere, one of serenity and of rest.
  The old cook had gone shuffling up the stairs; for a time her heavy footsteps
  could be heard clanging on the carpetless marble steps. A door upstairs was
  opened and shut again. But after that not a sound disturbed the quietude
  of the place. The hall itself was square with the circular stairs at one
  end of it and a gallery along two of its sides. The walls were white with
  pretty Louis XV panelling. Two or three old-fashioned portraits on the wall,
  a round table in the Empire style, a marble statue of a Hebe, all gave an
  air of old-worldliness to the home of this ultra-modern young <i>prima donna</i>.
  A large white cat was asleep on a high-backed chair, and a scent of lavender
  hung on the air.</p>
  <p>A few moments later the old cook came shuffling back down the stairs. Her
  large flat face looked troubled, almost tearful, as if she had received a
  scolding from her mistress. Friesen would not have been astonished if she
  had brought him the message that Mademoiselle declined to see him. However,
  she brought nothing of the sort, but her voice sounded more gruff and less
  inviting when she spoke the classical phrase: &ldquo;Will Monsieur give himself
  the trouble to enter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw open one of the doors which gave on the hall, and ushered Count
  Friesen into a pretty drawing-room, closing the door behind him. The room
  was rose-coloured with softly faded hangings and that same air of old-worldliness
  which had charmed him in the hall. But he had no time to take in all his
  surroundings, for in less than two minutes Aline Saint-Amand came into the
  room. She appeared entirely self-possessed and smiling. Dressed in perfect
  taste and in the latest mode as usual. She looked the picture of health and
  in the best possible spirits. To see her come forward with outstretched hand
  and a smile of welcome all over her pretty face an unseen observer would
  have declared that the Austrian diplomat was the person in the world she
  most desired to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your Excellency!&rdquo; she exclaimed in her habitual bird-like tone. &ldquo;What
  a delightful surprise! How charming of you to run me to earth in my funny
  little lair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And when Friesen had kissed the delicate hand so graciously extended to
  him, she led the way to the large square bay where a couple of downy arm-chairs
  invited a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; she went on lightly. &ldquo;I hope you have brought
  me lots of news from my dear Baden-Baden. . . . But first of all, tell me
  what would you like&mdash;you must be tired and hungry&mdash;I have some
  perfectly delicious Tokay&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen sat down. In answer to her hospitable offer he put up a protesting
  hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, dear lady, I thank you. My visit must only be a short one,
  I am sorry to say. I must go back to Strasbourg this afternoon&mdash;But
  first of all, do tell me&mdash;how is His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She frowned, looking terribly puzzled, as if he had asked an impossible,
  abnormal question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty?&rdquo; she queried vaguely. But the very next moment
  her manner changed completely. She clapped her hands together and exclaimed
  in a tone of acute distress:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, then you haven&rsquo;t heard!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard what?&rdquo; he retorted, and now it was his turn to frown
  and to look puzzled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty is not here&mdash;He was coming to spend a few days here
  with me&mdash;He was very tired and he needed rest. But&mdash;oh! I can&rsquo;t
  tell you,&rdquo; she went on while her eyes filled with tears and her voice
  shook with emotion. &ldquo;It is too, too dreadful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mademoiselle pulled herself together. She wiped her eyes with a dainty lace
  handkerchief and brushed a few unruly curls from her forehead. She leaned
  forward in her chair, and clasped her hands together, as if trying to keep
  her emotion under control. She said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty was kidnapped on the high road, by the police spies of
  Napol&eacute;on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kidnapped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen was frowning, almost glowering into the pretty flushed face before
  him. It was impossible to say whether he was horrified, puzzled or merely
  doubted the lovely lady&rsquo;s sanity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were travelling quietly in the berline,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It
  was just getting dark&mdash;twilight, you know&mdash;The coachman pulled
  up for the lackey to get down and light the carriage lamps. When suddenly
  a number of dark figures emerged from I don&rsquo;t know where. They seemed
  to me to have sprung out of the earth. They presented pistols at my servants&rsquo; heads.
  Others came to the door of the carriage. I was terrified. I thought they
  were a band of highway robbers. I just remember His Majesty getting hold
  of my hand. After that I must have fainted. When I came to, my old coachman,
  who has been in my service for years, was at the carriage door. I couldn&rsquo;t
  see him in the dusk, but he kept calling: &lsquo;Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle!
  Are you hurt?&rsquo; When I opened my eyes I realized to my horror that His
  Majesty was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouted to the coachman and the lackey. I asked them which way
  the ruffians had gone. I ordered them to run after them&mdash;I was so distracted,
  I feared I was losing my reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed as if she could not keep back her tears. Her lovely blue eyes
  swam in them; they rolled down her soft, round cheeks. And now she appeared
  to lose complete control over her emotion. Convulsive sobs shook her delicate
  body. She buried her face in her hands and gave way to a regular deluge of
  tears.</p>
  <p>Somehow Count Friesen had the conviction that she was lying. He didn&rsquo;t
  say anything for a moment or two, waiting until this paroxysm of sorrow&mdash;real
  or false&mdash;subsided. As soon as Aline appeared a little more calm, he
  asked quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is His Majesty now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made an effort to swallow her sobs, and to dry her tears with that dainty
  lace handkerchief which was nothing but a small wet rag by now. In a quivering
  voice she replied: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; and reiterated once
  or twice: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I don&rsquo;t know! That is what is
  breaking my heart&mdash;he was so tired&mdash;so ill&mdash;he needed careful
  nursing. If I only knew that those brutes were treating him kindly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those brutes? What brutes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, the police&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that it was the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her answer came very glibly: &ldquo;Pierre, my coachman, recognised some
  of the men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? In the dark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t quite dark&mdash;I thought I told you that it was
  dusk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see. . . . Well, and didn&rsquo;t Pierre do anything at all to
  defend His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How could he? He and Antoine, my other man, were held all the time
  at the point of a pistol. Besides&mdash;you know what people of that class
  are like&mdash;they are terrified of the police. Pierre is no coward but
  he is old, and Antoine wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Bo&rsquo; to a goose. He
  was frightened out of his wits. The men bundled His Majesty into a carriage
  and drove away at a tremendous speed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In which direction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Back towards Strasbourg. We should have had to turn before we could
  follow them. And by that time they would have been far out of reach&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had everything quite pat, and Friesen was more and more convinced that
  she lied. The question was, was she being paid to lie, or did she do it on
  her own account? In other words was she in the pay of Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s
  police and had she helped to engineer this coup? Or was she merely keeping
  Louis in hiding&mdash;in this house or elsewhere&mdash;so as to make it impossible
  for him to marry V&eacute;ronique Christophe? Either contingency was possible.
  Friesen was already wondering how he could force the truth out of her. He
  had many years of successful diplomacy behind him, but experience had taught
  him that where a clever or an ambitious woman pits her wits against the most
  astute diplomatist in the world, he has not the faintest chance of out-man&oelig;uvring
  her. And he had already come to the conclusion within the last quarter of
  an hour that Aline Saint-Amand was both clever and ambitious.</p>
  <p>He had made no further remark after her last statement; he remained quite
  still, measuring his forces, reflecting on his next move, his next words,
  on which so much would depend. To gain time he took his cigarette-case out
  of his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she replied. At once she rose and went across
  the room to get a box of matches. Friesen thought how graceful she looked,
  how beautifully she was dressed in pale green taffeta shot with mauve, with
  a wide sash of purple velvet round her slim waist, and a bunch of dark violets
  in her fair chignon. Trained though he was by his calling in the art of concealing
  his thoughts, the diplomat could not altogether disguise the admiration for
  her beauty which his eyes expressed. Her every movement was perfect as she
  glided back towards him; as she struck a match&mdash;one of those abominable
  French matches which emit atrocious fumes of sulphur; as she held it above
  her head till it had finished its spluttering, and as she finally stooped
  to light his cigarette. Louis had spoken of her as adorable, and she certainly
  was that. Had he been a simple commoner he could have indulged his infatuation,
  and been lover and husband to this beautiful creature, but as Madame la Princesse
  had very properly said, it was not for this ambitious jade to throw herself
  athwart projects framed for the future of a dynasty and the destiny of France.</p>
  <p>Aline Saint-Amand with her inimitable grace fell back into the downy arm-chair
  opposite her visitor. Without seeming to do so, she contrived to arrange
  the folds of her voluminous skirt to their best advantage. She also allowed
  the distinguished diplomat a peep at the tip of her dainty shoe. She leaned
  back against the cushions of the chair, folded her hands together, fingered
  a diminutive lace handkerchief which somehow or other had replaced the wet
  rag of a while ago, and drew a deep, deep sigh which still sounded like a
  sob.</p>
  <p>Count Friesen took two or three puffs at his cigarette, before he spoke
  again. And presently he put the question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you form any idea, Mademoiselle, of His Majesty&rsquo;s whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied dolefully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.
  Would to God I could. Do you think I would remain here contentedly if I could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he put in quietly.</p>
  <p>Again he waited a moment or two, studying her face, trying to probe what
  went on behind that mask of ostentatious sorrow. Then he said very slowly
  and quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are those in high places, who would make it worth your while
  to&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At once she sat up straight; the picture of indignation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you take me for, Excellency?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A very clever young lady,&rdquo; was his gentle reply.</p>
  <p>She screwed up her eyes, looked at him quizzically for a few seconds. He
  returned her glance. It was a challenge from one adversary to another, the
  measuring of swords in preparation for a fight. On the diplomat&rsquo;s face
  there was the first suggestion of an ironical smile. For those few short
  seconds he thought he had won the day. Then Aline Saint-Amand rose from her
  chair very slowly; it was an obvious intimation of dismissal, forcing him
  to rise likewise. But though the intimation was obvious, her face was wreathed
  in smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do not let us quarrel, Excellency,&rdquo; she said, and allowed those
  appealing blue eyes of hers to rest sorrowfully upon him; &ldquo;we were
  such friends at Baden-Baden&mdash;And,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;are we not
  allies in the cause we each have at heart, the welfare of His Majesty the
  King of France?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stretched her hand out to him with the gesture of a queen dismissing
  a courtier. What could he do but bend his back and kiss the rose-tipped fingers?
  He was too great a gentleman, too experienced a diplomat, not to know that
  he had lost the fight.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Aline Saint-Amand rang the bell. A moment or two later a man-servant threw
  open the door, and after a last deep bow to his victorious adversary, Count
  Friesen went through into the hall. The door into the rose-coloured drawing-room
  had remained wide open. Friesen wondered if, unseen by him, Mademoiselle
  was watching his exit out of her house. He had been in it less than an hour.
  The servant helped him on with his overcoat, handed him his hat and stick
  and opened the door for him to go out.</p>
  <p>At that moment an agitated cry came from somewhere at the back of the house: &ldquo;Mademoiselle!
  Mademoiselle!&rdquo; and the fat old cook, moving with astonishing rapidity,
  appeared in the hall, brandishing what was obviously a letter. &ldquo;The
  courier has just come from Fort Dyck.&rdquo; She almost ran in her excitement.
  At the drawing-room door she was met by Aline Saint-Amand. But not the same
  Aline with whom Friesen had had the passage of arms just now, not the self-possessed
  Aline with the winning smile, the appealing eyes and tear-stained cheek,
  but a wrathful, not to say shrewish Aline, who looked as if she would have
  liked to take a stick to the unfortunate old cook. She snatched the letter
  out of the woman&rsquo;s hand and as she did so she met Friesen&rsquo;s glance
  as he was on the point of leaving. He smiled and bowed once more, and as
  quick as a flash of lightning her expression changed; she was again the Aline
  of a while ago, sorrowful, inviting sympathy in her helplessness and distress.
  And while it seemed as if fickle chance had suddenly turned the tables against
  her, there was something in that sudden change of expression which took the
  edge off Friesen&rsquo;s sense of victory.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>That same evening Count Friesen was back in Strasbourg and there took the
  night express for Paris. It was a long and fatiguing journey. None too comfortable
  either. But Friesen had so much to think about, the situation had become
  so complicated that he would not have slept that night even in the downiest
  of beds. True, he had emerged triumphant out of his interview with Mademoiselle
  Aline; that is to say, he knew that her story was partially true, that Louis
  had really been kidnapped by Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s secret police&mdash;a
  fact which he had disbelieved at first&mdash;and that he was now incarcerated
  at Fort Dyck. So much, the old cook&rsquo;s sudden appearance with the letter
  from there, and Aline&rsquo;s equally sudden flash of temper, had revealed
  to him. Nor was he in any doubt now that the whole thing had been engineered
  with the lady&rsquo;s connivance, or at any rate with her consent. But what
  her aim and object was in this game of hide-and-seek he could not determine
  to his own satisfaction, experienced though he was in every kind of political
  intrigue.</p>
  <p>Was her motive solely one of money? Had she been bribed heavily enough to
  induce her to betray her royal lover? Or had she some other designs conceived
  for her own advancement? Here certainly was a problem, which a mere man could
  not even attempt to elucidate.</p>
  <p>Anyhow there the situation was; delicate in the extreme and one that might
  demand diplomatic intervention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had better see the chief,&rdquo; Friesen decided within himself.</p>
  <p>His train left at eight. So he had a couple of hours before him. He sent
  his valet into the town to search for a reliable courier, while he sat down
  and wrote a few lines to Madame.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I not only have hope&rdquo; [he wrote], &ldquo;but
      the assurance of success. Do not lose heart. His Majesty is safe and well
      and I shall certainly be in touch with him within the next two or three
      days. We still have close on a week before us in which to bring all matters
      to a happy issue. I am off to-night to Paris, as I want to talk over the
      affair with Prince Metternich. He has such a wonderful brain, and also
      he would resent not having been consulted in this delicate affair. Should
      you desire to communicate with me, my secretary, who is still at the Hotel
      Stephanie, is entirely at your disposal. He will send your letter by special
  courier in the sealed Embassy post-bag.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;With deepest respect I am,<br>
  &ldquo;Your obedient servant,<br>
  &ldquo;Hugo Friesen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The valet had engaged a trustworthy courier to take this letter at once
  to Baden-Baden. A fast train left Strasbourg soon after seven o&rsquo;clock,
  arriving at the German watering-place three hours later. Madame la Princesse
  would surely still be up, and the courier had orders to rouse the household
  at the Villa Elisabeth. If anything untoward or unexpected had occurred in
  the last twenty-four hours, there would be time for Madame to write a letter
  and send it round to the Hotel Stephanie, where His Excellency&rsquo;s secretary
  would still be at work. The Embassy courier would then leave by the morning
  express for Paris, and Friesen would get Madame&rsquo;s letter the same evening.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>On the late afternoon of the day following his interview with Mademoiselle
  Saint-Amand, Count Friesen was on the station platform of the Gare du Nord
  in Paris, awaiting the arrival of the express from Baden-Baden. Punctual
  to the minute the train steamed into the station. The Embassy courier stepped
  out of a first-class compartment. Friesen accosted him and asked if there
  was a letter for him. There was.</p>
  <p>Leaving the courier to look after himself and the rest of the mail-bag,
  he jumped into a cab and drove back to the Hotel d&rsquo;Espagne, where he
  was staying. He sat down in his comfortable sitting-room to read Madame&rsquo;s
  letter. The envelope contained two letters; one was Madame&rsquo;s own, evidently
  written under the stress of great emotion. The other was an enclosure, and
  was signed Albert Christophe.</p>
  <p>Madame&rsquo;s was quite short.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;My dear Friend,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Your letter has put heart into me. I assure you it was sadly needed.
  The last few hours have been a positive nightmare. You can judge of this
  for yourself from the enclosed letter which I received this morning from
  Christophe. I do not know if he suspects that there is anything amiss. I
  shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if certain gossip had reached his ears. Perhaps he
  is only anxious for his daughter&rsquo;s sake to hurry things on. Anyway,
  I feel happier now that I have your letter. Once I have my Louis here, away
  from that woman&rsquo;s influence, I&rsquo;ll soon make him see reason. As
  for myself, I do agree with Christophe. The sooner the contract is signed
  the better it will be for all of us.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I am,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your grateful friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Inez
 de Bourbon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Baron Christophe&rsquo;s letter, on the other hand, was a long one. It was
  dated from Vienna and was couched in friendly, even deferential terms; but
  it was firm in its tone and very much to the point. Christophe was tired
  of delays and anxious about his daughter, who, though tremendously flattered
  and thrilled at the prospect of her marriage to the King of France, felt
  hurt at the idea that she was on probation, being weighed in the balance,
  as it were, while His Majesty was making up his mind whether he would have
  her or no.</p>
  <p>The financier then went on to say:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Knowing that your views on this grave matter coincide with mine,
  and as our respective decisions are quite irrevocable, I have now come to
  the conclusion, in my daughter&rsquo;s interest, that the sooner her engagement
  to His Majesty is made public the better it will be for all of us. As things
  now are I feel that we run the risk of V&eacute;ronique changing her mind.
  She is very young. Her emotions are easily stirred. Any day she might meet
  a man who would capture her affections and so work on them that all our projects
  suddenly came to naught. I know, Madame, that you will approve of what I
  have done. The first meeting between His Majesty and my daughter is to take
  place as arranged at your villa on the 23rd next. As the father of the future
  bride it was my duty to provide for the signing of the marriage contract
  and I have just completed all arrangements that it shall be signed that selfsame
  evening at your house, before the required witnesses, after which formality
  I shall have the honour of placing in His Majesty&rsquo;s hands my banker&rsquo;s
  draft for five hundred million francs.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;In anticipation of that happy evening I have already
      taken steps to have the engagement officially announced in Vienna, in Paris,
      in Rome and in Berlin. I am proud to say that His Majesty the Emperor of
      Austria, His Holiness the Pope, and His Majesty the King of Prussia are
  all sending special envoys to represent them on the great occasion.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Need I add that September 23rd, 1860,
      will be the happiest day of my life, as I hope and believe it will be equally
  so with you.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I am, Madame la Princesse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Your humble and devoted servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Albert
 Christophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he had finished reading these two letters, Count Friesen sat musing
  for some considerable time, staring into the lamplight. If he had put his
  thoughts into words, this is what he would have said: &ldquo;Old Christophe
  must have planned all this some time ago. He couldn&rsquo;t have made all
  these complicated arrangements in so short a time. Obviously he has heard
  gossip and he does not trust either Madame or His Majesty the King of France.
  Well! I don&rsquo;t blame him. Who would be fool enough to trust these Bourbons?&rdquo; He
  also would have added: &ldquo;Six days in which to put backbone into a weakling,
  and reason into a beautiful and rapacious woman&rsquo;s head. Well! We shall
  see what the chief has to say about it all. Here is his chance of justifying
  his reputation of being the greatest diplomatist of all times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But Chance once more took pleasure in embroiling the threads of all these
  peoples&rsquo; destinies, for when Count Friesen called at the Austrian Embassy
  that evening, he learned, to his chagrin, that &ldquo;the greatest diplomatist
  of all times,&rdquo; Prince Metternich, was absent on leave for three weeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That means going straight back to Strasbourg,&rdquo; Friesen muttered
  with a deep sigh of self-pity, &ldquo;and working this out alone, and only
  six days to do it in! Six days to get a political prisoner out of a French
  fortress and drag him, willy-nilly, across the frontier! Well! More difficult
  problems than these have been solved before now, but not in the face of a
  woman who means to have her own way&mdash;and not,&rdquo; he added to himself, &ldquo;single-handed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rose from the comfortable chair in which he had been sitting. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he
  went on musing, &ldquo;since Fate, it seems, has willed it, let&rsquo;s see
  what the other man has got to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>It was a beautiful autumn evening. One of the finest Paris had experienced
  this September. Parisians were all out like flies, on the river, in the Bois,
  dining at outdoor restaurants, under the trees or vine-clad arbours. But
  as it was &ldquo;cassoulette&rdquo; day at the Trois Rois, the restaurant
  had been as crowded as it usually was on those occasions. They had all been
  there for dinner, the great ones of the Parisian artistic and literary coterie:
  Delacroix and Jean Auguste Ingres, Charles Gounod and Georges Bizet, Alexandre
  Dumas and Gustave Flaubert and a multitude of other lesser lights. But now
  they had finished their cassoulette, drunk their coffee, paid their bills
  and gone. For them Bohemia was just an interlude. The fashionable world,
  back from having drunk the waters of foreign spas, demanded toll of their
  time. The author of <i>Madame Bovary</i> was due at a soir&eacute;e given
  in his honour by the Duchesse de Mouchy. The painter of &ldquo;<i>La Source</i>&rdquo; had
  promised to meet Prince Soltikoff at Tortoni&rsquo;s. The creator of <i>The
  Three Musketeers</i> was expected to put in an appearance in Madame Alphonse
  de Rothschild&rsquo;s box at the Fran&ccedil;ais. One by one they passed
  through the swing doors out into the Square. Once past the archway and in
  the Rue de Clichy, the majority of them picked up cabs&mdash;some of them
  had their carriages waiting for them&mdash;and were wafted into the fashionable
  world where dwelt princesses and duchesses and financiers who bought their
  pictures and read their books.</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand was also thinking of going&mdash;not into the fashionable
  world wherein he had no part, but back to his studio, where a cheerful fire
  would be smouldering in the small iron stove, and where a capacious chair
  was ready for him, together with a pair of well-worn slippers and the latest
  novel of young Dumas. It was then close on nine o&rsquo;clock. Cyril had
  risen from the table and was reaching for his hat when a man came in through
  the swing doors and walked straight up to him with outstretched hand. Cyril
  did not recognise him at first, not until a pleasant voice said lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They told me I should find you here. I am in luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Count Friesen. Cyril, who was genuinely delighted to see him, said
  simply: &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; and shook warmly the hand that was cordially
  extended to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you had dinner?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything, thanks,&rdquo; the Austrian replied. &ldquo;What I would
  like is a chat with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril looked ruefully about him. Most of the customers had gone. The waiters
  had that air peculiar to them of wanting to shoo the remaining ones off.
  Some of the lights had already been turned out. After the gaiety of a while
  ago the place looked dark and uninviting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t mind a ramshackle, musty studio&mdash;&rdquo; he
  said to his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind?&rdquo; the other retorted gaily. &ldquo;I should love it. Let&rsquo;s
  go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two men went together across the Square. The <i>femme de m&eacute;nage</i> let
  them in and brought a lighted lamp into the room. A nice warm glow came from
  the small iron stove. Cyril drew a couple of cosy arm-chairs before it and
  invited his friend to sit down and to smoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t any cigars good enough to offer you,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but perhaps you prefer a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks! I won&rsquo;t smoke just now. I am not much of a smoker at
  any time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down, and Cyril said: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind if I light my pipe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you to,&rdquo; Friesen responded. &ldquo;It makes
  you look more English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This remark made Cyril smile. &ldquo;I hope not to my detriment,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most decidedly not. As a matter of fact, it is to the English side
  of you, my friend, that I am going to appeal to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Appeal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I came to see you this evening with the intention of asking
  your help in a very delicate affair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; was Cyril&rsquo;s simple reply to this.</p>
  <p>Friesen now was watching him intently, studying the face which he already
  knew well, trying to guess what effect his distinctly extravagant proposal
  would have on this curiously arresting individual of mixed blood and mercurial
  temperament. Cyril was still standing, intent on lighting his pipe; the flickering
  match lit up the outline of the brow, square and straight, and the quivering,
  sensitive nostrils. A strong face, Friesen thought, the face of a man who
  would love and hate intensely, who would be capable on occasion of sublime
  sacrifice or satanic revenge. Well! the die was cast. There was no going
  back now. Friesen before he came to-night had made up his mind as to the
  very words he was going to use, so, after a short moment of reflection, he
  said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The affair concerns your brother&mdash;or half-brother&mdash;His
  Majesty the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril only said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; to that. He blew out the match, sat down,
  puffed away at his pipe, and waited in silence, his face quite expressionless,
  for his friend to continue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your brother&mdash;or half-brother&mdash;my good Bertrand, is at
  this moment in a perilous position. It is just on the cards that even his
  life is in danger. At best his whole future, the future of his race and the
  royalist cause are gravely imperilled, unless energetic measures are taken
  on his behalf. You understand me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; Cyril replied; &ldquo;but in any case I don&rsquo;t
  see how the future of the Bourbon family is going to interest me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, my friend,&rdquo; Friesen made haste
  to protest. &ldquo;I am not going to appeal to you on the grounds of dynasty
  or royalist cause. As you say, these are not likely to interest you. I merely
  want your help&mdash;and I need it badly, I assure you&mdash;on humanitarian
  grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That sounds funny!&rdquo; Cyril remarked dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so funny as you think. Let me tell you what has happened. His
  Majesty has been in Strasbourg on what one might call propaganda work. The
  garrison there being known for its royalist tendencies, the King wished to
  talk to the men, to interview the officers, to rally as many as he could
  round the old fleur-de-lys flag. As you know, perhaps, every pretender to
  the throne of France, both Bourbon and Orleans are, by law, exiled from their
  country. His Majesty knows that quite well, yet he did not hesitate to court
  the danger of arrest and imprisonment for the sake of his cause and of his
  rights. Unfortunately, the inevitable did happen. He was tracked by Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s
  secret police, taken prisoner and conveyed to the fortress of Dyck, where
  he now is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril had listened in silence to all this. Pulling away at his pipe, and
  staring at the red glow of the stove, he seemed absorbed in thought. The
  diplomat had measured his words well. He knew that it would not be through
  mere compassion for a helpless weakling that he would enlist the assistance
  of this virile, somewhat embittered dare-devil. He therefore dwelt more particularly
  on the dangers which had beset His Majesty when he went to France; dangers
  which he had deliberately faced. As it was impossible to guess what effect
  this first expos&eacute; of the situation had had on his friend, who continued
  to smoke and to muse in silence, Friesen went on after a moment&rsquo;s pause:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you that it is just on the cards that His Majesty&rsquo;s
  life&mdash;your brother&rsquo;s, my dear Bertrand&mdash;is in danger. He
  is very delicate; his lungs are affected as his father&rsquo;s were. A long
  detention in a dank fortress will surely be the death of him. Quite apart
  from His Majesty&rsquo;s great importance in the political arena of to-day,
  it seems to me a terrible, an inhuman thing to allow a young man to perish
  miserably in prison, away from his mother, his kindred and his friends, all
  of them powerless to save him. Directly I heard of the awful catastrophe
  I rushed over here to consult with my chief at the Austrian Embassy. You
  may or may not know that my Emperor is deeply interested in the future of
  His Majesty, who, of course, is his near kinsman. The political aims of my
  government all tend towards the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne
  of France. So I wished first of all to put the case before Prince Metternich,
  so that he might set our diplomatic machinery to work for the immediate release
  of His Majesty the King. Unfortunately His Excellency is away on leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once again Friesen paused. His next words, he knew, would be the turning-point
  of this interview. Everything would depend on how Cyril Bertrand took them.
  But as nothing could be gained by postponing the momentous issue he said
  quietly after a second or two:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so I came to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time Cyril burst into loud laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo; he exclaimed: &ldquo;Why in the world&mdash;? Well!
  If that isn&rsquo;t the best joke I&rsquo;ve heard for many a day. Even supposing,&rdquo; he
  went on more seriously, &ldquo;I cared a brass farthing what happened to
  my half-brother, or to the whole lot of the Bourbons for that matter&mdash;even
  if I was fool enough to care, what could <i>I</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen looked at him keenly. Cyril&rsquo;s first outburst of hilarity had
  quickly turned to one of bitterness. Well, even bitterness was better than
  indifference. Apparently it did not prove discouraging to Count Friesen,
  who resumed with seeming irrelevance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are more English than French, my dear Bertrand, and I am sure
  you are well acquainted with the wonderful literature of your father&rsquo;s
  country. Tell me, have you ever read a book by one of your most distinguished
  writers of to-day, Charles Dickens&mdash;a book which he published last year
  called <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I have,&rdquo; Cyril replied, frowning, slightly puzzled
  for the moment.</p>
  <p>Friesen said: &ldquo;A wonderful book, with a thrilling episode in it. Well!&rdquo; he
  went on slowly, &ldquo;do you see why I asked you that question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril obviously did. Not at first. But gradually it broke upon him like
  a light that is slowly turned higher and higher. He returned his friend&rsquo;s
  glance with a still puzzled and questioning look as much as to say: &ldquo;Am
  I mad or are you?&rdquo; But Friesen looked grave. Solemn even. No one could
  doubt, least of all Cyril, that he meant all that he had left unsaid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think for a moment,&rdquo; Friesen hastened to
  add, speaking more lightly, &ldquo;that I would presume to suggest your sacrificing
  your life for a person or a cause which, as you rightly say, is nothing to
  you. All I am doing is to propose for your consideration what I would call
  a first-class adventure, which I am certain will appeal to you, first of
  all because you would be the means of actually saving a life which is precious
  to many, and also chiefly because, as I say, you are more English than French,
  and first-class adventures always make a strong appeal to your nation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an old-fashioned clock up on the wall; it ticked and ticked sixty
  times and more before either man spoke again. The sounds of the world outside,
  the rumble of cab wheels, the clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs on the cobble-stones,
  the laughter or chatter of passers-by hardly reached this backwater of the
  busy city. The only sounds that broke the silence in the dimly-lit studio
  were the ticking of the old clock and the gentle soughing of the south-easterly
  breeze round the old-fashioned square.</p>
  <p>All at once Friesen said: &ldquo;The first time I ever saw you, I was struck
  by your extraordinary resemblance to His Majesty the King of France. All
  you need do is to shave and have your hair closely trimmed. That would be
  quite enough to deceive the governor and warders of Fort Dyck. By virtue
  of my diplomatic status I can get permission to visit the prisoner. I suggest
  your coming with me and, if necessary, changing clothes with His Majesty.
  You could then remain in the fortress while His Majesty walked quietly out
  of it with me. Your detention there would only be a matter of a day or two,
  a few hours perhaps. As soon as the prison authorities had discovered the
  substitution you would, of course, be released. My government would certainly
  see to that. Anyway I don&rsquo;t suppose that this slight spice of danger
  would deter you. And I would pledge my country&rsquo;s honour that your life
  would be safe. Now, do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril gave a short laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me if I say that I don&rsquo;t quite see the object
  of all this play-acting. You say that Prince Metternich could set machinery
  going that would effect my brother&rsquo;s release. You also say that Prince
  Metternich is away on leave. Well, surely you can communicate with him, or
  better still with your government; you can set machinery going too, without
  having recourse to&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;that rather fantastic stratagem.
  Then why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because unfortunately time is dead against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean? Time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty must be back in Baden-Baden by next Saturday or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or he will lose his throne.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril gave a shrug, which plainly reiterated what he had already said, namely
  that he did not care one brass farthing about that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! I know! I know!&rdquo; Friesen rejoined with a short, impatient
  sigh; &ldquo;you do not care. <i>C&rsquo;est entendu.</i> His Majesty is
  nothing to you. Your half-brother and no more. Good. But what about the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril gave an involuntary jump. &ldquo;The girl?&rdquo; he queried, frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes! V&eacute;ronique Christophe. Think of the awful position
  the unfortunate girl will be in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say. Mademoiselle Christophe is officially engaged to
  His Majesty. All the principal Chancelleries of Europe have been apprised
  of the fact. The Emperor of Austria, His Holiness the Pope, the King of Prussia,
  to name only a few, are sending special envoys to represent them at the signing
  of the marriage contract, which ceremony will take place in your mother&rsquo;s
  house in Baden-Baden on Saturday next. Now just think of the position if
  His Majesty does not put in an appearance on that occasion. Think of the
  gossip, the scandal all round the poor girl publicly insulted by being jilted
  at the eleventh hour. I won&rsquo;t even speak of her affections, of the
  romantic love which she feels for her unknown fianc&eacute;, or of her girlish
  ambition, all of which will receive such a terrible, such a humiliating blow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then as Cyril remained silent, staring thoughtfully into the lamplight,
  Friesen went on with great earnestness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If only for the girl&rsquo;s sake, my dear Bertrand, lend me a hand
  in this. Think of her standing before the world in the humiliating position
  of a woman jilted. Already His Majesty&rsquo;s name has been linked by all
  the gossip-mongers of Europe with that of Mademoiselle Saint-Amand. If the
  marriage doesn&rsquo;t take place&mdash;and, mind you, old Christophe will
  never forgive the insult, he is the most obstinate man you can meet in a
  day&rsquo;s march&mdash;the whole world will say that V&eacute;ronique was
  jilted because of the pretty <i>prima donna</i>. And she was to have been
  Queen of France! Think what that means, and how the crowd of harpies, envious
  of her beauty and good fortune, will jeer at her and gloat over her discomfiture.
  V&eacute;ronique Christophe is a high-mettled girl. I do believe that the
  humiliation will half kill her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old clock went ticking on sixty and a hundred times and still Cyril
  remained silent and thoughtful. His eyes went roaming round the old studio
  where V&eacute;ronique had sat for her portrait, where he had lived through
  those blessed, blessed hours which could never have their like again. With
  characteristic piety he had left everything just as it was after the last
  sitting. The platform was in its old position, with the piece of shabby carpet
  on it and the stool on which her prettily-shod foot had rested. There was
  the chair on which she had sat&mdash;the only nice piece of furniture in
  the room. He had bought it on purpose for the portrait, and gone two days
  without his dinner, and pawned his overcoat and his watch to pay for it.
  The easel was still on the same spot where it had stood when she came close
  to it in order to look at the picture. And on a small table nearby was the
  wineglass, just where she had put it down. Except for dusting and cleaning
  no one had ever been allowed to displace any of these things. The old <i>femme
  de m&eacute;nage</i> who had charge of the studio did indeed think one day
  that Monsieur had gone mad, for he fell into a fury just because she had
  washed a wineglass and put it away in a cupboard. Monsieur took it out of
  the cupboard and replaced it upon the table, and threatened her with instant
  dismissal if she ever moved it again.</p>
  <p>And now when the blessed name V&eacute;ronique fell from his friend&rsquo;s
  lips, Cyril&rsquo;s glance wandered around the studio, as it so often did,
  and he felt as if suddenly something of her had come back; as if her sweet
  spirit had returned to fill the musty old place with the exquisiteness of
  her personality.</p>
  <p>And then he thought of her as Friesen had described; thrown over by her
  fianc&eacute;, laughed at, humiliated, the prey of evil-minded gossips, and
  the thought was so intolerable that he nearly cried out in vigorous protest
  at the bare possibility of such an outrage.</p>
  <p>It was Friesen&rsquo;s turn now to watch in silence. He watched his friend;
  scrutinising the thoughtful face, the earnest eyes which quite involuntarily
  had revealed the secret that Cyril had thought for ever buried in his heart.
  Friesen would not have been the shrewd diplomatist and experienced man of
  the world if he had not guessed that secret. It was for him an altogether
  new phase of this extraordinary situation. It had never entered his mind
  that Cyril Bertrand might be in love with V&eacute;ronique Christophe; that
  the artist had succumbed to the fascination of the sitter. But obviously
  this was the case. There was no mistaking the light that suddenly flashed
  in Cyril&rsquo;s eyes when first the girl&rsquo;s name was mentioned, nor
  the meaning of that vague, contemplative look in his face now. Well! That
  was all to the good. Friesen had so much at stake in this affair, both for
  his own sake and that of his Emperor, that the thought of exploiting his
  friend&rsquo;s heartache in order to gain his ends didn&rsquo;t strike him
  as inhuman. Anyway that is what he now determined to do. Cyril&rsquo;s love
  for V&eacute;ronique would be a magnificent lever wherewith to force his
  hand; nor had Friesen any doubt now of the success of his plan. He leaned
  back in his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. It is always pleasant to feel
  that a well-laid scheme has not &ldquo;gone agley.&rdquo; He took his cigarette-case
  out or his pocket, struck a match, lit a cigarette and threw the match down
  again. But Cyril never moved. He stared into the lamplight or let his eyes
  roam round the dark corners of the room. He seemed entirely oblivious of
  his friend&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>After a time Friesen asked: &ldquo;Well! What do you say?&rdquo; But he
  had to ask the question three times before he had an answer. The old clock
  had ticked five times sixty seconds before Cyril appeared to come back from
  the land of dreams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo; he queried in the tone of a man suddenly wakened
  out of sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of my &lsquo;fantastic stratagem&rsquo; now that
  you know all its consequences?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I still think it fantastic,&rdquo; Cyril replied slowly, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will go to Fort Dyck with you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; Friesen rejoined simply. Then added gravely: &ldquo;Your
  word on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My word of honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen rose and so did Cyril. Friesen stretched out his hand, and Cyril
  put his in it. The Austrian took a kind of comprehensive look at his friend
  as he stood there before him, straight and tall, scarcely taller than his
  brother but of splendid build. And holding on to that hand&mdash;the hand
  of an artist, but also of a fighter&mdash;he thought: &ldquo;What a fine
  king he would have made! Why should Nature have been so erratic in apportioning
  her gifts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Aloud he said: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be going now. But I&rsquo;ll call
  in to-morrow about nine. Unfortunately we cannot go by the morning train,
  as I must see about getting an order to visit the prisoner in the fortress,
  and the bureaux don&rsquo;t open before ten. If I go without an order we
  should have endless trouble and delays. But the night express gets into Strasbourg
  in the forenoon, and there is a local train which will take us to Leissen,
  within a driving distance of Fort Dyck. I don&rsquo;t know at what time it
  gets in, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if we do get in late. It will be all
  to the good if we pay our visit in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook Cyril once more warmly by the hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going away a happier man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than when I
  came.&rdquo; And he added more earnestly: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything
  about risks in this affair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need you?&rdquo; Cyril broke in, smiling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only because I want to assure you that my government will see to
  it that you will not suffer in any way through it. Beyond a few days&rsquo; detention&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall find the barber&rsquo;s shop closed,&rdquo; Cyril broke in
  once more, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right! All right! I won&rsquo;t say any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Laughing he took his leave. At the door he turned finally to his friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind!&rdquo; he said lightly, and put up an admonitory finger, &ldquo;a
  close shave and a good crop.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>But Cyril did not go out again that evening. He spent a long, long time
  staring into nothingness, buried in thoughts, thinking of V&eacute;ronique&mdash;of
  V&eacute;ronique mourning for the loss of her dreams, of V&eacute;ronique
  weeping with humiliation, of V&eacute;ronique, always of V&eacute;ronique.
  The thought that he could save her both from sorrow and humiliation was very
  sweet&mdash;bitter-sweet, perhaps&mdash;because anyway she was lost to him,
  so what did anything else matter? His word was pledged to his friend, and
  he did not regret his promise. She would be happy. She would&mdash;perhaps&mdash;be
  Queen of France one day. Queen V&eacute;ronique, married to a miserable softling
  who didn&rsquo;t even appreciate her beauty, who only cared for the money
  that her fond father would give him. Or for his throne. Lover-like, with
  the arrogant foolishness of youth, Cyril thought: &ldquo;If the throne were
  mine, I would barter it for her love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At one time during the night he actually went to bed. Whether he slept or
  not he didn&rsquo;t know. He most certainly dreamed. Stupid, senseless dreams
  that made his heartache worse when finally he woke. He got up early and went
  round to the barber&rsquo;s at eight o&rsquo;clock. When, half an hour later,
  he looked into the glass, he hardly recognised his own face. &ldquo;Am I
  really like that effeminate brother of mine now?&rdquo; he said to himself.
  The barber who had shaved him and cropped his hair remarked facetiously: &ldquo;If
  Monsieur has committed a crime, he can easily evade the police. No one would
  know him now and I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>When Cyril got back to the studio he found a telegram waiting for him. The <i>femme
   de m&eacute;nage</i> had laid it on the table beside his breakfast tray.
   A telegram! That was funny. Cyril couldn&rsquo;t remember ever having received
   a telegram before. And at this hour, too! It must have come overnight,
   and not been delivered till the morning. He fingered the folded bit of
   blue paper, turning it over and over between his fingers. Somehow he was
   half afraid of opening it. He didn&rsquo;t believe that it was actually
   intended for him. Indeed, he half hoped that it was not.</p>
  <p>The <i>femme de m&eacute;nage</i> came in just then with a basket full of
  wood for the fire. At sight of Cyril she gave a scream, and dropped the basket.
  The wood made a terrible clatter, falling on the floor. Cyril didn&rsquo;t
  know at first why she should stare at him so, with round, terrified eyes.
  Then he remembered. Of course, she had not recognised him; thought, perhaps,
  that he was a burglar, or at best a stranger. He laughed, that merry, infectious
  laugh of youth, which the old woman had not heard often of late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, do you, Ang&egrave;le?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N-n-n-no, monsieur,&rdquo; Ang&egrave;le replied stammering, very
  confused and frightened, wondering perhaps if this strange man would proceed
  to murder her presently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me all right enough, though. Monsieur Bertrand, you know,
  Ang&egrave;le, who paints the pictures and makes a mess in the studio.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He suddenly remembered the telegram and went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pick up the wood, my good woman. I am quite harmless; I promise not
  to attack you from the rear. And then you can tell me who brought this telegram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ang&egrave;le, still doubtful, with one eye on this strange monsieur with
  the smooth face and the tidy hair, proceeded to gather the wood back into
  the basket. She murmured, partly to herself: &ldquo;What a pity! What a pity!
  Such a beautiful silky beard! And such a lovely colour! And so becoming!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When she had put the basket down in its regular place beside the fire, and
  cleared up the mess on the floor which the wood had made, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The postman brought the telegram for Monsieur, of course; not five
  minutes after Monsieur had gone out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was quite sure it was for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But yes, monsieur. It has your name and address on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So it had. &ldquo;Cyril Bertrand. Square R&eacute;aumur No. 14,&rdquo; was
  clear enough. There was no doubt the telegram was for him. The <i>femme de
  m&eacute;nage</i> went out, with a parting admonition to Monsieur not to
  let his coffee get cold; and Cyril tore open the flap of the missive with
  fingers that were anything but steady.</p>
  <p>The telegram was worded in English and this is what it said:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Have to acquaint you of the sudden death of Lord Longueville, following
  an accident while shooting. You are his next of kin. Please come immediately.
  Carben and Houston, Solicitors, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril read those few words three times before he as much as began to take
  in their meaning. He laid the blue paper out on the table, and smoothed out
  its creases. Then he sat down, poured himself out a cup of coffee, broke
  his roll and buttered it. Took a bite. Read the telegram through for the
  fourth time and tried to co-ordinate his thoughts.</p>
  <p>Firstly the signature. &ldquo;Carben and Houston, Solicitors.&rdquo; Cyril
  remembered that years and years ago, when he was a mere lad, come to Paris
  to seek his fortune in the art world, he had had some communication signed
  Carben and Houston, Solicitors. He didn&rsquo;t remember, however, what the
  communication was about, or why those London solicitors had taken the trouble
  to find out where and how he lived. But they did find out at the time&mdash;through
  the police perhaps&mdash;and that was all about it.</p>
  <p>Secondly the name &ldquo;Longueville.&rdquo; Lord Longueville. Cyril knew
  that somewhere in England he had a cousin, a nephew of his father&rsquo;s
  whose name was Francis Bertrand, and who was Lord Longueville. But neither
  he nor that cousin had ever taken any notice of one another. Cyril had never
  troubled his head about any Lord Longueville. He didn&rsquo;t even know if
  Francis was married, if he had any children, if he was rich or impecunious.
  He didn&rsquo;t know where he lived or what he did with himself. Apparently
  he spent some of his time in killing things and now, seemingly, an accident
  while shooting had made an end of him. But did this fact affect him, Cyril
  Bertrand, in any way? Certainly not. Why should it? The man was dead and
  that was all there was to it. Why these London solicitors should have gone
  to the lengths of sending a telegram&mdash;which, by the way, must have cost
  a mint of money&mdash;Cyril couldn&rsquo;t imagine. That is, he couldn&rsquo;t
  imagine, just at first. Presently, while he drank his coffee&mdash;which,
  by the way, was no longer hot&mdash;it all dawned upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are his next of kin,&rdquo; the telegram said, which meant that
  through this accident while shooting, he, Cyril Bertrand, the impecunious
  artist of Montmartre had suddenly become a person of consequence&mdash;a
  man with a title&mdash;with money, perhaps&mdash;anyway, Somebody. Well!
  What of it? What in the world did it matter? A little while ago&mdash;how
  long? a few months or an eternity?&mdash;it might have made all the difference
  in the world. V&eacute;ronique then was not engaged to his half-brother&mdash;a
  wretched weakling, but, nevertheless, according to a great many people, King
  of France&mdash;she had not then been promised that one day she would be
  queen, she was hardly out of the schoolroom then, she was heartfree. Oh,
  yes! Then, it would have made a difference. If this miserable telegram had
  come in the immediate wake of those blessed, blessed hours, he, Cyril Bertrand,
  could have gone down on his knees before the rich financier&rsquo;s daughter
  and offered her a historic name, a title, some fine old castle, probably,
  in England, to which she would gladly have come as his wife. Oh, yes! It
  would have been all right then. But now?</p>
  <p>Cyril&rsquo;s next impulse was to throw the damned thing into the fire. &ldquo;Please
  come immediately.&rdquo; Here was impertinence!! He was not coming immediately.
  Perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t come at all. Let Carben and Houston and the lot
  of them all go to the devil for aught he cared. Anyway, he wouldn&rsquo;t
  come until after he had redeemed his promise to his friend; not till after
  he had gone with him to Fort Dyck and played the role of a farcical Sidney
  Carton, so that the most perfect of God&rsquo;s creatures might bestow her
  priceless favours on an effete and weak-kneed kingling. With an almost savage
  oath he crushed the blue paper in his clenched hand, ready to throw the miserable
  thing into the fire, when he heard a light, elastic step cross the stone-paved
  corridor that lay between his studio and the outside door.</p>
  <p>The old clock was just striking nine. A pleasant voice called out: &ldquo;Here
  I am!&rdquo; as the studio door was thrown open, and Count Friesen came in.</p>
  <p>Cyril stuffed the ball of blue paper into the drawer of the bureau.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Count Friesen had called out: &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; and closed the door
  behind him. He took off his hat, put it down and then called again: &ldquo;Here
  I&mdash;&rdquo; but this time he paused with mouth agape and eyes nearly
  starting out of his head. Then he broke into loud laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid, my dear fellow! Splendid!&rdquo; he exclaimed and took
  hold of Cyril by both shoulders. &ldquo;Your own mother wouldn&rsquo;t know
  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril came down from the clouds. He shrugged and passed his hand over his
  lips and chin. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes, this good old beard
  is gone! I have already scared old Ang&egrave;le out of her wits. Is it all
  right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely perfect. How did you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Liar,&rdquo; said Friesen gaily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you
  slept a wink. I know I didn&rsquo;t. Seriously though,&rdquo; he went on
  more soberly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t try and meet any of your friends. We don&rsquo;t
  necessarily want your metamorphosis to become the talk of the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cyril rejoined lightly. &ldquo;I am not of
  sufficient importance to cause a stir anywhere. But I won&rsquo;t go to my
  usual haunts. In fact, I shan&rsquo;t go out at all to-day. I have a few
  things to do. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good. I am just going to see the Minister of the Interior, whom I
  know personally, and who will give me the order I want. Our train is at 6.15
  from the Gare de l&rsquo;Est. I&rsquo;ll call for you here at a quarter before
  six. We have a nasty night journey before us and a racketing day to-morrow,
  so I shall take it very quietly all afternoon: and I advise you to do the
  same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the two friends took leave of one another for the day.</p>
  <p>At 6.15 that same afternoon they started on their way. The following morning
  they stepped out of the local train on the platform of Leissen, the small
  wayside station which was within a drive of Fort Dyck. The night journey
  had not only been wearisome, it was also very dirty. But the travellers had
  had a couple of hours&rsquo; wait at Strasbourg. They had washed and they
  had breakfasted before they took train for Leissen. Here they had a hasty,
  but otherwise excellent luncheon, and by putting a few very casual questions
  to the station-master and to the drivers of the ramshackle vehicles in the
  yard, Friesen found, to his satisfaction, that nothing was known locally
  of any new or exalted prisoner in the fortress. Ostensibly he and Cyril Bertrand
  were tourists interested in the natural beauties of the countryside and in
  its ancient buildings. Cyril had also provided himself with a portable easel
  and materials for sketching, and anyway there did not seem to be the slightest
  danger of their arousing the suspicion of the village constabulary. Friesen
  had the order from the Minister of the Interior in his pocket, so everything
  so far was plain sailing.</p>
  <p>They hired one of the ramshackle flies and desired to be driven to Fort
  Dyck.</p>
  <p>There had been some heavy rains in the district in the past few days, but
  to-day the sun was showing to the sodden world just what it could do in the
  way of brilliance and beauty, even though autumn was already knocking at
  the door. The air was soft and had in it the tang of wet earth and of damp
  vegetation. In this high altitude there had already been a few night frosts
  and the leaves of beech and plane and sycamore were turning to gold. Far
  away the heights of Kaisersberg and St. Diedler rose from out the sea of
  pines, dense, dark masses which a giant hand had covered with a coating of
  rich purple, trenchant against the intense blue of the sky. Down below, the
  turbulent Breusch sent a multisonous gurgle echoing upwards and around as
  if it tried to drown the tinkle of the little church bell calling the faithful
  to Vespers. It was a day and a sight that would gladden the heart and eye
  of any man with a feeling for poesy, but even Cyril&rsquo;s eyes were blind
  to all the beauty of it, whilst Friesen&rsquo;s glance was fixed on a height
  in the near distance, where the ruined towers of Fort Dyck could be seen
  peeping out now and then among the pines.</p>
  <p>Soon the carriage left the small township behind and began the ascent up
  the mountain-side. The road wound through the forest and the gradient was
  fairly steep. The driver put his horses at foot pace, and the two men got
  out of the carriage, glad to stretch their legs and to enjoy to the full
  the soothing scent of the pines.</p>
  <p>Half an hour&rsquo;s climb brought them up to the castle. Seen at close
  quartets it looked neither imposing nor picturesque. With the characteristic
  vandalism of the time, the French military authorities had taken it over,
  restored the main portion of the buildings without any regard to style or
  historic associations, and with nothing but utilitarianism in view. Two old
  towers had alone been permitted to fall into ruins. Originally built of red
  sandstone and mantled in ivy, they did to a certain extent retrieve the barbarism
  of the rest of the building.</p>
  <p>The approach to the main entrance wound through a narrow street of small
  houses, sordid in appearance, in the doorways of which groups of children
  and a few women stood gaping at the carriage as it came up the hill-side,
  and at the two strangers whom they took to be tourists come to view the castle.
  Friesen ordered the driver to wait at a convenient spot, and he and Cyril
  then made their way to the front gate. Sentry stood at the gate. Friesen
  exhibited the official document, which bore the stamp of the Ministry of
  the Interior and gave him the entry into the castle, and the two men were
  allowed to pass inside. Here they were met by a sergeant in uniform, and
  to him also Friesen exhibited the official document. The sergeant muttered
  something which was ununderstandable, and went off in the direction of the
  courtyard, leaving the two visitors standing under the archway of the gate.</p>
  <p>A few moments later, the sergeant came back, this time with a young lieutenant,
  also in uniform. The lieutenant had the document in his hand. He gave a military
  salute and asked: &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte Friesen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est moi</i>,&rdquo; Friesen replied: &ldquo;and this is
  Monsieur Bertrand, my private secretary.&rdquo; He pointed to the paper in
  the officer&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I have this order from Monsieur le Ministre
  himself. I presume it is in order?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly in order, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; the lieutenant replied, &ldquo;but
  evidently Monsieur le Ministre didn&rsquo;t know that the prisoner in question
  is no longer with us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen frowned. &ldquo;How do you mean? No longer with you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The prisoner was only here five days. Yesterday the Commandant had
  orders from the Chief of Police to release him. Two officers of the secret
  police arrived in a carriage to fetch him and they drove away with him. It
  was some time in the forenoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where did they take His&mdash;er&mdash;the prisoner to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lieutenant smiled. &ldquo;They had secret orders, Monsieur le Comte.
  Even if I knew I could say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That, of course, was obvious. All Friesen said was:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can I see the Commandant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
  <p>The young officer escorted the two visitors across the yard to the Commandant&rsquo;s
  quarters. Friesen was doing his best to hide his mortification. Here was
  an eventuality that he had not even thought of when he planned his &ldquo;fantastic
  stratagem,&rdquo; and it now looked as if the whole edifice of his policy
  would tumble about his ears, unless the Commandant proved communicative&mdash;which,
  frankly, was not very likely. As for Cyril, he was partly amused, and partly
  sorry for his friend; there was a certain element of grim humour in the way
  Fate had so unexpectedly cut through the thread and thrum of the clever diplomatist&rsquo;s
  pet schemes. Cyril knew that Friesen would be terribly mortified if they
  went agley. After the marvellous ingenuity which he had displayed in the
  devising of his plan, to see it all fall to the ground owing to this unexpected
  turn in the wheel of chance, would mean, Cyril knew, a serious set-back to
  his friend&rsquo;s hitherto successful career. Strangely enough his thoughts
  over this turn did not immediately fly to V&eacute;ronique, and what the
  failure of Friesen&rsquo;s plan would mean to her. If indeed there was going
  to be a failure.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The Commandant, a starchy old fellow, for whom military discipline and the
  prestige of the army were nothing short of religion, was extremely amiable.
  He knew what was due to the representative of a great and friendly Empire,
  even though such a representative had the misfortune of being a mere civilian.
  But the visitor being an &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; Colonel Bouchard received
  him with a military salute; offered him and his &ldquo;private secretary&rdquo; a
  chair; and even went to the length of suggesting that he would be honoured
  if Monsieur le Comte and Monsieur Bertrand would drink a glass of wine with
  him.</p>
  <p>Friesen very courteously declined the wine and went at once to the point.
  He had an order from Monsieur le Ministre himself to visit the prisoner in
  the fortress. Was it a fact that that same prisoner had been released the
  day before by order of the Chief of Police?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Secret orders,&rdquo; the Commandant put in somewhat curtly. &ldquo;Yes,
  Monsieur le Comte, that is so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps,&rdquo; Friesen continued in as matter-of-fact a way
  as he could, taking it for granted that of course the Commandant would immediately
  comply with his request, &ldquo;perhaps you would kindly let me know where&mdash;er&mdash;your
  late prisoner now is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon Colonel Bouchard adjusted his tunic which already sat upon him
  like a glove and said sternly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have already had the honour to inform Your Excellency that the
  orders which I received from His Majesty the Emperor&rsquo;s Chief of Police
  were secret orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And his attitude while he spoke was so uncompromising that Friesen realised
  at once that there was nothing more to be done. To argue further would only
  have entailed further rebuke from the old soldier who obviously was within
  his rights, and a consequent loss of dignity. So he said nothing more. A
  moment or two later he rose to take his leave. Colonel Bouchard accompanied
  him to the door, saluted the representative of the great and friendly Empire,
  and with a sigh of satisfaction closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>And that was all about it.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>4</b></h3>
  <p>Except for one remark which fell, with a deep sigh, from Friesen&rsquo;s
  lips, the drive back was carried on in silence. Less even than before did
  the two men take note of the beauty of this glorious autumn afternoon with
  the sun slowly sinking behind Kaisersberg and throwing a gorgeous mantle
  of crimson and gold on the crests of the stately pines and the leaf-laden
  branches of beech and sycamore, softly quivering under the kiss of the evening
  breeze. On the east side the line of mountains and rocks glowed with an exquisite
  rose-coloured radiance, and down in the valley the Breusch, stained with
  the same exquisite hue, gurgled gently on.</p>
  <p>But what was all this beauty to men engaged in the difficult task of disembroiling
  the tangled threads of their own destiny? Cyril thought sorrowfully of his
  disappointed friend, and Friesen thought of something else. Of something
  that caused him to say presently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should mind so much, either for His Majesty
  or myself&mdash;though, frankly, I am terribly disappointed&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t
  help thinking of that beautiful, unfortunate girl. God only knows what the
  disappointment and humiliation will mean to her!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;God only knows what the disappointment and humiliation will mean
  to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen&rsquo;s words, spoken to the accompaniment of a deep, compassionate
  sigh, echoed and re-echoed in Cyril&rsquo;s brain till he wondered if he
  was going mad.</p>
  <p>The two men had been obliged to seek for lodgings in Leissen, as there was
  no local train back to Strasbourg until the following morning. They found
  simple but clean and fairly comfortable quarters in a small hotel close to
  the railway station, and here they were sitting at supper in a small private
  room, with a good fire burning cheerily in one of those large porcelain stoves
  peculiar to the countryside. They were served by a trim Alsatian girl, who
  presently, when they had finished eating, cleared some of the things away
  and brought in a tray with a jug of steaming hot coffee, and a bottle of
  old Armagnac.</p>
  <p>Neither Friesen nor Cyril had said much during supper. Both men were absorbed
  in distinctly gloomy thoughts, and neither of them noticed how silent the
  other was. Friesen thought of his threatened career and Cyril thought of
  V&eacute;ronique: &ldquo;God only knows what the disappointment will mean
  to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They drank their coffee in silence. They hardly noticed when the trim Alsatian,
  small and blonde below the huge black taffeta bow on her head, came to clear
  away the remnants of supper and the abandoned coffee-tray. Clearly she was
  accustomed to complimentary or facetious remarks from the customers of the
  hotel, for she looked across with a pout at these two, who had drawn their
  chairs close to the stove and smoked on in silence&mdash;one a cigarette,
  the other a pipe&mdash;without turning round once to look at her. And so,
  after she had collected the supper things, seen to the lamp and put wood
  on the fire, she gave a shrug indicative of contempt and left the two surly
  bears to themselves.</p>
  <p>And the silence between the two men persisted for over an hour. Leissen
  was a sleepy little town. Her citizens went to bed early, and soon after
  nine o&rsquo;clock scarcely a sound from outside disturbed this prolonged
  silence. Just the ticking of the cuckoo clock, and its call every quarter
  of an hour; a call which seemingly passed unheeded, for neither of the two
  men made any movement when it came. Cyril smoked one pipe after another and
  stared into nothing at all, in the manner he had acquired of late. And Friesen
  smoked one cigarette after another and began by staring into nothingness.
  But after a time he turned his glance on his friend and stared at him. And
  he continued to stare and stare. And if Cyril had returned his glance at
  any time he would have seen that the gloom on his friend&rsquo;s face was
  slowly passing away, as if one veil of grey after another was being lifted
  from it, whilst two red spots made their appearance on his cheeks, and a
  curious light began to glow in his eyes.</p>
  <p>The cuckoo called out ten times, and Cyril, waking from his dreams, rose
  and knocked the ashes out of his pipe. The fire was burning low. The air
  began to feel chilly. He gave a slight shudder, as if he was being shaken
  by ague. A superstitious person would have said: &ldquo;Someone is walking
  over my grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go to bed now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>But Friesen seized him by the coat sleeve and dragged him down again into
  his chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said gravely; &ldquo;you are going
  to listen to me first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril shrugged and retorted dryly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing more to say, that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there is,&rdquo; Friesen rejoined, &ldquo;we are not going
  to be beaten quite so easily as all that, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment or two and then added with more than usual earnestness: &ldquo;And
  we are not going to allow the life of a sensitive woman to be made permanently
  wretched by ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, man!&rdquo; Cyril burst out involuntarily, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  speak of that, or I shall go mad and commit a murder or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am going to speak of it,&rdquo; was the Austrian&rsquo;s firm
  rejoinder, &ldquo;and I give you my word that after you have listened to
  me, you will no longer wish to murder anyone or to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in the world are you driving at now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At a way which I have found out of this terrible impasse&mdash;if
  you will listen to reason and give me your help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another of your fantastic schemes?&rdquo; Cyril retorted with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Friesen went on good-humouredly, &ldquo;jeer away
  as much as you like. So long as you agree to listen I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As Cyril made no comment on this, his friend resumed after a few seconds,
  speaking in quiet, slow, impressive tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt whatever in my mind&mdash;never had&mdash;that the
  whole farce of His Majesty&rsquo;s imprisonment was engineered by Aline Saint-Amand.
  Her attitude, and every word she spoke to me that day when I saw her proved
  it to the hilt. I dare say that Napol&eacute;on III is as anxious as anybody
  to be rid of this perpetual menace of a popular rising in favour of the Bourbons,
  but I am equally certain that he wouldn&rsquo;t like to be embroiled in a
  quarrel with my Emperor, and he knows quite well that Austria would never
  allow His Majesty the King of France to be kept a prisoner in such a place
  as Fort Dyck. With the example of Louis XVI or the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien before
  him, my Emperor would soon move heaven and earth to have His Majesty released
  from prison. You see what I mean, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Cyril replied with some impatience. His friend&rsquo;s
  dissertations on the subject of &ldquo;His Majesty the King of France&rdquo; always
  appeared to him both futile and infinitely boring. But Friesen took no notice
  this time of the other&rsquo;s sullen mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course one knows all these things,&rdquo; he went on quietly. &ldquo;I
  did. And that is how I came to put two and two together, and I came to the
  conclusion first that Napol&eacute;on III did not wish to hold His Majesty
  a permanent prisoner&mdash;it would lead to a number of European complications
  which certainly would not fit in with France&rsquo;s policy&mdash;and secondly,
  that nevertheless there was some reason for his arrest. Well! the reason
  was not far to seek. Baron Christophe&rsquo;s millions, figuratively speaking,
  jumped to my eyes. The fact that V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s marriage portion
  is to be half a milliard is of course well known to the secret police, and
  it is pretty obvious that Napol&eacute;on has no wish to see those millions
  finding their way into the coffers of the Bourbon faction. What more simple,
  then, than to put a stop to the marriage with the financier&rsquo;s daughter,
  by keeping His Majesty locked up in Fort Dyck long enough to create such
  a scandal that the marriage would become an impossibility. Now do you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril broke into loud and prolonged laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said with good-natured sarcasm, &ldquo;that you
  have reasoned out the position to your own satisfaction. Haven&rsquo;t you,
  old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be to yours too, I promise you. All you have to do is to
  put two and two together as I did. You will then see how valuable Mademoiselle
  Saint-Amand&rsquo;s co-operation was in all this. His Majesty&rsquo;s open
  admiration for her, and the gossip this has already created everywhere, will
  provide the necessary scandal if he does not appear in time for the signing
  of the marriage contract. Baron Christophe will put his millions back into
  his own pocket and poor V&eacute;ronique will be left to mourn both a husband
  and a crown. But let me tell you this, my dear Bertrand, and you know I never
  talk lightly of such things: I cannot say for the moment if His Majesty has
  been transferred to another fortress or merely been handed back to the tender
  care of the lovely Aline. But I take my solemn oath here and now that in
  either case I will have him back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen paused a moment to allow his words to sink in. Then he added impressively: &ldquo;But
  unfortunately not within the next forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril had re-lit his pipe. He had listened attentively to his friend&rsquo;s
  long disquisition. With his thoughts fixed on V&eacute;ronique he longed
  above all to have the same faith in Friesen&rsquo;s power to put things right
  for her, as Friesen had himself. He didn&rsquo;t want to pooh-pooh his plans
  or to jeer at them. He wanted to see the way clear for an issue out of this
  impossible situation. And his friend&rsquo;s optimism, his persuasive eloquence
  had begun to put heart and hope into him when those last few words: &ldquo;But
  not within forty-eight hours,&rdquo; seemed to dash those hopes once more
  to the ground.</p>
  <p>He murmured, partly to himself: &ldquo;Not within forty-eight hours? Well?
  What then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; Friesen responded in a tone ringing with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Why,
  just this, my friend. That I believe in God&rsquo;s hand in all this&mdash;or
  in Fate if you like to call it so. God created you the very image of His
  Majesty, that you might take his place to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Cyril exclaimed. &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; Friesen retorted with the same boyish enthusiasm, &ldquo;it
  is the simplest thing in the world. A role to play for one evening&mdash;a
  few hours&mdash;a contract to sign&mdash;a cheque for a few millions to receive&mdash;then
  a feigned illness&mdash;retirement while I find His Majesty and bring him
  back, willy-nilly, to step into his own shoes again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Cyril asserted hotly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should be known&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear that you will not. Except for one evening at the opera in
  Baden-Baden in July, His Majesty has not been seen in public for nearly two
  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;my mother. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will prepare her&mdash;she will agree&mdash;she has too much at
  stake to refuse. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and Mademoiselle Christophe. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She has never yet met His Majesty. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But . . .&rdquo; Cyril continued to protest in a vague confused manner.
  He was bewildered, swept off his feet, dumbfounded at the audacity of the
  suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you are afraid,&rdquo; Friesen put in with a
  laugh.</p>
  <p>Cyril shrugged. &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; he echoed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say quite glibly that there will be a contract to sign&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to suggest that I should forge my brother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Friesen queried blandly. He dived into his breast
  pocket, and brought out his letter-case. He selected one letter which he
  held out to Cyril:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here is a letter from His Majesty, signed by him: &lsquo;Louis Rex.&rsquo; You
  are an artist&mdash;expert with pencil and with pen&mdash;an hour&rsquo;s
  practice will be sufficient&mdash;and His Majesty, I promise you, will not
  deny the signature&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The forgery, you mean. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen shrugged. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he said again. And as Cyril did
  not take the letter, he put it back into his case, and the case into his
  pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A forgery,&rdquo; Cyril insisted, &ldquo;at the foot of a marriage
  contract? The whole contract a forgery. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In order to hoodwink a man into handing me over a cheque for several
  millions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Friesen reiterated once more. &ldquo;All these will
  be just temporary measures&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With which to deceive a woman. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For a few hours&mdash;and for her ultimate happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril said nothing more for the moment. He puffed away at his pipe, and
  inside his brain Friesen&rsquo;s last words went round and round: &ldquo;For
  her ultimate happiness!&rdquo; Also those other words which Friesen had spoken
  during the drive back from Fort Dyck: &ldquo;God only knows,&rdquo; he had
  murmured then, &ldquo;what the disappointment will mean to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If only this deception &ldquo;for her ultimate happiness,&rdquo; did not
  entail the forgery of his brother&rsquo;s name. A criminal act, which any
  honest man would condemn. Yet Count Friesen, Chancellor of the Austrian Embassy,
  an honest, upright gentleman if ever there was one, did not condemn it. He
  had said &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; with a careless shrug. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; But
  then Friesen was a diplomat and in diplomacy the axiom held good that the
  end justifies the means. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; but Cyril&rsquo;s inner consciousness,
  his code of honour, inherited from his English father, told him plainly the
  reason why not. Because to forge a signature, be the excuse what it may,
  is an act unworthy of a man of honour&mdash;the act of a criminal. And Friesen
  knew quite well what was going on in his friend&rsquo;s mind. He knew quite
  well that here was the stumbling-block on which his last and best-laid scheme
  stood a good chance of being wrecked. The only real stumbling-block, because
  as far as the main scheme was concerned Cyril Bertrand had already capitulated.
  He had argued the point, raised objections, but in principle he had capitulated.
  Friesen had easily demolished his arguments and his objections, until the
  question of the signature was raised, after which all he could say was a
  bland &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique, of course, was Friesen&rsquo;s strongest card. V&eacute;ronique
  and Cyril&rsquo;s love for her. Men had done worse things than forgery before
  now for a woman&rsquo;s sake. The question was, was Cyril Bertrand that type
  of man, or was he one of those who would echo the words of the poet: &ldquo;I
  would not love thee half so well, loved I not honour more&rdquo;? Who shall
  say? Friesen was a sound psychologist, but even he could not have said for
  certain. Well, perhaps it would be as well to let matters rest for the moment,
  to let the riddle and its solution roll round and round in Cyril&rsquo;s
  brain. To allow dreams of V&eacute;ronique, her happiness and likely sorrow,
  to haunt Cyril&rsquo;s wakeful night. Friesen said genially: &ldquo;Sleep
  on it, my dear Bertrand. Tell me your decision in the morning. That will
  give us time to complete our arrangements, or to wire the bad news to Baden-Baden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went as far as the door, and had his hand on the latch when a sudden
  thought appeared to strike him. He searched through a number of letters which
  he kept stored in his pocket-book. Presently he found what he wanted, and
  placed one letter down on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would like you to read that, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before
  you finally make up your mind one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After which he nodded a last good night to Cyril and went out of the room.</p>
  <p>The letter which he had left on the table was the one which Baron Christophe
  had written to Madame. One passage&mdash;the end one&mdash;Cyril read through
  more than once. Baron Christophe had written:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;In anticipation of that happy evening I have already taken steps
  to have the engagement officially announced in Vienna, in Paris, in Rome
  and in Berlin. I am proud to say that His Majesty the Emperor of Austria,
  His Holiness the Pope, and His Majesty the King of Prussia are all sending
  special envoys to represent them on the great occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And every time when he had finished reading that paragraph, Cyril caught
  himself murmuring the words which Friesen had spoken during the drive back
  from Fort Dyck: &ldquo;God only knows what the disappointment and humiliation
  will mean for her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>They met the next morning at breakfast, in their comfortless sitting-room,
  each knowing that the other had hardly slept a wink all night. Friesen had
  been kept awake by gloomy thoughts; failure of his pet scheme, a serious
  set-back to his career; reproof, perhaps, from his Emperor, censure from
  his chiefs. It was a dismal outlook, and he tried in vain to forget his anxiety
  in sleep. At one time he thought of going to the next room and restarting
  his argument with Cyril. He knew quite well that his friend would be wide
  awake, and he hoped that inspiration would come to him, as to the best reasoning
  to use to convince an obstinate man. But he soon changed his mind. Cyril
  was an obstinate man of the worst possible type, for he never argued for
  long. Once he had said all that he thought necessary, he would lapse into
  a state of complete muteness, out of which the most eloquent pleading in
  the world could not drag him. On the whole, Friesen thought, it would be
  best to get his friend thoroughly tired after a sleepless night, and so find
  him, perhaps, more amenable.</p>
  <p>But events have a way, sometimes, of turning out quite differently to what
  one expects. Greatly to Friesen&rsquo;s astonishment his friend, who obviously
  had also spent a sleepless night, was extraordinarily brisk and alert in
  the morning. His eyes were certainly circled with dark rings, but there was
  a glow in them that was either caused by fever or excitement. The first words
  he spoke to his friend were in the nature of a bombshell. Friesen almost
  staggered under it. For the first second or two he wondered if he was really
  awake or still dreaming.</p>
  <p>Cyril said: &ldquo;Well, my friend, I have thought it all over, and I will
  do what you suggest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he saw Friesen&rsquo;s almost comic bewilderment, he burst out laughing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so scared,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean it. I&rsquo;ll
  go with you to Baden-Baden and for the space of one night I will be, in effect,
  His Majesty the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was on the tip of Friesen&rsquo;s tongue to ask: &ldquo;And you will
  sign the marriage contract?&rdquo; but he refrained. On the whole he thought
  it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie. So all he said was:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew you would, my dear fellow. It really was the only thing to
  do for the girl&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blonde Alsatian brought in the breakfast-tray. They both sat down to
  excellent coffee and fresh rolls, and then drew their chairs close to the
  big stove, in which a cheerful wood fire was blazing. Cyril lit his pipe,
  and Friesen his cigarette. They smoked in silence for some time. Friesen
  said: &ldquo;Our train for Strasbourg does not leave till three o&rsquo;clock.
  Unfortunately we missed the early morning one. Five o&rsquo;clock. I forgot
  to ask the maid to call us. The point is can we catch the night express to
  Baden-Baden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if we don&rsquo;t, does it?&rdquo; Cyril
  said casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Friesen replied. &ldquo;We can anyhow get to Baden-Baden
  in time for your mother&rsquo;s reception.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; Cyril remarked, &ldquo;the reception!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the signing of the contract. It is customary in France. <i>La
   soir&eacute;e du contrat.</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The maid came in to fetch away the coffee-tray. She asked if the fire was
  all right. Cyril said: &ldquo;No, put a log on, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl did as she was told, and went out, carrying the tray. When she
  had gone, Friesen said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that log was a mistake. It is too hot in here already.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Cyril rejoined, &ldquo;I am afraid I spoke inadvertently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He opened the door of the stove and glanced into the fiercely blazing fire.
  He laughed and said: &ldquo;I am afraid it is going to be a lot hotter directly.
  She has put a huge log on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open the window,&rdquo; Friesen decided. He rose and went
  over to the window. At that moment Cyril was saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble
  to do that. This is the easiest way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And before Friesen realised what his friend was doing, the latter had thrust
  a hand into the fire and dragged out the blazing log.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertrand!&rdquo; Friesen exclaimed, horrified, &ldquo;are you mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! Only a fool!&rdquo; Cyril retorted. He had already dropped the
  log. An acrid smell of scorched flesh filled the room, and Cyril was obviously
  fighting an inclination to lose consciousness. Friesen tugged violently at
  the bell, and then ran for his brandy flask, which he held to Cyril&rsquo;s
  lips. The little maid came running into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick! A doctor!&rdquo; Friesen commanded. &ldquo;My friend here
  has burnt his hand badly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! not a doctor,&rdquo; Cyril contrived to say with a wry smile. &ldquo;Give
  me another drop of brandy, there&rsquo;s a good fellow, and I&rsquo;ll go
  round to the local chemist, who will bandage me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And that was the end of the incident. The local chemist dressed Cyril&rsquo;s
  badly injured hand. It was the right one.</p>
  <p>That same afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock the two friends left by the local
  train for Strasbourg. Cyril had his right arm in a sling. Otherwise he seemed
  gayer than he had been for a long time. But Friesen remained very thoughtful
  all day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the English blood in him,&rdquo; he commented
  to himself. &ldquo;They are all mad, those English!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Extract from the diary of His Eminence Louis Beneventy, Cardinal Archbishop,
  Primate of Hungary, under date September 24th, 1860:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a wonderful evening. So wonderful that somehow my thoughts
  turned back to the great day in Gm&uuml;nd when I saw the Prior of the Dominican
  Fathers walk up the aisle of the Priory chapel carrying the King of France
  in his arms. I was five years old then, I am an old man now, but last night
  I felt young again, because I witnessed the marvellous workings of God&rsquo;s
  will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all assembled in the salon of Madame la Princesse half an hour
  before the ceremony of signing the contract was timed to take place. There
  were present on this great occasion His Eminence Monsignor Gomini representing
  His Holiness the Pope, His Excellency Count Friedrich representing the Emperor
  of Austria, and Prince Remiroff representing the Grand Duke of Baden. There
  were also the representatives of other European monarchs, friendly to the
  Bourbon cause: representatives of the Kings of Prussia and of Bavaria, of
  the Czar and of the Queen of Spain, members of the great aristocracy of Austria,
  of Italy and of England. I cannot recollect all the names, but I do assert
  that the presence of these eminent personages in the salon of Madame la Princesse
  on that memorable evening bore testimony to the interest and sympathy felt
  throughout Europe for the cause of His Majesty the King. Indeed, the reception
  rooms of the Villa Elisabeth were so crowded that it was difficult to make
  one&rsquo;s way through the forest of immense crinolines, which seem to me
  to grow in size year after year. I must admit that the ladies of the fashionable
  world do wear these monstrosities with much grace and distinction, and that,
  to my mind, it is a beautiful and modest fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course we were all of us on tenterhooks to see His Majesty, for
  he was practically unknown to all of us. Even I, who had seen him more recently
  than anyone else there, had not done so for close on seven years. He was
  still a growing lad then, in delicate health, but I had heard lately that
  he had greatly improved in physique after his long sojourn in Switzerland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Punctually at nine o&rsquo;clock Madame made a solemn entry into
  the room. I was glad to see that she was saluted by every one of her guests
  with the honours usually accorded only to royalty. She was very pale, and
  appeared to me to be suffering from nerve-strain. But she was equally gracious
  to everybody. Many enquiries were of course made after His Majesty&rsquo;s
  health. To all these Madame replied that His Majesty had greatly benefited
  from the long rest he had enjoyed in Switzerland; that he was better in health
  than he had been for years and, in fact, had put on quite a bit of flesh,
  which was both becoming to him and reassuring to his mother and loyal friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To some of us Madame explained that His Majesty had met with a slight
  accident to his hand, through the sudden going off of his sporting rifle
  when he was out shooting a day or two ago. Madame spoke lengthily on this
  subject with the Mayor of Baden-Baden and with the French vice-consul, explaining
  that His Majesty might not be able to hold a pen in his injured hand, and
  asking what could be done about the signing of the contract. Both the gentlemen
  gave her the same assurance, namely, that so long as His Majesty made any
  kind of a sign at the bottom of the document, the contract countersigned
  by two witnesses would be perfectly legal, and His Majesty could complete
  it later on, when his hand was healed, by appending his august signature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Baron Christophe was announced. He came in with his daughter
  on his arm. I am an old man, but I must confess to being almost dazzled by
  the beauty of Mademoiselle Christophe. Never have I seen anything more lovely
  than she looked when she advanced into the room with perfect grace of movement,
  and exquisite modesty of mien. She made a deep curtsy before Madame and would
  have kissed the hand that Madame extended to her had not that gracious lady
  drawn the blushing girl to her heart and kissed her fondly on both cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But all this brilliancy and splendour paled before the glamour which
  spread over the assembly when the great double doors were thrown open and
  a stentorian voice announced: &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen! His Majesty the
  King!&rsquo; A kind of gasp went round the room, something like a deeply
  drawn sigh, and we all gazed with a look akin to reverence on the King of
  France. Truly a kingly figure, so we all thought, I am sure. The last time
  I had seen His Majesty was some seven years ago. He was in delicate health
  then, he stooped slightly, and there seemed to be perpetual lines of fatigue
  in his otherwise handsome face. But he looked, I am happy to say, quite different
  now. Full of vitality and energy and, if I may say so, of <i>joie de vivre</i>.
  He had certainly put on flesh, or rather muscle, for he even appeared taller
  to me than he had done before. His extraordinary resemblance to Madame his
  mother was also more marked. He had her wonderful dark eyes and the rich
  chestnut hue of her hair, which when she was younger had been the delight
  of her august husband. Strangely enough, when I made my obeisance before
  him, my thoughts took a very strange turn. They flew to his half-brother
  the son of Madame by her previous marriage with the English army officer.
  His name was Bertrand&mdash;Cyril Bertrand&mdash;a fine upstanding boy he
  was&mdash;but very wilful and queer-tempered. I wonder what has become of
  him, and considering that I have lost sight of him for a dozen years and
  more, I wonder why I thought of him just then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty had his right hand swathed in bandages, and carried that
  arm in a sling. So it was his left hand that we and all his devotees were
  permitted to kiss. I thought he looked pale, and guessed from an occasional
  glance in his eyes that his injured hand was causing him pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there was a wonderful moment when Baron Christophe advanced with
  his daughter, to present her to His Majesty. Never shall I forget the sight,
  nor will anyone else who was there. That kingly figure standing rather apart
  from everyone else. Madame la Princesse stately and austere a few paces behind
  him, and the radiant figure of the young girl advancing to do homage to her
  royal fianc&eacute;. She was dressed all in white with one white camellia
  in her soft brown hair. I didn&rsquo;t know which of the two young faces
  impressed me most. There was a certain look of wonderment in both; a look
  as of a wondrous revelation&mdash;I was going to say, ecstasy. On the whole
  the girl&rsquo;s face expressed the greatest joy. She looked as if a sublime
  happiness had suddenly been revealed to her, while His Majesty&rsquo;s handsome
  face irradiated overpowering love. And this I thought strange, for I knew
  that this was the first meeting between His Majesty and his bride-elect,
  and never in my long life had I seen love become at first sight so complete
  and so immense. Mademoiselle Christophe made a deep curtsy before the King.
  He took her left hand in his and kissed its fourth finger, and then without
  a word, only with a glance of infinite love, he slipped the betrothal ring
  upon it. He put his arms round her and kissed her on the forehead. I don&rsquo;t
  think there was a dry eye in the room. I know my old eyes were full of tears.
  Just as sixty-five years ago in the Priory chapel at Gm&uuml;nd the monks
  had intoned the &lsquo;Nunc dimittis&rsquo; when the little King of France
  was laid upon the altar steps, so did I long to hear this brilliant assembly
  now, repeat the inspired words: &lsquo;Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart
  in peace. . . .&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty remained for a time in conversation with Mademoiselle
  Christophe. Madame la Princesse joined them after a time, also Count Friesen,
  the Austrian Chancellor of Embassy, who had accompanied His Majesty. The
  conversation in the room soon became general. Several personages including
  the representatives of foreign monarchs were introduced to His Majesty. I
  too had the honour of a lengthy talk with him. Presently the Mayor came up,
  also the French vice-consul with the request that His Majesty would deign
  to hear the marriage contract read through before putting his august signature
  to it. His Majesty laughed most heartily. &lsquo;But, my good man,&rsquo; he
  said, &lsquo;I cannot hold a pen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Mayor then explained to him what he had already told Madame la
  Princesse, that if His Majesty would just put a cross at the bottom of the
  document where his name should come, it could then be countersigned by the
  witnesses, and thus made perfectly valid and legal. His Majesty gave a light
  shrug and turned to Baron Christophe: &lsquo;If you are satisfied, Monsieur
  le Baron. . .&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course I am satisfied, Your Majesty,&rsquo; Baron
  Christophe replied. &lsquo;A cross from your maimed hand is worth more than
  any signature in the world.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty, Baron Christophe and Mademoiselle V&eacute;ronique then
  went to the table on which a large legal document lay spread out. The Mayor
  took up the document and began to read it aloud so that everyone in the room
  could hear. I don&rsquo;t, of course, remember the exact wording of it. It
  was couched in the usual terms that pertain to all marriage contracts in
  France. Two phrases, however, stand out clearly in my memory; both caused
  a prolonged &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; to come from the lips of all those present.
  One of them referred to the bride&rsquo;s marriage portion. It was no less
  than half a milliard of francs which Baron Christophe undertook to place
  this very evening in the form of a banker&rsquo;s draft in the hands of His
  Majesty the King of France. The other contained His Majesty&rsquo;s promise
  that his wife would share on terms of perfect equality the throne and crown
  of France with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am trying to remember more of what happened on that memorable evening;
  but everything was so wonderful and so dazzling that I can hardly trust my
  memory. I do remember His Majesty bending over the table. A pen had been
  put into his maimed hand, and Madame la Princesse was asked to guide it,
  in making a X at the bottom of the document. I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes
  off his face during this brief ceremony, for it wore an expression I could
  not possibly define. Had the occasion not been so solemn I could have sworn
  that a smile curled round His Majesty&rsquo;s lips. And to me the smile seemed
  to be more ironical than gay. But of course I must have been mistaken. I
  had the honour of being one of the witnesses to the signature of the august
  bridegroom. The other, I understood, was to have been Count Friesen, but
  at the last moment when he was about to take the pen from me, Madame came
  quickly forward, took the pen out of my hand and held it out to Monsignor
  Gomini with a few gracious words. His Eminence took the pen and countersigned
  the contract and again I saw that strange smile curling round His Majesty&rsquo;s
  lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was now the turn of the bride to sign the contract; her father
  countersigned it and Count Friedrich and Prince Remiroff witnessed the two
  signatures. Even while they did so Baron Christophe dived into the breast
  pocket of his coat and took out from his letter-case a small oblong piece
  of paper which represented his daughter&rsquo;s marriage portion, no less
  than half a milliard&mdash;a fortune for the Bourbon cause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After that my recollections of the rest of the evening are nothing
  but a blur. I was very tired, and felt relieved when His Majesty gave the
  signal for breaking up the party. I was standing quite close to him when
  he took leave of Mademoiselle Christophe. I tried not to hear what those
  two said to one another; they were already lovers, and their &lsquo;good
  night&rsquo; or &lsquo;farewell&rsquo; was not intended for other ears than
  theirs. But I did hear His Majesty whisper the word &lsquo;To-morrow&rsquo;;
  and I saw the loveliest blush slowly mount to Mademoiselle&rsquo;s cheeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Baron Christophe had, of course, to be let into the secret, or he would
  have been anxious, but his joy was so great at seeing the happiness of his
  darling child, that he didn&rsquo;t think of etiquette or of the social rules
  that in 1860 governed the conduct of engaged couples. He even went to the
  length of starting out with V&eacute;ronique and her royal fianc&eacute; and
  accompanying them some short distance beyond the gate of the Villa Marie
  Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, so as not to arouse astonishment and comment among
  his domestics.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique had confided the project to her father the evening before,
  on their return from the grand reception at the Villa Elisabeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Louis wants me to go out in the country with him for the whole day.
  He says Baden-Baden stifles him,&rdquo; she explained rather diffidently,
  because she did not know how father would take to the idea.</p>
  <p>All he said, however, and did it in a tone of gentle reproof was: &ldquo;Louis!
  My dear child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean His Majesty, of course,&rdquo; V&eacute;ronique rejoined demurely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must not forget that, must we?&rdquo; father concluded in his
  gravest tones.</p>
  <p>He was so happy, so happy, for he had reached the pinnacle of his ambition;
  the millions which he had amassed through sheer hard work and brain power
  had brought happiness as well as splendour to the daughter who was the only
  love of his life. He thought His Majesty greatly improved not only in health
  and general appearance, but also in something more subtle and indefinable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somehow he has become a man,&rdquo; he said complacently to himself. &ldquo;A
  big transformation in a little over a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, the great financier had only seen His Majesty once&mdash;the
  previous year in Baden-Baden when first the vague project of seeing his daughter
  crowned Queen of France began to stir in his active brain. The project soon
  ripened, and this past summer he had broached it to Madame la Princesse,
  who demurred just sufficiently to keep the rich Baron in his place, but not
  too much so as to put him off altogether. And now it was all accomplished
  and not only was his darling V&eacute;ronique dazzled, not only was she happy,
  but she looked in a fair way of becoming enamoured of her royal fianc&eacute;. &ldquo;And
  no wonder,&rdquo; thought Baron Christophe, &ldquo;for a more kingly and
  at the same time more attractive man I have never seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>The young people waved a joyous <i>au revoir</i> to father when he parted
  from them at the bottom of the Maria Viktoria Strasse. They were like two
  children who have been given a holiday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be home before six,&rdquo; Cyril had said. &ldquo;Promise
  you won&rsquo;t be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to try,&rdquo; Christophe retorted with a smile.</p>
  <p>He soon lost sight of them, for they walked very fast. They were anxious
  to leave Baden-Baden as quickly behind them as they could. Baden-Baden and
  its social <i>milieu</i> stifled them. What they wanted was to be away from
  the world, from people, to be alone together in the forest, with only the
  pine trees and a few birds for company. The sky was a brilliant blue. The
  scent of autumn was in the air. They were young and they were in love. He
  knowingly, for he had loved V&eacute;ronique Christophe, he reckoned, all
  his life, but she unconsciously, not understanding her own heart, or that
  feeling of ecstasy which made the sky seem more blue, and the sun more golden.</p>
  <p>They almost ran as far as the old Nunnery and here they turned off to go
  up the pine-clad Caecilienberg. They didn&rsquo;t talk. Not really talk.
  Just an occasional &ldquo;Am I walking too fast?&rdquo; from him and a protesting &ldquo;Oh
  no!&rdquo; from her. &ldquo;Are you tired?&rdquo; he asked more than once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet. Only rather warm. But isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t look at the sky or the golden vistas through the intervening
  pines, nevertheless he said &ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; and that was because he
  was looking at her.</p>
  <p>She had on a little lace affair over her brown hair. It didn&rsquo;t prevent
  the curls from escaping out of their gossamer bonds, nor stop the mountain
  breeze from playing with them. Her dress was all muslin and lace with bows
  and sash of a soft shade of green. She carried a tiny parasol which threw
  a pearly shadow over her face; and on her feet she had little boots of bronze
  kid, which reached up to above her ankles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God! isn&rsquo;t she lovely!&rdquo; Cyril murmured to himself.
  And he had to put his hand up to his throat for he felt somehow as if he
  were choking.</p>
  <p>V&eacute;ronique remembered that His Majesty was reputed to be delicate
  in health, and although this delicacy was certainly not apparent in this
  lithe and stalwart man beside her, she felt remorseful at having walked so
  fast and perhaps tired him. He certainly didn&rsquo;t look tired, and seemed
  to be enjoying the walk as much as she did. Still, she must not be selfish,
  she thought, and hoped that he would ask her again if she was tired.</p>
  <p>He did, after a time, and she said: &ldquo;Yes, rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They came on a small clearing where a few trees had been cut down, and some
  of them had been left lying on the ground almost as if they had been intended
  for seats for lovers to sit on. Rather uncomfortable seats they were, and
  Cyril looked ruefully at V&eacute;ronique, and V&eacute;ronique laughed gaily
  in his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is rather uncomfortable,&rdquo; she admitted. She was no coquette,
  and certainly she was as innocent as a child, and like a child she wriggled
  on the hard seat till, unconsciously, she was dangerously near to him. Dangerously,
  because here they were, alone in the middle of the stately, silent pines,
  their sole companions a yellow-breast robin, inquisitive after the manner
  of his kind, and a squirrel who had strayed far from his home among the chestnut
  trees down below and paused half-way up the stem of a pine to look on them
  with tiny, beady eyes.</p>
  <p>They were silent, these two, for a long, long time, she tracing patterns
  in the mossy ground with her tiny parasol, and he gazing at her, wondering
  how it came to pass that God created such perfect loveliness and then allowed
  it to be close enough for him to kiss. Naturally, the moment came soon enough.
  She happened to look up at him, slightly puzzled by his long silence, for
  V&eacute;ronique Christophe was very, very young, and had no experience of
  lovers and lovers&rsquo; ways. She looked up at him, and encountered that
  gaze which every woman knows how to interpret, however young and inexperienced
  she may be; a blush rose slowly to her cheeks, and the next moment she was
  in his arms, and his lips taught her the first lesson of love.</p>
  <p>And Cyril Bertrand was an excellent teacher, for he had loved her for &aelig;ons
  of time, and it was in anticipation of this one supreme moment in life that
  he had acted the lie which Count Friesen had suggested to him. It was solely
  because he knew that if he played his part in this political intrigue, the
  moment would surely come when he could hold V&eacute;ronique in his arms,
  and teach her how good a thing is love, and how good it is to kiss.</p>
  <p>The squirrel, astonished at the doings of these strange humans, scampered
  away from tree to tree, but the yellow-breasted robin was more sophisticated,
  for this clearing, which was his haunt, was a favourite meeting-place of
  lovers, so he just went on scouting for his dinner in the moss-covered ground.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>After a time&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t had his fill yet, but she had just succeeded
  in disengaging herself from that over-tight embrace&mdash;he asked her the
  question which comes to the lips of most lovers:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;V&eacute;ronique, tell me; have you ever loved before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She replied: &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; and she said this
  in such a way that all in a moment the male instinct of jealousy was aroused
  in him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean, you don&rsquo;t think so?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>She looked up at him with eyes that mirrored the blue out of the sky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly, &ldquo;I did rather like a
  man once&mdash;I mean I liked him better than I had ever liked any man before&mdash;except
  father, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These last few words did certainly alleviate the sting caused by the others.
  But the sting was there, nevertheless, and Cyril had winced, for it had touched
  him on the raw. Does not every lover hug the belief that he is first in the
  field, and that he will always be the only one? And in her candour and innocence
  V&eacute;ronique had just admitted that she &ldquo;did rather like a man
  once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you still,&rdquo; he asked in a fairly steady voice, &ldquo;like
  him better than any other man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said with a light shrug, &ldquo;he never thought of
  me in that way . . . and so . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t make love to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a fool!&rdquo; was Cyril&rsquo;s curt comment.</p>
  <p>She laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was absorbed in
  his painting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His painting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With that gesture which was habitual to him, Cyril put his hand up to his
  throat. He was actually choking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His painting?&rdquo; he echoed hoarsely. His voice was so strange
  and his gesture so alarming that V&eacute;ronique was frightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why? What have I said?&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing! Nothing!&rdquo; he hastened to assure her, and added with
  a laugh: &ldquo;Only what the English call a frog in my throat. Do you know
  what it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She nodded, but still asked anxiously: &ldquo;Is it all right now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite all right. But tell me what did this man paint. The man whom
  you rather liked, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He painted my portrait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a beautiful portrait. Everyone said so. It was hung on the
  line in the Salon last spring. You didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean Your Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name don&rsquo;t call me that,&rdquo; he broke
  in roughly. So roughly, indeed, that it made her laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she asked and then added demurely: &ldquo;Father
  would scold me if I did not. And . . . I don&rsquo;t very much like the name
  of Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hate it,&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;But do go on telling
  me about the portrait and the man who painted it. What was he like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more she turned her merry blue eyes upon him and looked him squarely
  in the face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;To be quite frank he was rather
  like Your M&mdash;; I mean, he was rather like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that flattering for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh no! Because the likeness was only to there.&rdquo; And she put
  her small, gloved hand across her face just below the nose. &ldquo;The rest
  of his face was all hidden by a very ugly beard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And yet you liked him?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only said &lsquo;rather&rsquo;; for my portrait was finished in
  four days and I have never seen the artist since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never will either,&rdquo; Cyril rejoined curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care, would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she murmured softly. &ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you are Queen of France . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;only,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Cyril could have groaned aloud. His self-restraint was playing him false.
  It would fly to the winds of heaven in a moment or two. Undoubtedly within
  the next few seconds he would once more have had this lovely creature in
  his arms. He would, I think, have lifted her off the ground then and there
  and carried her away to some mountain fastness up on the Klosterberg, and
  defied the whole of Europe to take her from him. At any rate, that is what
  he thought he would like to do, if reason had not had a last say. Reason
  whispered that V&eacute;ronique Christophe had only rather liked the man
  who painted her portrait; she had not liked him even as she loved her father,
  and pretty soon she would learn to hate him for depriving her of her kingly
  fianc&eacute; and of the crown of France. She was such a child. She had only
  learned the first lesson of love. A very elementary lesson; the sweetness
  of a kiss; and like a child she would soon resent its sweetness and sigh
  for the lost throne.</p>
  <p>Desperate difficulties need desperate means to combat them. This solitude
  was the enemy of self-control. Prosy surroundings, the consciousness of everyday
  life were the only shackles that could hold passionate love in check. Although
  he called himself a fool for his pains, Cyril jumped to his feet and with
  a gay, infectious laugh he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now shall we go and get some lunch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She didn&rsquo;t rise all at once. Somehow she was conscious of disappointment
  and she threw him a look of childlike reproach which very nearly upset the
  apple-cart of his self-control once more.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for the said apple-cart, she rose, patted her skirt, her hair
  and diminutive bonnet, and asked coolly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>He took her up Klosterberg to the small restaurant which commands such magnificent
  views over Lichtenthal and Geroldsau and the fringe of the Black Forest.
  Here they sat under a creeper-covered arbour on wooden benches, at a table
  spread with a red and white checked cloth. They ate ham and liver sausage
  and potato salad, and drank a golden Munich beer. They were waited on by
  a jolly Bavarian maid, with blonde plaits down her back, red of face and
  broad in the beam, who smiled benignly on them as she did on all the young
  couples who frequented the restaurant. They chattered and they laughed; made
  silly, childish jokes at the expense of their fellow-diners; the corpulent
  shopkeeper from Carlsruhe with his strapping wife and numerous progeny who
  ate smoked sausages and sauerkraut, which they washed down with numerous
  tankards of beer; the solitary poet with long hair, who sipped Rhine wine
  out of a long-stemmed glass and consumed large slices of chocolate cake while
  wooing the Muse with paper and pencil; and the two lovers, who giggled and
  kissed, ate off the one plate and drank out of the one mug.</p>
  <p>Cyril and V&eacute;ronique were just like two children on a holiday; two
  children forgetting that presently they would have to go back to school and
  mind their p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s. They talked nothing but nonsense because
  their hearts were light, and because, childlike, they lived for the present
  without care or thought for the future. Cyril related amusing incidents of
  Ingres, the great artist, who fancied himself as a lady-killer, and of Horace
  Vernet and his many decorations, some of which he wore pinned to the tails
  of his coat, and had sat on, on one occasion, with disastrous results to
  his comfort. And V&eacute;ronique gave an account of Princesse Metternich
  dancing the can-can and of the Duchesse d&rsquo;Arlington trying to man&oelig;uvre
  her portly figure and immense crinoline up a narrow winding staircase and
  remaining stuck in the middle, whence it took four lackeys to extricate her.</p>
  <p>There was only one interval of seriousness in this day of childlike thoughtlessness
  of the morrow. It came after they had finished their lunch, and the plump
  Bavarian maid had placed the tray of steaming hot coffee before them. Cyril
  took a cigarette out of his case. He reached for the matches, but V&eacute;ronique
  forestalled him and lit the cigarette for him. Their faces were very close
  one to the other, and their eyes met in one of those happy glances of which
  only lovers possess the secret. It was the sort of glance that provokes a
  kiss! Fortunately or unfortunately, there were so many indifferent observers
  near, that Cyril was forced to resist the provocation. But he could not keep
  back the question which had been hovering on his lips for the past half-hour;
  the egotistic question on which he loved to dwell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more about the portrait-painter whom you liked better than
  any man&mdash;except your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a light shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;talk about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is such a lot I want to say to you. Far more important things
  than that silly schoolgirl fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was only a silly schoolgirl fancy, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she replied with a demure little smile.</p>
  <p>How sweet she was! How sincere! And how unconscious that she was hurting
  him. Hurting him terribly! Women&mdash;good women&mdash;have a way of dealing
  these cruel blows in sheer ignorance, in sheer childish guilelessness. The
  others try to hurt, they do it deliberately because they are coldblooded,
  but somehow their darts fail in their effect. It takes a good woman&mdash;a
  saint&mdash;to be really cruel.</p>
  <p>A silly schoolgirl fancy! And he had been fool enough to think&mdash;What!&mdash;God
  only knows&mdash;men in love are such arrant fools! However, a man, even
  a man in love, if he be not made of putty, must pull himself together. Cyril
  gave a wry smile, which he hoped she would not interpret, and then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what are the important things you are going to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She clasped her pretty hands together and looked eager and enthusiastic.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to talk about our projects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Projects?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes! I am so terribly ignorant, you know. Father never would
  talk of outside things to me&mdash;things that I would have been terribly
  interested in, if only he had tried to explain them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! Politics, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. Politics! In these days of class-war and
  rising democracy what had this artless child to do with politics? She said,
  reproachfully:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh! I am very serious!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Politics are unclean, mostly,&rdquo; he remarked dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know. At least, I have heard men say so. And that women must keep
  aloof from them. But . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She waited a moment, not knowing quite how to go on. She was a product of
  her generation, the generation that reviled Georges Sand or George Eliot
  as unsexed, and kept a woman in perpetual subjection first to her father
  and then to her husband. And V&eacute;ronique was still a little shy of her
  royal fianc&eacute;, when he didn&rsquo;t make jokes about the shopkeeper
  from Carlsruhe and his strapping wife, or about the great Ingres and Horace
  Vernet&rsquo;s decorations, when he looked serious, almost sad, as he did
  now. However, he seemed to be waiting for her to go on, and after a second
  or two she gathered sufficient courage to say softly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But when I shall have the immense privilege of being Queen of France
  . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall want to hear everything about our people. Your people and
  mine. I mean to make it the aim of my life to know all about their wants,
  to see that every man, woman and child in France is made happy&mdash;as happy,
  or almost, as I shall be myself. I know I am talking foolishly, but ever
  since I knew that I was to be so greatly honoured by&mdash;by becoming your
  wife and sharing your throne, I have dreamed that one day, when I am gone,
  the people of France will speak of me as &lsquo;good Queen V&eacute;ronique,&rsquo; in
  the same way that you will be known to history as &lsquo;Louis the Well-Beloved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat with his head resting on his hand. Looking at her&mdash;wondering
  how much more of this he could stand. Her artlessness, her faith, shamed
  him to such an extent, that he very nearly blurted out the whole truth then
  and there. He just longed to take hold of those dear little hands of hers,
  to look straight into her eyes and to say: &ldquo;I am nothing but a liar,
  and a cheat. For the sake of this one day, which was promised me, I agreed
  to play this vile comedy. I am no king, I have no right to hold your hand.
  I am only the wretched portrait-painter for whom you had once a silly girlish
  fancy. Now I am going out of your life, and by another piece of abominable
  trickery you will become the wife of an effeminate weakling who will certainly
  make you Queen of France, but who will never give you a moment&rsquo;s joy,
  or cause you to feel the rapture of love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And while this wild confession nearly burst out from his overburdened soul,
  his glance became so intense and almost wild that V&eacute;ronique, frightened
  and shy, felt that she had gone too far, that he disapproved of what she
  had said, that he was, in fact, one of those men who, like her father, would
  not allow a woman to discuss any but the most trivial subjects. She gave
  a nervous little laugh, and made a casual remark about the lateness of the
  hour, and so the spell was broken. Cyril was free once more from the obsession
  which would have robbed him of these last hours of joy.</p>
  <p>They paid their bill and wandered back through the woods. Instinctively
  they avoided the clearing where memory would have been too insistent for
  their peace of mind. The late afternoon was exquisite, with just enough of
  the tang of autumn in the air to make it soft and balmy, a soporific to lull
  remorse on the one side, and dissipate shyness on the other. Once more they
  became children wandering hand in hand through fairyland. They didn&rsquo;t
  speak of thrones or of kings, of father&rsquo;s millions or the people of
  France. Nor did the words &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; rise from their hearts
  to their lips. The one interval of seriousness was forgotten in the last
  hour of this unforgettable afternoon. It had been the golden day of their
  lives, a day in which every hour had meant a new joy, and revealed a new
  happiness. V&eacute;ronique was happy because she looked on the blessed hours
  as the forerunners of others equally full of joy; and Cyril was happy because
  of her happiness, well knowing that the greatest joy the future could possibly
  hold for him would be the memory of this golden day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>During the course of that same afternoon Count Friesen received an urgent
  summons from Madame.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put everything aside, my dear friend,&rdquo; Madame had written in
  haste and almost illegibly, &ldquo;and come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen was, of course, accustomed by now to these urgent messages, which
  usually were supplemented by weird references to a yawning grave or the wide
  open door of a lunatic asylum. In this case he felt pretty sure of what the
  trouble was about. Cyril had told him of his intention to defy all etiquette
  and propriety by spending a long day in the country alone with V&eacute;ronique.
  Friesen had done his best to dissuade him, for he foresaw trouble of some
  sort, but Cyril was obstinate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll either do that,&rdquo; he had said with absolute finality, &ldquo;or
  cut my stick and run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What Friesen had foreseen did actually occur. Madame, unaware of Cyril&rsquo;s
  determination, had probably worked herself up into a state of frenzy at his
  prolonged absence. And that, the Austrian decided within himself, was all
  that the pother was about.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless he went.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>He found Madame la Princesse in one of those states of excitement with which
  he alone knew how to cope. When he was announced she was pacing the room
  up and down, and to him she looked as if she was verging on a nervous collapse.
  The valet de chambre who had shown him in made haste to retire. Madame then
  sank into an arm-chair, and with a shaking hand she held out at arm&rsquo;s
  length what looked like a letter&mdash;looked like one because she had crushed
  the paper into a ball.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read it, Friesen&mdash;read it . . .&rdquo; was all she seemed able
  to say.</p>
  <p>Friesen took the shapeless mass, sat down, unfolded it and smoothed out
  the creases against his knee. The letter, he had guessed at once, came from
  His Majesty the King of France. No one but he had the power of throwing Madame
  into such a state of agitation, and, frankly, what the eminent diplomat now
  read nearly threw him&mdash;even him&mdash;off his balance.</p>
  <p>The letter was written from the Villa Eglantine, Baden-Baden.</p>
  <p>Villa Eglantine? Surely&mdash;Friesen frowned, thinking of Aline Saint-Amand:
  then he continued to read:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Honoured and Beloved Mother&rdquo; [the letter
  began],</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Do not be astonished to learn that I am back in Baden-Baden. I arrived
  here yesterday too late for the distasteful ceremony which was to tie me
  for life to a woman whom I have never seen and could not possibly love, and
  which, I know, was intended to keep me in the forefront of a cause with which
  I have no sympathy. Beloved mother, try and think of me not as the uncrowned&mdash;never
  to be crowned&mdash;King of France, but only as your son, who comes to you
  craving for your love and your indulgence. I have had plenty of time to think
  things over in the past few days while complete rest and peace which I had
  never known before made me see the future more clearly. God, my dear mother,
  did not create me with the intention that I should ever be a ruler of men.
  That was so obviously not His purpose when He made me weak of will and delicate
  in health. I could no more rally waverers to our cause than I could lead
  an army or plunge into political intrigues, nor could I marry a woman whom
  I did not love. I should only bring misery to her, and disgrace on our dynasty.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;All this may mean bitter disappointment to you,
      for I know how deeply you have the success of our fortunes at heart. But
      a man cannot go against his own nature, and my nature only craves for peace
      and quiet in the arms of a woman to whom I can give my heart. If I followed
      your commands, I should be laying the foundation of a whole edifice of
      misery and disappointment for you. I should, in the end, break your heart
  and cause you to be ashamed of your son and of your King.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;What happened here in the last few days I do not know. I do know
  that Count Friesen, probably at your behest, has been doing his best to drag
  me firstly out of the fortress where Napol&eacute;on&rsquo;s police kept
  me a prisoner for three days and then out of the solitude where I was happy
  in the company of the one woman who thoroughly understands me, and condones
  all my weaknesses.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Do not, I beg you in all respect, try to deter me from doing what
  I earnestly believe is the only right thing to do. I have decided to abdicate
  in favour of my cousin the Duc de Bordeaux, the only rightful and legitimate
  King of France, who will from now onwards be looked up to by all our adherents
  as the head of the house of Bourbon, and will, with God&rsquo;s help, and
  your co-operation, be crowned one day in Rheims Cathedral. I herewith append
  a copy of the proclamation I propose to send to all the Chancelleries of
  Europe. It would make me happier if, after reading this letter, you would
  send me your approval. I came to Baden-Baden hoping that you will allow me
  to plead my cause with you in person. In the meanwhile I have written this
  letter in all respect and affection. All I crave for now is your love.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Your dutiful son,<br>
  &ldquo;Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Friesen had read the letter through with unswerving attention. Parts of
  it he re-read more than once. Now he dropped the hand that held it. He looked
  up and saw Madame lying back in her chair, her head against the cushion,
  her eyes gazing up at the ceiling, her face paler than the lappets of old
  lace fastened under her chin.</p>
  <p>Though he had years of successful diplomacy behind him, Friesen was entirely
  at a loss what to say. How to begin to speak to this woman, who had just
  received the death-blow to her pride, to her ambition, to the dearest hopes
  of her life! The trouble was that what Louis said in this long letter was
  true. So very, very true. Neither God nor Fate had destined this vacillating,
  irresolute weakling to lead an army, to rally waverers to a moribund cause
  and to wear the crown of St. Louis. He was just a very nice boy, with no
  vices in his composition save those of incurable laziness and self-indulgence.
  There was no man in France less fitted to be her King than this effete scion
  of a noble race. And what was more pathetic than anything else was the fact
  that his own mother was well aware of this fact, and that she was even now
  breaking her heart over him.</p>
  <p>To gain time Count Friesen glanced perfunctorily at the draft of the proposed
  proclamation. There was nothing unusual in it; it was worded in much the
  same way as Charles X&rsquo;s abdication some fifteen years ago. Friesen
  felt, with the instinct of the shrewd diplomat, that it would have a very
  bad effect on the minds of foreign rulers and ministers who had up to now
  been supporters of the royalist cause in France. Vaguely he wondered what
  his own Emperor would think about it all, and how far he would blame him,
  Friesen, for what would be nothing short of a scandal. Louis&rsquo;s name
  would inevitably be coupled with that of Aline Saint-Amand. There would be
  tittle-tattle among the gossip-mongers, and democracy, though still in its
  infancy, would delight in the mud freely slung at royalty. That the uncrowned
  King of France was deep in the toils of the lovely <i>prima donna</i> could
  not for a moment remain in doubt. He had even gone to the length of being
  under the same roof with her.</p>
  <p>Friesen could have groaned aloud with mortification, for at once the image
  of Cyril Bertrand rose before his mind. The man out of all others who was
  so very much a man, whom any adherent of the Bourbon cause would willingly
  acclaim as the head of the family, was here in this very town. The enthusiasm
  which his mere appearance last night had provoked, proved beyond a doubt
  that his personality in itself would rally any number of loyalists to his
  flag.</p>
  <p>It did seem like the irony of Fate that these two half-brothers should be
  so alike in face and features and so immeasurably unlike physically and temperamentally.
  Friesen cursed Fate for having shuffled the cards with so much partiality,
  giving all the attributes of manhood to one, and to the other nothing but
  a birthright which he was ready to sell at the demand of a woman. No doubt
  that if at this moment Friesen had suddenly found himself face to face with
  the lovely Aline he would have tried to wring her pretty neck.</p>
  <p>Perhaps he did groan aloud, or was it merely that his expressive face betrayed
  something of what he thought and that Madame, happening to glance at him
  just then, saw or guessed what went on inside his clever brain? Certain it
  is that she said suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the only thing to do, Friesen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Austrian pulled himself together. He had the feeling that he had been
  dreaming. He asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That man must keep up the role&mdash;I hate him, but he must. Don&rsquo;t
  you see?&rdquo; she went on, as Friesen, bewildered, not quite understanding,
  could do little else but gasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; Madame reiterated in a dull, toneless
  voice. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that he must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen protested: &ldquo;But Madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are difficulties, I know,&rdquo; she went on slowly. &ldquo;I
  have been thinking about them ever since I received that abominable letter.
  But I can contend with them all, because I think he will be willing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; Friesen asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean my son Cyril, of course. You saw him last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When V&eacute;ronique Christophe curtsied to him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stood a little way behind, so I couldn&rsquo;t see his face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did. And I know how to read a man&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; She paused
  a moment, then added gravely: &ldquo;Friesen, that son of mine is in love
  with V&eacute;ronique Christophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He certainly is,&rdquo; Friesen admitted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had he met her before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He painted her portrait. You remember, Madame, I told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you did. I had forgotten. Anyway, it confirms my impression of
  what I saw last night. Cyril Bertrand is in love with V&eacute;ronique. He
  will be only too ready to continue to play his kingly role, until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until what, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until we can bring His Majesty to see reason.&rdquo; Then as Friesen,
  by his silence, seemed to intimate that he had not much hope of that, she
  went on: &ldquo;We can do it, Friesen, you know. You and I. Our influence
  against the wiles of that minx Saint-Amand. Baron Christophe&rsquo;s millions
  dangled before his eyes&mdash;and hers. They haven&rsquo;t a sou between
  them. Even if she was bribed to inveigle His Majesty into this absurd proclamation,
  the money wouldn&rsquo;t amount to much and Louis has extravagant tastes.
  We can do it, Friesen, you and I,&rdquo; she reiterated vehemently, &ldquo;and
  we must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen said nothing. He remained thoughtful, absorbed in reflections over
  Madame&rsquo;s new suggestion. She was a resourceful, masterful woman. No
  doubt about that. If she was laid in her coffin, she would devise a plan
  for rising out of it. Dead, she would be as dangerous as she was living.
  And she was terribly dangerous just now. A masterful woman, thwarted in her
  ambition and with her back to the wall! Friesen could not help wondering
  of what madness or crime she would not be capable. Presently she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a quarter of an hour, Friesen, to think about
  this. Don&rsquo;t speak to me. Close your eyes and think. After that we&rsquo;ll
  talk further about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen was not by any means weak in character; he would never have attained
  the prominent position which he held in international diplomacy if he had
  not been a man of firm purpose and of equally firm determination. But somehow
  this imperious woman held sway over his will. She was so determined to get
  what she wanted that by sheer argument she would compel him&mdash;and most
  men&mdash;to see eye to eye with her. It was wonderful to see her now, leaning
  back in her chair against a bright-coloured cushion, the black of her gown
  setting off the pallor of her face. Her eyes were closed. She had commanded
  her friend to think over her project and she left him to think in perfect
  silence, apparently incurious as to which way his thoughts would tend. Around
  her firm mouth there were some hard lines, which to Friesen suggested cruelty.
  She hated her eldest son, but smarting under the shame brought upon her by
  her favourite&rsquo;s letter, she was at this moment ready to sacrifice even
  him on the altar of her ambition.</p>
  <p>Obedient to her command Friesen remained absorbed in thought. And the Boule
  clock on the chimney piece ticked fifteen times sixty before Madame spoke.
  When the quarter of an hour had gone by, she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now tell me your objections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen waited a moment before he replied. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! Frankly I don&rsquo;t think that Cyril would do what you want!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that after to-day he will cut his stick and run.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For one thing, he said so to me this morning, and then&mdash;well!
  He is English&mdash;and you know what the English are&mdash;obstinate on
  a point of honour. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard and obstinate,&rdquo; Madame rejoined. &ldquo;You are right
  there, Friesen. And don&rsquo;t I know it? I was married three years to one
  of them. But you cannot get away from the fact that Cyril did agree to the
  deception. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only for the one short occasion&mdash;to avoid the scandal which
  would have covered the poor girl with ridicule. As you said just now&mdash;he
  is in love with her . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He would have signed His Majesty&rsquo;s name to the marriage contract.
  A forgery, Friesen. But for the accident to his hand, he would have done
  it; so his honour cannot be quite so ticklish as you imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure, Madame,&rdquo; Friesen put in dryly, &ldquo;that
  it was an accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame threw him a quick, enquiring look, but gave him no direct reply,
  and presently she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cyril has Spanish as well as English blood in his veins, and, in
  Spain, when a man is in love . . .&rdquo; She ended with a shrug that spoke
  volumes. Then she went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If Cyril&rsquo;s refusal is your only fear, you can dismiss it, my
  friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not only that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The game would be so terribly dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is the Saint-Amand girl, for one thing. She could give us away
  at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can deal with the Saint-Amand girl,&rdquo; Madame retorted with
  even more than her usual energy. &ldquo;It is a risk, I know, but I can deal
  with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How? Bribery? which invariably leads to blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not bribery only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Threats?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of a certain kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will, presently. Any other objection?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any day, any hour, someone might find out. And we should be in such
  a terrible position if they did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can they? No one but Cyril himself could do that and is he likely
  to, I ask you. Besides, it would only be for a day&mdash;or two. We can bring
  His Majesty to reason, and anyhow, I can deal with him and that minx. I know
  I can. He is at the Villa Eglantine with her. I will send Noc&eacute; to
  watch until she goes out. Then you can go and see him, Friesen. You will.
  I know you will. You have a great deal at stake, too, haven&rsquo;t you?
  His Majesty will be alone, and you can make him see reason. You are so clever,
  Friesen, you will know just how to put the case before him. When he understands
  that he and his Aline will be paupers, that they won&rsquo;t have a sou between
  them, beyond a small allowance which I might be persuaded to make personally
  to His Majesty, you will find that he will sing a very different tune. And
  so will that greedy baggage. She doesn&rsquo;t know that Louis has no private
  fortune of his own, and that we have been subsisting for years on allowances
  made to us by friends abroad and adherents at home. Well, after the scandal
  of an abdication we may take it that those allowances will cease, and all
  I shall have to live on will be the small fortune which my English husband
  left me, not enough to keep His ex-Majesty in luxury. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame paused a moment to draw breath, for she had spoken vehemently and
  at great length. Friesen had listened to her in silence. She didn&rsquo;t
  tell him anything which he didn&rsquo;t know already. After the death of
  Louis XVI, his present Majesty&rsquo;s grandfather, the revolutionary government
  of France had confiscated the whole of his private property. After the revolution
  and the fall of the Empire, Louis XVIII, as the acknowledged head of the
  family, took possession of it and Friesen knew quite well that the Emperor
  of Austria had been the chief financial support of Louis XVII first and of
  Madame and her son subsequently. That support would be automatically withdrawn,
  or at any rate substantially curtailed, if His Majesty retired into private
  life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know that what I am telling you is true, don&rsquo;t you, Friesen?&rdquo; Madame
  insisted after a time.</p>
  <p>Friesen nodded. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will know just what to say to His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I can get to see him . . .&rdquo; Friesen said dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must see him, Friesen, you must. For all our sakes. And after
  you have talked to him, you must bring him round to see me. And once I have
  him here between these four walls . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame gave another of her expressive shrugs, and Friesen was forced to
  admit within himself that if His Majesty could be got back somehow under
  her influence, she could again, as she had so often done before, twist him
  round her little finger. It was only the question of Cyril Bertrand and what
  his view would be of the new situation, which still remained a doubtful quantity.
  Putting, however, that question aside for the moment, Friesen now asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the position exactly at the moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame did not reply immediately. She was intent on studying her friend&rsquo;s
  face, trying to find in it an expression of wavering, of a tendency to give
  in to her arguments. A short sigh of satisfaction found its way through her
  firm lips, for she thought she had detected certain signs of weakening in
  Friesen&rsquo;s attitude. He seemed ready, at any rate, to discuss the proposition,
  and Madame, conscious of her own powers of persuasion, felt that she would,
  in the end, gain her point. For the moment and in order to gain time, she
  merely echoed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Friesen said. &ldquo;You had the last word with Cyril
  yesterday before the reception. I suppose you discussed the position with
  him. What did he say exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! All he condescended to say to me was that in order to save
  a grave scandal which would chiefly affect an innocent girl, he was willing
  for one evening to play the part of his half-brother, the King of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is, of course, what was originally understood between us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He told me. He said that the suggestion came from you, but that
  he had been quite willing to fall in with it. I then assured him that it
  would only be for the one evening. I thought at the time that that was all
  it would amount to. He then said that he very much objected&mdash;in fact
  that he flatly refused&mdash;to forge his brother&rsquo;s signature to the
  marriage contract, but that fortunately&mdash;he said &lsquo;fortunately&rsquo;&mdash;an
  accident to his right hand had made it impossible for him to hold a pen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never questioned whether it was an accident or not,&rdquo; Madame
  hastened to add, when she saw a curious expression flit over Friesen&rsquo;s
  face. &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I prepared the way with
  all our important friends for the story we shall have to tell to-morrow,
  namely, that His Majesty is suffering a great deal of pain from his injured
  hand, that he had developed a temperature and the doctor whom we called in
  immediately feared that the wound was becoming septic. He begged His Majesty
  to keep to his bed, so as to stave off serious complications.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did Cyril say to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He just laughed. You know his ugly way. But he raised no objections.
  I don&rsquo;t suppose he wishes to be seen in public again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not in public. But, of course, the representatives of our foreign
  friends will want to pay their respects before leaving. Cyril will have to
  see the Papal Nuncio and Cardinal Beneventy&mdash;also Prince Remiroff and
  Count Friedrich. Did you tell him that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m sure he won&rsquo;t object. He
  seemed amused, I thought, at the whole thing. And perhaps he had it in mind
  that he would see V&eacute;ronique again. Anyway, that is the position, Friesen.
  And now what do we do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about a line to His Majesty?&rdquo; Friesen suggested. &ldquo;He
  will expect some sort of answer to his letter. If he didn&rsquo;t get it,
  he might do something rash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly Madame rose. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said, and went across
  to her bureau. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send him a few non-committal words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She sat down and wrote a few words, read them through, strewed sand over
  the wet ink, but before she slipped the note into its envelope, she brought
  it across to show Friesen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that will do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention
  your coming visit, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen read the note through. It was quite short. Madame had written:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall hope to see you to-morrow. In all circumstances you can count
  on your mother&rsquo;s love and understanding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; was Friesen&rsquo;s curt comment.</p>
  <p>Madame addressed the envelope to &ldquo;His Majesty the King of France.&rdquo; She
  rang the bell and gave the letter to the major-domo.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take this letter yourself,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;to the Villa
  Eglantine and give it into His Majesty&rsquo;s own hands. No one else&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
  emphasised sternly.</p>
  <p>When the man had gone, Madame drew a deep sigh of relief, and sank back
  with something like a groan into the capacious arm-chair. She seemed wearied
  to death. Friesen allowed her to rest for a few moments, with her eyes closed,
  her handsome head pillowed against the cushion. Then he broached the question
  of Cyril Bertrand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall have to have a talk with Cyril before I see His Majesty,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>
  <p>Madame raised her head and looked at him enquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why on earth . . . ?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must know what his attitude is going to be. It&rsquo;s no good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good man,&rdquo; Madame broke in with obvious impatience, &ldquo;have
  you been in diplomacy all these years and yet know so little about human
  nature? Tell any man in love that he can spend another day or even another
  hour with his beloved, before parting from her probably for ever, and see
  if he will say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; or &lsquo;No, thank you, I have had enough.&rsquo; But
  have a talk with Cyril by all means. You see, I am so sure of the result.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen glanced up at the clock. It was just past six and the light was
  beginning to wane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back soon,&rdquo; he said, then added: &ldquo;You
  will let me see him alone, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! of course,&rdquo; Madame replied coolly. &ldquo;I have no wish
  to see him more often than I need.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen rose to take his leave. Madame stretched her hand out to him, and
  when he stooped to kiss it she held on to him, and said gravely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember one thing, my friend, when you talk to Cyril and also to
  Louis. I have the identity papers of both my sons, their birth and baptismal
  certificates. Nothing easier in the world than to change these. So Cyril
  need have no fear. You understand? I mean, in case Louis changed his mind&mdash;when
  it is too late. It all depends on me&mdash;not on him. Unless he listens
  to reason within the next twenty-four hours, he will become officially the
  son of my English husband, who&mdash;listen to me, Friesen&mdash;has been
  foolish enough to impersonate his younger brother in order to gain the favours
  of Mademoiselle Saint-Amand. Now do you see how the baggage can be dealt
  with? And how ready she will be to turn her back on His Majesty when she
  is made to understand that situation. It is my version of what has happened,
  and I will not swerve from it one iota. All the papers, mind you, will be
  in order and they will show that the man whom she has inveigled into her
  toils is my first-born, Cyril Bertrand, and that it is Cyril who is the son
  of Louis XVII King of France. God knows how I shall hate him for that, but
  I will make the sacrifice for the sake of the dynasty. You do understand,
  don&rsquo;t you, Friesen?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
  <p>Friesen assured her that he did. &ldquo;For the sake of the dynasty?&rdquo; He
  could not help smiling to himself, wondering if she really thought that he
  believed in her disinterestedness. However, he said nothing more now, and
  finally took his leave. He felt very like a conspirator taking leave of his
  accomplice. He was going to lend himself to her schemes. This much he knew,
  for she was a masterful woman, and had won him over to her point of view,
  chiefly because it coincided with his own desire in the matter. But he wondered
  if he had done right. There is a good old German proverb which says that &ldquo;he
  who says A must also say B&rdquo; and that was Count Friesen&rsquo;s position.
  He had been the prime mover in the original deception, and now he was wallowing
  in the intrigue up to his neck and could no longer draw back. He did not
  doubt for a moment that Cyril would agree to carry on; at the same time he
  was not blind to the fact that the game was going to be dangerous. Things
  had gone wonderfully smoothly up to now, but at any moment some unforeseen
  circumstances might bring the deception to light, and if such a mischance
  were to happen, the disgrace and scandal would spell ruin to him, as well
  as to the Bourbon cause. Ridicule would deal a death-blow to the cause, but
  the scandal would assuredly put an end to the public career of Count Friesen,
  the distinguished representative of a great Empire; and the only issue for
  him out of the disgrace would be a bullet through his head.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Friesen went back to the Villa Elisabeth later in the evening. He asked
  to see His Majesty and was shown into Cyril&rsquo;s private room.</p>
  <p>As soon as the Austrian came in, Cyril exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friesen, I am the happiest man on earth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The devil you are!&rdquo; was Friesen&rsquo;s smiling retort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, old man, and have a drink,&rdquo; the other went on gaily. &ldquo;What
  will you have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An English drink,&rdquo; Friesen replied and pointed to a bottle
  of Scotch whisky which stood on a tray on the table, together with a couple
  of glasses, wine and mineral waters. A table-lamp shed a pleasant light around.
  A nice fire roared in the big German stove. There was a cosiness, and an
  air of intimacy about the whole place. Friesen, feeling very hopeful and
  very much at home, sat down, while Cyril, who was humming softly to himself,
  poured out whisky and soda for him. Now Friesen was one of those men who
  had the faculty of noticing everything and keeping his observations to himself.
  In this case he saw that the hand with which his friend poured out the whisky
  shook slightly&mdash;very slightly. Also that there was a flush on his forehead
  and a warm glow in his eyes.</p>
  <p>He took the glass which Cyril now handed to him whilst he queried with a
  soup&ccedil;on of gentle irony:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing with yourself, to be the happiest man
  on earth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril was standing by the table. He too had a glass in his hand and was
  gazing into the bubbles that rose sparkling to the surface. After a moment
  or two he said with a quick, short sigh:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have laid up a store of memories which will last me as long as
  I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And they are sufficient to make you happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other gave a light shrug, emptied his glass at one draught, and sat
  down. He offered Friesen a cigarette, took one himself and set a match to
  both. For a few moments the two men smoked in silence, each buried in his
  own thoughts. Cyril had not yet replied to Friesen&rsquo;s last question.
  But presently he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Happiness is a relative term, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Friesen admitted, &ldquo;but what about you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! I have answered your question. Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Cyril
  retorted with a disarming smile.</p>
  <p>Friesen continued to smoke in silence. He was surreptitiously watching this
  man, whom he had in such a short while taken to his heart as a friend. The
  face was easy enough to read. There was nothing subtle in its expression.
  Introspection. Communion with self. Retirement into that world of memories
  of which he had spoken. He looked perfectly happy. All this was clearly depicted
  in Cyril&rsquo;s expressive face, nevertheless Friesen didn&rsquo;t quite
  know what to make of him. After a while he rejoined:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You say that you have answered my question. I suppose you mean that
  you answered it when you told me that you were the happiest man on earth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is what I did mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I begged leave to wonder whether any man&mdash;especially a man
  like you&mdash;can find happiness in memories alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s nothing else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is always something else, you know, Bertrand,&rdquo; Friesen
  said with sudden earnestness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In some cases, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In yours most decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To this Cyril made no answer. Clearly his mind was not entirely fixed on
  what Friesen was saying; his thoughts were roaming along paths that wound
  in and out of the realm of chimera and fantasy. Friesen tried to drag them
  back to the land of reality. Knowing what a queer temperament he had to deal
  with, he began the attack by putting one question very quietly and very gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you realised, Bertrand, that it rests entirely with you, whether
  your happiness in the future is going to rest on mere flimsy memories, or
  on a much more secure foundation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril frowned, then laughed and asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that there is no reason whatever why the present state of
  things should not continue&mdash;indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Cyril frowned, more puzzled than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I am more dense than usual, old man, but would you mind
  not talking in riddles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not talking in riddles. And I am perfectly serious,&rdquo; Friesen
  rejoined gravely. &ldquo;Listen. Your half-brother is in Baden-Baden. His
  mother and I are in touch with him, and I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that
  not only is he not in a fit state to take up the position which you have
  kept warm for him, but that he never will be. Frankly, I was very nervous
  last night as to what impression you would make on the crowd at your mother&rsquo;s
  reception. You are extraordinarily like your half-brother certainly, but
  there is always, in cases of this sort, a certain something which makes the
  one man different to any other, and I was terribly afraid that among the
  crowd last night there would be someone who would detect that certain something,
  which to my eyes, for instance, makes you so very different to His Majesty.
  I won&rsquo;t flatter you,&rdquo; Friesen added with a short laugh, &ldquo;by
  telling you in what that difference consists. Thank Heaven no one suspected
  it, not even Cardinal Beneventy, who has known you and your family for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused a moment, then as Cyril said nothing, he went on after a time:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not asking you to do anything that is going to hurt anyone.
  I give you my word that there is no one less desirous of leading a lost cause,
  or of occupying a precarious throne than the uncrowned King of France. He
  wrote to his mother this morning. I wish I had the letter to show you. He
  declares his intention of abdicating in favour of his cousin the Duc de Bordeaux.
  He calls himself &lsquo;the uncrowned&mdash;never to be crowned&mdash;King
  of France.&rsquo; He says that his only desire is to spend his days in obscurity
  in the arms of the one woman who understands him, and so on, and so on, <i>ad
  infinitum</i>. So you see that you need have no scruples on his score. On
  the contrary, you would confer the greatest benefit upon him, and also upon
  your mother, by taking over the leadership of the royalist cause, which under
  His present Majesty&rsquo;s chieftainship is in grave danger of a collapse.
  So much for your half-brother. As for Mademoiselle Christophe&mdash;No, don&rsquo;t
  interrupt till I have done,&rdquo; he went on as Cyril, at mention of the
  girl&rsquo;s name, gave a kind of gasp, and looked almost savagely across
  at his friend. &ldquo;I must speak of her, and you&rsquo;ve got to listen.
  The facts are quite simple in her case. I am neither so dense, nor so old,
  as not to have guessed something of what happened to-day. For one thing I
  saw last night that you were already in love with that exquisite child. Again
  I won&rsquo;t flatter you, but I imagine that by the end of to-day she is
  no longer indifferent to you either. She is romantic and your personality
  must come very near to what she has conceived would be her ideal mate. Just
  imagine her disillusionment if, within a few hours, she found herself in
  the arms of a weak, backboneless creature with no more power to give her
  love for love than a jellyfish. And now I have done. For one thing I am hoarse
  from so much talking. It is the longest speech I have ever made in my life;
  but I do want now to ask you in all fairness what possible harm there can
  be in a substitution&mdash;a deception if you like&mdash;which will secure
  your own happiness and the happiness of the woman you love, and will render
  an incalculable service to a legitimate and, if I may say so, a holy cause.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>Long after Friesen had finished speaking, a kind of ominous silence held
  sway in the cosy, lamp-lit room. Cyril had said nothing, had scarcely made
  a movement after that sudden gasp of protest when Friesen uttered V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s
  name. At first mention of &ldquo;His Majesty the King of France,&rdquo; all
  the light seemed to go out of Cyril&rsquo;s eyes. It seemed as if an invisible
  grey veil had been thrown over his face, changing its youthful colour to
  one of dead ashes. His world of happy memories seemed all at once to have
  crumbled to dust. His half-brother! Almost he had forgotten in the past golden
  hours that there was such a person as the real, the legitimate, King of France.
  His half-brother! So aptly described by Friesen as a jellyfish; a weak, effeminate,
  backboneless creature on whom V&eacute;ronique, when thrown into his arms,
  would begin to look at first with bewilderment, then with bitter disappointment,
  indifference, and finally with contempt.</p>
  <p>This was the first thought that flashed through Cyril&rsquo;s mind when
  Friesen spoke of his half-brother. And it was this thought which suddenly
  dimmed the light in his eyes and turned the fresh glow in his face to the
  colour of dead ashes. V&eacute;ronique was in love with love&rsquo;s dream.
  The awakening would be nothing short of a cataclysm. But what could he do?
  Fate had caught him in a snare out of which he could never free himself as
  long as he lived. Friesen had spoken of happiness. But there was no question
  of happiness in this. A few days ago, perhaps, before Friesen came to him
  with his fantastic plans and embroiled him in this inextricable web. Back
  in his studio in Paris he might have had the hope that with the lapse of
  time would come a measure of forgetfulness. If he had never seen V&eacute;ronique
  again, save as the central figure in a royal procession; if he had never
  thought of her again save as the future Queen of France, he might, in time,
  have found relief from torturing thoughts of her.</p>
  <p>But now! What had the future to offer him? Instinctively he looked across
  at Friesen. His friend. The complacent diplomat who saw no harm in the deception
  which he had engineered and which suited the tortuous plans that would bring
  about the triumph of one cause, as against that of another. Was Friesen right
  after all? What harm could come of grasping with both hands at this mirage
  of happiness which his friend dangled so tantalisingly before him? He cared
  nothing and less than nothing for any crown or throne, and common sense told
  him that the royalist cause in France was more dead than any dead thing on
  earth. Neither he nor anyone else had the power to revive it. But happiness
  did not mean a crown to Cyril Bertrand; it meant, first of all and all the
  time&mdash;V&eacute;ronique.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>How long the silence had lasted between the two men it is impossible to
  say. Cyril had not uttered a sound since Friesen had first spoken of the
  King of France. Indeed, he seemed to be quite unconscious of Friesen&rsquo;s
  presence. He had forgotten everything since the moment when a grisly spectre
  had risen up before him&mdash;the spectre of V&eacute;ronique&rsquo;s disillusionment
  and unhappiness.</p>
  <p>After a little time, Friesen ventured to speak again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any difficulty in the way, you know, Bertrand,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>
  <p>Cyril looked at him with the bewildered air of a man just roused from heavy
  sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; he muttered vaguely, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite catch
  . . . What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just wanted you to know that things will be made as easy for you
  as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, for instance, you need not be seen in public for a bit&mdash;Your
  hand, by the way&mdash;how is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril looked down at his bandaged hand with a kind of vacant stare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That sounds all right, at any rate,&rdquo; Friesen responded as cheerfully
  as he could&mdash;he was feeling far from cheerful at this moment, because
  he really didn&rsquo;t know what to make of Cyril and how the whole thing
  was going to work out. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we can put
  it about that you are suffering a good deal of pain, that the doctor is anxious
  about you and has recommended you to keep to your room for a day or two,
  as he fears that further excitement might cause the wound to become septic.
  In this way you need not face another crowd, only one or two of the foreign
  prelates and envoys who will pay their respects before taking their leave.
  That will be quite easy, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, quite!&rdquo; Cyril retorted, and he threw back his head and
  laughed. &ldquo;But do tell me,&rdquo; he went on more seriously, &ldquo;does
  His Majesty the King of France&mdash;the real one, I mean&mdash;know anything
  about this farce that is going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Friesen admitted, &ldquo;but he will presently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are going to tell him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His mother is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He might spoil sport, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be allowed to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who will prevent him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His mother&mdash;and yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you mean to tell me, that she&mdash;my mother and his&mdash;is
  willing that I, whom she hates, shall usurp the rights of the son whom she
  worships? You are not serious, are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never was so serious in my life. Your mother has been a wonderful
  ally to me; she knows that I am working under orders from my Emperor, and
  she has put her personal feelings aside for the sake of the cause and of
  the dynasty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen paused a moment, and then said with grave earnestness: &ldquo;Bertrand,
  you must do this for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For you? Why, what can you gain by this cruel farce which, mind you,
  should never have been started&mdash;never would have been started, if I
  had not been such a sentimental fool?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You happened to be a friend to me,&rdquo; Friesen rejoined, &ldquo;and
  now . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I just stand before you and before myself as a liar and a cheat
  . . . If you only knew how I loathe myself for it all. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is sentimental sophistry, if you will forgive my saying so.
  What you have got to think of is not your own point of view but the future
  of a woman who loves you and whom you love. Her happiness and yours. All
  of which you can attain by the sacrifice of what is after all mere exaggerated
  and selfish point of honour. You have got to think of V&eacute;ronique Christophe,
  of your mother&mdash;because in whatever way she may have wronged you in
  the past, she is your mother, after all&mdash;of your brother . . . of me,
  if you like, and not only of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have got to think of V&eacute;ronique Christophe . . . of me,
  if you like, and not only of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Friesen allowed this new train of thought to do its work. But it was in
  vain that he tried to guess what went on in Cyril&rsquo;s mind. Everything,
  he knew, would depend on what hold his love for V&eacute;ronique had on his
  temperament. The diplomat had seen too much of human nature, too many frailties
  and too many moral wrecks not to know that when a man is in love&mdash;really
  and unmistakably in love&mdash;the question of right or wrong, of expediency
  or the reverse, becomes relegated into the background. One thing must also
  be remembered and that is, that to Count Friesen there was nothing integrally
  wrong in what he suggested. As he had said a moment ago: &ldquo;No harm was
  being done to anyone&rdquo;: certainly not to Louis who would welcome with
  joy the thought that he would be free from the trammels of royalty, and from
  the domination of his mother, and free to live his life with the woman of
  his choice, in peace and obscurity. The harm would come if the truth ever
  came to light. But Madame&rsquo;s way of dealing with it&mdash;unscrupulous
  as it was&mdash;minimised every kind of danger, and since last night when
  there was not the faintest doubt in the mind of any one present&mdash;and
  most of them were clever and shrewd, the &eacute;lite of royalist partisans&mdash;what
  danger there was had become entirely negligible.</p>
  <p>Still Cyril said nothing and Friesen was left wondering. It was close on
  ten o&rsquo;clock now and not a sound from the outside broke the silence
  of this solemn moment. A restless clock ticked the time away with a kind
  of fussy rapidity. It was a funny old German clock. All face, and with a
  small pendulum that worked in front of that face. Friesen fell to watching
  that ceaseless motion. He was as it were hypnotised by it. Its monotonous
  ticking sound seemed to echo the &ldquo;Yes? No?&rdquo; of his own thoughts.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly something made him turn and glance up at his friend, and he
  saw that Cyril was looking at him, and smiling . . . that disarming smile
  of his. . . . And now he gave a shrug and then said lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have another drink, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No. It was not possible to read the man&rsquo;s thoughts. More especially
  as now he began to talk of other things. Politics. Music. The latest play.
  The actress <i>&agrave; la mode</i>. He poured out another glass of whisky
  for Friesen, and one for himself, and Friesen tried in vain to bring the
  conversation back to the one momentous topic. But in vain. The other eluded
  him every time, switched over at once to trivial small talk.</p>
  <p>Only at the end, when Friesen realised that he would get nothing more out
  of Cyril that night, he took his friend&rsquo;s uninjured hand and grasped
  it with a cordiality that was more eloquent than words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder whether you realise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a tremendous
  lot I have at stake in all this. Somehow I have an idea that you will play
  the game. You are English, Bertrand, more English than you realise yourself,
  and one always trusts an Englishman to play the game.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t say anything more. Cyril held on to his hand for a moment
  or two. The same rather puzzling smile still hung around his lips. It was
  a funny little smile, not altogether gay, nor at all sad. He had pulled the
  bell just before and the major-domo came to the door just then, and stood
  there waiting to show His Excellency out. The last sight Friesen had of his
  friend was of his tall figure silhouetted against the lamplight. A kingly
  figure. A true friend. An upright and honourable gentleman. But ever after
  Friesen remembered that funny little smile. At the moment he sighed and turned
  away for Cyril&rsquo;s head was bent and his whole figure immobile. He had
  a glass in his hand and was gazing down on the bubbles. Somehow he reminded
  Friesen of a statue he had seen in the spring Salon this year. It was the
  work of the rising young sculptor Auguste Rodin who had named his work &ldquo;Tristesse
  et Sourire.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>The next morning, long before the fashionable world was astir, street-cleaners,
  scavengers, road-menders and such-like folk saw the tall figure of a man
  standing in the roadway immediately facing the grandiose villa occupied by
  Baron Christophe, the Austrian banker, said to be the richest man in Europe.
  All those good folk knew nothing of the grave events which centred around
  that beautiful villa. They knew nothing of Bourbon claims to the throne of
  France or of the intrigue which was to enrich that cause with half a milliard,
  and place on the head of a commoner the crown of Marie Antoinette. If one
  of them cast more than a hurried glance at the cloaked figure which stood
  facing the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se at this hour of the morning,
  it was because the figure was good to look at; a fine, manly figure of a
  man, who gazed up at the windows of the villa so persistently that one road-mender
  remarked, smiling, to his mate: &ldquo;A lover, what?&rdquo; and the other
  retorted with a shrug: &ldquo;An unhappy one, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril had slept little that night. A man who is faced by the greatest problem
  of life, cannot hope to woo sleep successfully. And the greatest problem
  of life for any man or woman is when the choice has to be made between love&mdash;real
  love, not the shams of to-day&mdash;and a point of honour. This choice now
  lay before Cyril Bertrand. It was his hand, and his only, that held the balance.
  On the one side a life of joy, of luxury, of love, happiness not only for
  himself but for an exquisite child-woman who loved him and would find happiness
  in his arms. And on the other a harrowing life of deceit. The spectre of
  dishonour, unseen by all, but ever present before his own consciousness.
  Friesen had dubbed that spectre a selfish, exaggerated sophism. And Cyril
  was left to solve his life-problem as best he could, alone.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>He began the day by wandering down the lane as far as the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.
  He had called himself a sentimental fool, and he probably was. At any rate
  the present generation would call him so . . . although while the human race
  subsists and men are creatures of flesh and blood and not of putty, there
  will always be sentimental fools in the world, fools, that is, who are wiser
  far than all the sophisticated wiseacres that are fool enough to sneer at
  sentiment. So much for that, and for Cyril Bertrand&rsquo;s folly in going
  in the early dawn to gaze on the shuttered windows of the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se.
  He desired nothing so much as a last look at the child-woman whom he had
  learned to love so tenderly and so passionately. A last look. A farewell
  look, and then away into a world in which she would have no part. A world
  which would be immeasurably dreary and drab, but a world in which one played
  the game.</p>
  <p>By all the rules of romance, she should presently have opened her window,
  drawn by the irresistible magnetism of his glance, and he, Romeo-like, should
  have climbed over the intervening wall and from below her balcony have poured
  out into her willing ear the full measure of his love in words of rapture
  and ecstasy. Or else he should, like a timid lover, have been content to
  remain unobserved while he filled his mind with memories of her by gazing
  at the exquisite image she presented. But neither of these things happened.
  True the shutters of the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se were thrown open
  one by one, but the one head that this sentimental fool longed to see did
  not appear at any one of them. And so, after a time, and with an extra measure
  of contempt at his own folly, he went away.</p>
  <p>His way lay in the direction of the Villa Eglantine, brimful of memories:
  the house lower down the hill where he had lodged, when first he came to
  Baden-Baden, and before he had fully realised that V&eacute;ronique Christophe
  was destined for the King of France and not for him. He came in sight of
  the gate beside which, on that night in July, he had seen the King of France
  in the arms of Aline Saint-Amand, and had then felt such a surge of hatred
  rise within him because of this appalling treachery that it drove him to
  the point of fratricide. Close by was the spot where Louis reeled and fell
  with a cry like that of an animal in pain, and where he, Cyril, moved by
  an unexplainable impulse, had gathered the man he so hated in his arms and
  had carried him to the Villa Elisabeth. Here he had met Count Friesen for
  the first time. The hand of God? Surely not. For nothing but cruelty, and
  heartache, and lies had come out of it all. Rather was it the spindle of
  Fate, the relentless scissors of the three grim sisters, that in that instant
  cut the thread and thrums of his destiny.</p>
  <p>Cyril Bertrand paused a moment in sight of all these places, musing perhaps
  on all the strange events that followed on this first encounter with his
  half-brother. He was thinking of calling at the Villa Eglantine because he
  had made up his mind to speak with Louis, but there were servants at the
  villa who had perhaps been waiting at this very moment on the King, and at
  sight of Cyril, his very image, might through sheer stupidity, terror or
  amazement, precipitate a crisis which had at all costs to be avoided. While
  he stood for a moment in the road, debating with himself what he should do,
  he saw Louis himself come out of the gate arm-in-arm with Aline Saint-Amand.
  They turned to walk up the hill in the direction of the Villa Elisabeth.
  The two of them appeared very gay, chatting and laughing, and coming to a
  halt occasionally to exchange a hug or a kiss.</p>
  <p>Cyril decided to follow. At the next crossroads, the young couple on ahead
  came to a final halt. They took affectionate leave of one another, after
  which Louis turned up the road on the right, in the direction of the Villa
  Elisabeth, whilst Aline continued on her way, intent probably on lengthening
  her walk. Cyril waited a moment or two till she was out of sight, then he
  too turned up the road in the wake of His Majesty the King of France. A distant
  church clock struck nine just then. It was later than he thought. No wonder
  he felt both tired and cold. He had been out since early dawn, wandering
  he knew not how far, nor how long he had stood gazing at the shuttered windows
  of the Villa Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. The morning was fresh and he had
  had no breakfast. The leaves of sycamore and beech were beginning to lose
  their warm tones of burnt sienna and gold, and turning to a sadder, a more
  sober brown. The fallen leaves made a melancholy swishing sound under the
  wanderer&rsquo;s feet. The sound was reminiscent of a chorus of sighs.</p>
  <p>By the time Cyril had reached the gate of the Villa Elisabeth, Louis had
  already gone in. The villa was all opened up. The gardener was at work sweeping
  the paths. The front door was wide open, but the major-domo, who usually
  stood there with his nose in the air, and his hands behind his back surveying
  weather conditions, was not at his post. He had probably gone to usher His
  Majesty into the presence of Madame la Princesse. This suited Cyril&rsquo;s
  book admirably, for he had during the past thirty-six hours become fairly
  well acquainted with the internal geography of the villa. The only trouble
  that might arise would be if he met one of the indoor servants, who by some
  mischance had already caught sight of Louis himself.</p>
  <p>Trusting to luck, however, he gave the gardener the slip, went quickly up
  the garden path. He reached the inner hall of the villa, just at the moment
  when a door on the floor above was being discreetly closed. The next moment
  he caught sight of the major-domo&rsquo;s feet descending the wide circular
  stairs. Chance favoured him, for he had just time to slip behind one of the
  doors that gave on the hall. A minute or so later the major-domo reached
  the bottom of the stairs, crossed the hall, and once more took up his accustomed
  position in the entrance door, with nose in the air and hands behind his
  back, indicative of complete detachment from everything that went on inside
  the villa.</p>
  <p>Cyril now emerged from his hiding-place, ran up the stairs, and the next
  moment he was knocking at his mother&rsquo;s boudoir door.</p>
  <p>In response to his knock he heard something like a scramble proceeding from
  inside the room. A murmur of voices, followed by the opening and closing
  of a door. Clearly Louis had been with his mother, and been summarily ordered
  out again. Now a harsh, familiar voice called out: &ldquo;<i>Entrez!</i>&rdquo; Cyril
  pushed open the door and entered the room.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>Madame la Princesse was alone. She was sitting at her bureau, ostensibly
  writing a letter, but obviously she had only picked up her pen a second ago.
  Her cheeks were flushed, and the hand that held the pen shook visibly. All
  of which was a clear indication that the interview with her beloved son had
  been of a somewhat stormy character. Now, at sight of Cyril, she jumped up
  from her chair like a dart. Her trembling lips framed the one word: &ldquo;You?&rdquo; but
  did so in a tone that betrayed her agitation, her annoyance, and something
  like fear.</p>
  <p>Cyril closed the door behind him, then remained standing with his back to
  it.</p>
  <p>Madame queried testily: &ldquo;Well? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Louis?&rdquo; was Cyril&rsquo;s curt retort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s whereabouts do not concern you,&rdquo; Madame
  replied coldly; &ldquo;and perhaps you will tell me by what right you are
  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No right at all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I wish to see Louis. He
  was here a moment ago. Why did he run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will tell him when I see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I shall not let you see him till I know what you want with him.
  Do you imagine that you can force your way into the royal presence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Cyril broke in roughly, &ldquo;stop
  that business. Mine is too serious for all that rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now you are impertinent,&rdquo; Madame retorted haughtily. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know what you want to say to His Majesty that you cannot say
  to me. Are you afraid&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why this secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no secrecy,&rdquo; Cyril now said with growing impatience. &ldquo;I
  wish to hand over to my brother Louis, the banker&rsquo;s draft which Baron
  Christophe gave me the other night&mdash;not to me, that is, but to the King
  of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well? What about it? You can give the draft to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will give it to no one but to the King of France,&rdquo; Cyril
  concluded obstinately.</p>
  <p>Before Madame could utter another word, the door at the further end of the
  room was thrown open and Louis himself appeared under the lintel. He did
  look a strange figure indeed, did the uncrowned King of France. His eyes
  looked bleary and tired; his cheeks were flushed and the hand which clung
  to the door-knob looked moist and shaky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is quite right,&rdquo; he said with a short, inane laugh, &ldquo;and
  our royal mother is all wrong. You hand the nice little draft over to the
  King of France, old man. It is made out in our august name, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril had thrown one glance at his mother. She was standing quite still,
  very pale, frowning, obviously puzzled and vaguely terrified of something&mdash;she
  knew not what. Her fine eyes wandered restlessly from one face to the other.
  It was the first time she had seen her two sons standing face to face with
  one another, since they had become men. Of course, in some ways the resemblance
  was remarkable. The features were the same. Eyes and hair the same colour.
  There was even a certain resemblance in the build, and the tone of voice
  was the same. But there was a Something very, very different between the
  two, and no one knew better in what that difference consisted than Madame,
  their mother. Her frown deepened, she bit her lips and passed her handkerchief
  over her forehead.</p>
  <p>In the meanwhile Louis had stepped further into the room. He came to a halt
  beside his brother, and put out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, with the same kind of bashful laugh, &ldquo;that
  nice little draft? Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril dived into the pocket of his coat, and took a slip of paper out of
  his letter-case. Both Louis and Madame watched him with eager eyes while
  he turned it round once or twice in his hand, looking at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; Louis insisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In one moment,&rdquo; Cyril now said gravely. &ldquo;Before I do,
  I want you to give me your most solemn assurance, your oath in fact, that
  you will always love and honour the gracious lady who has consented to be
  your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was looking his brother squarely in the face while he said this. Somehow
  he did not like the expression in Louis&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard what I said,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shouted loud enough,&rdquo; the other retorted. &ldquo;But may
  I ask what concern it is of yours, and who the lady is of whom you speak
  so loudly and so eloquently?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I made a promise to Mademoiselle V&eacute;ronique Christophe in your
  name. I saved you from disgrace and her from humiliation. I also saved your
  precious cause from collapse by acting a lie before Baron Christophe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you to do all that, did I?&rdquo; Louis broke
  in sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. And that is part of the tragedy of it all. But we won&rsquo;t
  argue about it. It was done in your name and at your mother&rsquo;s desire,
  and that is all there is to it. But it was done, and, therefore, before I
  hand this draft over to you, I want you to swear to me that the innocent
  lady who is involved in all these schemes and all these lies, will never
  be made unhappy through you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Louis looked at his brother for a moment or two. And then threw back his
  head and breaking into loud and prolonged laughter, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well! If that isn&rsquo;t the funniest thing I ever heard in all
  my life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Madame was apparently unable to control her temper any longer. She said
  acidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the most insolent thing I ever heard.&rdquo; Then she added,
  turning brusquely on Cyril: &ldquo;I suppose you are in love with V&eacute;ronique
  Christophe yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She wanted to say something more, something more cruel and biting that would
  really hurt, but Louis now broke in:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry the poor man, mother,&rdquo; he said, still laughing. &ldquo;I
  am going to give him the assurance he wants, and then we shall all be happy
  again, and have no more rows. Look here,&rdquo; he added, turning to Cyril
  and speaking seriously and solemnly, &ldquo;I give you my word of honour
  that my life in future shall be spent in making the charming lady who has
  consented to be my wife, the happiest woman on earth. Now are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cyril, without a word, handed the draft to His Majesty the King, who took
  it from him, glanced at it, slipped it into the breast pocket of his coat,
  and then strode across the room. He came to a halt at the door, which was
  still wide open, turned once more to Cyril and said lightly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is all such damn&rsquo; nonsense, you know. Because I am never
  going to marry the gracious lady with whom you are in love, for the very
  good reason that I am married already and bigamy does not accord with the
  laws of France.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Louis!&rdquo; came in an agonised cry of protest from Madame,
  a cry that amounted to a shriek.</p>
  <p>But His Majesty only laughed again, that same inane, affected laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I be silent?&rdquo; he queried blandly. &ldquo;It will
  be known all over Europe presently that Louis XIX is no longer King of France,
  but just a happy man, married to the woman of his choice, the exquisite,
  the beautiful Aline Saint-Amand. And I swear to you here and now that I will
  always love and honour that gracious lady who has consented to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stepped back into the next room and closed the door behind him with a
  bang. Cyril, not unlike a maddened wild beast at that moment, took one leap
  in the direction of that door, but Madame was too quick for him, and interposed
  her tall, majestic figure between him and the murderous project that was
  only too apparent in every line of his face. She said nothing. It was only
  her eyes that spoke, and Cyril, looking straight into them, suddenly felt
  all his rage, his hatred of her, fall away from him. For the first time in
  his life he felt a twinge of tenderness for her. It was tenderness born of
  pity. He was immensely sorry for her, as sorry as he would have been if he
  had seen a fine and noble animal wounded and bleeding. A look of hopeless
  misery came creeping over her handsome face; her eyes lost their lustre,
  her cheeks became grey, her lips appeared bloodless. She swayed slightly
  on her feet and Cyril instinctively put out his arms to steady her, but she
  drew away from him as if he had been a noxious beast.</p>
  <p>But that mood only lasted a few seconds, and quite suddenly her whole attitude
  changed. Within a few seconds she was a transformed woman, and Cyril&rsquo;s
  pity for her gave place to complete amazement. She really was wonderful!
  The way she recovered herself, her air of authority, her domination over
  the catastrophic mischance appealed to Cyril&rsquo;s manliness, and roused
  his profound admiration. She just raised a handkerchief to her lips, and
  all trace of their quivering immediately vanished. And when she spoke, her
  voice, though perhaps more harsh even than usual, was perfectly steady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is all sheer nonsense,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;His Majesty
  has been inveigled into this by a designing woman. The marriage is entirely
  illegal, and the whole thing will be put right in a few days. In the meanwhile
  we will carry on in the way we have begun. You had better wait here, while
  I send someone round for Count Friesen. We will then hold council together,
  as to what action we had better take in the immediate future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Cyril shook his head gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must count me out of your council, Madame, and out of all your
  future schemes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That I am leaving Baden-Baden this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are not serious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was never so serious in all my life,&rdquo; he rejoined earnestly. &ldquo;A
  man is not likely to joke when he sees the structure which he has built up
  at the cost of his honour fall to pieces like a mass of dirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you talking rather high-falutin&rsquo; twaddle?&rdquo; Madame
  queried acidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am. And I know I am tiring you. So I will go, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned to the door, but Madame checked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she asked peremptorily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First to Baron Christophe,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To&mdash;&rdquo; Madame gasped. She put a hand to her throat as if
  she were choking. But with characteristic energy she quickly recovered herself
  and said quite calmly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are going to betray us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to tell Baron Christophe the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I thought you would do that,&rdquo; she retorted coldly, &ldquo;I
  would kill you now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Madame gave a contemptuous shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Cyril,&rdquo; was all she said in response: &ldquo;or
  else mad like your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am English like my father. And in England men do not look on complacently
  when they see a good woman sacrificed for the ambition of politicians. I
  am not going to see V&eacute;ronique Christophe made a pawn in the game which
  you are already turning over in your mind. I know that she will suffer&mdash;terribly,
  in her pride and in her affections, when she realises how she has been deceived
  and lied to, but that will be nothing to the lifelong agony she would endure
  if she were tied to a miserable skunk like my brother Louis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another contemptuous or angry retort hovered on Madame&rsquo;s lips, but
  her shrewd common sense came to her rescue just in time. She was quite clever
  enough to understand that she would gain nothing with this obstinate son
  of hers, either by passion or threat, and she was past-master in the art
  of changing her tactics as opportunity demanded. Past-master too in the art
  of suddenly changing her expression of face and the very tone of her voice.
  She did both now. Her whole face softened, her voice became gentle, almost
  appealing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Cyril,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is the use of our quarrelling
  like this? You attribute all sorts of evil motives to me, and, I am sorry
  to say, that we have never known each other intimately enough for you to
  understand me. . . . No!&rdquo; she hastened to add when she saw an expression
  of bitterness flit over her son&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sneer. I
  assure you I know a great many more things than you give me credit for. For
  one thing I know that V&eacute;ronique Christophe loves you just as much
  as you love her. . . . Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I
  mean every word I say. Here are you two young people, fond of one another,
  whom a lucky chance has brought together. You want to spend your lives together,
  don&rsquo;t you? You wouldn&rsquo;t be human if you did not. Well! Your future
  together rests with you, and with me. That banker&rsquo;s draft can be stopped,
  of course. Louis will only be too happy to give up all claims to the throne
  of France, to V&eacute;ronique Christophe and to her father&rsquo;s millions.
  All he will want will be an adequate sum of money to keep him and his egregious
  Aline in comparative luxury. On the other hand, you have already been accepted
  by a large number of influential persons as the son of Louis XVII, and the
  rightful King of France. Nothing can shake you from that position, so long
  as you hold your tongue. I am too deeply involved in the whole affair not
  to hold mine, and so is Count Friesen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She broke off at this point, and crossed over to her bureau. Cyril hadn&rsquo;t
  said a word. He just watched her while she opened a locked drawer and took
  out from it a bundle of papers. Out of these she selected a couple of documents,
  and with a hand that shook slightly she held them out for her son to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are your birth and baptismal certificates,
  yours and Louis&rsquo;s. From this moment, the one in the name of Louis Antoine
  Marie Charles Aim&eacute; de Bourbon will be yours, and the other in the
  name of Cyril Arthur Bertrand will become Louis&rsquo;s. So you see,&rdquo; Madame
  concluded, &ldquo;how simple and how safe it all is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She still held the documents out to Cyril, and when he made no movement
  to take them, or even to look at them, she thrust them in her excitement,
  almost into his face, so that he had to step back to avoid her striking him
  with them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you look at them?&rdquo; she insisted: &ldquo;you
  don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The expression on her face supplied the end of the phrase. Incredulity first,
  then fear, then towering passion. Half choking, she murmured:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, on what grounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That a life of dishonour, of lying, of filching what is not yours,
  can only lead to tragedy in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Louis is longing to abdicate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In favour of his cousin who will become the rightful King of France,
  but not in favour of Cyril Bertrand, the son of an English officer who would
  sooner have seen that son dead than living a life of dishonour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honour?&rdquo; Madame sneered. &ldquo;Dishonour? Big words, my son!
  Selfish, egotistical words! What about the unfortunate V&eacute;ronique and
  her future of humiliation and sorrow? Is that nothing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing to me?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Only my lifelong punishment
  for having lied to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he was gone before Madame could stop him, or utter another word.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
  <p>Twenty-four hours later Cyril was in Paris. He went straight to his studio
  in the Square R&eacute;aumur. He had wired to the <i>femme de m&eacute;nage</i> from
  Strasbourg and she had got the place ready and cosy for him. A cheerful fire
  roared in the iron stove; his slippers were being kept warm beside the fire,
  and the petrol lamp shed a pleasant, subdued light in this room which at
  one time had meant peace, joy, and contentment for the young ambitious worker.</p>
  <p>Now all it meant, all it would ever mean, was the memory of past joy and
  vanished quietude. Tearing himself away as soon as he could from Ang&egrave;le&rsquo;s
  effusive and rather noisy welcome, he went into his tiny bedroom and started
  unpacking his suit-case. Would he ever settle down again, he wondered, to
  work, to cadge for commissions, to accept rejection or acceptance slips from
  the hanging committee of the Salon, with an easy and philosophical shrug?
  Would he enjoy his chats with Mimi, the little model, give her bonbons and
  take her down to the Restaurant des Trois Rois to share his cassoulette with
  him, after a hard day&rsquo;s work? He couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at the
  thought, for he knew that things would never be the same again. The spirit
  of Montmartre, the gay, careless spirit had fled from him never to return&mdash;at
  least so he thought at the moment. He had taken one quick comprehensive glance
  round the studio. Ang&egrave;le, remembering past scoldings, had left everything
  in the same old order, the easel in its usual place, the platform with the
  rare Louis XV chair and the shabby bit of carpet and the empty wineglass
  on the table. How could the gay, careless spirit return when it would be
  met by this array of mute objects which bore testimony to the fact that things
  would never be again as they were before? Memories of the past were no longer
  happy. They were bitter and hurtful and raised demons of rebellion against
  Fate and a longing for revenge.</p>
  <p>With a shrug and a sneer Cyril had glanced round the studio, the only home
  he could have offered, even if he had the mind, to the girl-woman who had
  dreamed of becoming Queen of France one day: &ldquo;good Queen V&eacute;ronique.&rdquo; He
  had been the King for a day and a night. For one whole blissful day he had
  tasted the ecstasy of love. He had held in his arms the most perfect of God&rsquo;s
  creations, and dreamed a dream that in itself was Nirvana. And now he was
  just a poor struggling unknown artist with nothing to offer but immeasurable
  love and the service of a lifetime, and he was left wondering whether the
  great Italian poet was right when he said that &ldquo;sorrow&rsquo;s crown
  of sorrow is remembering happier things.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>It was an &ldquo;off-night&rdquo; at the Restaurant des Trois Rois. The
  crowded evenings, when all that was notorious and distinguished assembled
  round the wooden tables, and ate homely fare washed down with thin wine or
  beer, had not yet started. Most artists were still away painting in the country.
  Other great men were paying visits in their patrons&rsquo; ch&acirc;teaux,
  killing things by day and gossiping or playing whist by night. Cyril sat
  down at his accustomed table in the far corner of the room and ordered a <i>tournedos</i> and
  fried potatoes. There were two or three other men in the restaurant&mdash;men
  whom he knew&mdash;but in Montmartre one doesn&rsquo;t do more than nod to
  acquaintances when one isn&rsquo;t in the mood for gossip. Two strangers
  were sitting at a table close by. Young men, obviously English art students.
  Cyril listened perfunctorily to their talk. He loved the sound of English,
  loved everything in fact that was English, for the sake of the father whom
  he had never known, but whom, for some unaccountable reason, he had secretly
  worshipped. He had made great efforts to learn the language, at first from
  books, and in the past he had made as many friends as he could among the
  English art students who frequented the studios of Julien or Jean Paul Laurens.</p>
  <p>The two young men talked about many things: pictures, books, London life,
  a law case which had filled the columns of <i>The Times</i> with sensational
  details for the past few days&mdash;one of them had apparently studied law
  at one time until he had found that he had an art vocation. And that is where
  the Unseen Hand of God pointed the way to Cyril Bertrand. The young man,
  speaking of the law case, mentioned the solicitors who were acting for one
  of the parties. They were names unknown to Cyril, but the address of the
  firm was in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. The words struck Cyril&rsquo;s consciousness
  all in a moment. &ldquo;Of course, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields,&rdquo; the
  man had said in reply to a question from his friend. And this set up a train
  of thought in Cyril&rsquo;s mind. A trail, long since lost. Where had he
  heard or seen those three words? Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields?</p>
  <p>It was not till he got back to the studio that he remembered. I suppose
  it will seem almost unbelievable that he should have forgotten. But heavens
  above! what a lot of things had happened since he had received that telegram
  from the unknown London solicitors. And it had made no lasting impression
  on his mind. The very morning the telegram arrived Count Friesen had come
  along with the fantastic proposition which had culminated in so much shame
  and such appalling disaster. Since that morning Cyril had been King of France
  for thirty-six hours. He had also been the happiest and most miserable of
  men.</p>
  <p>Now he searched among a litter of papers which he had thrown into a drawer
  before starting with Friesen for Strasbourg and Fort Dyck. He found the telegram
  all right enough.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Have to acquaint you of the sudden death of Lord Longueville following
  an accident while shooting. You are his next of kin. Please come immediately.
  Carben and Houston, Solicitors, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That is what it said. Well! Why not? London was a long way from Baden-Baden
  and it might be easier to forget over there than here where everything reminded
  one of the past. In London there would be nothing. The people he would meet
  had probably never heard of an uncrowned King of France, and if they had
  they would probably smile and speak of other pretenders to that problematical
  crown, who had all turned out to be adventurers unworthy of serious consideration.
  And if those same people had heard of Baron Christophe they would surely
  not know that the great financier had an exquisite daughter who was eating
  out her heart now with shame and disappointment. London? Why not? And why
  should one not be called Lord Longueville, instead of Cyril Bertrand? One
  name was as good as another, and, after all, what did it all matter? So long
  as one had something to do, something that would help one to forget.</p>
  <p>Something that would help one not to be a weakling, to be a man, and to
  play the game.</p>
  <p>And so Cyril Bertrand, the unknown struggling artist, packed up his suit-case
  once more and the next day crossed over to England.</p>

  <p>Extracts from the diary of His Eminence Louis Beneventy, Cardinal Archbishop,
  Primate of Hungary, under date September 26th, 1860:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is with a shaking hand and a heavy heart that I am now putting
  on record the events of this very sad day. Looking back on the last entry
  I made in my diary, I can hardly believe that little more than forty-eight
  hours have gone by since then. Two days ago I made note in this same book,
  of my thoughts and impressions on that wonderful evening at the Villa Elisabeth,
  when I saw His Majesty the King of France plight his troth to the exquisite
  daughter of Baron Christophe and listened with a gladsome heart to the terms
  of a marriage contract which surely, I thought then, would receive the blessing
  of God. Never shall I forget that evening, and its memory will always be
  one of the happiest of my life, in spite of what has occurred since then.
  Never shall I forget that handsome kingly figure, the strong earnest face,
  the eyes that glowed with love, the lips that seemed incapable of lying.
  To see such an ideal&mdash;for it was an ideal&mdash;shattered, has nearly
  broken my heart. Through Baron Christophe&mdash;himself a broken-hearted
  man&mdash;I learnt early this morning that the handsome, earnest face, the
  noble brow and firm lips, were merely a mask to cover cruelty and deceit.
  His Majesty the King of France, whom may God forgive and save, has deceived
  us all, and broken the heart of an innocent and deeply-wronged woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thirty-six hours after the signature of the marriage contract, Baron
  Christophe received an urgent intimation to stop payment of the draft for
  half a milliard which he had handed over to His Majesty the King of France,
  as His Majesty would be unable to make use of the money in the manner Baron
  Christophe had intended that it should be used; also that His Majesty could
  not fulfil his promise to marry Mademoiselle Christophe, he having contracted
  a legal marriage with the young prima donna Aline Saint-Amand. The original
  intimation had come from Count Friesen, and Baron Christophe communicated
  it at once to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Directly I heard I sent an urgent message to Count Friesen, begging
  him to come and see me, but my messenger failed to find him, nor could I
  get in touch with him the whole of this day. I was left to ponder on the
  power which the devil exercises over certain souls that are noble in themselves,
  but are rendered weak through the wiles of designing women. Such a soul was
  that of His Majesty the King of France. Long experience has taught me to
  measure human character and human frailties, and I may safely say that never
  in my life have I seen a man whom I would have trusted so implicitly as I
  would His Majesty, as I saw him that night. And never in my life have I been
  so completely deceived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later in the day, as I still failed to get in touch with Count Friesen,
  I performed the painful duty of calling on Madame la Princesse de Bourbon,
  the unfortunate mother of an unfortunate son. On enquiry at the Villa Elisabeth
  I heard, to my sorrow, that Madame was very ill, that two doctors were in
  attendance, and great anxiety was felt for her future health. I spoke to
  one of the Sisters of Mercy who were attending Madame, and from her I gathered
  that the noble lady had had a severe heart-attack, which necessitated her
  keeping to her bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God forgive me, but I felt rather thankful that I was relieved from
  the prospect of such a painful interview. I sent a note round to Baron Christophe
  intimating that if my ministration was likely to be a comfort to his darling
  daughter, my time and service were at his disposal.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;September 27th, 9 a.m.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I slept little last night and spent many hours in prayer, imploring
  God&rsquo;s mercy for His erring son, the King of France, and His goodness
  and loving kindness for those who, at this hour and through no fault of their
  own, are in sorrow and great adversity. More especially did I commend to
  His Fatherly Goodness, that poor child V&eacute;ronique, on whom the weight
  of an immense affliction has fallen more heavily than on any one of us. I
  shall hope to see her later in the day, after my necessary interview with
  Count Friesen, for I have already received a very kind note from Baron Christophe,
  begging my presence by his daughter&rsquo;s side during the hour immediately
  following the terrible and, alas! inevitable revelation of the treachery
  which has been perpetrated against her.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;11 a.m.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Count Friesen has just gone. He was with me over an hour, and has
  left me in a state of bewilderment impossible to describe. He came to tell
  me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and it took him
  nearly an hour to persuade me that I was listening to the truth and not to
  the product of a fanciful imagination. The man whom I saw on that memorable
  evening at the Villa Elisabeth was not the King of France, but Cyril Bertrand,
  the son of Madame and her English husband. The man who had repudiated all
  his obligations, broken the heart of an innocent woman, foresworn his duty
  and smirched his crown was the real, the only legitimate King of France,
  Louis XIX, by the grace of God. To get these two facts into my head has meant
  a terrific effort for me in my declining years. What effect the revelation
  of them will have in the Chancelleries of Europe, on the mind of His Majesty
  the Emperor of Austria and of His Holiness the Pope, it is impossible to
  foresee. Count Friesen showed me the draft of a proclamation to be signed
  by His Majesty the King of France, renouncing all his rights present and
  future to the throne and crown of his forebears, in favour of his cousin,
  the Duc de Bordeaux, Comte de Chambord, henceforth Henri V, King of France.
  I could but approve of this step, although Count Friesen begged me most earnestly
  to use all my influence with Cyril Bertrand to continue the deception so
  successfully carried through the other evening. He argued that this could
  only be for the good of the cause and could not possibly injure or harm anyone.
  I thank God, however, that although I have been something of a diplomat all
  my life, I have never become a slave to the tortuous ways of diplomacy. Right
  has always seemed to me to be nothing but right, and wrong, nothing but wrong,
  even though it did no harm to anyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But quite apart from my own feelings in the matter, I was quite convinced
  in my mind that the man before whom I had made obeisance on that fateful
  evening, who had stood before me then, proud, earnest and loyal, would never
  consent to lead a life of deception. He had, unfortunately, been misled by
  sophistry and specious arguments, perhaps also by sentiment, into starting
  a deception which, alas! has carried its punishment along with it. I thought
  of him in his loneliness, sorrowing, regretful and ashamed, but was glad
  to hear that Count Friesen, travelling with him as far as Strasbourg yesterday
  had tried hard, and tried in vain, to persuade him to deviate further from
  the path of rectitude and honour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God in his Fatherly Goodness grant him comfort and peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>3</b></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;6 p.m.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am more convinced than I ever was before that the finest creation
  of God is a good woman. I have spent a very happy hour with one this afternoon,
  and feel morally and mentally all the better for it. I must confess that
  after my interview with Count Friesen I felt terribly depressed. Things in
  the world appeared dismally out of tune. People whom I have liked and esteemed
  were in grave trouble. I saw nothing but tears, heard nothing but sighs around
  me, and when I said my prayers in the early part of the afternoon, I implored
  God&rsquo;s help in the hard task which I had before me, that of bringing
  comfort to that sorely afflicted child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To my astonishment I found her serene, almost cheerful. She was sitting
  on the floor in front of the fire by her father&rsquo;s knee. He had just
  told her the whole truth, and when the servant showed me into the room, she
  was sitting quite still, holding on to her father&rsquo;s hand and looking
  into the flames. Baron Christophe rose to greet me, and she, very alert,
  jumped up, made me a pretty curtsy, and dragged a comfortable chair close
  to the fire for me. We all sat down, V&eacute;ronique resuming her place
  on the floor beside her father&rsquo;s knee. There was an engaging smile
  round her pretty mouth and her deep blue eyes looked more excited than sad.
  I began speaking first to her father then to her, hoping that I should find
  the right words in this terrible emergency. But V&eacute;ronique herself
  quickly reassured me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know just what your Eminence is going to say,&rsquo; she
  said gravely, &lsquo;but it won&rsquo;t be necessary. I don&rsquo;t want
  to be consoled or pitied. I am not unhappy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank God for that my child,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You
  are very young, and your heart has not been wounded as deeply as I feared.
  Time is all in your favour&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here V&eacute;ronique broke in very quietly, and, as I could see
  with earnest conviction:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is not a question of time,&rsquo; she rejoined. &lsquo;Time
  will probably never bring anything different into my life. Perhaps I shall
  not wish it. I don&rsquo;t know. But I am not unhappy. I never shall be.
  You see,&rsquo; she went on, and her dark eyes took on a strange, inward
  glow, &lsquo;I have not really been wronged. My King has not wronged me.
  My King loves me and he has done no wrong.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What answer could I give to this na&iuml;ve, this sublime profession
  of faith? The last thing in the world I would ever wish to do, would be to
  disturb the serenity of this loving soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After a time I took my leave. Certainly of us three, the child herself
  was infinitely the most cheerful. Even when she took leave of me, she clung
  to my hand, her lovely eyes sought mine, and her lips murmured softly once
  more, the formula of her trust and her faith:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My King can do no wrong.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gm&uuml;nd, September 23rd, 1862.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a date I do not care to recall. It brings back memories that
  make my tired old heart ache with a desire which I know to be sinful&mdash;the
  desire that the joy and the hopes of that never-to-be-forgotten evening had
  been continued, and that the world had never known the tragedy that underlay
  it all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two years have gone by since then. I can scarcely credit it. Time
  runs away so quickly when one is getting old. So many things have happened
  during those years, and I myself have been so helpless with gout that for
  months on end I failed in my self-imposed task of keeping my diary up-to-date.
  Thank God I am very much better now, and will make amends for past neglect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His Majesty the Emperor Francis Joseph is sending me to Paris on
  a special mission, the success or failure of which will have the greatest
  possible influence on the religious life of our friends in France. The few
  days I am spending here in prayer and self-communion are a preparation for
  my difficult task. During the past two years I have seen little or nothing
  of those who were my fellow-actors in the past tragedy. Baron Christophe
  alone came to see me last winter while I was in Vienna. I was happy to hear
  from him that V&eacute;ronique has lost nothing of her serenity and of her
  faith. He had taken his daughter for an interesting voyage to Egypt during
  the autumn following the tragedy, and after that he settled down with her
  in the beautiful ch&acirc;teau he owns in Bohemia. But she has really seemed
  so well during all this time and so strangely happy, that he had decided
  to resume his normal life with her in Paris next winter. I couldn&rsquo;t
  help noticing, however, that whenever he spoke of his daughter, he appeared
  puzzled, as if there was something about her he could not understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame la Princesse de Bourbon, I am sorry to say, has never recovered
  from the grave shock her son&rsquo;s conduct caused both to her health and
  to her spirits. She continues to live in Baden-Baden in the Villa Elisabeth,
  as she finds the curative waters there very beneficial, but she never leaves
  her room, and a Sister of Mercy is in constant attendance upon her. I understand
  that His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, with his usual generosity, makes
  her a handsome allowance, which enables her to live quietly, in comparative
  comfort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of his former Majesty the King of France I am not permitted to speak.
  He lives in Holland, so I am told, and his wife has sung with considerable
  success both in Berlin and at The Hague. Every loyal Frenchman, who believes
  in the divine right of Kings, has sworn allegiance to Henri V, the one and
  only legitimate King of France, whom may God guard and bring one day to the
  throne of his forbears. By tacit consent, the name of Louis XIX is never
  mentioned in royalist circles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paris, November 9th, 1862.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the artistic <i>milieu</i> in which it has been my great good
  fortune to move there had been quite a good deal of talk about a beautiful
  picture which was on exhibition in one of the smaller art galleries in the
  Boulevard. It was a landscape, which art connoisseurs over here tell me could
  easily rank with some of the finest work of French paysagists. The talk at
  once awakened my deepest interest for I was told that the picture was signed
  Cyril Bertrand, a name that had already been favourably noted a couple of
  years ago through a remarkably fine portrait by the same brush of Mademoiselle
  Christophe, the daughter of the great international financier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am an old man and I consider that my sacred calling gives me certain
  privileges, denied perhaps to others. I went to the gallery where Cyril Bertrand&rsquo;s
  picture was exhibited. I asked to speak to the manager and asked him to put
  me in touch with the artist whom I had known ever since he was a child. To
  my astonishment M. Petit, the manager, was strangely reticent, and with all
  the respect due to me, he firmly declined to give me the assistance which
  I sought. But though I am an old man, I am still wilful and obstinate. And
  standing before the picture signed Cyril Bertrand, recalling the fine, kingly
  figure before whom I had once made obeisance, I made up my mind that, undaunted
  by M. Petit&rsquo;s reticence, I would at all costs get in touch with the
  lad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some people might think it sinful to act as I did then. But my conscience
  never pricked me for what I did do, and I am sure it would have been very
  uneasy if I had done wrong. I paid a second visit to M. Petit&rsquo;s gallery,
  and instead of speaking with him personally I interviewed his clerk&mdash;a
  nice young fellow only too ready to accept the present of money I offered
  him, if he gave me valuable information concerning Monsieur Bertrand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What he told me was indeed astonishing. He showed me the last letter
  which the firm had received from the artist. It was dated from a place in
  England, where he lived, and his name was not Bertrand at all. He was Lord
  Longueville, and to all appearances a great gentleman, with plenty of money,
  a dilettante with a talent for painting which almost amounted to genius.
  I was bewildered. I know quite a good deal about England and its peerage,
  and that it often happens that a <i>cadet de famille</i> of one of the great
  houses will see his name changed three and four times, as older members of
  the family happen to die, and he becomes first the heir with a title of his
  own, and ultimately ends by being the head of the house. But I never knew
  that Sir Mark Bertrand, Madame&rsquo;s first husband, had any connection
  with the peerage. The letter was luckily written in French as I, alas! do
  not know a word of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tongue, and from it I gathered that
  Cyril would be coming over to Paris in about a fortnight&rsquo;s time. It
  ended with the words: &lsquo;I shall of course stay at my old studio in the
  Square R&eacute;aumur.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The young clerk put me <i>au fait</i> where the Square R&eacute;aumur
  was; anyone in the Square, he said, would tell me which was Monsieur Bertrand&rsquo;s
  studio. With many expressions of goodwill I gave him five louis, and went
  away quite satisfied with what I had done. All this occurred in the middle
  of last month.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;November 10th.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was too tired yesterday to continue writing and I didn&rsquo;t
  want to slur over any of the events of the past three weeks. After my second
  visit to Monsieur Petit&rsquo;s gallery, I prayed to God to guide me and
  to help me in the task I had set to myself. On my knees I thank Him now for
  His guidance and His aid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I began by seeking out my old friend Baron Christophe who had already
  taken up his residence in his fine mansion in the Rue de Varennes. He came
  to see me at my hotel and at my special request he paid me a second visit,
  this time bringing his daughter with him. V&eacute;ronique was as engaging,
  as young, and with it all as serene as before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mention Cyril, of course, nor his picture, but could
  not help speculating whether she had been to the gallery Petit or not. But
  we did speak of many things. I tried to interest the child in several serious
  questions, all of which obviously appealed to her. She was remarkably intelligent,
  and after this first visit she appeared extraordinarily grateful and flattered
  when I asked her to come now and then to cheer an old man in his solitude.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She came again and again, and we had many intimate talks together
  on religion, on art, on social problems, so that before a fortnight had gone
  by we had become firm friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On the third of this month I drove over Clichy way, dismissed my <i>voiture</i> at
  the entrance of the Square R&eacute;aumur, and went in search of my old friend
  Cyril Bertrand. Monsieur Petit&rsquo;s clerk had not prepared me for the
  surroundings in which I should find him. Those surroundings might almost
  be called squalid: the houses and the studio itself appeared more like the
  quarters of a struggling young artist, than those of a wealthy dilettante.
  The door was opened by an amiable and obese woman who told me that Monsieur
  Bertrand was out, and also that he never received visitors. However, a louis
  went a long way towards removing that objection, and also the fact that my
  winter coat, happening to gape at the moment, displayed the purple buttons
  of my cassock, and so over-awed the worthy woman that she nearly fell down
  on her knees, and only recovered herself sufficiently to usher me into the
  studio, where there was a cosy fire, and a certain atmosphere which strangely
  enough evoked before my mental vision just that same kingly form, and open,
  loyal countenance, which I had hoped to find.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cyril came in half an hour later. He received me with very obvious
  joy. I could not detect the slightest <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i> in
  his fine eyes, or in the smile with which he greeted me. We talked of many
  things. I made him relate to me the circumstances under which he had become
  the head of a distinguished family. This he did quite frankly and again without <i>arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e</i>.
  When I have a little more leisure I will note all these circumstances in
  this little book. Never once were the names of Baron Christophe and of his
  daughter mentioned by either of us. But we spoke of Madame la Princesse and
  of His ex-Majesty, also of Count Friesen who had been transferred lately
  to the Austrian Legation in London, and whose friendship Cyril apparently
  valued as highly as he had done before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We parted the best of friends, Cyril giving me his promise that he
  would come and see me at my hotel the very next morning. I went away somewhat
  saddened, for I had found him very changed. He looked older, very much older,
  and somehow he gave one the impression of a man who had done with life, and
  who only eked out the remaining years that were granted him, without looking
  forward to either joy or peace. He loved his art, but deprecated the success
  he was enjoying. Palette and brushes, I guessed, only helped him to forget.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He came to see me two or three times, and very obviously enjoyed
  the intimate terms into which we both fell after his very first visit. As
  with V&eacute;ronique I talked to him of many things, but unlike V&eacute;ronique
  he appeared only dispassionately interested. I always encouraged him to call
  on me in the mornings, because my afternoons were devoted to V&eacute;ronique.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But three days ago I sent him word that I was engaged during the
  morning but begged him to come in the late afternoon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;V&eacute;ronique was with me. It was four o&rsquo;clock. My sitting-room
  in the hotel looked exceptionally cosy. The chambermaid had, at my request,
  put bowls of roses on the tables. There was a cosy wood-fire burning in the
  open grate, and a soft rose-coloured shade tempered the light of the lamp.
  Never had I seen the child look more lovely, and I thanked God for having
  inspired me to do the one thing which has brought lifelong happiness to two
  loyal and trusting souls. She and I were talking over a charitable organisation
  which Baron Christophe had endowed recently, when the door was opened and
  Cyril came in. V&eacute;ronique who had been gazing into the fire looked
  round and then rose all in a moment like a dart. He never moved but she advanced
  towards him, and as she did so she caught my eye and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I knew that my King loved me and had done me no wrong.&rsquo; Whereupon
  I went as noiselessly as I could out of the room, but before I had reached
  the door she was already in his arms.&rdquo;</p>
