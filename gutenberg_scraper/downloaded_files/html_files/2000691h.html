  <p>On the diggings up to twenty odd years ago&mdash;and as far back as I can
    remember&mdash;on Lambing Flat, the Pipe Clays, Gulgong, Home Rule, and so
    through the roaring list; in bark huts, tents, public-houses, sly grog shanties,
    and&mdash;well, the most glorious voice of all belonged to a bad girl. We
    were only children and didn&rsquo;t know why she was bad, but we weren&rsquo;t
    allowed to play near or go near the hut she lived in, and we were trained
    to believe firmly that something awful would happen to us if we stayed to
    answer a word, and didn&rsquo;t run away as fast as our legs could carry
    us, if she attempted to speak to us. We had before us the dread example of
    one urchin, who got an awful hiding and went on bread and water for twenty-four
    hours for allowing her to kiss him and give him lollies. She didn&rsquo;t
    look bad &mdash; she looked to us like a grand and beautiful lady-girl&mdash; but
    we got instilled into us the idea that she was an awful bad woman, something
    more terrible even than a drunken man, and one whose presence was to be feared
    and fled from. There were two other girls in the hut with her, also a pretty
    little girl, who called her &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo;, and with whom we were not
    allowed to play&mdash;for they were all bad; which puzzled us as much as
    child-minds can be puzzled. We couldn&rsquo;t make out how everybody in one
    house could be bad. We used to wonder why these bad people weren&rsquo;t
    hunted away or put in gaol if they were so bad. And another thing puzzled
    us. Slipping out after dark, when the bad girls happened to be singing in
    their house, we&rsquo;d sometimes run against men hanging round the hut by
    ones and twos and threes, listening. They seemed mysterious. They were mostly
    good men, and we concluded they were listening and watching the bad women&rsquo;s
    house to see that they didn&rsquo;t kill anyone, or steal and run away with
    any bad little boys &mdash; ourselves, for instance&mdash;who ran out after
    dark; which, as we were informed, those bad people were always on the lookout
    for a chance to do.</p>
  <p>We were told in after years that old Peter McKenzie (a respectable, married,
    hard-working digger) would sometimes steal up opposite the bad door in the
    dark, and throw in money done up in a piece of paper, and listen round until
    the bad girl had sung the &ldquo;Bonnie Hills of Scotland&rdquo; two or three
    times. Then he&rsquo;d go and get drunk, and stay drunk two or three days
    at a time. And his wife caught him throwing the money in one night, and there
    was a terrible row, and she left him; and people always said it was all a
    mistake. But we couldn&rsquo;t see the mistake then.</p>
  <p>But I can hear that girl&rsquo;s voice through the night, twenty years ago:</p>
  <p class="note">Oh! the bloomin&rsquo; heath, and the pale blue bell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my bonnet then I wore;<br>
    And memory knows no brighter theme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than those happy days of yore.<br>
    Scotland! Land of chief and song!<br>
Oh, what charms to thee belong!</p>
  <p>And I am old enough to understand why poor Peter McKenzie &mdash; who was
    married to a Saxon, and a Tartar&mdash;went and got drunk when the bad girl
    sang  &ldquo;The Bonnie Hills of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">His anxious eye might look in vain<br>
For some loved form it knew!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And yet another thing puzzled us greatly at the time. Next door to the bad
    girl&rsquo;s house there lived a very respectable family&mdash; a family
    of good girls with whom we were allowed to play, and from whom we got lollies
    (those hard old red-and-white &ldquo;fish lollies&rdquo; that grocers sent
    home with parcels of groceries and receipted bills). Now one washing day,
    they being as glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out, we went
    over to the good house and found no one at home except the grown-up daughter,
    who used to sing for us, and read &ldquo;<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>&rdquo; of
    nights, &ldquo;out loud&rdquo;, and give us more lollies than any of the
    rest&mdash;and with whom we were passionately in love, notwithstanding the
    fact that she was engaged to a &ldquo;grown-up man&rdquo;&mdash; (we reckoned
    he&rsquo;d be dead and out of the way by the time we were old enough to marry
    her). She was washing. She had carried the stool and tub over against the
    stick fence which separated her house from the bad house; and, to our astonishment
    and dismay, the bad girl had brought <i>her</i> tub over against her side
    of the fence. They stood and worked with their shoulders to the fence between
    them, and heads bent down close to it. The bad girl would sing a few words,
    and the good girl after her, over and over again. They sang very low, we
    thought. Presently the good grown-up girl turned her head and caught sight
    of us. She jumped, and her face went flaming red; she laid hold of the stool
    and carried it, tub and all, away from that fence in a hurry. And the bad
    grown-up girl took her tub back to her house. The good grown-up girl made
    us promise never to tell what we saw &mdash; that she&rsquo;d been talking
    to a bad girl&mdash;else she would never, never marry us.</p>
  <p>She told me, in after years, when she&rsquo;d grown up to be a grandmother,
    that the bad girl was surreptitiously teaching her to sing  &ldquo;Madeline&rdquo; that
    day.</p>
  <p>I remember a dreadful story of a digger who went and shot himself one night
    after hearing that bad girl sing. We thought then what a frightfully bad
    woman she must be. The incident terrified us; and thereafter we kept carefully
    and fearfully out of reach of her voice, lest we should go and do what the
    digger did.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I have a dreamy recollection of a circus on Gulgong in the roaring days,
    more than twenty years ago, and a woman (to my child-fancy a being from another
    world) standing in the middle of the ring, singing:</p>
  <p class="note">Out in the cold world&mdash;out in the street&mdash;<br>
    Asking a penny from each one I meet;<br>
    Cheerless I wander about all the day,<br>
Wearing my young life in sorrow away!</p>
  <p>That last line haunted me for many years. I remember being frightened by
    women sobbing (and one or two great grown-up diggers also) that night in
    that circus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, Dear Father, Come Home with Me Now&rdquo;, was a sacred song
    then, not a peg for vulgar parodies and more vulgar &ldquo;business&rdquo; for
    fourth-rate clowns and corner-men. Then there was &ldquo;The Prairie Flower&rdquo;. &ldquo;Out
    on the Prairie, in an Early Day&rdquo;&mdash;I can hear the digger&rsquo;s
    wife yet: she was the prettiest girl on the field. They married on the sly
    and crept into camp after dark; but the diggers got wind of it and rolled
    up with gold-dishes, shovels,  &amp;c., &amp;c., and gave them a real good
    tinkettling in the old-fashioned style, and a nugget or two to start housekeeping
    on. She had a very sweet voice.</p>
  <p class="note">Fair as a lily, joyous and free,<br>
Light of the prairie home was she.</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s a &ldquo;granny&rdquo; now, no doubt&mdash;or dead.</p>
  <p>And I remember a poor, brutally ill-used little wife, wearing a black eye
    mostly, and singing &ldquo;Love Amongst the Roses&rdquo; at her work. And
    they sang the &ldquo;Blue Tail Fly&rdquo;, and all the first and best coon
    songs&mdash; in the days when old John Brown sank a duffer on the hill.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The great bark kitchen of Granny Mathews&rsquo; &ldquo;Redclay Inn&rdquo;.
    A fresh back-log thrown behind the fire, which lights the room fitfully.
    Company settled down to pipes, subdued yarning, and reverie.</p>
  <p>Flash Jack&mdash;red sash, cabbage-tree hat on back of head with nothing
    in it, glossy black curls bunched up in front of brim. Flash Jack volunteers,
    without invitation, preparation, or warning, and through his nose:</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">There was a wild kerlonial youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Dowlin was his name!<br>
  He bountied on his parients,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lived in Castlemaine!</p>
  <p>and so on to&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">He took a pistol from his breast<br>
    And waved that lit&mdash;tle toy&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little toy&rdquo; with an enthusiastic flourish and great unction
    on Flash Jack&rsquo;s part&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight, but I won&rsquo;t surrender!&rdquo; said<br>
    The wild Kerlonial Boy.</p>
  <p>Even this fails to rouse the company&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;Give us
    a song, Abe! Give us the &lsquo;Lowlands&rsquo;!&rdquo; Abe Mathews, bearded
    and grizzled, is lying on the broad of his back on a bench, with his hands
    clasped under his head&mdash; his favourite position for smoking, reverie,
    yarning, or singing. He had a strong, deep voice, which used to thrill me
    through and through, from hair to toenails, as a child.</p>
  <p>They bother Abe till he takes his pipe out of his mouth and puts it behind
    his head on the end of the stool:</p>
  <p class="note">The ship was built in Glasgow;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the &ldquo;Golden Vanitee&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Lines have dropped out of my memory during the thirty years gone between&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!</p>
  <p>The public-house people and more diggers drop into the kitchen, as all do
    within hearing, when Abe sings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, boys:</p>
  <p class="note">And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, all together!</p>
  <p class="note">The Low Lands! The Low Lands!<br>
    And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Toe and heel and flat of foot begin to stamp the clay floor, and horny hands
    to slap patched knees in accompaniment.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh! save me, lads!&rdquo; he cried,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m drifting with the current,<br>
    And I&rsquo;m drifting with the tide!<br>
    And I&rsquo;m sinking in the Low Lands, Low!<br>
    The Low Lands! The Low Lands!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old bark kitchen is a-going now. Heels drumming on gin-cases under stools;
    hands, knuckles, pipe-bowls, and pannikins keeping time on the table.</p>
  <p class="note">And we sewed him in his hammock,<br>
    And we slipped him o&rsquo;er the side,<br>
    And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!<br>
    The Low Lands! The Low Lands!<br>
    And we sunk him in the Low Lands, Low!</p>
  <p>Old Boozer Smith&mdash;a dirty gin-sodden bundle of rags on the floor in
    the corner with its head on a candle box, and covered by a horse rug&mdash; old
    Boozer Smith is supposed to have been dead to the universe for hours past,
    but the chorus must have disturbed his torpor; for, with a suddenness and
    unexpectedness that makes the next man jump, there comes a bellow from under
    the horse rug:</p>
  <p class="note">Wot though!&mdash;I wear!&mdash;a rag!&mdash;ged coat!<br>
    I&rsquo;ll wear it like a man!</p>
  <p>and ceases as suddenly as it commenced. He struggles to bring his ruined
    head and bloated face above the surface, glares round; then, no one questioning
    his manhood, he sinks back and dies to creation; and subsequent proceedings
    are only interrupted by a snore, as far as he is concerned.</p>
  <p>Little Jimmy Nowlett, the bullock-driver, is inspired. &ldquo;Go on, Jimmy!
    Give us a song!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">In the days when we were hard up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of wood and wire&mdash;</p>
  <p>Jimmy always blunders; it should have been &ldquo;<i>food and fire</i>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">We used to tie our boots up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lit&mdash;tle bits&mdash;er wire;</p>
  <p>and&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">I&rsquo;m sitting in my lit&mdash;tle room,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It measures six by six;<br>
    The work-house wall is opposite,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve counted all the bricks!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give us a chorus, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy does, giving his head a short, jerky nod for nearly every word, and
    describing a circle round his crown&mdash;as if he were stirring a pint of
    hot tea&mdash;with his forefinger, at the end of every line:</p>
  <p class="note">Hall!&mdash;Round!&mdash;Me&mdash;Hat!<br>
    I wore a weepin&rsquo; willer!</p>
  <p>Jimmy is a Cockney.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, boys!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">Hall&mdash;round&mdash;me hat!</p>
  <p>How many old diggers remember it?</p>
  <p>And:</p>
  <p class="note">A butcher, and a baker, and a quiet-looking quaker,<br>
    All a-courting pretty Jessie at the Railway Bar.</p>
  <p>I used to wonder as a child what the &ldquo;railway bar&rdquo; meant.</p>
  <p>And:</p>
  <p class="note">I would, I would, I would in vain<br>
    That I were single once again!<br>
    But ah, alas, that will not be<br>
    Till apples grow on the willow tree.</p>
  <p>A drunken gambler&rsquo;s young wife used to sing that song&mdash;to herself.</p>
  <p>A stir at the kitchen door, and a cry of &ldquo;Pinter,&rdquo; and old Poynton,
    Ballarat digger, appears and is shoved in; he has several drinks aboard,
    and they proceed to &ldquo;git Pinter on the singin&rsquo; lay,&rdquo; and
    at last talk him round. He has a good voice, but no &ldquo;theory&rdquo;,
    and blunders worse than Jimmy Nowlett with the words. He starts with a howl&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!<br>
    Way down in Covent Gar-ar-r-dings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-strolling I did go,<br>
    To see the sweetest flow-ow-wers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e&rsquo;er in gardings grow.</p>
  <p>He saw the rose and lily&mdash;the red and white and blue&mdash; and he
    saw the sweetest flow-ow-ers that e&rsquo;er in gardings grew; for he saw
    two lovely maidens (Pinter calls &rsquo;em &ldquo;virgings&rdquo;) underneath
    (he must have meant on top of)  &ldquo;<i>a garding chair</i>&rdquo;, sings
    Pinter.</p>
  <p class="note">And one was lovely Jessie,<br>
    With the jet black eyes and hair,</p>
  <p>roars Pinter,</p>
  <p class="note">And the other was a vir-ir-ging,<br>
    I solemn-lye declare!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maiden, Pinter!&rdquo; interjects Mr. Nowlett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; retorts Pinter. &ldquo;A maiden <i>is</i> a
    virging, Jimmy. If you&rsquo;re singing, Jimmy, and not me, I&rsquo;ll leave
    off!&rdquo; Chorus of &ldquo;Order! Shut up, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">I quicklye step-ped up to her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto her did sa-a-y:<br>
    Do you belong to any young man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoh, tell me that, I pra-a-y?</p>
  <p>Her answer, according to Pinter, was surprisingly prompt and unconventional;
    also full and concise:</p>
  <p class="note">No; I belong to no young man&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I solemnlye declare!<br>
    I mean to live a virging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still my laurels wear!</p>
  <p>Jimmy Nowlett attempts to move an amendment in favour of &ldquo;maiden&rdquo;,
    but is promptly suppressed. It seems that Pinter&rsquo;s suit has a happy
    termination, for he is supposed to sing in the character of a &ldquo;Sailor
    Bold&rdquo;, and as he turns to pursue his stroll in &ldquo;Covent Gar-ar-dings&rdquo;:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;I love a Sailor Bold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hong-kore, Pinter! Give us the &lsquo;Golden Glove&rsquo;, Pinter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus warmed up, Pinter starts with an explanatory &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; to
    the effect that the song he is about to sing illustrates some of the little
    ways of woman, and how, no matter what you say or do, she is bound to have
    her own way in the end; also how, in one instance, she set about getting
    it.</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!<br>
    Now, it&rsquo;s of a young squoire near Timworth did dwell,<br>
    Who courted a nobleman&rsquo;s daughter so well&mdash;</p>
  <p>The song has little or nothing to do with the &ldquo;squire&rdquo;, except
    so far as &ldquo;all friends and relations had given consent,&rdquo; and&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">The troo-soo was ordered&mdash;appointed the day,<br>
    And a farmer were appointed for to give her away&mdash;</p>
  <p>which last seemed a most unusual proceeding, considering the wedding was
    a toney affair; but perhaps there were personal interests&mdash; the nobleman
    might have been hard up, and the farmer backing him. But there was an extraordinary
    scene in the church, and things got mixed.</p>
  <p class="note">For as soon as this maiding this farmer espied:<br>
  &ldquo;Hoh, my heart! Hoh, my heart!<br>
  &ldquo;Hoh, my heart!&rdquo; then she cried.</p>
  <p>Hysterics? Anyway, instead of being wed&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">This maiden took sick and she went to her bed.</p>
  <p>(N.B.&mdash; Pinter sticks to &lsquo;<i>virging</i>&rsquo;.)</p>
  <p>Whereupon friends and relations and guests left the house in a body (a strange
    but perhaps a wise proceeding, after all&mdash;maybe they smelt a rat) and
    left her to recover alone, which she did promptly. And then:</p>
  <p class="note">Shirt, breeches, and waistcoat this maiding put on,<br>
    And a-hunting she went with her dog and her gun;<br>
    She hunted all round where this farmier did dwell,<br>
    Because in her own heart she love-ed him well.</p>
  <p>The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now:</p>
  <p class="note">And often she fired, but no game she killed&mdash;</p>
  <p>which was not surprising&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">Till at last the young farmier came into the field&mdash;</p>
  <p>No wonder. She put it to him straight:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, why are you not at the wedding?&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;For to wait on the squoire, and to give him his bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was as prompt and as delightfully unconventional in his reply as the
    young lady in Covent Gardings:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! and oh, no! For the truth I must sa-a-y,<br>
    I love her too well for to give her a-w-a-a-y!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>which was satisfactory to the disguised &ldquo;virging&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;. . . . and I&rsquo;d take sword in hand,<br>
    And by honour I&rsquo;d win her if she would command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which was still more satisfactory.</p>
  <p class="note">Now this virging, being&mdash;</p>
  <p>(Jimmy Nowlett: &ldquo;Maiden, Pinter&mdash;&rdquo; Jim is thrown on a stool
    and sat on by several diggers.)</p>
  <p class="note">Now this maiding, being please-ed to see him so bold,<br>
    She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold,</p>
  <p>and explained that she found it in his field while hunting around with her
    dog and her gun. It is understood that he promised to look up the owner.
    Then she went home and put an advertisement in the local&nbsp;<i>Herald</i>;
    and that ad. must have caused considerable sensation. She stated that she
    had lost her golden glove, and</p>
  <p class="note">The young man that finds it and brings it to me,<br>
    Hoh! that very young man my husband shall be!</p>
  <p>She had a saving clause in case the young farmer mislaid the glove before
    he saw the ad., and an <i>old</i> bloke got holt of it and fetched it along.
    But everything went all right. The young farmer turned up with the glove.
    He was a very respectable young farmer, and expressed his gratitude to her
    for having &ldquo;<i>honour-ed him with her love.</i>&rdquo; They were married,
    and the song ends with a picture of the young farmeress milking the cow,
    and the young farmer going whistling to plough. The fact that they lived
    and grafted on the selection proves that I hit the right nail on the head
    when I guessed, in the first place, that the old nobleman was &ldquo;stony&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>In after years,</p>
  <p class="note">. . . she told him of the fun,<br>
    How she hunted him up with her dog and her gun.</p>
  <p>But whether he was pleased or otherwise to hear it, after years of matrimonial
    experiences, the old song doesn&rsquo;t say, for it ends there.</p>

  <p>But Sam Holt makes a pile and goes home, leaving many a better and worse

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVisionofSandyBlight"></a>A Vision of Sandy Blight</b></h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been humping my back, and crouching and groaning for an hour or
    so in the darkest corner of the travellers&rsquo; hut, tortured by the demon
    of sandy blight. It was too hot to travel, and there was no one there except
    ourselves and Mitchell&rsquo;s cattle pup. We were waiting till after sundown,
    for I couldn&rsquo;t have travelled in the daylight, anyway. Mitchell had
    tied a wet towel round my eyes, and led me for the last mile or two by another
    towel&mdash; one end fastened to his belt behind, and the other in my hand
    as I walked in his tracks. And oh! but this was a relief! It was out of the
    dust and glare, and the flies didn&rsquo;t come into the dark hut, and I
    could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort. I didn&rsquo;t
    want a thousand a year, or anything; I only wanted relief for my eyes &mdash;that
    was all I prayed for in this world. When the sun got down a bit, Mitchell
    started poking round, and presently he found amongst the rubbish a dirty-looking
    medicine bottle, corked tight; when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper
    that was pasted on, he saw &ldquo;eye-water&rdquo; written on it. He drew
    the cork with his teeth, smelt the water, stuck his little finger in, turned
    the bottle upside down, tasted the top of his finger, and reckoned the stuff
    was all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! Wake up, Joe!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bottle
    of tears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bottler wot?&rdquo; I groaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eye-water,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to
    be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake; perhaps some burning acid
    had got into that bottle, or the label had been put on, or left on, in mistake
    or carelessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no harm in
    tryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I chanced it. I lay down on my back in a bunk, and Mitchell dragged my lids
    up and spilt half a bottle of eye-water over my eye-balls.</p>
  <p>The relief was almost instantaneous. I never experienced such a quick cure
    in my life. I carried the bottle in my swag for a long time afterwards, with
    an idea of getting it analysed, but left it behind at last in a camp.</p>
  <p>Mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully, and watched me for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait a bit longer,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and
    if it doesn&rsquo;t blind you I&rsquo;ll put some in my eyes. I&rsquo;m getting
    a touch of blight myself now. That&rsquo;s the fault of travelling with a
    mate who&rsquo;s always catching something that&rsquo;s no good to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As it grew dark outside we talked of sandy-blight and fly-bite, and sand-flies
    up north, and ordinary flies, and branched off to Barcoo rot, and struck
    the track again at bees and bee stings. When we got to bees, Mitchell sat
    smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards along tracks and branch
    tracks, and round corners and circles he had travelled, right back to the
    short, narrow, innocent bit of track that ends in a vague, misty point&mdash;like
    the end of a long, straight, cleared road in the moonlight&mdash;as far back
    as we can remember.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had about fourteen hives,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;we
    used to call them  &lsquo;swarms&rsquo;, no matter whether they were flying
    or in the box&mdash;when I left home first time. I kept them behind the shed,
    in the shade, on tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes; but
    I had to make legs later on, and stand them in pans of water, on account
    of the ants. When the bees swarmed&mdash;and some hives sent out the Lord
    knows how many swarms in a year, it seemed to me&mdash; we&rsquo;d tin-kettle  &rsquo;em,
    and throw water on &rsquo;em, to make &rsquo;em believe the biggest thunderstorm
    was coming to drown the oldest inhabitant; and, if they didn&rsquo;t get
    the start of us and rise, they&rsquo;d settle on a branch&mdash; generally
    on one of the scraggy fruit trees. It was rough on the bees&mdash; come to
    think of it; their instinct told them it was going to be fine, and the noise
    and water told them it was raining. They must have thought that nature was
    mad, drunk, or gone ratty, or the end of the world had come. We&rsquo;d rig
    up a table, with a box upside down, under the branch, cover our face with
    a piece of mosquito net, have rags burning round, and then give the branch
    a sudden jerk, turn the box down, and run. If we got most of the bees in,
    the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow, and
    then we reckoned we&rsquo;d shook the queen in. If the bees in the box came
    out and joined the others, we&rsquo;d reckon we hadn&rsquo;t shook the queen
    in, and go for them again. When a hive was full of honey we&rsquo;d turn
    the box upside down, turn the empty box mouth down on top of it, and drum
    and hammer on the lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the
    top box. I suppose it made their heads ache, and they went up on that account.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose things are done differently on proper bee-farms. I&rsquo;ve
    heard that a bee-farmer will part a hanging swarm with his fingers, take
    out the queen bee and arrange matters with her; but our ways suited us, and
    there was a lot of expectation and running and excitement in it, especially
    when a swarm took us by surprise. The yell of &lsquo;Bees swarmin&rsquo;!&rsquo; was
    as good to us as the yell of &lsquo;Fight!&rsquo; is now, or &lsquo;Bolt!&rsquo; in
    town, or &lsquo;Fire&rsquo; or &lsquo;Man overboard!&rsquo;  at sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was tons of honey. The bees used to go to the vineyards at
    wine-making and get honey from the heaps of crushed grape-skins thrown out
    in the sun, and get so drunk sometimes that they wobbled in their bee-lines
    home. They&rsquo;d fill all the boxes, and then build in between and under
    the bark, and board, and tin covers. They never seemed to get the idea out
    of their heads that this wasn&rsquo;t an evergreen country, and it wasn&rsquo;t
    going to snow all winter. My younger brother Joe used to put pieces of meat
    on the tables near the boxes, and in front of the holes where the bees went
    in and out, for the dogs to grab at. But one old dog, &lsquo;Black Bill&rsquo;,
    was a match for him; if it was worth Bill&rsquo;s while, he&rsquo;d camp
    there, and keep Joe and the other dogs from touching the meat&mdash;once
    it was put down&mdash;till the bees turned in for the night. And Joe would
    get the other kids round there, and when they weren&rsquo;t looking or thinking,
    he&rsquo;d brush the bees with a stick and run. I&rsquo;d lam him when I
    caught him at it. He was an awful young devil, was Joe, and he grew up steady,
    and respectable, and respected&mdash;and I went to the bad. I never trust
    a good boy now. . . . Ah, well!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the first swarm we got. We&rsquo;d been talking of getting
    a few swarms for a long time. That was what was the matter with us English
    and Irish and English-Irish Australian farmers: we used to talk so much about
    doing things while the Germans and Scotch did them. And we even talked in
    a lazy, easy-going sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one blazing hot day I saw father coming along the road, home
    to dinner (we had it in the middle of the day), with his axe over his shoulder.
    I noticed the axe particularly because father was bringing it home to grind,
    and Joe and I had to turn the stone; but, when I noticed Joe dragging along
    home in the dust about fifty yards behind father, I felt easier in my mind.
    Suddenly father dropped the axe and started to run back along the road towards
    Joe, who, as soon as he saw father coming, shied for the fence and got through.
    He thought he was going to catch it for something he&rsquo;d done&mdash;or
    hadn&rsquo;t done. Joe used to do so many things and leave so many things
    not done that he could never be sure of father. Besides, father had a way
    of starting to hammer us unexpectedly&mdash; when the idea struck him. But
    father pulled himself up in about thirty yards and started to grab up handfuls
    of dust and sand and throw them into the air. My idea, in the first flash,
    was to get hold of the axe, for I thought it was sun-stroke, and father might
    take it into his head to start chopping up the family before I could persuade
    him to put it (his head, I mean) in a bucket of water. But Joe came running
    like mad, yelling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Swarmer&mdash;bees! Swawmmer&mdash;bee&mdash;ee&mdash;es!
    Bring&mdash;a&mdash;tin&mdash;dish&mdash;  and&mdash;a&mdash;dippera&mdash;wa-a-ter!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ran with a bucket of water and an old frying-pan, and pretty soon
    the rest of the family were on the spot, throwing dust and water, and banging
    everything, tin or iron, they could get hold of. The only bullock bell in
    the district (if it was in the district) was on the old poley cow, and she&rsquo;d
    been lost for a fortnight. Mother brought up the rear&mdash;but soon worked
    to the front&mdash; with a baking-dish and a big spoon. The old lady&mdash;she
    wasn&rsquo;t old then&mdash;  had a deep-rooted prejudice that she could
    do everything better than anybody else, and that the selection and all on
    it would go to the dogs if she wasn&rsquo;t there to look after it. There
    was no jolting that idea out of her. She not only believed that she could
    do anything better than anybody, and hers was the only right or possible
    way, and that we&rsquo;d do everything upside down if she wasn&rsquo;t there
    to do it or show us how&mdash;but she&rsquo;d try to do things herself or
    insist on making us do them her way, and that led to messes and rows. She
    was excited now, and took command at once. She wasn&rsquo;t tongue-tied,
    and had no impediment in her speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t throw up dust!&mdash;Stop throwing up dust!&mdash; Do
    you want to smother &rsquo;em?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t throw up so much water!&mdash; Only
    throw up a pannikin at a time!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want to drown &rsquo;em?
    Bang! Keep on banging, Joe!&mdash;Look at that child! Run, someone!&mdash;run!
    you, Jack!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want the child to be stung to death?&mdash;Take
    her inside! . . . Dy&rsquo; hear me? . . . Stop throwing up dust, Tom! [To
    father.] You&rsquo;re scaring &rsquo;em away! Can&rsquo;t you see they want
    to settle?&rsquo; [Father was getting mad and yelping: &lsquo;For Godsake
    shettup and go inside.&rsquo;] &lsquo;Throw up water, Jack! Throw up&mdash;Tom!
    Take that bucket from him and don&rsquo;t make such a fool of yourself before
    the children! Throw up water! Throw&mdash;keep on banging, children! Keep
    on banging!&rsquo; [Mother put her faith in banging.] &lsquo;There!&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    off! You&rsquo;ve lost &rsquo;em! I knew you would! I told yer&mdash;keep
    on bang&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bee struck her in the eye, and she grabbed at it!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother went home&mdash;and inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father was good at bees&mdash;could manage them like sheep when he
    got to know their ideas. When the swarm settled, he sent us for the old washing
    stool, boxes, bags, and so on; and the whole time he was fixing the bees
    I noticed that whenever his back was turned to us his shoulders would jerk
    up as if he was cold, and he seemed to shudder from inside, and now and then
    I&rsquo;d hear a grunting sort of whimper like a boy that was just starting
    to blubber. But father wasn&rsquo;t weeping, and bees weren&rsquo;t stinging
    him; it was the bee that stung mother that was tickling father. When he went
    into the house, mother&rsquo;s other eye had bunged for sympathy. Father
    was always gentle and kind in sickness, and he bathed mother&rsquo;s eyes
    and rubbed mud on, but every now and then he&rsquo;d catch inside, and jerk
    and shudder, and grunt and cough. Mother got wild, but presently the humour
    of it struck her, and she had to laugh, and a rum laugh it was, with both
    eyes bunged up. Then she got hysterical, and started to cry, and father put
    his arm round her shoulder and ordered us out of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were very fond of each other, the old people were, under it
    all&mdash;right up to the end. . . . Ah, well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell pulled the swags out of a bunk, and started to fasten the nose-bags
    on.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AndyPagesRival"></a>Andy Page&rsquo;s Rival</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Tall and freckled and sandy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of a country lout;<br>
    That was the picture of Andy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middleton&rsquo;s rouseabout.<br>
    On Middleton's wide dominions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plied the stock-whip and shears;<br>
Hadn&rsquo;t any opinions&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>And he hadn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;ideers&rdquo;&mdash;at least, he said so
    himself&mdash; except as regarded anything that looked to him like what he
    called &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, under which heading he catalogued tyranny,
    treachery, interference with the liberty of the subject by the subject, &ldquo;blanky&rdquo; lies,
    or swindles&mdash;all things, in short, that seemed to his slow understanding
    dishonest, mean or paltry; most especially, and above all, treachery to a
    mate. <i>That</i> he could never forget. Andy was uncomfortably &ldquo;straight&rdquo;.
    His mind worked slowly and his decisions were, as a rule, right and just;
    and when he once came to a conclusion concerning any man or matter, or decided
    upon a course of action, nothing short of an earthquake or a Nevertire cyclone
    could move him back an inch&mdash;unless a conviction were severely shaken,
    and then he would require as much time to &ldquo;back&rdquo; to his starting
    point as he did to come to the decision.</p>
  <p>Andy had come to a conclusion with regard to a selector&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;name,
    Lizzie Porter&mdash;who lived (and slaved) on her father&rsquo;s selection,
    near the township corner of the run on which Andy was a general &ldquo;hand&rdquo;.
    He had been in the habit for several years of calling casually at the selector&rsquo;s
    house, as he rode to and fro between the station and the town, to get a drink
    of water and exchange the time of day with old Porter and his &ldquo;missus&rdquo;.
    The conversation concerned the drought, and the likelihood or otherwise of
    their ever going to get a little rain; or about Porter&rsquo;s cattle, with
    an occasional enquiry concerning, or reference to, a stray cow belonging
    to the selection, but preferring the run; a little, plump, saucy, white cow,
    by-the-way, practically pure white, but referred to by Andy&mdash;who had
    eyes like a blackfellow&mdash;as &ldquo;old Speckledy&rdquo;. No one else
    could detect a spot or speckle on her at a casual glance. Then after a long
    bovine silence, which would have been painfully embarrassing in any other
    society, and a tilting of his cabbage-tree hat forward, which came of tickling
    and scratching the sun-blotched nape of his neck with his little finger,
    Andy would slowly say: &ldquo;Ah, well. I must be gettin&rsquo;. So-long,
    Mr. Porter. So-long, Mrs. Porter.&rdquo; And, if <i>she</i> were in evidence &mdash;as
    she generally was on such occasions&mdash;&ldquo;So-long, Lizzie.&rdquo; And
    they&rsquo;d shout: &ldquo;So-long, Andy,&rdquo; as he galloped off from
    the jump. Strange that those shy, quiet, gentle-voiced bushmen seem the hardest
    and most reckless riders.</p>
  <p>But of late his horse had been seen hanging up outside Porter&rsquo;s for
    an hour or so after sunset. He smoked, talked over the results of the last
    drought (if it happened to rain), and the possibilities of the next one,
    and played cards with old Porter; who took to winking, automatically, at
    his &ldquo;old woman&rdquo;, and nudging, and jerking his thumb in the direction
    of Lizzie when her back was turned, and Andy was scratching the nape of his
    neck and staring at the cards.</p>
  <p>Lizzie told a lady friend of mine, years afterwards, how Andy popped the
    question; told it in her quiet way&mdash;you know Lizzie&rsquo;s quiet way
    (something of the old, privileged house-cat about her); never a sign in expression
    or tone to show whether she herself saw or appreciated the humour of anything
    she was telling, no matter how comical it might be. She had witnessed two
    tragedies, and had found a dead man in the bush, and related the incidents
    as though they were common-place.</p>
  <p>It happened one day&mdash;after Andy had been coming two or three times
    a week for about a year&mdash;that she found herself sitting with him on
    a log of the woodheap, in the cool of the evening, enjoying the sunset breeze.
    Andy&rsquo;s arm had got round her&mdash; just as it might have gone round
    a post he happened to be leaning against. They hadn&rsquo;t been talking
    about anything in particular. Andy said he wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
    they had a thunderstorm before mornin&rsquo;&mdash; it had been so smotherin&rsquo; hot
    all day.</p>
  <p>Lizzie said, &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy smoked a good while, then he said: &ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s a weary
    world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lizzie didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
  <p>By-and-bye Andy said: &ldquo;Ah, well; it&rsquo;s a lonely world, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you feel lonely, Andy?&rdquo; asked Lizzie, after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Lizzie; I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lizzie let herself settle, a little, against him, without either seeming
    to notice it, and after another while she said, softly: &ldquo;So do I, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy knocked the ashes from his pipe very slowly and deliberately, and put
    it away; then he seemed to brighten suddenly, and said briskly: &ldquo;Well,
    Lizzie! Are you satisfied!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andy; I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m quite sure, Andy. I&rsquo;m perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Lizzie&mdash;it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But to-day&mdash;a couple of months after the proposal described above&mdash;  Andy
    had trouble on his mind, and the trouble was connected with Lizzie Porter.
    He was putting up a two-rail fence along the old log-paddock on the frontage,
    and working like a man in trouble, trying to work it off his mind; and evidently
    not succeeding&mdash; for the last two panels were out of line. He was ramming
    a post&mdash; Andy rammed honestly, from the bottom of the hole, not the
    last few shovelfuls below the surface, as some do. He was ramming the last
    layer of clay when a cloud of white dust came along the road, paused, and
    drifted or poured off into the scrub, leaving long Dave Bentley, the horse-breaker,
    on his last victim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy! Graftin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Dave,&rdquo; said Andy, in a strange voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right!&rdquo; said Dave, rather puzzled. He got down,
    wondering what was up, and hung his horse to the last post but one.</p>
  <p>Dave was Andy&rsquo;s opposite in one respect: he jumped to conclusions,
    as women do; but, unlike women, he was mostly wrong. He was an old chum and
    mate of Andy&rsquo;s who had always liked, admired, and trusted him. But
    now, to his helpless surprise, Andy went on scraping the earth from the surface
    with his long-handled shovel, and heaping it conscientiously round the butt
    of the post, his face like a block of wood, and his lips set grimly. Dave
    broke out first (with bush oaths):</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Spit it out! What have I been doin&rsquo;  to
    you? What&rsquo;s yer got yer rag out about, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy faced him suddenly, with hatred for &ldquo;funny business&rdquo; flashing
    in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you say to my sister Mary about Lizzie Porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave started; then he whistled long and low. &ldquo;Spit it all out, Andy!&rdquo; he
    advised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said she was travellin&rsquo; with a feller!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the harm in that? Everybody knows that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If any crawler says a word about Lizzie Porter&mdash;look here, me
    and you&rsquo;s got to fight, Dave Bentley!&rdquo; Then, with still greater
    vehemence, as though he had a share in the garment: &ldquo;Take off that
    coat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I know it!&rdquo; said Dave, with the sudden quietness that
    comes to brave but headstrong and impulsive men at a critical moment: &ldquo;Me
    and you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to fight, Andy; and&rdquo; (with sudden energy) &ldquo;if
    you try it on I&rsquo;ll knock you into jim-rags!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, stepping close to Andy and taking him by the arm: &ldquo;Andy, this
    thing will have to be fixed up. Come here; I want to talk to you.&rdquo; And
    he led him some paces aside, inside the boundary line, which seemed a ludicrously
    unnecessary precaution, seeing that there was no one within sight or hearing
    save Dave&rsquo;s horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy; let&rsquo;s have it over. What&rsquo;s the
    matter with you and Lizzie Porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> travellin&rsquo; with her, that&rsquo;s all; and
    we&rsquo;re going to get married in two years!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave gave vent to another long, low whistle. He seemed to think and make
    up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy: we&rsquo;re old mates, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you think I&rsquo;d tell you a blanky lie, or crawl behind
    your back? Do you? Spit it out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always stuck up for you, Andy, and&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ve
    fought for you behind your back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy took his friend&rsquo;s hand mechanically, but gripped it hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Andy, I&rsquo;ll tell you straight: It&rsquo;s Gorstruth about
    Lizzie Porter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They stood as they were for a full minute, hands clasped; Andy with his
    jaw dropped and staring in a dazed sort of way at Dave. He raised his disengaged
    hand helplessly to his thatch, gulped suspiciously, and asked in a broken
    voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you know it, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know it? Andy, <i>I seen &rsquo;em meself!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did, Dave?&rdquo; in a tone that suggested sorrow more than anger
    at Dave&rsquo;s part in the seeing of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gorstruth, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Dave, who was the feller? That&rsquo;s all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. I only seen them when I was canterin&rsquo; past
    in the dusk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then how&rsquo;d you know it was a man at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wore trousers, anyway, and was as big as you; so it couldn&rsquo;t
    have been a girl. I&rsquo;m pretty safe to swear it was Mick Kelly. I saw
    his horse hangin&rsquo; up at Porter&rsquo;s once or twice. But I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do: I&rsquo;ll find out for you, Andy. And, what&rsquo;s
    more, I&rsquo;ll job him for you if I catch him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy said nothing; his hands clenched and his chest heaved. Dave laid a
    friendly hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s red hot, Andy, I know. Anybody else but you and I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have cared. But don&rsquo;t be a fool; there&rsquo;s any Gorsquantity of
    girls knockin&rsquo;  round. You just give it to her straight and chuck her,
    and have done with it. You must be bad off to bother about her. Gorstruth!
    she ain&rsquo;t much to look at anyway! I&rsquo;ve got to ride like blazes
    to catch the coach. Don&rsquo;t knock off till I come back; I won&rsquo;t
    be above an hour. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you some points in case you&rsquo;ve
    got to fight Mick; and I&rsquo;ll have to be there to back you!&rdquo; And,
    thus taking the right moment instinctively, he jumped on his horse and galloped
    on towards the town.</p>
  <p>His dust-cloud had scarcely disappeared round a corner of the paddocks when
    Andy was aware of another one coming towards him. He had a dazed idea that
    it was Dave coming back, but went on digging another post-hole, mechanically,
    until a spring-cart rattled up, and stopped opposite him. Then he lifted
    his head. It was Lizzie herself, driving home from town. She turned towards
    him with her usual faint smile. Her small features were &ldquo;washed out&rdquo;  and
    rather haggard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But, at the sight of her, all his hatred of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;  &mdash;intensified,
    perhaps, by a sense of personal injury&mdash;came to a head, and he exploded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Lizzie Porter! I know all about you. You needn&rsquo;t
    think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to cotton on with me any more after this!
    I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen in a paddock with yer! I&rsquo;m satisfied about
    you! Get on out of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck; then she lammed into
    the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a whip.</p>
  <p>She cried, and wondered what she&rsquo;d done, and trembled so that she
    could scarcely unharness the horse, and wondered if Andy had got a touch
    of the sun, and went in and sat down and cried again; and pride came to her
    aid and she hated Andy; thought of her big brother, away droving, and made
    a cup of tea. She shed tears over the tea, and went through it all again.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Andy was suffering a reaction. He started to fill the hole before
    he put the post in; then to ram the post before the rails were in position.
    Dubbing off the ends of the rails, he was in danger of amputating a toe or
    a foot with every stroke of the adze. And, at last, trying to squint along
    the little lumps of clay which he had placed in the centre of the top of
    each post for several panels back&mdash;to assist him to take a line&mdash; he
    found that they swam and doubled, and ran off in watery angles, for his eyes
    were too moist to see straight and single.</p>
  <p>Then he threw down the tools hopelessly, and was standing helplessly undecided
    whether to go home or go down to the creek and drown himself, when Dave turned
    up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seen her?&rdquo; asked Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you chuck her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Dave; are you sure the feller was Mick Kelly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never said I was. How was I to know? It was dark. You don&rsquo;t
    expect I&rsquo;d &lsquo;fox&rsquo; a feller I see doing a bit of a bear-up
    to a girl, do you? It might have been you, for all I knowed. I suppose she&rsquo;s
    been talking you round?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But, look here, Dave;
    I was properly gone on that girl, I was, and&mdash;and I want to be sure
    I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The business was getting altogether too psychological for Dave Bentley. &ldquo;You
    might as well,&rdquo; he rapped out, &ldquo;call me a liar at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint that at all, Dave. I want to get at who the feller is;
    that&rsquo;s what I want to get at now. Where did you see them, and when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seen them Anniversary night, along the road, near Ross&rsquo; farm;
    and I seen &rsquo;em Sunday night afore that&mdash;in the trees near the
    old culvert&mdash; near Porter&rsquo;s sliprails; and I seen &rsquo;em one
    night outside Porter&rsquo;s, on a log near the woodheap. They was thick
    that time, and bearin&rsquo; up proper, and no mistake. So I can swear to
    her. Now, are you satisfied about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Andy was wildly pitchforking his thatch under his hat with all ten fingers
    and staring at Dave, who began to regard him uneasily; then there came to
    Andy&rsquo;s eyes an awful glare, which caused Dave to step back hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God, Andy! Are yer goin&rsquo; ratty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Andy, wildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what the blazes is the matter with you? You&rsquo;ll have rats
    if you don&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Jimminy froth</i>!&mdash;It was <i>me</i> all the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was me that was with her all them nights. It was me that you seen. <i>Why,
      I popped on the woodheap</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave was taken too suddenly to whistle this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you went for her just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled Andy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy, hopelessly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave whistled now&mdash;a very long, low whistle. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re
    a bloomin&rsquo; goat, Andy, after this. But this thing&rsquo;ll have to
    be fixed up!&rdquo; and he cantered away. Poor Andy was too badly knocked
    to notice the abruptness of Dave&rsquo;s departure, or to see that he turned
    through the sliprails on to the track that led to Porter&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Andy appeared at Porter&rsquo;s back door, with an expression
    on his face as though the funeral was to start in ten minutes. In a tone
    befitting such an occasion, he wanted to see Lizzie.</p>
  <p>Dave had been there with the laudable determination of fixing the business
    up, and had, of course, succeeded in making it much worse than it was before.
    But Andy made it all right.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheIronBarkChip"></a>The Iron-Bark Chip</b></h2>
  <p>Dave Regan and party&mdash;bush-fencers, tank-sinkers, rough carpenters,  &amp;c.&mdash; were
    finishing the third and last culvert of their contract on the last section
    of the new railway line, and had already sent in their vouchers for the completed
    contract, so that there might be no excuse for extra delay in connection
    with the cheque.</p>
  <p>Now it had been expressly stipulated in the plans and specifications that
    the timber for certain beams and girders was to be iron-bark and no other,
    and Government inspectors were authorised to order the removal from the ground
    of any timber or material they might deem inferior, or not in accordance
    with the stipulations. The railway contractor&rsquo;s foreman and inspector
    of sub-contractors was a practical man and a bushman, but he had been a timber-getter
    himself; his sympathies were bushy, and he was on winking terms with Dave
    Regan. Besides, extended time was expiring, and the contractors were in a
    hurry to complete the line. But the Government inspector was a reserved man
    who poked round on his independent own and appeared in lonely spots at unexpected
    times &mdash;with apparently no definite object in life&mdash;like a grey
    kangaroo bothered by a new wire fence, but unsuspicious of the presence of
    humans. He wore a grey suit, rode, or mostly led, an ashen-grey horse; the
    grass was long and grey, so he was seldom spotted until he was well within
    the horizon and bearing leisurely down on a party of sub-contractors, leading
    his horse.</p>
  <p>Now iron-bark was scarce and distant on those ridges, and another timber,
    similar in appearance, but much inferior in grain and &ldquo;standing&rdquo;  quality,
    was plentiful and close at hand. Dave and party were &ldquo;about full of&rdquo;  the
    job and place, and wanted to get their cheque and be gone to another &ldquo;spec&rdquo;  they
    had in view. So they came to reckon they&rsquo;d get the last girder from
    a handy tree, and have it squared, in place, and carefully and conscientiously
    tarred before the inspector happened along, if he did. But they didn&rsquo;t.
    They got it squared, and ready to be lifted into its place; the kindly darkness
    of tar was ready to cover a fraud that took four strong men with crowbars
    and levers to shift; and now (such is the regular cussedness of things) as
    the fraudulent piece of timber lay its last hour on the ground, looking and
    smelling, to their guilty imaginations like anything but iron-bark, they
    were aware of the Government inspector drifting down upon them obliquely,
    with something of the atmosphere of a casual Bill or Jim who had dropped
    out of his easy-going track to see how they were getting on, and borrow a
    match. They had more than half hoped that, as he had visited them pretty
    frequently during the progress of the work, and knew how near it was to completion,
    he wouldn&rsquo;t bother coming any more. But it&rsquo;s the way with the
    Government. You might move heaven and earth in vain endeavour to get the &ldquo;Guvermunt&rdquo; to
    flutter an eyelash over something of the most momentous importance to yourself
    and mates and the district&mdash; even to the country; but just when you
    are leaving authority severely alone, and have strong reasons for not wanting
    to worry or interrupt it, and not desiring it to worry about you, it will
    take a fancy into its head to come along and bother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way!&rdquo; muttered Dave to his mates. &ldquo;I
    knew the beggar would turn up! . . . And the only cronk log we&rsquo;ve had,
    too!&rdquo; he added, in an injured tone. &ldquo;If this had &rsquo;a&rsquo; been
    the only blessed iron-bark in the whole contract, it would have been all
    right. . . . Good-day, sir!&rdquo; (to the inspector). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    hot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The inspector nodded. He was not of an impulsive nature. He got down from
    his horse and looked at the girder in an abstracted way; and presently there
    came into his eyes a dreamy, far-away, sad sort of expression, as if there
    had been a very sad and painful occurrence in his family, way back in the
    past, and that piece of timber in some way reminded him of it and brought
    the old sorrow home to him. He blinked three times, and asked, in a subdued
    tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that iron-bark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Bentley, the fluent liar of the party, caught his breath with a jerk
    and coughed, to cover the gasp and gain time. &ldquo;I&mdash;iron-bark? Of
    course it is! I thought you would know iron-bark, mister.&rdquo; (Mister
    was silent.) &ldquo;What else d&rsquo;yer think it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dreamy, abstracted expression was back. The inspector, by-the-way, didn&rsquo;t
    know much about timber, but he had a great deal of instinct, and went by
    it when in doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;L&mdash;look here, mister!&rdquo; put in Dave Regan, in a tone of
    innocent puzzlement and with a blank bucolic face. &ldquo;B&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
    the plans and specifications say iron-bark? Ours does, anyway. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    git the papers from the tent and show yer, if yer like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not necessary. The inspector admitted the fact slowly. He stooped,
    and with an absent air picked up a chip. He looked at it abstractedly for
    a moment, blinked his threefold blink; then, seeming to recollect an appointment,
    he woke up suddenly and asked briskly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did this chip come off that girder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blank silence. The inspector blinked six times, divided in threes, rapidly,
    mounted his horse, said &ldquo;Day,&rdquo; and rode off.</p>
  <p>Regan and party stared at each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did he do that for?&rdquo; asked Andy Page, the third
    in the party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do what for, you fool?&rdquo; enquired Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ta&mdash;take that chip for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it to the office!&rdquo; snarled Jack Bentley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what for? What does he want to do that for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To get it blanky well analysed! You ass! Now are yer satisfied?&rdquo;  And
    Jack sat down hard on the timber, jerked out his pipe, and said to Dave,
    in a sharp, toothache tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gimmiamatch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&mdash;well! what are we to do now?&rdquo; enquired Andy, who was
    the hardest grafter, but altogether helpless, hopeless, and useless in a
    crisis like this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grain and varnish the bloomin&rsquo; culvert!&rdquo; snapped Bentley.</p>
  <p>But Dave&rsquo;s eyes, that had been ruefully following the inspector, suddenly
    dilated. The inspector had ridden a short distance along the line, dismounted,
    thrown the bridle over a post, laid the chip (which was too big to go in
    his pocket) on top of it, got through the fence, and was now walking back
    at an angle across the line in the direction of the fencing party, who had
    worked up on the other side, a little more than opposite the culvert.</p>
  <p>Dave took in the lay of the country at a glance and thought rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gimme an iron-bark chip!&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
  <p>Bentley, who was quick-witted when the track was shown him, as is a kangaroo
    dog (Jack ran by sight, not scent), glanced in the line of Dave&rsquo;s eyes,
    jumped up, and got a chip about the same size as that which the inspector
    had taken.</p>
  <p>Now the &ldquo;lay of the country&rdquo; sloped generally to the line from
    both sides, and the angle between the inspector&rsquo;s horse, the fencing
    party, and the culvert was well within a clear concave space; but a couple
    of hundred yards back from the line and parallel to it (on the side on which
    Dave&rsquo;s party worked their timber) a fringe of scrub ran to within a
    few yards of a point which would be about in line with a single tree on the
    cleared slope, the horse, and the fencing party.</p>
  <p>Dave took the iron-bark chip, ran along the bed of the water-course into
    the scrub, raced up the siding behind the bushes, got safely, though without
    breathing, across the exposed space, and brought the tree into line between
    him and the inspector, who was talking to the fencers. Then he began to work
    quickly down the slope towards the tree (which was a thin one), keeping it
    in line, his arms close to his sides, and working, as it were, down the trunk
    of the tree, as if the fencing party were kangaroos and Dave was trying to
    get a shot at them. The inspector, by-the-bye, had a habit of glancing now
    and then in the direction of his horse, as though under the impression that
    it was flighty and restless and inclined to bolt on opportunity. It was an
    anxious moment for all parties concerned&mdash;except the inspector. They
    didn&rsquo;t want&nbsp;<i>him</i>&nbsp;to be perturbed. And, just as Dave
    reached the foot of the tree, the inspector finished what he had to say to
    the fencers, turned, and started to walk briskly back to his horse. There
    was a thunderstorm coming. Now was the critical moment&mdash; there were
    certain prearranged signals between Dave&rsquo;s party and the fencers which
    might have interested the inspector, but none to meet a case like this.</p>
  <p>Jack Bentley gasped, and started forward with an idea of intercepting the
    inspector and holding him for a few minutes in bogus conversation. Inspirations
    come to one at a critical moment, and it flashed on Jack&rsquo;s mind to
    send Andy instead. Andy looked as innocent and guileless as he was, but was
    uncomfortable in the vicinity of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, and must have
    an honest excuse. &ldquo;Not that that mattered,&rdquo; commented Jack afterwards; &ldquo;it
    would have taken the inspector ten minutes to get at what Andy was driving
    at, whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run, Andy! Tell him there&rsquo;s a heavy thunderstorm coming and
    he&rsquo;d better stay in our humpy till it&rsquo;s over. Run! Don&rsquo;t
    stand staring like a blanky fool. He&rsquo;ll be gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy started. But just then, as luck would have it, one of the fencers started
    after the inspector, hailing him as &ldquo;Hi, mister!&rdquo; He wanted to
    be set right about the survey or something &mdash;or to pretend to want to
    be set right&mdash;from motives of policy which I haven&rsquo;t time to explain
    here.</p>
  <p>That fencer explained afterwards to Dave&rsquo;s party that he &ldquo;seen
    what you coves was up to,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why he called the inspector
    back. But he told them that after they had told their yarn&mdash;which was
    a mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back, Andy!&rdquo; cried Jack Bentley.</p>
  <p>Dave Regan slipped round the tree, down on his hands and knees, and made
    quick time through the grass which, luckily, grew pretty tall on the thirty
    or forty yards of slope between the tree and the horse. Close to the horse,
    a thought struck Dave that pulled him up, and sent a shiver along his spine
    and a hungry feeling under it. The horse would break away and bolt! But the
    case was desperate. Dave ventured an interrogatory &ldquo;Cope, cope, cope?&rdquo; The
    horse turned its head wearily and regarded him with a mild eye, as if he&rsquo;d
    expected him to come, and come on all fours, and wondered what had kept him
    so long; then he went on thinking. Dave reached the foot of the post; the
    horse obligingly leaning over on the other leg. Dave reared head and shoulders
    cautiously behind the post, like a snake; his hand went up twice, swiftly&mdash;the
    first time he grabbed the inspector&rsquo;s chip, and the second time he
    put the iron-bark one in its place. He drew down and back, and scuttled off
    for the tree like a gigantic tailless &ldquo;goanna&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>A few minutes later he walked up to the culvert from along the creek, smoking
    hard to settle his nerves.</p>
  <p>The sky seemed to darken suddenly; the first great drops of the thunderstorm
    came pelting down. The inspector hurried to his horse, and cantered off along
    the line in the direction of the fettlers&rsquo; camp.</p>
  <p>He had forgotten all about the chip, and left it on top of the post!</p>
  <p>Dave Regan sat down on the beam in the rain and swore comprehensively.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MiddletonsPeter"></a>&ldquo;Middleton&rsquo;s Peter&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
The First Born</b></h3>
  <p>The struggling&nbsp;squatter is to be found in Australia as well as the &ldquo;struggling
    farmer&rdquo;. The Australian squatter is not always the mighty wool king
    that English and American authors and other uninformed people apparently
    imagine him to be. Squatting, at the best, is but a game of chance. It depends
    mainly on the weather, and that, in New South Wales at least, depends on
    nothing.</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton was a struggling squatter, with a station some distance to
    the westward of the furthest line reached by the ordinary &ldquo;new chum&rdquo;.
    His run, at the time of our story, was only about six miles square, and his
    stock was limited in proportion. The hands on Joe&rsquo;s run consisted of
    his brother Dave, a middle-aged man known only as &ldquo;Middleton&rsquo;s
    Peter&rdquo; (who had been in the service of the Middleton family ever since
    Joe Middleton could remember), and an old black shepherd, with his gin and
    two boys.</p>
  <p>It was in the first year of Joe&rsquo;s marriage. He had married a very
    ordinary girl, as far as Australian girls go, but in his eyes she was an
    angel. He really worshipped her.</p>
  <p>One sultry afternoon in midsummer all the station hands, with the exception
    of Dave Middleton, were congregated about the homestead door, and it was
    evident from their solemn faces that something unusual was the matter. They
    appeared to be watching for something or someone across the flat, and the
    old black shepherd, who had been listening intently with bent head, suddenly
    straightened himself up and cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear the cart. I can see it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You must bear in mind that our blackfellows do not always talk the gibberish
    with which they are credited by story writers.</p>
  <p>It was not until some time after Black Bill had spoken that the white &mdash; or,
    rather, the brown &mdash; portion of the party could see or even hear the
    approaching vehicle. At last, far out through the trunks of the native apple-trees,
    the cart was seen approaching; and as it came nearer it was evident that
    it was being driven at a break-neck pace, the horses cantering all the way,
    while the motion of the cart, as first one wheel and then the other sprang
    from a root or a rut, bore a striking resemblance to the Highland Fling.
    There were two persons in the cart. One was Mother Palmer, a stout, middle-aged
    party (who sometimes did the duties of a midwife), and the other was Dave
    Middleton, Joe&rsquo;s brother.</p>
  <p>The cart was driven right up to the door with scarcely any abatement of
    speed, and was stopped so suddenly that Mrs. Palmer was sent sprawling on
    to the horse&rsquo;s rump. She was quickly helped down, and, as soon as she
    had recovered sufficient breath, she followed Black Mary into the bedroom
    where young Mrs. Middleton was lying, looking very pale and frightened. The
    horse which had been driven so cruelly had not done blowing before another
    cart appeared, also driven very fast. It contained old Mr. and Mrs. Middleton,
    who lived comfortably on a small farm not far from Palmer&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had dumped Mrs. Palmer, Dave Middleton left the cart and,
    mounting a fresh horse which stood ready saddled in the yard, galloped off
    through the scrub in a different direction.</p>
  <p>Half an hour afterwards Joe Middleton came home on a horse that had been
    almost ridden to death. His mother came out at the sound of his arrival,
    and he anxiously asked her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you find Doc. Wild?&rdquo; asked the mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, confound him!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe bitterly. &ldquo;He promised
    me faithfully to come over on Wednesday and stay until Maggie was right again.
    Now he has left Dean&rsquo;s and gone &mdash; Lord knows where. I suppose
    he is drinking again. How is Maggie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now &mdash; the child is born. It&rsquo;s a boy;
    but she is very weak. Dave got Mrs. Palmer here just in time. I had better
    tell you at once that Mrs. Palmer says if we don&rsquo;t get a doctor here
    to-night poor Maggie won&rsquo;t live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! and what am I to do?&rdquo; cried Joe desperately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there any other doctor within reach?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; there is only the one at B&mdash;&mdash;; that&rsquo;s forty
    miles away, and he is laid up with the broken leg he got in the buggy accident.
    Where&rsquo;s Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone to Black&rsquo;s shanty. One of Mrs. Palmer&rsquo;s sons thought
    he remembered someone saying that Doc. Wild was there last week. That&rsquo;s
    fifteen miles away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it is our only hope,&rdquo; said Joe dejectedly. &ldquo;I wish
    to God that I had taken Maggie to some civilised place a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild was a well-known character among the bushmen of New South Wales,
    and although the profession did not recognise him, and denounced him as an
    empiric, his skill was undoubted. Bushmen had great faith in him, and would
    often ride incredible distances in order to bring him to the bedside of a
    sick friend. He drank fearfully, but was seldom incapable of treating a patient;
    he would, however, sometimes be found in an obstinate mood and refuse to
    travel to the side of a sick person, and then the devil himself could not
    make the doctor budge. But for all this he was very generous &mdash; a fact
    that could, no doubt, be testified to by many a grateful sojourner in the
    lonely bush.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
The Only Hope</b></h3>
  <p>Night came on, and still there was no change in the condition of the young
    wife, and no sign of the doctor. Several stockmen from the neighbouring stations,
    hearing that there was trouble at Joe Middleton&rsquo;s, had ridden over,
    and had galloped off on long, hopeless rides in search of a doctor. Being
    generally free from sickness themselves, these bushmen look upon it as a
    serious business even in its mildest form; what is more, their sympathy is
    always practical where it is possible for it to be so. One day, while out
    on the run after an &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo;, Joe Middleton was badly thrown
    from his horse, and the break-neck riding that was done on that occasion
    from the time the horse came home with empty saddle until the rider was safe
    in bed and attended by a doctor was something extraordinary, even for the
    bush.</p>
  <p>Before the time arrived when Dave Middleton might reasonably have been expected
    to return, the station people were anxiously watching for him, all except
    the old blackfellow and the two boys, who had gone to yard the sheep.</p>
  <p>The party had been increased by Jimmy Nowlett, the bullocky, who had just
    arrived with a load of fencing wire and provisions for Middleton. Jimmy was
    standing in the moonlight, whip in hand, looking as anxious as the husband
    himself, and endeavouring to calculate by mental arithmetic the exact time
    it ought to take Dave to complete his double journey, taking into consideration
    the distance, the obstacles in the way, and the chances of horse-flesh.</p>
  <p>But the time which Jimmy fixed for the arrival came without Dave.</p>
  <p>Old Peter (as he was generally called, though he was not really old) stood
    aside in his usual sullen manner, his hat drawn down over his brow and eyes,
    and nothing visible but a thick and very horizontal black beard, from the
    depth of which emerged large clouds of very strong tobacco smoke, the product
    of a short, black, clay pipe.</p>
  <p>They had almost given up all hope of seeing Dave return that night, when
    Peter slowly and deliberately removed his pipe and grunted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He then replaced the pipe, and smoked on as before.</p>
  <p>All listened, but not one of them could hear a sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer ears must be pretty sharp for yer age, Peter. We can&rsquo;t
    hear him,&rdquo; remarked Jimmy Nowlett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His dog ken,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>The pipe was again removed and its abbreviated stem pointed in the direction
    of Dave&rsquo;s cattle dog, who had risen beside his kennel with pointed
    ears, and was looking eagerly in the direction from which his master was
    expected to come.</p>
  <p>Presently the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs was distinctly heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear two horses,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett excitedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; said old Peter quietly.</p>
  <p>A few moments passed, and a single horseman appeared on the far side of
    the flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Doc. Wild on Dave&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett. &ldquo;Dave
    don&rsquo;t ride like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dave,&rdquo; said Peter, replacing his pipe and looking
    more unsociable than ever.</p>
  <p>Dave rode up and, throwing himself wearily from the saddle, stood ominously
    silent by the side of his horse.</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton said nothing, but stood aside with an expression of utter
    hopelessness on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo; asked Jimmy Nowlett at last, addressing Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; answered Dave, impatiently.</p>
  <p>This was not the answer they expected, but nobody seemed surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here old Peter removed his pipe, and pronounced the one word &mdash;  &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you mean by that?&rdquo; muttered Dave, whose patience
    had evidently been severely tried by the clever but intemperate bush doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How drunk?&rdquo; explained Peter, with great equanimity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stubborn drunk, blind drunk, beastly drunk, dead drunk, and damned
    well drunk, if that&rsquo;s what you want to know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did Doc. say?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Said he was sick &mdash; had lumbago &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t come
    for the Queen of England; said he wanted a course of treatment himself. Curse
    him! I have no patience to talk about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him a course of treatment,&rdquo; muttered Jimmy viciously,
    trailing the long lash of his bullock-whip through the grass and spitting
    spitefully at the ground.</p>
  <p>Dave turned away and joined Joe, who was talking earnestly to his mother
    by the kitchen door. He told them that he had spent an hour trying to persuade
    Doc. Wild to come, and, that before he had left the shanty, Black had promised
    him faithfully to bring the doctor over as soon as his obstinate mood wore
    off.</p>
  <p>Just then a low moan was heard from the sick room, followed by the sound
    of Mother Palmer&rsquo;s voice calling old Mrs. Middleton, who went inside
    immediately.</p>
  <p>No one had noticed the disappearance of Peter, and when he presently returned
    from the stockyard, leading the only fresh horse that remained, Jimmy Nowlett
    began to regard him with some interest. Peter transferred the saddle from
    Dave&rsquo;s horse to the other, and then went into a small room off the
    kitchen, which served him as a bedroom; from it he soon returned with a formidable-looking
    revolver, the chambers of which he examined in the moonlight in full view
    of all the company. They thought for a moment the man had gone mad. Old Middleton
    leaped quickly behind Nowlett, and Black Mary, who had come out to the cask
    at the corner for a dipper of water, dropped the dipper and was inside like
    a shot. One of the black boys came softly up at that moment; as soon as his
    sharp eye &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; the weapon, he disappeared as though the
    earth had swallowed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the mischief are yer goin&rsquo; ter do, Peter?&rdquo; asked
    Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to fetch him,&rdquo; said Peter, and, after carefully
    emptying his pipe and replacing it in a leather pouch at his belt, he mounted
    and rode off at an easy canter.</p>
  <p>Jimmy watched the horse until it disappeared at the edge of the flat, and
    then after coiling up the long lash of his bullock-whip in the dust until
    it looked like a sleeping snake, he prodded the small end of the long pine
    handle into the middle of the coil, as though driving home a point, and said
    in a tone of intense conviction:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>III<br>
Doc. Wild</b></h3>
  <p>Peter gradually increased his horse&rsquo;s speed along the rough bush track
    until he was riding at a good pace. It was ten miles to the main road, and
    five from there to the shanty kept by Black.</p>
  <p>For some time before Peter started the atmosphere had been very close and
    oppressive. The great black edge of a storm-cloud had risen in the east,
    and everything indicated the approach of a thunderstorm. It was not long
    coming. Before Peter had completed six miles of his journey, the clouds rolled
    over, obscuring the moon, and an Australian thunderstorm came on with its
    mighty downpour, its blinding lightning, and its earth-shaking thunder. Peter
    rode steadily on, only pausing now and then until a flash revealed the track
    in front of him.</p>
  <p>Black&rsquo;s shanty &mdash; or, rather, as the sign had it, &ldquo;Post
    Office and General Store&rdquo; &mdash; was, as we have said, five miles
    along the main road from the point where Middleton&rsquo;s track joined it.
    The building was of the usual style of bush architecture. About two hundred
    yards nearer the creek, which crossed the road further on, stood a large
    bark and slab stable, large enough to have met the requirements of a legitimate
    bush &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The reader may doubt that a &ldquo;sly grog shop&rdquo; could openly carry
    on business on a main Government road along which mounted troopers were continually
    passing. But then, you see, mounted troopers get thirsty like other men;
    moreover, they could always get their thirst quenched &lsquo;gratis&rsquo; at
    these places; so the reader will be prepared to hear that on this very night
    two troopers&rsquo;  horses were stowed snugly away in the stable, and two
    troopers were stowed snugly away in the back room of the shanty, sleeping
    off the effects of their cheap but strong potations.</p>
  <p>There were two rooms, of a sort, attached to the stables &mdash; one at
    each end. One was occupied by a man who was &ldquo;generally useful&rdquo;,
    and the other was the surgery, office, and bedroom&nbsp;<i>pro tem.</i>&nbsp;of
    Doc. Wild.</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild was a tall man, of spare proportions. He had a cadaverous face,
    black hair, bushy black eyebrows, eagle nose, and eagle eyes. He never slept
    while he was drinking. On this occasion he sat in front of the fire on a
    low three-legged stool. His knees were drawn up, his toes hooked round the
    front legs of the stool, one hand resting on one knee, and one elbow (the
    hand supporting the chin) resting on the other. He was staring intently into
    the fire, on which an old black saucepan was boiling and sending forth a
    pungent odour of herbs. There seemed something uncanny about the doctor as
    the red light of the fire fell on his hawk-like face and gleaming eyes. He
    might have been Mephistopheles watching some infernal brew.</p>
  <p>He had sat there some time without stirring a finger, when the door suddenly
    burst open and Middleton&rsquo;s Peter stood within, dripping wet. The doctor
    turned his black, piercing eyes upon the intruder (who regarded him silently)
    for a moment, and then asked quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what do you want me for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you to come to Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife. She&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said
    Peter calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; shouted the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    brought enough horse-stealers into the world already. If any more want to
    come they can go to blazes for me. Now, you get out of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yer rag out,&rdquo; said Peter quietly. &ldquo;The
    hoss-stealer&rsquo;s come, an&rsquo; nearly killed his mother ter begin with;
    an&rsquo; if yer don&rsquo;t get yer physic-box an&rsquo; come wi&rsquo; me,
    by the great God I&rsquo;ll &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the revolver was produced and pointed at Doc. Wild&rsquo;s head. The
    sight of the weapon had a sobering effect upon the doctor. He rose, looked
    at Peter critically for a moment, knocked the weapon out of his hand, and
    said slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wall, ef the case es as serious as that, I (hic) reckon I&rsquo;d
    better come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter was still of the same opinion, so Doc. Wild proceeded to get his medicine
    chest ready. He explained afterwards, in one of his softer moments, that
    the shooter didn&rsquo;t frighten him so much as it touched his memory  &mdash; &ldquo;sorter
    put him in mind of the old days in California, and made him think of the
    man he might have been,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &mdash; &ldquo;kinder touched
    his heart and slid the durned old panorama in front of him like a flash;
    made him think of the time when he slipped three leaden pills into &lsquo;Blue
    Shirt&rsquo; for winking at a new chum behind his (the Doc.&rsquo;s) back
    when he was telling a truthful yarn, and charged the said &lsquo;Blue Shirt&rsquo; a
    hundred dollars for extracting the said pills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife is a grandmother now.</p>
  <p>Peter passed after the manner of his sort; he was found dead in his bunk.</p>
  <p>Poor Doc. Wild died in a shepherd&rsquo;s hut at the Dry Creeks. The shepherds
    (white men) found him, &ldquo;naked as he was born and with the hide half
    burned off him with the sun,&rdquo; rounding up imaginary snakes on a dusty
    clearing, one blazing hot day. The hut-keeper had some &ldquo;quare&rdquo; (queer)
    experiences with the doctor during the next three days and used, in after
    years, to tell of them, between the puffs of his pipe, calmly and solemnly
    and as if the story was rather to the doctor&rsquo;s credit than otherwise.
    The shepherds sent for the police and a doctor, and sent word to Joe Middleton.
    Doc. Wild was sensible towards the end. His interview with the other doctor
    was characteristic. &ldquo;And, now you see how far I am,&rdquo; he said
    in conclusion &mdash; &ldquo;have you brought the brandy?&rdquo; The other
    doctor had. Joe Middleton came with his waggonette, and in it the softest
    mattress and pillows the station afforded. He also, in his innocence, brought
    a dozen of soda-water. Doc. Wild took Joe&rsquo;s hand feebly, and, a little
    later, he &ldquo;passed out&rdquo; (as he would have said) murmuring &ldquo;something
    that sounded like poetry&rdquo;, in an unknown tongue. Joe took the body
    to the home station. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the boss bringin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked
    the shearers, seeing the waggonette coming very slowly and the boss walking
    by the horses&rsquo; heads. &ldquo;Doc. Wild,&rdquo; said a station hand. &ldquo;Take
    yer hats off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They buried him with bush honours, and chiselled his name on a slab of bluegum &mdash; a
    wood that lasts.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryofDaveRegan"></a>The Mystery of Dave Regan</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;then there was Dave Regan,&rdquo; said the traveller. &ldquo;Dave
    used to die oftener than any other bushman I knew. He was always being reported
    dead and turnin&rsquo; up again. He seemed to like it &mdash; except once,
    when his brother drew his money and drank it all to drown his grief at what
    he called Dave&rsquo;s  &lsquo;untimely end&rsquo;. Well, Dave went up to
    Queensland once with cattle, and was away three years and reported dead,
    as usual. He was drowned in the Bogan this time while tryin&rsquo; to swim
    his horse acrost a flood &mdash; and his sweetheart hurried up and got spliced
    to a worse man before Dave got back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was out in the bush lookin&rsquo; for timber, when
    the biggest storm ever knowed in that place come on. There was hail in it,
    too, as big as bullets, and if I hadn&rsquo;t got behind a stump and crouched
    down in time I&rsquo;d have been riddled like a &mdash; like a bushranger.
    As it was, I got soakin&rsquo; wet. The storm was over in a few minutes,
    the water run off down the gullies, and the sun come out and the scrub steamed &mdash; and
    stunk like a new pair of moleskin trousers. I went on along the track, and
    presently I seen a long, lanky chap get on to a long, lanky horse and ride
    out of a bush yard at the edge of a clearin&rsquo;. I knowed it was Dave
    d&rsquo;reckly I set eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave used to ride a tall, holler-backed thoroughbred with a body
    and limbs like a kangaroo dog, and it would circle around you and sidle away
    as if it was frightened you was goin&rsquo; to jab a knife into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello! Dave!&rsquo; said I, as he came spurrin&rsquo; up. &lsquo;How
    are yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer gettin&rsquo; on?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, before we could say any more, that horse shied away and broke
    off through the scrub to the right. I waited, because I knowed Dave would
    come back again if I waited long enough; and in about ten minutes he came
    sidlin&rsquo; in from the scrub to the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; says he, spurrin&rsquo; up
    sideways; &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the old people?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t been home yet,&rsquo; says he, holdin&rsquo; out
    his hand; but, afore I could grip it, the cussed horse sidled off to the
    south end of the clearin&rsquo; and broke away again through the scrub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard Dave swearin&rsquo; about the country for twenty minutes
    or so, and then he came spurrin&rsquo; and cursin&rsquo; in from the other
    end of the clearin&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been all this time?&rsquo; I said, as the horse
    came curvin&rsquo; up like a boomerang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gulf country,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was a storm, Dave,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My oath!&rsquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get caught in it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got to shelter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re as dry&rsquo;s a bone, Dave!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned. &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he
    yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said that to the horse as it boomeranged off again and broke away
    through the scrub. I waited; but he didn&rsquo;t come back, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d got so far away before he could pull up that he didn&rsquo;t think
    it worth while comin&rsquo; back; so I went on. By-and-bye I got thinkin&rsquo;.
    Dave was as dry as a bone, and I knowed that he hadn&rsquo;t had time to
    get to shelter, for there wasn&rsquo;t a shed within twelve miles. He wasn&rsquo;t
    only dry, but his coat was creased and dusty too &mdash; same as if he&rsquo;d
    been sleepin&rsquo; in a holler log; and when I come to think of it, his
    face seemed thinner and whiter than it used ter, and so did his hands and
    wrists, which always stuck a long way out of his coat-sleeves; and there
    was blood on his face &mdash; but I thought he&rsquo;d got scratched with
    a twig. (Dave used to wear a coat three or four sizes too small for him,
    with sleeves that didn&rsquo;t come much below his elbows and a tail that
    scarcely reached his waist behind.) And his hair seemed dark and lank, instead
    of bein&rsquo; sandy and stickin&rsquo; out like an old fibre brush, as it
    used ter. And then I thought his voice sounded different, too. And, when
    I enquired next day, there was no one heard of Dave, and the chaps reckoned
    I must have been drunk, or seen his ghost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem all right at all &mdash; it worried me a lot.
    I couldn&rsquo;t make out how Dave kept dry; and the horse and saddle and
    saddle-cloth was wet. I told the chaps how he talked to me and what he said,
    and how he swore at the horse; but they only said it was Dave&rsquo;s ghost
    and nobody else&rsquo;s. I told &rsquo;em about him bein&rsquo; dry as a
    bone after gettin&rsquo; caught in that storm; but they only laughed and
    said it was a dry place where Dave went to. I talked and argued about it
    until the chaps began to tap their foreheads and wink &mdash; then I left
    off talking. But I didn&rsquo;t leave off thinkin&rsquo; &mdash; I always
    hated a mystery. Even Dave&rsquo;s father told me that Dave couldn&rsquo;t
    be alive or else his ghost wouldn&rsquo;t be round &mdash; he said he knew
    Dave better than that. One or two fellers did turn up afterwards that had
    seen Dave about the time that I did &mdash; and then the chaps said they
    was sure that Dave was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But one fine day, as a lot of us chaps was playin&rsquo; pitch and
    toss at the shanty, one of the fellers yelled out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Gee! Here comes Dave Regan!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I looked up and saw Dave himself, sidlin&rsquo; out of a cloud
    of dust on a long lanky horse. He rode into the stockyard, got down, hung
    his horse up to a post, put up the rails, and then come slopin&rsquo; towards
    us with a half-acre grin on his face. Dave had long, thin bow-legs, and when
    he was on the ground he moved as if he was on roller skates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;El-lo, Dave!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;How the blazes are
    you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I, shakin&rsquo; hands. &lsquo;How
    are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right!&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;How are yer
    poppin&rsquo; up!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, when we&rsquo;d got all that settled, and the other chaps had
    asked how he was, he said: &lsquo;Ah, well! Let&rsquo;s have a drink.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all the other chaps crawfished up and flung themselves round
    the corner and sidled into the bar after Dave. We had a lot of talk, and
    he told us that he&rsquo;d been down before, but had gone away without seein&rsquo; any
    of us, except me, because he&rsquo;d suddenly heard of a mob of cattle at
    a station two hundred miles away; and after a while I took him aside and
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Dave! Do you remember the day I met you after the
    storm?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He scratched his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you get under shelter that day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why &mdash; no.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then how the blazes didn&rsquo;t yer get wet?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned; then he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, when I seen the storm coming I took off me clothes and
    stuck &rsquo;em in a holler log till the rain was over.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says, after the other coves had done laughin&rsquo;,
    but before I&rsquo;d done thinking; &lsquo;I kept my clothes dry and got
    a good refreshin&rsquo;  shower-bath into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he scratched the back of his neck with his little finger, and
    dropped his jaw, and thought a bit; then he rubbed the top of his head and
    his shoulder, reflective-like, and then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t reckon for them there blanky hailstones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonMatrimony"></a>Mitchell on Matrimony</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;suppose your wife will be glad to see you,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to his mate in their camp by the dam at Hungerford. They were overhauling
    their swags, and throwing away the blankets, and calico, and old clothes,
    and rubbish they didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;everything, in fact, except their
    pocket-books and letters and portraits, things which men carry about with
    them always, that are found on them when they die, and sent to their relations
    if possible. Otherwise they are taken in charge by the constable who officiates
    at the inquest, and forwarded to the Minister of Justice along with the depositions.</p>
  <p>It was the end of the shearing season. Mitchell and his mate had been lucky
    enough to get two good sheds in succession, and were going to take the coach
    from Hungerford to Bourke on their way to Sydney. The morning stars were
    bright yet, and they sat down to a final billy of tea, two dusty Johnny-cakes,
    and a scrag of salt mutton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be
    glad to see her too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you will,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He placed his pint-pot
    between his feet, rested his arm against his knee, and stirred the tea meditatively
    with the handle of his pocket-knife. It was vaguely understood that Mitchell
    had been married at one period of his chequered career.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever understood women properly,&rdquo; he
    said, as he took a cautious sip to see if his tea was cool and sweet enough,
    for his lips were sore; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever will&mdash;we
    never took the trouble to try, and if we did it would be only wasted brain
    power that might just as well be spent on the blackfellow&rsquo;s lingo;
    because by the time you&rsquo;ve learnt it they&rsquo;ll be extinct, and
    woman &lsquo;ll be extinct before you&rsquo;ve learnt her. . . . The morning
    star looks bright, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Mitchell after a while,  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    many little things we might try to understand women in. I read in a piece
    of newspaper the other day about how a man changes after he&rsquo;s married;
    how he gets short, and impatient, and bored (which is only natural), and
    sticks up a wall of newspaper between himself and his wife when he&rsquo;s
    at home; and how it comes like a cold shock to her, and all her air-castles
    vanish, and in the end she often thinks about taking the baby and the clothes
    she stands in, and going home for sympathy and comfort to mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she never got a word of sympathy from her mother in her life,
    nor a day&rsquo;s comfort at home before she was married; but that doesn&rsquo;t
    make the slightest difference. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference in your
    case either, if you haven&rsquo;t been acting like a dutiful son-in-law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somebody wrote that a woman&rsquo;s love is her whole existence,
    while a man&rsquo;s love is only part of his&mdash;which is true, and only
    natural and reasonable, all things considered. But women never consider as
    a rule. A man can&rsquo;t go on talking lovey-dovey talk for ever, and listening
    to his young wife&rsquo;s prattle when he&rsquo;s got to think about making
    a living, and nursing her and answering her childish questions and telling
    her he loves his little ownest every minute in the day, while the bills are
    running up, and rent mornings begin to fly round and hustle and crowd him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got her and he&rsquo;s satisfied; and if the truth is
    known he loves her really more than he did when they were engaged, only she
    won&rsquo;t be satisfied about it unless he tells her so every hour in the
    day. At least that&rsquo;s how it is for the first few months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a woman doesn&rsquo;t understand these things&mdash;she never
    will, she can&rsquo;t&mdash; and it would be just as well for us to try and
    understand that she doesn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t understand them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell knocked the tea-leaves out of his pannikin against his boot, and
    reached for the billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many little things we might do that seem mere trifles
    and nonsense to us, but mean a lot to her; that wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble
    or sacrifice to us, but might help to make her life happy. It&rsquo;s just
    because we never think about these little things&mdash;don&rsquo;t think
    them worth thinking about, in fact&mdash; they never enter our intellectual
    foreheads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For instance, when you&rsquo;re going out in the morning you might
    put your arms round her and give her a hug and a kiss, without her having
    to remind you. You may forget about it and never think any more of it&mdash; but
    she will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble to you, and would only take a couple
    of seconds, and would give her something to be happy about when you&rsquo;re
    gone, and make her sing to herself for hours while she bustles about her
    work and thinks up what she&rsquo;ll get you for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate sighed, and shifted the sugar-bag over towards Mitchell.
    He seemed touched and bothered over something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;it mightn&rsquo;t be convenient
    for you to go home to dinner&mdash;something might turn up during the morning&mdash; you
    might have some important business to do, or meet some chaps and get invited
    to lunch and not be very well able to refuse, when it&rsquo;s too late, or
    you haven&rsquo;t a chance to send a message to your wife. But then again,
    chaps and business seem very big things to you, and only little things to
    the wife; just as lovey-dovey talk is important to her and nonsense to you.
    And when you come to analyse it, one is not so big, nor the other so small,
    after all; especially when you come to think that chaps can always wait,
    and business is only an inspiration in your mind, nine cases out of ten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think of the trouble she takes to get you a good dinner, and how
    she keeps it hot between two plates in the oven, and waits hour after hour
    till the dinner gets dried up, and all her morning&rsquo;s work is wasted.
    Think how it hurts her, and how anxious she&rsquo;ll be (especially if you&rsquo;re
    inclined to booze) for fear that something has happened to you. You can&rsquo;t
    get it out of the heads of some young wives that you&rsquo;re liable to get
    run over, or knocked down, or assaulted, or robbed, or get into one of the
    fixes that a woman is likely to get into. But about the dinner waiting. Try
    and put yourself in her place. Wouldn&rsquo;t you get mad under the same
    circumstances? I know I would.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember once, only just after I was married, I was invited unexpectedly
    to a kidney pudding and beans&mdash;which was my favourite grub at the time&mdash; and
    I didn&rsquo;t resist, especially as it was washing day and I told the wife
    not to bother about anything for dinner. I got home an hour or so late, and
    had a good explanation thought out, when the wife met me with a smile as
    if we had just been left a thousand pounds. She&rsquo;d got her washing finished
    without assistance, though I&rsquo;d told her to get somebody to help her,
    and she had a kidney pudding and beans, with a lot of extras thrown in, as
    a pleasant surprise for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I kissed her, and sat down, and stuffed till I thought every
    mouthful would choke me. I got through with it somehow, but I&rsquo;ve never
    cared for kidney pudding or beans since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell felt for his pipe with a fatherly smile in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then again,&rdquo; he continued, as he cut up his tobacco, &ldquo;your
    wife might put on a new dress and fix herself up and look well, and you might
    think so and be satisfied with her appearance and be proud to take her out;
    but you want to tell her so, and tell her so as often as you think about
    it&mdash;and try to think a little oftener than men usually do, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have made a good husband, Jack,&rdquo; said his mate,
    in a softened tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, perhaps I should,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing up his
    tobacco; then he asked abstractedly: &ldquo;What sort of a husband did you
    make, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might have made a better one than I did,&rdquo; said Joe seriously,
    and rather bitterly, &ldquo;but I know one thing, I&rsquo;m going to try
    and make up for it when I go back this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all say that,&rdquo; said Mitchell reflectively, filling his pipe. &ldquo;She
    loves you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know she does,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>Mitchell lit up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so would any man who knew her or had seen her letters to you,&rdquo; he
    said between the puffs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s happy and contented enough, I
    believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;at least while I was there. She&rsquo;s
    never easy when I&rsquo;m away. I might have made her a good deal more happy
    and contented without hurting myself much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell smoked long, soft, measured puffs.</p>
  <p>His mate shifted uneasily and glanced at him a couple of times, and seemed
    to become impatient, and to make up his mind about something; or perhaps
    he got an idea that Mitchell had been &ldquo;having&rdquo; him, and felt
    angry over being betrayed into maudlin confidences; for he asked abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How is your wife now, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; echoed the mate. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
    treat her well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell removed his pipe and drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I tried to,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, did you put your theory into practice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Mitchell very deliberately.</p>
  <p>Joe waited, but nothing came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked impatiently, &ldquo;How did it act? Did it
    work well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell (puff); &ldquo;she left
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell jerked the half-smoked pipe from his mouth, and rapped the burning
    tobacco out against the toe of his boot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She left me,&rdquo; he said, standing up and stretching himself.
    Then, with a vicious jerk of his arm, &ldquo;She left me for&mdash;another
    kind of a fellow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked east towards the public-house, where they were taking the coach-horses
    from the stable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish your tea, Joe? The billy&rsquo;s getting
    cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonWomen"></a>Mitchell on Women</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;All&nbsp;the same,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, continuing
    an argument by the camp-fire; &ldquo;all the same, I think that a woman can
    stand cold water better than a man. Why, when I was staying in a boarding-house
    in Dunedin, one very cold winter, there was a lady lodger who went down to
    the shower-bath first thing every morning; never missed one; sometimes went
    in freezing weather when I wouldn&rsquo;t go into a cold bath for a fiver;
    and sometimes she&rsquo;d stay under the shower for ten minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, my room was near the bath-room, and I could hear the shower
    and tap going, and her floundering about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear your grandmother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell, contemptuously. &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t know women yet. Was this woman married? Did she have a husband
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she was a young widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! well, it would have been the same if she was a young girl&mdash; or
    an old one. Were there some passable men-boarders there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>&nbsp;was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! But I mean, were there any there beside you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there were three or four; there was&mdash;a clerk and a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, as long as there was something with trousers on. Did
    it ever strike you that she never got into the bath at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, no! What would she want to go there at all for, in that case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make an impression on the men,&rdquo;  replied Mitchell promptly. &ldquo;She
    wanted to make out she was nice, and wholesome, and well-washed, and particular.
    Made an impression on&nbsp;<i>you</i>, it seems, or you wouldn&rsquo;t remember
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose so; and, now I come to think of it, the bath
    didn&rsquo;t seem to injure her make-up or wet her hair; but I supposed she
    held her head from under the shower somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she make-up so early in the morning?&rdquo;  asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unusual; but it might have been so where there was a
    lot of boarders. And about the hair&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t count for anything,
    because washing-the-head ain&rsquo;t supposed to be always included in a
    lady&rsquo;s bath; it&rsquo;s only supposed to be washed once a fortnight,
    and some don&rsquo;t do it once a month. The hair takes so long to dry; it
    don&rsquo;t matter so much if the woman&rsquo;s got short, scraggy hair;
    but if a girl&rsquo;s hair was down to her waist it would take hours to dry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how do they manage it without wetting their heads?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy enough. They have a little oilskin cap that
    fits tight over the forehead, and they put it on, and bunch their hair up
    in it when they go under the shower. Did you ever see a woman sit in a sunny
    place with her hair down after having a wash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I used to see one do that regular where I was staying; but I
    thought she only did it to show off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;she was drying her hair; though perhaps she was
    showing off at the same time, for she wouldn&rsquo;t sit where you&mdash;or
    even a Chinaman&mdash; could see her, if she didn&rsquo;t think she had a
    good head of hair. Now,&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;tell you a yarn about
    a woman&rsquo;s bath. I was stopping at a shabby-genteel boarding-house in
    Melbourne once, and one very cold winter, too; and there was a rather good-looking
    woman there, looking for a husband. She used to go down to the bath every
    morning, no matter how cold it was, and flounder and splash about as if she
    enjoyed it, till you&rsquo;d feel as though you&rsquo;d like to go and catch
    hold of her and wrap her in a rug and carry her in to the fire and nurse
    her till she was warm again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate moved uneasily, and crossed the other leg; he seemed
    greatly interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she never went into the water at all!&rdquo; continued Mitchell. &ldquo;As
    soon as one or two of the men was up in the morning she&rsquo;d come down
    from her room in a dressing-gown. It was a toney dressing-gown, too, and
    set her off properly. She knew how to dress, anyway; most of that sort of
    women do. The gown was a kind of green colour, with pink and white flowers
    all over it, and red lining, and a lot of coffee-coloured lace round the
    neck and down the front. Well, she&rsquo;d come tripping downstairs and along
    the passage, holding up one side of the gown to show her little bare white
    foot in a slipper; and in the other hand she carried her tooth-brush and
    bath-brush, and soap&mdash;like this&mdash;so&rsquo;s we all could see &rsquo;em;
    trying to make out she was too particular to use soap after anyone else.
    She could afford to buy her own soap, anyhow; it was hardly ever wet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;d go into the bathroom and turn on the tap and shower;
    when she got about three inches of water in the bath, she&rsquo;d step in,
    holding up her gown out of the water, and go slithering and kicking up and
    down the bath, like this, making a tremendous splashing. Of course she&rsquo;d
    turn off the shower first, and screw it off very tight&mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t
    do to let that leak, you know; she might get wet; but she&rsquo;d leave the
    other tap on, so as to make all the more noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how did you come to know all about this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the servant girl told me. One morning she twigged her through
    a corner of the bathroom window that the curtain didn&rsquo;t cover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have been pretty thick with servant girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do you with landladies! But never mind&mdash;let me finish the
    yarn. When she thought she&rsquo;d splashed enough, she&rsquo;d get out,
    wipe her feet, wash her face and hands, and carefully unbutton the two top
    buttons of her gown; then throw a towel over her head and shoulders, and
    listen at the door till she thought she heard some of the men moving about.
    Then she&rsquo;d start for her room, and, if she met one of the men-boarders
    in the passage or on the stairs, she&rsquo;d drop her eyes, and pretend to
    see for the first time that the top of her dressing-gown wasn&rsquo;t buttoned&mdash; and
    she&rsquo;d give a little start and grab the gown and scurry off to her room
    buttoning it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And sometimes she&rsquo;d come skipping into the breakfast-room late,
    looking awfully sweet in her dressing-gown; and if she saw any of us there,
    she&rsquo;d pretend to be much startled, and say that she thought all the
    men had gone out, and make as though she was going to clear; and someone &lsquo;d
    jump up and give her a chair, while someone else said, &lsquo;Come in, Miss
    Brown! come in! Don&rsquo;t let us frighten you. Come right in, and have
    your breakfast before it gets cold.&rsquo; So she&rsquo;d flutter a bit in
    pretty confusion, and then make a sweet little girly-girly dive for her chair,
    and tuck her feet away under the table; and she&rsquo;d blush, too, but I
    don&rsquo;t know how she managed that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know another trick that women have; it&rsquo;s mostly played by
    private barmaids. That is, to leave a stocking by accident in the bathroom
    for the gentlemen to find. If the barmaid&rsquo;s got a nice foot and ankle,
    she uses one of her own stockings; but if she hasn&rsquo;t she gets hold
    of a stocking that belongs to a girl that has. Anyway, she&rsquo;ll have
    one readied up somehow. The stocking must be worn and nicely darned; one
    that&rsquo;s been worn will keep the shape of the leg and foot&mdash;at least
    till it&rsquo;s washed again. Well, the barmaid generally knows what time
    the gentlemen go to bath, and she&rsquo;ll make it a point of going down
    just as a gentleman&rsquo;s going. Of course he&rsquo;ll give her the preference&mdash;let
    her go first, you know&mdash; and she&rsquo;ll go in and accidentally leave
    the stocking in a place where he&rsquo;s sure to see it, and when she comes
    out he&rsquo;ll go in and find it; and very likely he&rsquo;ll be a jolly
    sort of fellow, and when they&rsquo;re all sitting down to breakfast he&rsquo;ll
    come in and ask them to guess what he&rsquo;s found, and then he&rsquo;ll
    hold up the stocking. The barmaid likes this sort of thing; but she&rsquo;ll
    hold down her head, and pretend to be confused, and keep her eyes on her
    plate, and there&rsquo;ll be much blushing and all that sort of thing, and
    perhaps she&rsquo;ll gammon to be mad at him, and the landlady&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh,
    Mr. Smith! how can yer? At the breakfast table, too!&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll
    all laugh and look at the barmaid, and she&rsquo;ll get more embarrassed
    than ever, and spill her tea, and make out as though the stocking didn&rsquo;t
    belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="NoPlaceforaWoman"></a>No Place for a Woman</b></h2>
  <p>He had a selection on a long box-scrub siding of the ridges, about half
    a mile back and up from the coach road. There were no neighbours that I ever
    heard of, and the nearest &ldquo;town&rdquo; was thirty miles away. He grew
    wheat among the stumps of his clearing, sold the crop standing to a Cockie
    who lived ten miles away, and had some surplus sons; or, some seasons, he
    reaped it by hand, had it thrashed by travelling &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; (portable
    steam engine and machine), and carried the grain, a few bags at a time, into
    the mill on his rickety dray.</p>
  <p>He had lived alone for upwards of 15 years, and was known to those who knew
    him as &ldquo;Ratty Howlett&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Trav&rsquo;lers and strangers failed to see anything uncommonly ratty about
    him. It was known, or, at least, it was believed, without question, that
    while at work he kept his horse saddled and bridled, and hung up to the fence,
    or grazing about, with the saddle on&mdash;or, anyway, close handy for a
    moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;and whenever he caught sight, over the scrub
    and through the quarter-mile break in it, of a traveller on the road, he
    would jump on his horse and make after him. If it was a horseman he usually
    pulled him up inside of a mile. Stories were told of unsuccessful chases,
    misunderstandings, and complications arising out of Howlett&rsquo;s mania
    for running down and bailing up travellers. Sometimes he caught one every
    day for a week, sometimes not one for weeks&mdash;it was a lonely track.</p>
  <p>The explanation was simple, sufficient, and perfectly natural&mdash;from
    a bushman&rsquo;s point of view. Ratty only wanted to have a yarn. He and
    the traveller would camp in the shade for half an hour or so and yarn and
    smoke. The old man would find out where the traveller came from, and how
    long he&rsquo;d been there, and where he was making for, and how long he
    reckoned he&rsquo;d be away; and ask if there had been any rain along the
    traveller&rsquo;s back track, and how the country looked after the drought;
    and he&rsquo;d get the traveller&rsquo;s ideas on abstract questions&mdash; if
    he had any. If it was a footman (swagman), and he was short of tobacco, old
    Howlett always had half a stick ready for him. Sometimes, but very rarely,
    he&rsquo;d invite the swagman back to the hut for a pint of tea, or a bit
    of meat, flour, tea, or sugar, to carry him along the track.</p>
  <p>And, after the yarn by the road, they said, the old man would ride back,
    refreshed, to his lonely selection, and work on into the night as long as
    he could see his solitary old plough horse, or the scoop of his long-handled
    shovel.</p>
  <p>And so it was that I came to make his acquaintance&mdash;or, rather, that
    he made mine. I was cantering easily along the track &mdash;I was making
    for the north-west with a pack horse&mdash;when about a mile beyond the track
    to the selection I heard, &ldquo;Hi, Mister!&rdquo; and saw a dust cloud
    following me. I had heard of &ldquo;Old Ratty Howlett&rdquo; casually, and
    so was prepared for him.</p>
  <p>A tall gaunt man on a little horse. He was clean-shaven, except for a frill
    beard round under his chin, and his long wavy, dark hair was turning grey;
    a square, strong-faced man, and reminded me of one full-faced portrait of
    Gladstone more than any other face I had seen. He had large reddish-brown
    eyes, deep set under heavy eyebrows, and with something of the blackfellow
    in them&mdash;the sort of eyes that will peer at something on the horizon
    that no one else can see. He had a way of talking to the horizon, too&mdash;more
    than to his companion; and he had a deep vertical wrinkle in his forehead
    that no smile could lessen.</p>
  <p>I got down and got out my pipe, and we sat on a log and yarned awhile on
    bush subjects; and then, after a pause, he shifted uneasily, it seemed to
    me, and asked rather abruptly, and in an altered tone, if I was married.
    A queer question to ask a traveller; more especially in my case, as I was
    little more than a boy then.</p>
  <p>He talked on again of old things and places where we had both been, and
    asked after men he knew, or had known&mdash;drovers and others&mdash;and
    whether they were living yet. Most of his inquiries went back before my time;
    but some of the drovers, one or two overlanders with whom he had been mates
    in his time, had grown old into mine, and I knew them. I notice now, though
    I didn&rsquo;t then&mdash;and if I had it would not have seemed strange from
    a bush point of view&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t ask for news, nor seem interested
    in it.</p>
  <p>Then after another uneasy pause, during which he scratched crosses in the
    dust with a stick, he asked me, in the same queer tone and without looking
    at me or looking up, if I happened to know anything about doctoring&mdash;if
    I&rsquo;d ever studied it.</p>
  <p>I asked him if anyone was sick at his place. He hesitated, and said  &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then
    I wanted to know why he had asked me that question, and he was so long about
    answering that I began to think he was hard of hearing, when, at last, he
    muttered something about my face reminding him of a young fellow he knew
    of who&rsquo;d gone to Sydney to &ldquo;study for a doctor&rdquo;. That might
    have been, and looked natural enough; but why didn&rsquo;t he ask me straight
    out if I was the chap he &ldquo;knowed of&rdquo;? Travellers do not like
    beating about the bush in conversation.</p>
  <p>He sat in silence for a good while, with his arms folded, and looking absently
    away over the dead level of the great scrubs that spread from the foot of
    the ridge we were on to where a blue peak or two of a distant range showed
    above the bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>I stood up and put my pipe away and stretched. Then he seemed to wake up. &ldquo;Better
    come back to the hut and have a bit of dinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
    missus will about have it ready, and I&rsquo;ll spare you a handful of hay
    for the horses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hay decided it. It was a dry season. I was surprised to hear of a wife,
    for I thought he was a hatter&mdash;I had always heard so; but perhaps I
    had been mistaken, and he had married lately; or had got a housekeeper. The
    farm was an irregularly-shaped clearing in the scrub, with a good many stumps
    in it, with a broken-down two-rail fence along the frontage, and logs and &ldquo;dog-leg&rdquo; the
    rest. It was about as lonely-looking a place as I had seen, and I had seen
    some out-of-the-way, God-forgotten holes where men lived alone. The hut was
    in the top corner, a two-roomed slab hut, with a shingle roof, which must
    have been uncommon round there in the days when that hut was built. I was
    used to bush carpentering, and saw that the place had been put up by a man
    who had plenty of life and hope in front of him, and for someone else beside
    himself. But there were two unfinished skilling rooms built on to the back
    of the hut; the posts, sleepers, and wall-plates had been well put up and
    fitted, and the slab walls were up, but the roof had never been put on. There
    was nothing but burrs and nettles inside those walls, and an old wooden bullock
    plough and a couple of yokes were dry-rotting across the back doorway. The
    remains of a straw-stack, some hay under a bark humpy, a small iron plough,
    and an old stiff coffin-headed grey draught horse, were all that I saw about
    the place.</p>
  <p>But there was a bit of a surprise for me inside, in the shape of a clean
    white tablecloth on the rough slab table which stood on stakes driven into
    the ground. The cloth was coarse, but it was a tablecloth &mdash;not a spare
    sheet put on in honour of unexpected visitors&mdash;and perfectly clean.
    The tin plates, pannikins, and jam tins that served as sugar bowls and salt
    cellars were polished brightly. The walls and fireplace were whitewashed,
    the clay floor swept, and clean sheets of newspaper laid on the slab mantleshelf
    under the row of biscuit tins that held the groceries. I thought that his
    wife, or housekeeper, or whatever she was, was a clean and tidy woman about
    a house. I saw no woman; but on the sofa &mdash;a light, wooden, batten one,
    with runged arms at the ends&mdash;lay a woman&rsquo;s dress on a lot of
    sheets of old stained and faded newspapers. He looked at it in a puzzled
    way, knitting his forehead, then took it up absently and folded it. I saw
    then that it was a riding skirt and jacket. He bundled them into the newspapers
    and took them into the bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wife was going on a visit down the creek this afternoon,&rdquo; he
    said rapidly and without looking at me, but stooping as if to have another
    look through the door at those distant peaks. &ldquo;I suppose she got tired
    o&rsquo; waitin&rsquo;, and went and took the daughter with her. But, never
    mind, the grub is ready.&rdquo; There was a camp-oven with a leg of mutton
    and potatoes sizzling in it on the hearth, and billies hanging over the fire.
    I noticed the billies had been scraped, and the lids polished.</p>
  <p>There seemed to be something queer about the whole business, but then he
    and his wife might have had a &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; during the morning. I
    thought so during the meal, when the subject of women came up, and he said
    one never knew how to take a woman, etc.; but there was nothing in what he
    said that need necessarily have referred to his wife or to any woman in particular.
    For the rest he talked of old bush things, droving, digging, and old bushranging&mdash;but
    never about live things and living men, unless any of the old mates he talked
    about happened to be alive by accident. He was very restless in the house,
    and never took his hat off.</p>
  <p>There was a dress and a woman&rsquo;s old hat hanging on the wall near the
    door, but they looked as if they might have been hanging there for a lifetime.
    There seemed something queer about the whole place&mdash;something wanting;
    but then all out-of-the-way bush homes are haunted by that something wanting,
    or, more likely, by the spirits of the things that should have been there,
    but never had been.</p>
  <p>As I rode down the track to the road I looked back and saw old Howlett hard
    at work in a hole round a big stump with his long-handled shovel.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d noticed that he moved and walked with a slight list to port, and
    put his hand once or twice to the small of his back, and I set it down to
    lumbago, or something of that sort.</p>
  <p>Up in the Never Never I heard from a drover who had known Howlett that his
    wife had died in the first year, and so this mysterious woman, if she was
    his wife, was, of course, his second wife. The drover seemed surprised and
    rather amused at the thought of old Howlett going in for matrimony again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I rode back that way five years later, from the Never Never. It was early
    in the morning&mdash;I had ridden since midnight. I didn&rsquo;t think the
    old man would be up and about; and, besides, I wanted to get on home, and
    have a look at the old folk, and the mates I&rsquo;d left behind&mdash;and
    the girl. But I hadn&rsquo;t got far past the point where Howlett&rsquo;s
    track joined the road, when I happened to look back, and saw him on horseback,
    stumbling down the track. I waited till he came up.</p>
  <p>He was riding the old grey draught horse this time, and it looked very much
    broken down. I thought it would have come down every step, and fallen like
    an old rotten humpy in a gust of wind. And the old man was not much better
    off. I saw at once that he was a very sick man. His face was drawn, and he
    bent forward as if he was hurt. He got down stiffly and awkwardly, like a
    hurt man, and as soon as his feet touched the ground he grabbed my arm, or
    he would have gone down like a man who steps off a train in motion. He hung
    towards the bank of the road, feeling blindly, as it were, for the ground,
    with his free hand, as I eased him down. I got my blanket and calico from
    the pack saddle to make him comfortable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help me with my back agen the tree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must
    sit up&mdash; it&rsquo;s no use lyin&rsquo; me down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat with his hand gripping his side, and breathed painfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I run up to the hut and get the wife?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He spoke painfully. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Then, as if the
    words were jerked out of him by a spasm: &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took it that she had left him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been bad? How long has this been coming on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took no notice of the question. I thought it was a touch of rheumatic
    fever, or something of that sort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone into my back and
    sides now&mdash;the pain&rsquo;s worse in me back,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
  <p>I had once been mates with a man who died suddenly of heart disease, while
    at work. He was washing a dish of dirt in the creek near a claim we were
    working; he let the dish slip into the water, fell back, crying, &ldquo;O,
    my back!&rdquo; and was gone. And now I felt by instinct that it was poor
    old Howlett&rsquo;s heart that was wrong. A man&rsquo;s heart is in his back
    as well as in his arms and hands.</p>
  <p>The old man had turned pale with the pallor of a man who turns faint in
    a heat wave, and his arms fell loosely, and his hands rocked helplessly with
    the knuckles in the dust. I felt myself turning white, too, and the sick,
    cold, empty feeling in my stomach, for I knew the signs. Bushmen stand in
    awe of sickness and death.</p>
  <p>But after I&rsquo;d fixed him comfortably and given him a drink from the
    water bag the greyness left his face, and he pulled himself together a bit;
    he drew up his arms and folded them across his chest. He let his head rest
    back against the tree&mdash;his slouch hat had fallen off revealing a broad,
    white brow, much higher than I expected. He seemed to gaze on the azure fin
    of the range, showing above the dark blue-green bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>Then he commenced to speak&mdash;taking no notice of me when I asked him
    if he felt better now&mdash;to talk in that strange, absent, far-away tone
    that awes one. He told his story mechanically, monotonously&mdash;in set
    words, as I believe now, as he had often told it before; if not to others,
    then to the loneliness of the bush. And he used the names of people and places
    that I had never heard of&mdash;just as if I knew them as well as he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bring her up the first year. It was no place
    for a woman. I wanted her to stay with her people and wait till I&rsquo;d
    got the place a little more ship-shape. The Phippses took a selection down
    the creek. I wanted her to wait and come up with them so&rsquo;s she&rsquo;d
    have some company&mdash; a woman to talk to. They came afterwards, but they
    didn&rsquo;t stop. It was no place for a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mary would come. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop with her people down
    country. She wanted to be with me, and look after me, and work and help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He repeated himself a great deal&mdash;said the same thing over and over
    again sometimes. He was only mad on one track. He&rsquo;d tail off and sit
    silent for a while; then he&rsquo;d become aware of me in a hurried, half-scared
    way, and apologise for putting me to all that trouble, and thank me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be all right d&rsquo;reckly. Best take the horses up to the hut and have
    some breakfast; you&rsquo;ll find it by the fire. I&rsquo;ll foller you,
    d&rsquo;reckly. The wife&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
    would drop off, and be going again presently on the old track:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her mother was coming up to stay awhile at the end of the year, but
    the old man hurt his leg. Then her married sister was coming, but one of
    the youngsters got sick and there was trouble at home. I saw the doctor in
    the town&mdash;thirty miles from here&mdash;and fixed it up with him. He
    was a boozer&mdash;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him afterwards. I fixed up with
    a woman in the town to come and stay. I thought Mary was wrong in her time.
    She must have been a month or six weeks out. But I listened to her. . . .
    Don&rsquo;t argue with a woman. Don&rsquo;t listen to a woman. Do the right
    thing. We should have had a mother woman to talk to us. But it was no place
    for a woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rocked his head, as if from some old agony of mind, against the tree-trunk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was took bad suddenly one night, but it passed off. False alarm.
    I was going to ride somewhere, but she said to wait till daylight. Someone
    was sure to pass. She was a brave and sensible girl, but she had a terror
    of being left alone. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a black shepherd three or four miles away. I rode over
    while Mary was asleep, and started the black boy into town. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    shot him afterwards if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a caught him. The old black gin was
    dead the week before, or Mary would a&rsquo; bin alright. She was tied up
    in a bunch with strips of blanket and greenhide, and put in a hole. So there
    wasn&rsquo;t even a gin near the place. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was watchin&rsquo; the road at daylight, and I was watchin&rsquo; the
    road at dusk. I went down in the hollow and stooped down to get the gap agen
    the sky, so&rsquo;s I could see if anyone was comin&rsquo; over. . . . I&rsquo;d
    get on the horse and gallop along towards the town for five miles, but something
    would drag me back, and then I&rsquo;d race for fear she&rsquo;d die before
    I got to the hut. I expected the doctor every five minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It come on about daylight next morning. I ran back&rsquo;ards and
    for&rsquo;ards between the hut and the road like a madman. And no one come.
    I was running amongst the logs and stumps, and fallin&rsquo; over them, when
    I saw a cloud of dust agen sunrise. It was her mother an&rsquo; sister in
    the spring-cart, an&rsquo; just catchin&rsquo; up to them was the doctor
    in his buggy with the woman I&rsquo;d arranged with in town. The mother and
    sister was staying at the town for the night, when they heard of the black
    boy. It took him a day to ride there. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    caught him ever after. The doctor&rsquo;d been on the drunk. If I&rsquo;d
    had the gun and known she was gone I&rsquo;d have shot him in the buggy.
    They said she was dead. And the child was dead, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They blamed me, but I didn&rsquo;t want her to come; it was no place
    for a woman. I never saw them again after the funeral. I didn&rsquo;t want
    to see them any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He moved his head wearily against the tree, and presently drifted on again
    in a softer tone&mdash;his eyes and voice were growing more absent and dreamy
    and far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a month after&mdash;or a year, I lost count of the time long
    ago&mdash;she came back to me. At first she&rsquo;d come in the night, then
    sometimes when I was at work&mdash;and she had the baby&mdash;it was a girl&mdash;in
    her arms. And by-and-bye she came to stay altogether. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    blame her for going away that time&mdash;it was no place for a woman. . .
    . She was a good wife to me. She was a jolly girl when I married her. The
    little girl grew up like her. I was going to send her down country to be
    educated&mdash;it was no place for a girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a month, or a year, ago, Mary left me, and took the daughter,
    and never came back till last night&mdash;this morning, I think it was. I
    thought at first it was the girl with her hair done up, and her mother&rsquo;s
    skirt on, to surprise her old dad. But it was Mary, my wife&mdash;as she
    was when I married her. She said she couldn&rsquo;t stay, but she&rsquo;d
    wait for me on the road; on&mdash;the road. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His arms fell, and his face went white. I got the water-bag. &ldquo;Another
    turn like that and you&rsquo;ll be gone,&rdquo; I thought, as he came to
    again. Then I suddenly thought of a shanty that had been started, when I
    came that way last, ten or twelve miles along the road, towards the town.
    There was nothing for it but to leave him and ride on for help, and a cart
    of some kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wait here till I come back,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
    for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He roused himself a little. &ldquo;Best come up to the hut and get some
    grub. The wife&rsquo;ll be waiting. . . .&rdquo; He was off the track again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wait while I take the horse down to the creek?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the water-bag handy.
    Don&rsquo;t move till I come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I took the packhorse, which was the freshest and best, threw the pack-saddle
    and bags into a bush, left the other horse to take care of itself, and started
    for the shanty, leaving the old man with his back to the tree, his arms folded,
    and his eyes on the horizon.</p>
  <p>One of the chaps at the shanty rode on for the doctor at once, while the
    other came back with me in a spring-cart. He told me that old Howlett&rsquo;s
    wife had died in child-birth the first year on the selection&mdash;&ldquo;she
    was a fine girl he&rsquo;d heered!&rdquo; He told me the story as the old
    man had told it, and in pretty well the same words, even to giving it as
    his opinion that it was no place for a woman. &ldquo;And he &lsquo;hatted&rsquo; and
    brooded over it till he went ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew the rest. He not only thought that his wife, or the ghost of his
    wife, had been with him all those years, but that the child had lived and
    grown up, and that the wife did the housework; which, of course, he must
    have done himself.</p>
  <p>When we reached him his knotted hands had fallen for the last time, and
    they were at rest. I only took one quick look at his face, but could have
    sworn that he was gazing at the blue fin of the range on the horizon of the
    bush.</p>
  <p>Up at the hut the table was set as on the first day I saw it, and breakfast
    in the camp-oven by the fire.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellsJobs"></a>Mitchell&rsquo;s Jobs</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to knock off work and try to make some money,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, as he jerked the tea-leaves out of his pannikin and reached for
    the billy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the great mistake of my life &mdash; if
    I hadn&rsquo;t wasted all my time and energy working and looking for work
    I might have been an independent man to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; he added in a louder voice, condescendingly adapting
    his language to my bushed comprehension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sling
    graft and try and get some stuff together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t feel in a responsive humour, but I lit up and settled back
    comfortably against the tree, and Jack folded his arms on his knees and presently
    continued, reflectively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the first time I went to work. I was a youngster then.
    Mother used to go round looking for jobs for me. She reckoned, perhaps, that
    I was too shy to go in where there was a boy wanted and barrack for myself
    properly, and she used to help me and see me through to the best of her ability.
    I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t always feel as grateful to her as I should
    have felt. I was a thankless kid at the best of times &mdash; most kids are &mdash; but
    otherwise I was a straight enough little chap as nippers go. Sometimes I
    almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t been. My relations would have thought a good deal
    more of me and treated me better &mdash; and, besides, it&rsquo;s a comfort,
    at times, to sit and watch the sun going down in the bed of the bush, and
    think of your wicked childhood and wasted life, and the way you treated your
    parents and broke their hearts, and feel just properly repentant and bitter
    and remorseful and low-spirited about it when it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! . . . I generally did feel a bit backward in going in when
    I came to the door of an office or shop where there was a &lsquo;Strong Lad&rsquo;,
    or a &lsquo;Willing Youth&rsquo;, wanted inside to make himself generally
    useful. I was a strong lad and a willing youth enough, in some things, for
    that matter; but I didn&rsquo;t like to see it written up on a card in a
    shop window, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make myself generally useful in a
    close shop in a hot dusty street on mornings when the weather was fine and
    the great sunny rollers were coming in grand on the Bondi Beach and down
    at Coogee, and I could swim. . . . I&rsquo;d give something to be down along
    there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked away out over the sultry sandy plain that we were to tackle
    next day, and sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first job I got was in a jam factory. They only had &lsquo;Boy
    Wanted&rsquo;  on the card in the window, and I thought it would suit me.
    They set me to work to peel peaches, and, as soon as the foreman&rsquo;s
    back was turned, I picked out a likely-looking peach and tried it. They soaked
    those peaches in salt or acid or something &mdash; it was part of the process &mdash; and
    I had to spit it out. Then I got an orange from a boy who was slicing them,
    but it was bitter, and I couldn&rsquo;t eat it. I saw that I&rsquo;d been
    had properly. I was in a fix, and had to get out of it the best way I could.
    I&rsquo;d left my coat down in the front shop, and the foreman and boss were
    there, so I had to work in that place for two mortal hours. It was about
    the longest two hours I&rsquo;d ever spent in my life. At last the foreman
    came up, and I told him I wanted to go down to the back for a minute. I slipped
    down, watched my chance till the boss&rsquo; back was turned, got my coat,
    and cleared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next job I got was in a mat factory; at least, Aunt got that
    for me. I didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with mats or carpets.
    The worst of it was the boss didn&rsquo;t seem to want me to go, and I had
    a job to get him to sack me, and when he did he saw some of my people and
    took me back again next week. He sacked me finally the next Saturday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got the next job myself. I didn&rsquo;t hurry; I took my time and
    picked out a good one. It was in a lolly factory. I thought it would suit
    me &mdash; and it did, for a while. They put me on stirring up and mixing
    stuff in the jujube department; but I got so sick of the smell of it and
    so full of jujube and other lollies that I soon wanted a change; so I had
    a row with the chief of the jujube department and the boss gave me the sack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got a job in a grocery then. I thought I&rsquo;d have more variety
    there. But one day the boss was away, sick or something, all the afternoon,
    and I sold a lot of things too cheap. I didn&rsquo;t know. When a customer
    came in and asked for something I&rsquo;d just look round in the window till
    I saw a card with the price written up on it, and sell the best quality according
    to that price; and once or twice I made a mistake the other way about and
    lost a couple of good customers. It was a hot, drowsy afternoon, and by-and-bye
    I began to feel dull and sleepy. So I looked round the corner and saw a Chinaman
    coming. I got a big tin garden syringe and filled it full of brine from the
    butter keg, and, when he came opposite the door, I let him have the full
    force of it in the ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Chinaman put down his baskets and came for me. I was strong
    for my age, and thought I could fight, but he gave me a proper mauling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was like running up against a thrashing machine, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have been well for me if the boss of the shop next door hadn&rsquo;t interfered.
    He told my boss, and my boss gave me the sack at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I took a spell of eighteen months or so after that, and was growing
    up happy and contented when a married sister of mine must needs come to live
    in town and interfere. I didn&rsquo;t like married sisters, though I always
    got on grand with my brothers-in-law, and wished there were more of them.
    The married sister comes round and cleans up the place and pulls your things
    about and finds your pipe and tobacco and things, and cigarette portraits,
    and &ldquo;Deadwood Dicks&rdquo;, that you&rsquo;ve got put away all right,
    so&rsquo;s your mother and aunt wouldn&rsquo;t find them in a generation
    of cats, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother, why don&rsquo;t you make that boy go to work. It&rsquo;s
    a scandalous shame to see a big boy like that growing up idle. He&rsquo;s
    going to the bad before your eyes.&rsquo; And she&rsquo;s always trying to
    make out that you&rsquo;re a liar, and trying to make mother believe it,
    too. My married sister got me a job with a chemist, whose missus she knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got on pretty well there, and by-and-bye I was put upstairs in
    the grinding and mixing department; but, after a while, they put another
    boy that I was chummy with up there with me, and that was a mistake. I didn&rsquo;t
    think so at the time, but I can see it now. We got up to all sorts of tricks.
    We&rsquo;d get mixing together chemicals that weren&rsquo;t related to see
    how they&rsquo;d agree, and we nearly blew up the shop several times, and
    set it on fire once. But all the chaps liked us, and fixed things up for
    us. One day we got a big black dog &mdash; that we meant to take home that
    evening &mdash; and sneaked him upstairs and put him on a flat roof outside
    the laboratory. He had a touch of the mange and didn&rsquo;t look well, so
    we gave him a dose of something; and he scrambled over the parapet and slipped
    down a steep iron roof in front, and fell on a respected townsman that knew
    my people. We were awfully frightened, and didn&rsquo;t say anything. Nobody
    saw it but us. The dog had the presence of mind to leave at once, and the
    respected townsman was picked up and taken home in a cab; and he got it hot
    from his wife, too, I believe, for being in that drunken, beastly state in
    the main street in the middle of the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was ever quite sure that he hadn&rsquo;t been
    drunk or what had happened, for he had had one or two that morning; so it
    didn&rsquo;t matter much. Only we lost the dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day I went downstairs to the packing-room and saw a lot of phosphorus
    in jars of water. I wanted to fix up a ghost for Billy, my mate, so I nicked
    a bit and slipped it into my trouser pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stood under the tap and let it pour on me. The phosphorus burnt
    clean through my pocket and fell on the ground. I was sent home that night
    with my leg dressed with lime-water and oil, and a pair of the boss&rsquo;s
    pants on that were about half a yard too long for me, and I felt miserable
    enough, too. They said it would stop my tricks for a while, and so it did.
    I&rsquo;ll carry the mark to my dying day &mdash; and for two or three days
    after, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I fell asleep at this point, and left Mitchell&rsquo;s cattle pup to hear
    it out.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BilltheVentriloquialRooster"></a>Bill, the Ventriloquial Rooster</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;When we were up country on the selection, we had a rooster at our
    place, named Bill,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;a big mongrel of no particular
    breed, though the old lady said he was a &lsquo;brammer&rsquo;&mdash;and
    many an argument she had with the old man about it too; she was just as stubborn
    and obstinate in her opinion as the governor was in his. But, anyway, we
    called him Bill, and didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him till
    a cousin of some of us came from Sydney on a visit to the country, and stayed
    at our place because it was cheaper than stopping at a pub. Well, somehow
    this chap got interested in Bill, and studied him for two or three days,
    and at last he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, that rooster&rsquo;s a ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go along with yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he is. I&rsquo;ve heard of cases like this before; but
    this is the first I&rsquo;ve come across. Bill&rsquo;s a ventriloquist right
    enough.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we remembered that there wasn&rsquo;t another rooster within
    five miles  &mdash;our only neighbour, an Irishman named Page, didn&rsquo;t
    have one at the time&mdash; and we&rsquo;d often heard another cock crow,
    but didn&rsquo;t think to take any notice of it. We watched Bill, and sure
    enough he <i>was</i> a ventriloquist. The &lsquo;ka-cocka&rsquo; would come
    all right, but the &lsquo;co-ka-koo-oi-oo&rsquo; seemed to come from a distance.
    And sometimes the whole crow would go wrong, and come back like an echo that
    had been lost for a year. Bill would stand on tiptoe, and hold his elbows
    out, and curve his neck, and go two or three times as if he was swallowing
    nest-eggs, and nearly break his neck and burst his gizzard; and then there&rsquo;d
    be no sound at all where he was&mdash;only a cock crowing in the distance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And pretty soon we could see that Bill was in great trouble about
    it himself. You see, he didn&rsquo;t know it was himself&mdash;thought it
    was another rooster challenging him, and he wanted badly to find that other
    bird. He would get up on the wood-heap, and crow and listen&mdash;crow and
    listen again&mdash; crow and listen, and then he&rsquo;d go up to the top
    of the paddock, and get up on the stack, and crow and listen there. Then
    down to the other end of the paddock, and get up on a mullock-heap, and crow
    and listen there. Then across to the other side and up on a log among the
    saplings, and crow &lsquo;n&rsquo; listen some more. He searched all over
    the place for that other rooster, but, of course, couldn&rsquo;t find him.
    Sometimes he&rsquo;d be out all day crowing and listening all over the country,
    and then come home dead tired, and rest and cool off in a hole that the hens
    had scratched for him in a damp place under the water-cask sledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day Page brought home a big white rooster, and when he
    let it go it climbed up on Page&rsquo;s stack and crowed, to see if there
    was any more roosters round there. Bill had come home tired; it was a hot
    day, and he&rsquo;d rooted out the hens, and was having a spell-oh under
    the cask when the white rooster crowed. Bill didn&rsquo;t lose any time getting
    out and on to the wood-heap, and then he waited till he heard the crow again;
    then he crowed, and the other rooster crowed again, and they crowed at each
    other for three days, and called each other all the wretches they could lay
    their tongues to, and after that they implored each other to come out and
    be made into chicken soup and feather pillows. But neither&rsquo;d come.
    You see, there were <i>three</i> crows&mdash;there was Bill&rsquo;s crow,
    and the ventriloquist crow, and the white rooster&rsquo;s crow&mdash; and
    each rooster thought that there was <i>two</i> roosters in the opposition
    camp, and that he mightn&rsquo;t get fair play, and, consequently, both were
    afraid to put up their hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But at last Bill couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He made up his
    mind to go and have it out, even if there was a whole agricultural show of
    prize and honourable-mention fighting-cocks in Page&rsquo;s yard. He got
    down from the wood-heap and started off across the ploughed field, his head
    down, his elbows out, and his thick awkward legs prodding away at the furrows
    behind for all they were worth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to go down badly and see the fight, and barrack for Bill.
    But I daren&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;d been coming up the road late the night
    before with my brother Joe, and there was about three panels of turkeys roosting
    along on the top rail of Page&rsquo;s front fence; and we brushed &rsquo;em
    with a bough, and they got up such a blessed gobbling fuss about it that
    Page came out in his shirt and saw us running away; and I knew he was laying
    for us with a bullock whip. Besides, there was friction between the two families
    on account of a thoroughbred bull that Page borrowed and wouldn&rsquo;t lend
    to us, and that got into our paddock on account of me mending a panel in
    the party fence, and carelessly leaving the top rail down after sundown while
    our cows was moving round there in the saplings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there was too much friction for me to go down, but I climbed a
    tree as near the fence as I could and watched. Bill reckoned he&rsquo;d found
    that rooster at last. The white rooster wouldn&rsquo;t come down from the
    stack, so Bill went up to him, and they fought there till they tumbled down
    the other side, and I couldn&rsquo;t see any more. Wasn&rsquo;t I wild? I&rsquo;d
    have given my dog to have seen the rest of the fight. I went down to the
    far side of Page&rsquo;s fence and climbed a tree there, but, of course,
    I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, so I came home the back way. Just as I got
    home Page came round to the front and sung out, &lsquo;Insoid there!&rsquo; And
    me and Jim went under the house like snakes and looked out round a pile.
    But Page was all right&mdash;he had a broad grin on his face, and Bill safe
    under his arm. He put Bill down on the ground very carefully, and says he
    to the old folks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yer rooster knocked the stuffin&rsquo; out of my rooster,
    but I bear no malice. &rsquo;Twas a grand foight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then the old man and Page had a yarn, and got pretty friendly
    after that. And Bill didn&rsquo;t seem to bother about any more ventriloquism;
    but the white rooster spent a lot of time looking for that other rooster.
    Perhaps he thought he&rsquo;d have better luck with him. But Page was on
    the look-out all the time to get a rooster that would lick ours. He did nothing
    else for a month but ride round and enquire about roosters; and at last he
    borrowed a game-bird in town, left five pounds deposit on him, and brought
    him home. And Page and the old man agreed to have a match&mdash; about the
    only thing they&rsquo;d agreed about for five years. And they fixed it up
    for a Sunday when the old lady and the girls and kids were going on a visit
    to some relations, about fifteen miles away&mdash; to stop all night. The
    guv&rsquo;nor made me go with them on horseback; but I knew what was up,
    and so my pony went lame about a mile along the road, and I had to come back
    and turn him out in the top paddock, and hide the saddle and bridle in a
    hollow log, and sneak home and climb up on the roof of the shed. It was a
    awful hot day, and I had to keep climbing backward and forward over the ridge-pole
    all the morning to keep out of sight of the old man, for he was moving about
    a good deal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, after dinner, the fellows from roundabout began to ride in
    and hang up their horses round the place till it looked as if there was going
    to be a funeral. Some of the chaps saw me, of course, but I tipped them the
    wink, and they gave me the office whenever the old man happened around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Page came along with his game-rooster. Its name was Jim. It
    wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, and it seemed a good deal smaller and weaker
    than Bill. Some of the chaps were disgusted, and said it wasn&rsquo;t a game-rooster
    at all; Bill&rsquo;d settle it in one lick, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have
    any fun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, they brought the game one out and put him down near the wood-heap,
    and rousted Bill out from under his cask. He got interested at once. He looked
    at Jim, and got up on the wood-heap and crowed and looked at Jim again. He
    reckoned <i>this</i> at last was the fowl that had been humbugging him all
    along. Presently his trouble caught him, and then he&rsquo;d crow and take
    a squint at the game &rsquo;un, and crow again, and have another squint at
    gamey, and try to crow and keep his eye on the game-rooster at the same time.
    But Jim never committed himself, until at last he happened to gape just after
    Bill&rsquo;s whole crow went wrong, and Bill spotted him. He reckoned he&rsquo;d
    caught him this time, and he got down off that wood-heap and went for the
    foe. But Jim ran away&mdash;and Bill ran after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Round and round the wood-heap they went, and round the shed, and
    round the house and under it, and back again, and round the wood-heap and
    over it and round the other way, and kept it up for close on an hour. Bill&rsquo;s
    bill was just within an inch or so of the game-rooster&rsquo;s tail feathers
    most of the time, but he couldn&rsquo;t get any nearer, do how he liked.
    And all the time the fellers kept chyackin Page and singing out, &lsquo;What
    price yer game &rsquo;un, Page! Go it, Bill! Go it, old cock!&rsquo;  and
    all that sort of thing. Well, the game-rooster went as if it was a go-as-you-please,
    and he didn&rsquo;t care if it lasted a year. He didn&rsquo;t seem to take
    any interest in the business, but Bill got excited, and by-and-by he got
    mad. He held his head lower and lower and his wings further and further out
    from his sides, and prodded away harder and harder at the ground behind,
    but it wasn&rsquo;t any use. Jim seemed to keep ahead without trying. They
    stuck to the wood-heap towards the last. They went round first one way for
    a while, and then the other for a change, and now and then they&rsquo;d go
    over the top to break the monotony; and the chaps got more interested in
    the race than they would have been in the fight&mdash;and bet on it, too.
    But Bill was handicapped with his weight. He was done up at last; he slowed
    down till he couldn&rsquo;t waddle, and then, when he was thoroughly knocked
    up, that game-rooster turned on him, and gave him the father of a hiding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my father caught me when I&rsquo;d got down in the excitement,
    and wasn&rsquo;t thinking, and <i>he</i> gave <i>me</i> the step-father of
    a hiding. But he had a lively time with the old lady afterwards, over the
    cock-fight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bill was so disgusted with himself that he went under the cask and
    died.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BushCats"></a>Bush Cats</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Domestic cats&rdquo; we mean&mdash;the descendants of cats who came
    from the northern world during the last hundred odd years. We do not know
    the name of the vessel in which the first Thomas and his Maria came out to
    Australia, but we suppose that it was one of the ships of the First Fleet.
    Most likely Maria had kittens on the voyage &mdash;two lots, perhaps&mdash;the
    majority of which were buried at sea; and no doubt the disembarkation caused
    her much maternal anxiety.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The feline race has not altered much in Australia, from a physical point
    of view&mdash;not yet. The rabbit has developed into something like a cross
    between a kangaroo and a possum, but the bush has not begun to develop the
    common cat. She is just as sedate and motherly as the mummy cats of Egypt
    were, but she takes longer strolls of nights, climbs gum-trees instead of
    roofs, and hunts stranger vermin than ever came under the observation of
    her northern ancestors. Her views have widened. She is mostly thinner than
    the English farm cat&mdash; which is, they say, on account of eating lizards.</p>
  <p>English rats and English mice&mdash;we say &ldquo;English&rdquo; because
    everything which isn&rsquo;t Australian in Australia, <i>is</i> English (or
    British)&mdash; English rats and English mice are either rare or non-existent
    in the bush; but the hut cat has a wider range for game. She is always dragging
    in things which are unknown in the halls of zoology; ugly, loathsome, crawling
    abortions which have not been classified yet&mdash;and perhaps could not
    be.</p>
  <p>The Australian zoologist ought to rake up some more dead languages, and
    then go Out Back with a few bush cats.</p>
  <p>The Australian bush cat has a nasty, unpleasant habit of dragging a long,
    wriggling, horrid, black snake&mdash;she seems to prefer black snakes&mdash;into
    a room where there are ladies, proudly laying it down in a conspicuous place
    (usually in front of the exit), and then looking up for approbation. She
    wonders, perhaps, why the visitors are in such a hurry to leave.</p>
  <p>Pussy doesn&rsquo;t approve of live snakes round the place, especially if
    she has kittens; and if she finds a snake in the vicinity of her progeny&mdash; well,
    it is bad for that particular serpent.</p>
  <p>This brings recollections of a neighbour&rsquo;s cat who went out in the
    scrub, one midsummer&rsquo;s day, and found a brown snake. Her name &mdash;the
    cat&rsquo;s name&mdash;was Mary Ann. She got hold of the snake all right,
    just within an inch of its head; but it got the rest of its length wound
    round her body and squeezed about eight lives out of her. She had the presence
    of mind to keep her hold; but it struck her that she was in a fix, and that
    if she wanted to save her ninth life, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to
    go home for help. So she started home, snake and all.</p>
  <p>The family were at dinner when Mary Ann came in, and, although she stood
    on an open part of the floor, no one noticed her for a while. She couldn&rsquo;t
    ask for help, for her mouth was too full of snake. By-and-bye one of the
    girls glanced round, and then went over the table, with a shriek, and out
    of the back door. The room was cleared very quickly. The eldest boy got a
    long-handled shovel, and in another second would have killed more cat than
    snake; but his father interfered. The father was a shearer, and Mary Ann
    was a favourite cat with him. He got a pair of shears from the shelf and
    deftly shore off the snake&rsquo;s head, and one side of Mary Ann&rsquo;s
    whiskers. She didn&rsquo;t think it safe to let go yet. She kept her teeth
    in the neck until the selector snipped the rest of the snake off her. The
    bits were carried out on a shovel to die at sundown. Mary Ann had a good
    drink of milk, and then got her tongue out and licked herself back into the
    proper shape for a cat; after which she went out to look for that snake&rsquo;s
    mate. She found it, too, and dragged it home the same evening.</p>
  <p>Cats will kill rabbits and drag them home. We knew a fossicker whose cat
    used to bring him a bunny nearly every night. The fossicker had rabbits for
    breakfast until he got sick of them, and then he used to swap them with a
    butcher for meat. The cat was named Ingersoll, which indicates his sex and
    gives an inkling to his master&rsquo;s religious and political opinions.
    Ingersoll used to prospect round in the gloaming until he found some rabbit
    holes which showed encouraging indications. He would shepherd one hole for
    an hour or so every evening until he found it was a duffer, or worked it
    out; then he would shift to another. One day he prospected a big hollow log
    with a lot of holes in it, and more going down underneath. The indications
    were very good, but Ingersoll had no luck. The game had too many ways of
    getting out and in. He found that he could not work that claim by himself,
    so he floated it into a company. He persuaded several cats from a neighbouring
    selection to take shares, and they watched the holes together, or in turns&mdash;they
    worked shifts. The dividends more than realised even their wildest expectations,
    for each cat took home at least one rabbit every night for a week.</p>
  <p>A selector started a vegetable garden about the time when rabbits were beginning
    to get troublesome up country. The hare had not shown itself yet. The farmer
    kept quite a regiment of cats to protect his garden&mdash;and they protected
    it. He would shut the cats up all day with nothing to eat, and let them out
    about sundown; then they would mooch off to the turnip patch like farm-labourers
    going to work. They would drag the rabbits home to the back door, and sit
    there and watch them until the farmer opened the door and served out the
    ration of milk. Then the cats would turn in. He nearly always found a semi-circle
    of dead rabbits and watchful cats round the door in the morning. They sold
    the product of their labour direct to the farmer for milk. It didn&rsquo;t
    matter if one cat had been unlucky &mdash;had not got a rabbit&mdash;each
    had an equal share in the general result. They were true socialists, those
    cats.</p>
  <p>One of those cats was a mighty big Tom, named Jack. He was death on rabbits;
    he would work hard all night, laying for them and dragging them home. Some
    weeks he would graft every night, and at other times every other night, but
    he was generally pretty regular. When he reckoned he had done an extra night&rsquo;s
    work, he would take the next night off and go three miles to the nearest
    neighbour&rsquo;s to see his Maria and take her out for a stroll. Well, one
    evening Jack went into the garden and chose a place where there was good
    cover, and lay low. He was a bit earlier than usual, so he thought he would
    have a doze till rabbit time. By-and-bye he heard a noise, and slowly, cautiously
    opening one eye, he saw two big ears sticking out of the leaves in front
    of him. He judged that it was an extra big bunny, so he put some extra style
    into his manoeuvres. In about five minutes he made his spring. He must have
    thought (if cats think) that it was a whopping, old-man rabbit, for it was
    a pioneer hare&mdash;not an ordinary English hare, but one of those great
    coarse, lanky things which the bush is breeding. The selector was attracted
    by an unusual commotion and a cloud of dust among his cabbages, and came
    along with his gun in time to witness the fight. First Jack would drag the
    hare, and then the hare would drag Jack; sometimes they would be down together,
    and then Jack would use his hind claws with effect; finally he got his teeth
    in the right place, and triumphed. Then he started to drag the corpse home,
    but he had to give it best and ask his master to lend a hand. The selector
    took up the hare, and Jack followed home, much to the family&rsquo;s surprise.
    He did not go back to work that night; he took a spell. He had a drink of
    milk, licked the dust off himself, washed it down with another drink, and
    sat in front of the fire and thought for a goodish while. Then he got up,
    walked over to the corner where the hare was lying, had a good look at it,
    came back to the fire, sat down again, and thought hard. He was still thinking
    when the family retired.</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
    Tom Smith</b></h3>
  <p>You are getting well on in the thirties, and haven&rsquo;t left off being
    a fool yet. You have been away in another colony or country for a year or
    so, and have now come back again. Most of your chums have gone away or got
    married, or, worse still, signed the pledge&mdash; settled down and got steady;
    and you feel lonely and desolate and left-behind enough for anything. While
    drifting aimlessly round town with an eye out for some chance acquaintance
    to have a knock round with, you run against an old chum whom you never dreamt
    of meeting, or whom you thought to be in some other part of the country&mdash; or
    perhaps you knock up against someone who knows the old chum in question,
    and he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Tom Smith&rsquo;s in Sydney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom Smith! Why, I thought he was in Queensland! I haven&rsquo;t seen
    him for more than three years. Where&rsquo;s the old joker hanging out at
    all? Why, except you, there&rsquo;s no one in Australia I&rsquo;d sooner
    see than Tom Smith. Here I&rsquo;ve been mooning round like an unemployed
    for three weeks, looking for someone to have a knock round with, and Tom
    in Sydney all the time. I wish I&rsquo;d known before. Where&rsquo;ll I run
    against him&mdash; where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s living at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s his home? I was never there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give you his address. . . . There, I think that&rsquo;s
    it. I&rsquo;m not sure about the number, but you&rsquo;ll soon find out in
    that street&mdash; most of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll know Tom Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks! I rather think they will. I&rsquo;m glad I met you. I&rsquo;ll
    hunt Tom up to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So you put a few shillings in your pocket, tell your landlady that you&rsquo;re
    going to visit an old aunt of yours or a sick friend, and mayn&rsquo;t be
    home that night; and then you start out to hunt up Tom Smith and have at
    least one more good night, if you die for it.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>This is the first time you have seen Tom at home; you knew of his home and
    people in the old days, but only in a vague, indefinite sort of way. Tom
    has changed! He is stouter and older-looking; he seems solemn and settled
    down. You intended to give him a surprise and have a good old jolly laugh
    with him, but somehow things get suddenly damped at the beginning. He grins
    and grips your hand right enough, but there seems something wanting. You
    can&rsquo;t help staring at him, and he seems to look at you in a strange,
    disappointing way; it doesn&rsquo;t strike you that you also have changed,
    and perhaps more in his eyes than he in yours. He introduces you to his mother
    and sisters and brothers, and the rest of the family; or to his wife, as
    the case may be; and you have to suppress your feelings and be polite and
    talk common-place. You hate to be polite and talk common-place. You aren&rsquo;t
    built that way&mdash; and Tom wasn&rsquo;t either, in the old days. The wife
    (or the mother and sisters) receives you kindly, for Tom&rsquo;s sake, and
    makes much of you; but they don&rsquo;t know you yet. You want to get Tom
    outside, and have a yarn and a drink and a laugh with him&mdash;you are bursting
    to tell him all about yourself, and get him to tell you all about himself,
    and ask him if he remembers things; and you wonder if he is bursting the
    same way, and hope he is. The old lady and sisters (or the wife) bore you
    pretty soon, and you wonder if they bore Tom; you almost fancy, from his
    looks, that they do. You wonder whether Tom is coming out to-night, whether
    he wants to get out, and if he wants to and wants to get out by himself,
    whether he&rsquo;ll be able to manage it; but you daren&rsquo;t broach the
    subject, it wouldn&rsquo;t be polite. You&rsquo;ve got to be polite. Then
    you get worried by the thought that Tom is bursting to get out with you and
    only wants an excuse; is waiting, in fact, and hoping for you to ask him
    in an off-hand sort of way to come out for a stroll. But you&rsquo;re not
    quite sure; and besides, if you were, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage.
    By-and-bye you get tired of it all, thirsty, and want to get out in the open
    air. You get tired of saying,  &ldquo;Do you really, Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do
    you think so, Miss Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were quite right, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well,
    I think so too, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; or, to the brother,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    just what I thought, Mr. Smith.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;talk
    pretty&rdquo; to them, and listen to their wishy-washy nonsense; you want
    to get out and have a roaring spree with Tom, as you had in the old days;
    you want to make another night of it with your old mate, Tom Smith; and pretty
    soon you get the blues badly, and feel nearly smothered in there, and you&rsquo;ve
    got to get out and have a beer anyway&mdash;Tom or no Tom; and you begin
    to feel wild with Tom himself; and at last you make a bold dash for it and
    chance Tom. You get up, look at your hat, and say: &ldquo;Ah, well, I must
    be going, Tom; I&rsquo;ve got to meet someone down the street at seven o&rsquo;clock.
    Where&rsquo;ll I meet you in town next week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tom says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dash it; you ain&rsquo;t going yet. Stay to tea, Joe, stay to
    tea. It&rsquo;ll be on the table in a minute. Sit down&mdash;sit down, man!
    Here, gimme your hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&rsquo;s sister, or wife, or mother comes in with an apron on and
    her hands all over flour, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going yet, Mr. Brown? Tea&rsquo;ll be ready
    in a minute. Do stay for tea.&rdquo; And if you make excuses, she cross-examines
    you about the time you&rsquo;ve got to keep that appointment down the street,
    and tells you that their clock is twenty minutes fast, and that you have
    got plenty of time, and so you have to give in. But you are mightily encouraged
    by a winksome expression which you see, or fancy you see, on your side of
    Tom&rsquo;s face; also by the fact of his having accidentally knocked his
    foot against your shins. So you stay.</p>
  <p>One of the females tells you to &ldquo;Sit there, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; and
    you take your place at the table, and the polite business goes on. You&rsquo;ve
    got to hold your knife and fork properly, and mind your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s,
    and when she says, &ldquo;Do you take milk and sugar, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve
    got to say, &ldquo;Yes, please, Miss Smith&mdash;thanks&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    plenty.&rdquo; And when they press you, as they will, to have more, you&rsquo;ve
    got to keep on saying, &ldquo;No, thanks, Mrs. Smith; no, thanks, Miss Smith;
    I really couldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve done very well, thank you; I had a very
    late dinner, and so on&rdquo;&mdash;bother such tommy-rot. And you don&rsquo;t
    seem to have any appetite, anyway. And you think of the days out on the track
    when you and Tom sat on your swags under a mulga at mid-day, and ate mutton
    and johnny-cake with clasp-knives, and drank by turns out of the old, battered,
    leaky billy.</p>
  <p>And after tea you have to sit still while the precious minutes are wasted,
    and listen and sympathize, while all the time you are on the fidget to get
    out with Tom, and go down to a private bar where you know some girls.</p>
  <p>And perhaps by-and-bye the old lady gets confidential, and seizes an opportunity
    to tell you what a good steady young fellow Tom is now that he never touches
    drink, and belongs to a temperance society (or the Y.M.C.A.), and never stays
    out of nights.</p>
  <p>Consequently you feel worse than ever, and lonelier, and sorrier that you
    wasted your time coming. You are encouraged again by a glimpse of Tom putting
    on a clean collar and fixing himself up a bit; but when you are ready to
    go, and ask him if he&rsquo;s coming a bit down the street with you, he says
    he thinks he will in such a disinterested, don&rsquo;t-mind-if-I-do sort
    of tone, that he makes you mad.</p>
  <p>At last, after promising to &ldquo;drop in again, Mr. Brown, whenever you&rsquo;re
    passing,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to call,&rdquo; and thanking
    them for their assurance that they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;be always glad to see
    you,&rdquo; and telling them that you&rsquo;ve spent a very pleasant evening
    and enjoyed yourself, and are awfully sorry you couldn&rsquo;t stay&mdash;you
    get away with Tom.</p>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t say much to each other till you get round the corner and
    down the street a bit, and then for a while your conversation is mostly common-place,
    such as, &ldquo;Well, how have you been getting on all this time, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    all right. How have you been getting on?&rdquo; and so on.</p>
  <p>But presently, and perhaps just as you have made up your mind to chance
    the alleged temperance business and ask Tom in to have a drink, he throws
    a glance up and down the street, nudges your shoulder, says &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; and
    disappears sideways into a pub.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Joe?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    same for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s luck, old man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
    luck.&rdquo; You take a drink, and look over your glass at Tom. Then the
    old smile spreads over his face, and it makes you glad&mdash;you could swear
    to Tom&rsquo;s grin in a hundred years. Then something tickles him&mdash;your
    expression, perhaps, or a recollection of the past&mdash;and he sets down
    his glass on the bar and laughs. Then you laugh. Oh, there&rsquo;s no smile
    like the smile that old mates favour each other with over the tops of their
    glasses when they meet again after years. It is eloquent, because of the
    memories that give it birth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;? Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Oh,
    it all comes back again like a flash. Tom hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit; just
    the same good-hearted, jolly idiot he always was. Old times back again! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just like old times,&rdquo; says Tom, after three or four more drinks.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And so you make a night of it and get uproariously jolly. You get as  &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; as
    Bobby Burns did in the part of Tam O&rsquo;Shanter, and have a better &ldquo;time&rdquo;  than
    any of the times you had in the old days. And you see Tom as nearly home
    in the morning as you dare, and he reckons he&rsquo;ll get it hot from his
    people&mdash;which no doubt he will&mdash; and he explains that they are
    very particular up at home &mdash;church people, you know&mdash;and, of course,
    especially if he&rsquo;s married, it&rsquo;s understood between you that
    you&rsquo;d better not call for him up at home after this&mdash;at least,
    not till things have cooled down a bit. It&rsquo;s always the way. The friend
    of the husband always gets the blame in cases like this. But Tom fixes up
    a yarn to tell them, and you aren&rsquo;t to &ldquo;say anything different&rdquo; in
    case you run against any of them. And he fixes up an appointment with you
    for next Saturday night, and he&rsquo;ll get there if he gets divorced for
    it. But he <i>might</i> have to take the wife out shopping, or one of the
    girls somewhere; and if you see her with him you&rsquo;ve got to lay low,
    and be careful, and wait &mdash;at another hour and place, perhaps, all of
    which is arranged&mdash;  for if she sees you she&rsquo;ll smell a rat at
    once, and he won&rsquo;t be able to get off at all.</p>
  <p>And so, as far as you and Tom are concerned, the &ldquo;old times&rdquo; have
    come back once more.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But, of course (and we almost forgot it), you might chance to fall in love
    with one of Tom&rsquo;s sisters, in which case there would be another and
    a totally different story to tell.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
    Jack Ellis</b></h3>
  <p>Things are going well with you. You have escaped from &ldquo;the track&rdquo;,
    so to speak, and are in a snug, comfortable little billet in the city. Well,
    while doing the block you run against an old mate of other days&mdash;<i>very</i> other
    days&mdash;call him Jack Ellis. Things have gone hard with Jack. He knows
    you at once, but makes no advance towards a greeting; he acts as though he
    thinks you might cut him&mdash;which, of course, if you are a true mate,
    you have not the slightest intention of doing. His coat is yellow and frayed,
    his hat is battered and green, his trousers &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  in various
    places, his linen very cloudy, and his boots burst and innocent of polish.
    You try not to notice these things &mdash;or rather, not to seem to notice
    them&mdash;but you cannot help doing so, and you are afraid he&rsquo;ll notice
    that you see these things, and put a wrong construction on it. How men will
    misunderstand each other! You greet him with more than the necessary enthusiasm.
    In your anxiety to set him at his ease and make him believe that nothing&mdash;not
    even money&mdash;can make a difference in your friendship, you over-act the
    business; and presently you are afraid that he&rsquo;ll notice that too,
    and put a wrong construction on it. You wish that your collar was not so
    clean, nor your clothes so new. Had you known you would meet him, you would
    have put on some old clothes for the occasion.</p>
  <p>You are both embarrassed, but it is <i>you</i> who feel ashamed&mdash; you
    are almost afraid to look at him lest he&rsquo;ll think you are looking at
    his shabbiness. You ask him in to have a drink, but he doesn&rsquo;t respond
    so heartily as you wish, as he did in the old days; he doesn&rsquo;t like
    drinking with anybody when he isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, as he calls
    it&mdash; when he can&rsquo;t shout.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t matter in the old days who held the money so long as there
    was plenty of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the camp. You think of the days when
    Jack stuck to you through thick and thin. You would like to give him money
    now, but he is so proud; he always was; he makes you mad with his beastly
    pride. There wasn&rsquo;t any pride of that sort on the track or in the camp
    in those days; but times have changed&mdash;your lives have drifted too widely
    apart&mdash; you have taken different tracks since then; and Jack, without
    intending to, makes you feel that it is so.</p>
  <p>You have a drink, but it isn&rsquo;t a success; it falls flat, as far as
    Jack is concerned; he won&rsquo;t have another; he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel
    on&rdquo;, and presently he escapes under plea of an engagement, and promises
    to see you again.</p>
  <p>And you wish that the time was come when no one could have more or less
    to spend than another.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;I met an old mate of that description once, and so successfully
    persuaded him out of his beastly pride that he borrowed two pounds off me
    till Monday. I never got it back since, and I want it badly at the present
    time. In future I&rsquo;ll leave old mates with their pride unimpaired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoLarrikins"></a>Two Larrikins</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;orter do something, Ernie. Yer know how I am. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t
    seem to care. Y&rsquo;orter to do something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher slouched at a greater angle to the greasy door-post, and scowled
    under his hat-brim. It was a little, low, frowsy room opening into Jones&rsquo; Alley.
    She sat at the table, sewing&mdash;a thin, sallow girl with weak, colourless
    eyes. She looked as frowsy as her surroundings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go to some of them women, and get fixed
    up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She flicked the end of the table-cloth over some tiny, unfinished articles
    of clothing, and bent to her work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you know very well I haven&rsquo;t got a shilling, Ernie,&rdquo; she
    said, quietly. &ldquo;Where am I to get the money from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who asked yer to get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was silent, with the exasperating silence of a woman who has determined
    to do a thing in spite of all reasons and arguments that may be brought against
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, wot more do yer want?&rdquo; demanded Stowsher, impatiently.</p>
  <p>She bent lower. &ldquo;Couldn't we keep it, Ernie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot next?&rdquo; asked Stowsher, sulkily&mdash;he had half suspected
    what was coming. Then, with an impatient oath, &ldquo;You must be gettin&rsquo; ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She brushed the corner of the cloth further over the little clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t cost anything, Ernie. I&rsquo;d take a pride in
    him, and keep him clean, and dress him like a little lord. He&rsquo;ll be
    different from all the other youngsters. He wouldn&rsquo;t be like those
    dirty, sickly little brats out there. He&rsquo;d be just like you, Ernie;
    I know he would. I&rsquo;ll look after him night and day, and bring him up
    well and strong. We&rsquo;d train his little muscles from the first, Ernie,
    and he&rsquo;d be able to knock &rsquo;em all out when he grew up. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    cost much, and I&rsquo;d work hard and be careful if you&rsquo;d help me.
    And you&rsquo;d be proud of him, too, Ernie&mdash;I know you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher scraped the doorstep with his foot; but whether he was &ldquo;touched&rdquo;,
    or feared hysterics and was wisely silent, was not apparent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first day I met you, Ernie?&rdquo; she asked,
    presently.</p>
  <p>Stowsher regarded her with an uneasy scowl: &ldquo;Well&mdash;wot o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You came into the bar-parlour at the &lsquo;Cricketers&rsquo; Arms&rsquo; and
    caught a push of &rsquo;em chyacking your old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I altered that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you did. You done for three of them, one after another, and
    two was bigger than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! and when the push come up we done for the rest,&rdquo; said
    Stowsher, softening at the recollection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the day you come home and caught the landlord bullying your old
    mother like a dog&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I got three months for that job. But it was worth it!&rdquo; he
    reflected.  &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the old woman might have
    had the knocker to keep away from the lush while I was in quod. . . . But
    wot&rsquo;s all this got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> might barrack and fight for you, some day, Ernie,&rdquo; she
    said softly, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re old and out of form and ain&rsquo;t
    got no push to back you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The thing was becoming decidedly embarrassing to Stowsher; not that he felt
    any delicacy on the subject, but because he hated to be drawn into a conversation
    that might be considered &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, stow that!&rdquo; he said, comfortingly. &ldquo;Git on yer hat,
    and I&rsquo;ll take yer for a trot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose quickly, but restrained herself, recollecting that it was not good
    policy to betray eagerness in response to an invitation from Ernie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to go out like this.
    You can&rsquo;t&mdash; you wouldn&rsquo;t like to take me out the way I am,
    Ernie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Wot rot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fellows would see me, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And . . . wot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They might notice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, wot o&rsquo; that? I want &rsquo;em to. Are yer comin&rsquo; or
    are yer ain&rsquo;t? Fling round now. I can&rsquo;t hang on here all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They walked towards Flagstaff Hill.</p>
  <p>One or two, slouching round a pub. corner, saluted with &ldquo;Wotcher,
    Stowsher!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not too stinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Stowsher. &ldquo;Soak yer
    heads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stowsher&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stick,&rdquo; said one privately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so he orter,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Wish I had the
    chanst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two turned up a steep lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t walk so fast up hill, Ernie; I can&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Liz. I forgot that. Why didn&rsquo;t yer say so before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was contentedly silent most of the way, warned by instinct, after the
    manner of women when they have gained their point by words.</p>
  <p>Once he glanced over his shoulder with a short laugh. &ldquo;Gorblime!&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I nearly thought the little beggar was a-follerin&rsquo; along
    behind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he left her at the door he said: &ldquo;Look here, Liz. &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s
    half a quid. Git what yer want. Let her go. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to graft
    again in the mornin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll come round and see yer to-morrer
    night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still she seemed troubled and uneasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ernie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well. Wot now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it's a girl, Ernie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher flung himself round impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, stow that! Yer always singin&rsquo; out
    before yer hurt. . . . There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; else, ain&rsquo;t there&mdash;while
    the bloomin&rsquo; shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Ernie. Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me? . . . I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Satisfied! Yer don&rsquo;t want the kid to be arst &rsquo;oo &rsquo;is
    father was, do yer? Yer&rsquo;d better come along with me some day this week
    and git spliced. Yer don&rsquo;t want to go frettin&rsquo; or any of that
    funny business while it&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernie! do you really mean it?&rdquo;&mdash;and she threw her
    arms round his neck, and broke down at last.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So-long, Liz. No more funny business now&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had enough
    of it. Keep yer pecker up, old girl. To-morrer night, mind.&rdquo; Then he
    added suddenly: &ldquo;Yer might have known I ain&rsquo;t that sort of a
    bloke&rdquo; &mdash;and left abruptly.</p>
  <p>Liz was very happy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrSmellingscheck"></a>Mr. Smellingscheck</b></h2>
  <p>I met him in a sixpenny restaurant&mdash;&ldquo;All meals, 6d.&mdash;Good
    beds, 1s.&rdquo; That was before sixpenny restaurants rose to a third-class
    position, and became possibly respectable places to live in, through the
    establishment, beneath them, of fourpenny hash-houses (good beds, 6d.), and,
    beneath <i>them</i> again, of <i>three</i>-penny  &ldquo;dining-rooms&mdash;<i>clean</i> beds,
    4d.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were five beds in our apartment, the head of one against the foot
    of the next, and so on round the room, with a space where the door and washstand
    were. I chose the bed the head of which was near the foot of his, because
    he looked like a man who took his bath regularly. I should like, in the interests
    of sentiment, to describe the place as a miserable, filthy, evil-smelling
    garret; but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t. The room was large
    and airy; the floor was scrubbed and the windows cleaned at least once a
    week, and the beds kept fresh and neat, which is more&mdash;a good deal more&mdash; than
    can be said of many genteel private boarding-houses. The lodgers were mostly
    respectable unemployed, and one or two&mdash;fortunate men!&mdash; in work;
    it was the casual boozer, the professional loafer, and the occasional spieler&mdash;the
    one-shilling-bed-men&mdash;  who made the place objectionable, not the hard-working
    people who paid ten pounds a week for the house; and, but for the one-night
    lodgers and the big gilt black-and-red bordered and &ldquo;shaded&rdquo; &ldquo;6d.&rdquo; in
    the window &mdash;which made me glance guiltily up and down the street, like
    a burglar about to do a job, before I went in&mdash;I was pretty comfortable
    there.</p>
  <p>They called him &ldquo;Mr. Smellingscheck&rdquo;, and treated him with a
    peculiar kind of deference, the reason for which they themselves were doubtless
    unable to explain or even understand. The haggard woman who made the beds
    called him &ldquo;Mr. Smell-&rsquo;is-check&rdquo;. Poor fellow! I didn&rsquo;t
    think, by the look of him, that he&rsquo;d smelt his cheque, or anyone else&rsquo;s,
    or that anyone else had smelt his, for many a long day. He was a fat man,
    slow and placid. He looked like a typical monopolist who had unaccountably
    got into a suit of clothes belonging to a Domain unemployed, and hadn&rsquo;t
    noticed, or had entirely forgotten, the circumstance in his business cares&mdash;if
    such a word as care could be connected with such a calm, self-contained nature.
    He wore a suit of cheap slops of some kind of shoddy &ldquo;tweed&rdquo;.
    The coat was too small and the trousers too short, and they were drawn up
    to meet the waistcoat&mdash;which they did with painful difficulty, now and
    then showing, by way of protest, two pairs of brass buttons and the ends
    of the brace-straps; and they seemed to blame the irresponsive waistcoat
    or the wearer for it all. Yet he never gave way to assist them. A pair of
    burst elastic-sides were in full evidence, and a rim of cloudy sock, with
    a hole in it, showed at every step.</p>
  <p>But he put on his clothes and wore them like&mdash;like a gentleman. He
    had two white shirts, and they were both dirty. He&rsquo;d lay them out on
    the bed, turn them over, regard them thoughtfully, choose that which appeared
    to his calm understanding to be the cleaner, and put it on, and wear it until
    it was unmistakably dirtier than the other; then he&rsquo;d wear the other
    till it was dirtier than the first. He managed his three collars the same
    way. His handkerchiefs were washed in the bathroom, and dried, without the
    slightest disguise, in the bedroom. He never hurried in anything. The way
    he cleaned his teeth, shaved, and made his toilet almost transformed the
    place, in my imagination, into a gentleman&rsquo;s dressing-room.</p>
  <p>He talked politics and such things in the abstract&mdash;always in the abstract  &mdash;calmly
    in the abstract. He was an old-fashioned Conservative of the Sir Leicester
    Deadlock style. When he was moved by an extra shower of aggressive democratic
    cant&mdash;which was seldom&mdash; he defended Capital, but only as if it
    needed no defence, and as if its opponents were merely thoughtless, ignorant
    children whom he condescended to set right because of their inexperience
    and for their own good. He stuck calmly to his own order&mdash;the order
    which had dropped him like a foul thing when the bottom dropped out of his
    boom, whatever that was. He never talked of his misfortunes.</p>
  <p>He took his meals at the little greasy table in the dark corner downstairs,
    just as if he were dining at the Exchange. He had a chop&mdash;rather well-done&mdash;and
    a sheet of the <i>Herald</i> for breakfast. He carried two handkerchiefs;
    he used one for a handkerchief and the other for a table-napkin, and sometimes
    folded it absently and laid it on the table. He rose slowly, putting his
    chair back, took down his battered old green hat, and regarded it thoughtfully&mdash;as
    though it had just occurred to him in a calm, casual way that he&rsquo;d
    drop into his hatter&rsquo;s, if he had time, on his way down town, and get
    it blocked, or else send the messenger round with it during business hours.
    He&rsquo;d draw his stick out from behind the next chair, plant it, and,
    if you hadn&rsquo;t quite finished your side of the conversation, stand politely
    waiting until you were done. Then he&rsquo;d look for a suitable reply into
    his hat, put it on, give it a twitch to settle it on his head&mdash;as gentlemen
    do a &ldquo;chimney-pot&rdquo;&mdash;step out into the gangway, turn his
    face to the door, and walk slowly out on to the middle of the pavement&mdash; looking
    more placidly well-to-do than ever. The saying is that clothes make a man,
    but <i>he</i> made his almost respectable just by wearing them. Then he&rsquo;d
    consult his watch&mdash;(he stuck to the watch all through, and it seemed
    a good one&mdash;I often wondered why he didn&rsquo;t pawn it); then he&rsquo;d
    turn slowly, right turn, and look down the street. Then slowly back, left-about
    turn, and take a cool survey in that direction, as if calmly undecided whether
    to take a cab and drive to the Exchange, or (as it was a very fine morning,
    and he had half an hour to spare) walk there and drop in at his club on the
    way. He&rsquo;d conclude to walk. I never saw him go anywhere in particular,
    but he walked and stood as if he could.</p>
  <p>Coming quietly into the room one day, I surprised him sitting at the table
    with his arms lying on it and his face resting on them. I heard something
    like a sob. He rose hastily, and gathered up some papers which were on the
    table; then he turned round, rubbing his forehead and eyes with his forefinger
    and thumb, and told me that he suffered from&mdash;something, I forget the
    name of it, but it was a well-to-do ailment. His manner seemed a bit jolted
    and hurried for a minute or so, and then he was himself again. He told me
    he was leaving for Melbourne next day. He left while I was out, and left
    an envelope downstairs for me. There was nothing in it except a pound note.</p>
  <p>I saw him in Brisbane afterwards, well-dressed, getting out of a cab at
    the entrance of one of the leading hotels. But his manner was no more self-contained
    and well-to-do than it had been in the old sixpenny days&mdash;because it
    couldn&rsquo;t be. We had a well-to-do whisky together, and he talked of
    things in the abstract. He seemed just as if he&rsquo;d met me in the Australia.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ARoughShed"></a>&ldquo;A Rough Shed&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A hot, breathless, blinding sunrise&mdash;the sun having appeared suddenly
    above the ragged edge of the barren scrub like a great disc of molten steel.
    No hint of a morning breeze before it, no sign on earth or sky to show that
    it is morning&mdash;save the position of the sun.</p>
  <p>A clearing in the scrub&mdash;bare as though the surface of the earth were
    ploughed and harrowed, and dusty as the road. Two oblong huts &mdash;one
    for the shearers and one for the rouseabouts&mdash; in about the centre of
    the clearing (as if even the mongrel scrub had shrunk away from them) built
    end-to-end, of weatherboards, and roofed with galvanised iron. Little ventilation;
    no verandah; no attempt to create, artificially, a breath of air through
    the buildings. Unpainted, sordid&mdash;hideous. Outside, heaps of ashes still
    hot and smoking. Close at hand, &ldquo;butcher&rsquo;s shop&rdquo;&mdash;a
    bush and bag breakwind in the dust, under a couple of sheets of iron, with
    offal, grease and clotted blood blackening the surface of the ground about
    it. Greasy, stinking sheepskins hanging everywhere with blood-blotched sides
    out. Grease inches deep in great black patches about the fireplace ends of
    the huts, where wash-up and &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; water is thrown.</p>
  <p>Inside, a rough table on supports driven into the black, greasy ground floor,
    and formed of flooring boards, running on uneven lines the length of the
    hut from within about 6ft. of the fire-place. Lengths of single six-inch
    boards or slabs on each side, supported by the projecting ends of short pieces
    of timber nailed across the legs of the table to serve as seats.</p>
  <p>On each side of the hut runs a rough framework, like the partitions in a
    stable; each compartment battened off to about the size of a manger, and
    containing four bunks, one above the other, on each side&mdash; their ends,
    of course, to the table. Scarcely breathing space anywhere between. Fireplace,
    the full width of the hut in one end, where all the cooking and baking for
    forty or fifty men is done, and where flour, sugar, etc., are kept in open
    bags. Fire, like a very furnace. Buckets of tea and coffee on roasting beds
    of coals and ashes on the hearth. Pile of &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;  on the bare
    black boards at the end of the table. Unspeakable aroma of forty or fifty
    men who have little inclination and less opportunity to wash their skins,
    and who soak some of the grease out of their clothes &mdash;in buckets of
    hot water&mdash;on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. And clinging to all, and
    over all, the smell of the dried, stale yolk of wool &mdash;the stink of
    rams!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a rouseabout of the rouseabouts. I have fallen so far that it
    is beneath me to try to climb to the proud position of &lsquo;ringer&rsquo; of
    the shed. I had that ambition once, when I was the softest of green hands;
    but then I thought I could work out my salvation and go home. I&rsquo;ve
    got used to hell since then. I only get twenty-five shillings a week (less
    station store charges) and tucker here. I have been seven years west of the
    Darling and never shore a sheep. Why don&rsquo;t I learn to shear, and so
    make money? What should I do with more money? Get out of this and go home?
    I would never go home unless I had enough money to keep me for the rest of
    my life, and I&rsquo;ll never make that Out Back. Otherwise, what should
    I do at home? And how should I account for the seven years, if I were to
    go home? Could I describe shed life to them and explain how I lived. They
    think shearing only takes a few days of the year&mdash;at the beginning of
    summer. They&rsquo;d want to know how I lived the rest of the year. Could
    I explain that I &lsquo;jabbed trotters&rsquo; and was a &lsquo;tea-and-sugar
    burglar&rsquo; between sheds. They&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d been a tramp and
    a beggar all the time. Could I explain <i>anything</i> so that they&rsquo;d
    understand? I&rsquo;d have to be lying all the time and would soon be tripped
    up and found out. For, whatever else I have been I was never much of a liar.
    No, I&rsquo;ll never go home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I become momentarily conscious about daylight. The flies on the track
    got me into that habit, I think; they start at day-break&mdash; when the
    mosquitoes give over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook rings a bullock bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook is fire-proof. He is as a fiend from the nethermost sheol
    and needs to be. No man sees him sleep, for he makes bread &mdash;or worse,
    brownie&mdash;at night, and he rings a bullock bell loudly at half-past five
    in the morning to rouse us from our animal torpors. Others, the sheep-ho&rsquo;s
    or the engine-drivers at the shed or wool-wash, call him, if he does sleep.
    They manage it in shifts, somehow, and sleep somewhere, sometime. We haven&rsquo;t
    time to know. The cook rings the bullock bell and yells the time. It was
    the same time five minutes ago&mdash;or a year ago. No time to decide which.
    I dash water over my head and face and slap handfuls on my eyelids &mdash;gummed
    over aching eyes&mdash;still blighted by the yolk o&rsquo; wool&mdash; grey,
    greasy-feeling water from a cut-down kerosene tin which I sneaked from the
    cook and hid under my bunk and had the foresight to refill from the cask
    last night, under cover of warm, still, suffocating darkness. Or was it the
    night before last? Anyhow, it will be sneaked from me to-day, and from the
    crawler who will collar it to-morrow, and &lsquo;touched&rsquo;  and &lsquo;lifted&rsquo; and &lsquo;collared&rsquo; and
    recovered by the cook, and sneaked back again, and cause foul language, and
    fights, maybe, till we &lsquo;cut-out&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; we didn&rsquo;t have sweet dreams of home and mother, gentle
    poet&mdash; nor yet of babbling brooks and sweethearts, and love&rsquo;s
    young dream. We are too dirty and dog-tired when we tumble down, and have
    too little time to sleep it off. We don&rsquo;t want to dream those dreams
    out here&mdash; they&rsquo;d only be nightmares for us, and we&rsquo;d wake
    to remember. We <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> remember here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the edge of the timber a great galvanised-iron shed, nearly all
    roof, coming down to within 6ft. 6in. of the &lsquo;board&rsquo; over the &lsquo;shoots&rsquo;.
    Cloud of red dust in the dead timber behind, going up&mdash;noon-day dust.
    Fence covered with skins; carcases being burned; blue smoke going straight
    up as in noonday. Great glossy (greasy-glossy) black crows &lsquo;flopping&rsquo; around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first syren has gone. We hurry in single files from opposite
    ends of rouseabouts&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts (as the paths happen
    to run to the shed) gulping hot tea or coffee from a pint-pot in one hand
    and biting at a junk of brownie in the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shed of forty hands. Shearers rush the pens and yank out sheep and
    throw them like demons; grip them with their knees, take up machines, jerk
    the strings; and with a rattling whirring roar the great machine-shed starts
    for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go it, you &mdash;&mdash; tigers!&rsquo; yells a tar-boy. &lsquo;Wool
    away!&rsquo; &lsquo;Tar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Sheep Ho!&rsquo; We rush through with
    a whirring roar till breakfast time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We seize our tin plate from the pile, knife and fork from the candle-box,
    and crowd round the camp-oven to jab out lean chops, dry as chips, boiled
    in fat. Chops or curry-and-rice. There is some growling and cursing. We slip
    into our places without removing our hats. There&rsquo;s no time to hunt
    for mislaid hats when the whistle goes. Row of hat brims, level, drawn over
    eyes, or thrust back&mdash;according to characters or temperaments. Thrust
    back denotes a lucky absence of brains, I fancy. Row of forks going up, or
    jabbing, or poised, loaded, waiting for last mouthful to be bolted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We pick up, sweep, tar, sew wounds, catch sheep that break from the
    pens, jump down and pick up those that can&rsquo;t rise at the bottom of
    the shoots, &lsquo;bring-my-combs-from-the-grinder-will-yer,&rsquo;  laugh
    at dirty jokes, and swear&mdash;and, in short, are the &lsquo;will-yer&rsquo; slaves,
    body and soul, of seven, six, five, or four shearers, according to the distance
    from the rolling tables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The shearer on the board at the shed is a demon. He gets so much
    a hundred; we, 25s. a week. He is not supposed, by the rules of the shed,
    the Union, and humanity, to take a sheep out of the pen <i>after</i> the
    bell goes (smoke-ho, meals, or knock-off), but his watch is hanging on the
    post, and he times himself to get so many sheep out of the pen <i>before</i> the
    bell goes, and <i>one more</i>&mdash;the  &lsquo;bell-sheep&rsquo;&mdash;as
    it is ringing. We have to take the last fleece to the table and leave our
    board clean. We go through the day of eight hours in runs of about an hour
    and 20 minutes between smoke-ho&rsquo;s&mdash;from 6 to 6. If the shearers
    shore 200 instead of 100, they&rsquo;d get 2 Pounds a day instead of 1 Pound,
    and we&rsquo;d have twice as much work to do for our 25s. per week. But the
    shearers are racing each other for tallies. And it&rsquo;s no use kicking.
    There is no God here and no Unionism (though we all have tickets). But what
    am I growling about? I&rsquo;ve worked from 6 to 6 with no smoke-ho&rsquo;s
    for half the wages, and food we wouldn&rsquo;t give the sheep-ho dog. It&rsquo;s
    the bush growl, born of heat, flies, and dust. I&rsquo;d growl now if I had
    a thousand a year. We <i>must</i> growl, swear, and some of us drink to d.t.&rsquo;s,
    or go mad sober.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pants and shirts stiff with grease as though a couple of pounds of
    soft black putty were spread on with a painter&rsquo;s knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gentle bard!&mdash;we don&rsquo;t sing at our work. Over the
    whirr and roar and hum all day long, and with iteration that is childish
    and irritating to the intelligent greenhand, float unthinkable adjectives
    and adverbs, addressed to jumbucks, jackaroos, and mates indiscriminately.
    And worse words for the boss over the board&mdash;behind his back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came of a Good Christian Family&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s why
    I went to the Devil. When I came out here I&rsquo;d shrink from the man who
    used foul language. In a short time I used it with the worst. I couldn&rsquo;t
    help it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it. If I went back to a woman&rsquo;s country
    again I wouldn&rsquo;t swear. I&rsquo;d forget this as I would a nightmare.
    That&rsquo;s the way of it. There&rsquo;s something of the larrikin about
    us. We don&rsquo;t exist individually. Off the board, away from the shed
    (and each other) we are quiet&mdash;even gentle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A great-horned ram, in poor condition, but shorn of a heavy fleece,
    picks himself up at the foot of the &lsquo;shoot&rsquo;, and hesitates, as
    if ashamed to go down to the other end where the ewes are. The most ridiculous
    object under Heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tar-boy of fifteen, of the bush, with a mouth so vile that a street-boy,
    same age (up with a shearing uncle), kicks him behind&mdash;having proved
    his superiority with his fists before the shed started. Of which unspeakable
    little fiend the roughest shearer of a rough shed was heard to say, in effect,
    that if he thought there was the slightest possibility of his becoming the
    father of such a boy he&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;take drastic measures to prevent
    the possibility of his becoming a proud parent at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twice a day the cooks and their familiars carry buckets of oatmeal-water
    and tea to the shed, two each on a yoke. We cry, &lsquo;Where are you coming
    to, my pretty maids?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In ten minutes the surfaces of the buckets are black with flies.
    We have given over trying to keep them clear. We stir the living cream aside
    with the bottoms of the pints, and guzzle gallons, and sweat it out again.
    Occasionally a shearer pauses and throws the perspiration from his forehead
    in a rain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shearers live in such a greedy rush of excitement that often a strong
    man will, at a prick of the shears, fall in a death-like faint on the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hate the Boss-of-the-Board as the shearers&rsquo; &lsquo;slushy&rsquo; hates
    the shearers&rsquo; cook. I don&rsquo;t know why. He&rsquo;s a very fair
    boss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He refused to put on a traveller yesterday, and the traveller knocked
    him down. He walked into the shed this morning with his hat back and thumbs
    in waistcoat&mdash;a tribute to man&rsquo;s weakness. He threatened to dismiss
    the traveller&rsquo;s mate, a bigger man, for rough shearing&mdash;a tribute
    to man&rsquo;s strength. The shearer said nothing. We hate the boss because
    he <i>is</i> boss, but we respect him because he is a strong man. He is as
    hard up as any of us, I hear, and has a sick wife and a large, small family
    in Melbourne. God judge us all!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a gambling-school here, headed by the shearers&rsquo; cook.
    After tea they head-&rsquo;em, and advance cheques are passed from hand to
    hand, and thrown in the dust until they are black. When it&rsquo;s too dark
    to see with nose to the ground, they go inside and gamble with cards. Sometimes
    they start on Saturday afternoon, heading &rsquo;em till dark, play cards
    all night, start again heading &rsquo;em Sunday afternoon, play cards all
    Sunday night, and sleep themselves sane on Monday, or go to work ghastly&mdash;like
    dead men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cry of &lsquo;Fight&rsquo;; we all rush out. But there isn&rsquo;t
    much fighting. Afraid of murdering each other. I&rsquo;m beginning to think
    that most bush crime is due to irritation born of dust, heat, and flies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The smothering atmosphere shudders when the sun goes down. We call
    it the sunset breeze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saturday night or Sunday we&rsquo;re invited into the shearers&rsquo; hut.
    There are songs that are not hymns and recitations and speeches that are
    not prayers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last Sunday night: Slush lamps at long intervals on table. Men playing
    cards, sewing on patches&mdash;(nearly all smoking)&mdash; some writing,
    and the rest reading Deadwood Dick. At one end of the table a Christian Endeavourer
    endeavouring; at the other a cockney Jew, from the hawker&rsquo;s boat, trying
    to sell rotten clothes. In response to complaints, direct and not chosen
    generally for Sunday, the shearers&rsquo;  rep. requests both apostles to
    shut up or leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be expected to take the Christian and leave the
    Jew, any more than he could take the Jew and leave the Christian. We are
    just amongst ourselves in our hell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fiddle at the end of rouseabouts&rsquo; hut. Voice of Jackeroo, from
    upper bunk with apologetic oaths: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake chuck that

  <p>&ldquo;A lost soul laughs (mine) and dreadful night smothers us.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="PayableGold"></a>Payable Gold</b></h2>
  <p>Among the crowds who left the Victorian side for New South Wales about the
    time Gulgong broke out was an old Ballarat digger named Peter McKenzie. He
    had married and retired from the mining some years previously and had made
    a home for himself and family at the village of St. Kilda, near Melbourne;
    but, as was often the case with old diggers, the gold fever never left him,
    and when the fields of New South Wales began to blaze he mortgaged his little
    property in order to raise funds for another campaign, leaving sufficient
    behind him to keep his wife and family in comfort for a year or so.</p>
  <p>As he often remarked, his position was now very different from what it had
    been in the old days when he first arrived from Scotland, in the height of
    the excitement following on the great discovery. He was a young man then
    with only himself to look out for, but now that he was getting old and had
    a family to provide for he had staked too much on this venture to lose. His
    position did certainly look like a forlorn hope, but he never seemed to think
    so.</p>
  <p>Peter must have been very lonely and low-spirited at times. A young or unmarried
    man can form new ties, and even make new sweethearts if necessary, but Peter&rsquo;s
    heart was with his wife and little ones at home, and they were mortgaged,
    as it were, to Dame Fortune. Peter had to lift this mortgage off.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless he was always cheerful, even at the worst of times, and his
    straight grey beard and scrubby brown hair encircled a smile which appeared
    to be a fixture. He had to make an effort in order to look grave, such as
    some men do when they want to force a smile.</p>
  <p>It was rumoured that Peter had made a vow never to return home until he
    could take sufficient wealth to make his all-important family comfortable,
    or, at least, to raise the mortgage from the property, for the sacrifice
    of which to his mad gold fever he never forgave himself. But this was one
    of the few things which Peter kept to himself.</p>
  <p>The fact that he had a wife and children at St. Kilda was well known to
    all the diggers. They had to know it, and if they did not know the age, complexion,
    history and peculiarities of every child and of the &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; it
    was not Peter&rsquo;s fault.</p>
  <p>He would cross over to our place and talk to the mother for hours about
    his wife and children. And nothing pleased him better than to discover peculiarities
    in us children wherein we resembled his own. It pleased us also for mercenary
    reasons.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same with my old woman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just the same with my youngsters,&rdquo;  Peter would exclaim boisterously,
    for he looked upon any little similarity between the two families as a remarkable
    coincidence. He liked us all, and was always very kind to us, often standing
    between our backs and the rod that spoils the child&mdash;that is, I mean,
    if it isn&rsquo;t used. I was very short-tempered, but this failing was more
    than condoned by the fact that Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;eldest&rdquo; was given
    that way also. Mother&rsquo;s second son was very good-natured; so was Peter&rsquo;s
    third. Her &ldquo;third&rdquo; had a great aversion for any duty that threatened
    to increase his muscles; so had Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;second&rdquo;. Our baby
    was very fat and heavy and was given to sucking her own thumb vigorously,
    and, according to the latest bulletins from home, it was just the same with
    Peter&rsquo;s  &ldquo;last&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>I think we knew more about Peter&rsquo;s family than we did about our own.
    Although we had never seen them, we were as familiar with their features
    as the photographer&rsquo;s art could make us, and always knew their domestic
    history up to the date of the last mail.</p>
  <p>We became interested in the McKenzie family. Instead of getting bored by
    them as some people were, we were always as much pleased when Peter got a
    letter from home as he was himself, and if a mail were missed, which seldom
    happened&mdash;we almost shared his disappointment and anxiety. Should one
    of the youngsters be ill, we would be quite uneasy, on Peter&rsquo;s account,
    until the arrival of a later bulletin removed his anxiety, and ours.</p>
  <p>It must have been the glorious power of a big true heart that gained for
    Peter the goodwill and sympathy of all who knew him.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s smile had a peculiar fascination for us children. We would
    stand by his pointing forge when he&rsquo;d be sharpening picks in the early
    morning, and watch his face for five minutes at a time, wondering sometimes
    whether he was always <i>smiling inside</i>, or whether the smile went on
    externally irrespective of any variation in Peter&rsquo;s condition of mind.</p>
  <p>I think it was the latter case, for often when he had received bad news
    from home we have heard his voice quaver with anxiety, while the old smile
    played on his round, brown features just the same.</p>
  <p>Little Nelse (one of those queer old-man children who seem to come into
    the world by mistake, and who seldom stay long) used to say that Peter &ldquo;cried
    inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Once, on Gulgong, when he attended the funeral of an old Ballarat mate,
    a stranger who had been watching his face curiously remarked that McKenzie
    seemed as pleased as though the dead digger had bequeathed him a fortune.
    But the stranger had soon reason to alter his opinion, for when another old
    mate began in a tremulous voice to repeat the words &ldquo;Ashes to ashes,
    an&rsquo; dust to dust,&rdquo; two big tears suddenly burst from Peter&rsquo;s
    eyes, and hurried down to get entrapped in his beard.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s goldmining ventures were not successful. He sank three duffers
    in succession on Gulgong, and the fourth shaft, after paying expenses, left
    a little over a hundred to each party, and Peter had to send the bulk of
    his share home. He lived in a tent (or in a hut when he could get one) after
    the manner of diggers, and he &ldquo;did for himself&rdquo;, even to washing
    his own clothes. He never drank nor &ldquo;played&rdquo;, and he took little
    enjoyment of any kind, yet there was not a digger on the field who would
    dream of calling old Peter McKenzie &ldquo;a mean man&rdquo;. He lived, as
    we know from our own observations, in a most frugal manner. He always tried
    to hide this, and took care to have plenty of good things for us when he
    invited us to his hut; but children&rsquo;s eyes are sharp. Some said that
    Peter half-starved himself, but I don&rsquo;t think his family ever knew,
    unless he told them so afterwards.</p>
  <p>Ah, well! the years go over. Peter was now three years from home, and he
    and Fortune were enemies still. Letters came by the mail, full of little
    home troubles and prayers for Peter&rsquo;s return, and letters went back
    by the mail, always hopeful, always cheerful. Peter never gave up. When everything
    else failed he would work by the day (a sad thing for a digger), and he was
    even known to do a job of fencing until such time as he could get a few pounds
    and a small party together to sink another shaft.</p>
  <p>Talk about the heroic struggles of early explorers in a hostile country;
    but for dogged determination and courage in the face of poverty, illness,
    and distance, commend me to the old-time digger&mdash;the truest soldier
    Hope ever had!</p>
  <p>In the fourth year of his struggle Peter met with a terrible disappointment.
    His party put down a shaft called the Forlorn Hope near Happy Valley, and
    after a few weeks&rsquo; fruitless driving his mates jibbed on it. Peter
    had his own opinion about the ground&mdash;an old digger&rsquo;s opinion,
    and he used every argument in his power to induce his mates to put a few
    days&rsquo; more work in the claim. In vain he pointed out that the quality
    of the wash and the dip of the bottom exactly resembled that of the &ldquo;Brown
    Snake&rdquo;, a rich Victorian claim. In vain he argued that in the case
    of the abovementioned claim, not a colour could be got until the payable
    gold was actually reached. Home Rule and The Canadian and that cluster of
    fields were going ahead, and his party were eager to shift. They remained
    obstinate, and at last, half-convinced against his opinion, Peter left with
    them to sink the &ldquo;Iawatha&rdquo;, in Log Paddock, which turned out
    a rank duffer&mdash; not even paying its own expenses.</p>
  <p>A party of Italians entered the old claim and, after driving it a few feet
    further, made their fortune.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We all noticed the change in Peter McKenzie when he came to &ldquo;Log Paddock&rdquo;,
    whither we had shifted before him. The old smile still flickered, but he
    had learned to &ldquo;look&rdquo; grave for an hour at a time without much
    effort. He was never quite the same after the affair of Forlorn Hope, and
    I often think how he must have &ldquo;cried&rdquo;  sometimes &ldquo;inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>However, he still read us letters from home, and came and smoked in the
    evening by our kitchen-fire. He showed us some new portraits of his family
    which he had received by a late mail, but something gave me the impression
    that the portraits made him uneasy. He had them in his possession for nearly
    a week before showing them to us, and to the best of our knowledge he never
    showed them to anybody else. Perhaps they reminded him of the flight of time&mdash;perhaps
    he would have preferred his children to remain just as he left them until
    he returned.</p>
  <p>But stay! there was one portrait that seemed to give Peter infinite pleasure.
    It was the picture of a chubby infant of about three years or more. It was
    a fine-looking child taken in a sitting position on a cushion, and arrayed
    in a very short shirt. On its fat, soft, white face, which was only a few
    inches above the ten very podgy toes, was a smile something like Peter&rsquo;s.
    Peter was never tired of looking at and showing the picture of his child&mdash;the
    child he had never seen. Perhaps he cherished a wild dream of making his
    fortune and returning home before <i>that</i> child grew up.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>McKenzie and party were sinking a shaft at the upper end of Log Paddock,
    generally called &ldquo;The other end&rdquo;. We were at the lower end.</p>
  <p>One day Peter came down from &ldquo;the other end&rdquo; and told us that
    his party expected to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; during the following week, and
    if they got no encouragement from the wash they intended to go prospecting
    at the &ldquo;Happy Thought&rdquo;, near Specimen Flat.</p>
  <p>The shaft in Log Paddock was christened &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo;. Towards
    the end of the week we heard that the wash in the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; was showing
    good colours.</p>
  <p>Later came the news that &ldquo;McKenzie and party&rdquo; had bottomed on
    payable gold, and the red flag floated over the shaft. Long before the first
    load of dirt reached the puddling machine on the creek, the news was all
    round the diggings. The &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo; was a &ldquo;Golden
    Hole&rdquo;!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We will not forget the day when Peter went home. He hurried down in the
    morning to have an hour or so with us before Cobb and Co. went by. He told
    us all about his little cottage by the bay at St. Kilda. He had never spoken
    of it before, probably because of the mortgage. He told us how it faced the
    bay&mdash;how many rooms it had, how much flower garden, and how on a clear
    day he could see from the window all the ships that came up to the Yarra,
    and how with a good telescope he could even distinguish the faces of the
    passengers on the big ocean liners.</p>
  <p>And then, when the mother&rsquo;s back was turned, he hustled us children
    round the corner, and surreptitiously slipped a sovereign into each of our
    dirty hands, making great pantomimic show for silence, for the mother was
    very independent.</p>
  <p>And when we saw the last of Peter&rsquo;s face setting like a good-humoured
    sun on the top of Cobb and Co.&rsquo;s, a great feeling of discontent and
    loneliness came over all our hearts. Little Nelse, who had been Peter&rsquo;s
    favourite, went round behind the pig-stye, where none might disturb him,
    and sat down on the projecting end of a trough to &ldquo;have a cry&rdquo;,
    in his usual methodical manner. But old &ldquo;Alligator Desolation&rdquo;,
    the dog, had suspicions of what was up, and, hearing the sobs, went round
    to offer whatever consolation appertained to a damp and dirty nose and a
    pair of ludicrously doleful yellow eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOversightofSteelmans"></a>An Oversight of Steelman&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman and Smith&mdash;professional wanderers&mdash;were making back for
    Wellington, down through the wide and rather dreary-looking Hutt Valley.
    They were broke. They carried their few remaining belongings in two skimpy,
    amateurish-looking swags. Steelman had fourpence left. They were very tired
    and very thirsty&mdash;at least Steelman was, and he answered for both. It
    was Smith&rsquo;s policy to feel and think just exactly as Steelman did.
    Said Steelman:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The landlord of the next pub. is not a bad sort. I won&rsquo;t go
    in&mdash; he might remember me. You&rsquo;d best go in. You&rsquo;ve been
    tramping round in the Wairarapa district for the last six months, looking
    for work. You&rsquo;re going back to Wellington now, to try and get on the
    new corporation works just being started there&mdash;the sewage works. You
    think you&rsquo;ve got a show. You&rsquo;ve got some mates in Wellington,
    and they&rsquo;re looking out for a chance for you. You did get a job last
    week on a sawmill at Silverstream, and the boss sacked you after three days
    and wouldn&rsquo;t pay you a penny. That&rsquo;s just his way. I know him&mdash; at
    least a mate of mine does. I&rsquo;ve heard of him often enough. His name&rsquo;s
    Cowman. Don&rsquo;t forget the name, whatever you do. The landlord here hates
    him like poison; he&rsquo;ll sympathize with you. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got
    a mate with you; he&rsquo;s gone ahead&mdash;took a short cut across the
    paddocks. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got only fourpence left, and see if he&rsquo;ll
    give you a drop in a bottle. Says you: &lsquo;Well, boss, the fact is we&rsquo;ve
    only got fourpence, but you might let us have a drop in a bottle&rsquo;;
    and very likely he&rsquo;ll stand you a couple of pints in a gin-bottle.
    You can fling the coppers on the counter, but the chances are he won&rsquo;t
    take them. He&rsquo;s not a bad sort. Beer&rsquo;s fourpence a pint out here,
    same&rsquo;s in Wellington. See that gin-bottle lying there by the stump;
    get it and we&rsquo;ll take it down to the river with us and rinse it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the river bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take my swag&mdash;it looks more decent,&rdquo; said
    Steelman. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do: we&rsquo;ll
    undo both swags and make them into one&mdash;one decent swag, and I&rsquo;ll
    cut round through the lanes and wait for you on the road ahead of the pub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rolled up the swag with much care and deliberation and considerable judgment.
    He fastened Smith&rsquo;s belt round one end of it, and the handkerchiefs
    round the other, and made a towel serve as a shoulder-strap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or
    a cover of some sort. But never mind. The landlord&rsquo;s an old Australian
    bushman, now I come to think of it; the swag looks Australian enough, and
    it might appeal to his feelings, you know&mdash;bring up old recollections.
    But you&rsquo;d best not say you come from Australia, because he&rsquo;s
    been there, and he&rsquo;d soon trip you up. He might have been where you&rsquo;ve
    been, you know, so don&rsquo;t try to do too much. You always do mug-up the
    business when you try to do more than I tell you. You might tell him your
    mate came from Australia&mdash;but no, he might want you to bring me in.
    Better stick to Maoriland. I don&rsquo;t believe in too much ornamentation.
    Plain lies are the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the landlord&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that. You don&rsquo;t want to know that. You are not supposed
    to know him at all. It might look suspicious if you called him by his name,
    and lead to awkward questions; then you&rsquo;d be sure to put your foot
    into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could say I read it over the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh. Travellers don&rsquo;t read the names over the doors, when
    they go into pubs. You&rsquo;re an entire stranger to him. Call him &lsquo;Boss&rsquo;.
    Say &lsquo;Good-day, Boss,&rsquo;  when you go in, and swing down your swag
    as if you&rsquo;re used to it. Ease it down like this. Then straighten yourself
    up, stick your hat back, and wipe your forehead, and try to look as hearty
    and independent and cheerful as you possibly can. Curse the Government, and
    say the country&rsquo;s done. It don&rsquo;t matter what Government it is,
    for he&rsquo;s always against it. I never knew a real Australian that wasn&rsquo;t.
    Say that you&rsquo;re thinking about trying to get over to Australia, and
    then listen to him talking about it&mdash; and try to look interested, too!
    Get that damned stone-deaf expression off your face! . . . He&rsquo;ll run
    Australia down most likely (I never knew an Other-sider that had settled
    down over here who didn&rsquo;t). But don&rsquo;t you make any mistake and
    agree with him, because, although successful Australians over here like to
    run their own country down, there&rsquo;s very few of them that care to hear
    anybody else do it. . . . Don&rsquo;t come away as soon as you get your beer.
    Stay and listen to him for a while, as if you&rsquo;re interested in his
    yarning, and give him time to put you on to a job, or offer you one. Give
    him a chance to ask how you and your mate are off for tobacco or tucker.
    Like as not he&rsquo;ll sling you half a crown when you come away&mdash;that
    is, if you work it all right. Now try to think of something to say to him,
    and make yourself a bit interesting&mdash;if you possibly can. Tell him about
    the fight we saw back at the pub. the other day. He might know some of the
    chaps. This is a sleepy hole, and there ain&rsquo;t much news knocking round.
    . . . I wish I could go in myself, but he&rsquo;s sure to remember <i>me</i>.
    I&rsquo;m afraid he got left the last time I stayed there (so did one or
    two others); and, besides, I came away without saying good-bye to him, and
    he might feel a bit sore about it. That&rsquo;s the worst of travelling on
    the old road. Come on now, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet I&rsquo;ll get a quart,&rdquo; said Smith, brightening up, &ldquo;and
    some tucker for it to wash down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stoush
    you. Never mind the bottle; fling it away. It doesn&rsquo;t look well for
    a traveller to go into a pub. with an empty bottle in his hand. A real swagman
    never does. It looks much better to come out with a couple of full ones.
    That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do. Now, come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman turned off into a lane, cut across the paddocks to the road again,
    and waited for Smith. He hadn&rsquo;t long to wait.</p>
  <p>Smith went on towards the public-house, rehearsing his part as he walked&mdash;  repeating
    his &ldquo;lines&rdquo; to himself, so as to be sure of remembering all that
    Steelman had told him to say to the landlord, and adding, with what he considered
    appropriate gestures, some fancy touches of his own, which he determined
    to throw in in spite of Steelman&rsquo;s advice and warning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell him (this)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him (that). Well, look here, boss,
    I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re pretty right and I quite agree with you as far
    as that&rsquo;s concerned, but,&rdquo; &amp;c. And so, murmuring and mumbling
    to himself, Smith reached the hotel. The day was late, and the bar was small,
    and low, and dark. Smith walked in with all the assurance he could muster,
    eased down his swag in a corner in what he no doubt considered the true professional
    style, and, swinging round to the bar, said in a loud voice which he intended
    to be cheerful, independent, and hearty:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;. It was about the hardest-faced
    old woman that Smith had ever seen. The pub. had changed hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; stammered poor Smith.</p>
  <p>It was a knock-down blow for Smith. He couldn&rsquo;t come to time. He and
    Steelman had had a landlord in their minds all the time, and laid their plans
    accordingly; the possibility of having a she &mdash;and one like this&mdash;to
    deal with never entered into their calculations. Smith had no time to reorganise,
    even if he had had the brains to do so, without the assistance of his mate&rsquo;s
    knowledge of human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>Painful pause. She sized him up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus&mdash;I&mdash;the fact is&mdash;will you give me a bottle
    of beer for fourpence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;&mdash;. The fact is, we&rsquo;ve only got fourpence
    left, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate outside, and you might let us have
    a quart or so, in a bottle, for that. I mean&mdash;anyway, you might let
    us have a pint. I&rsquo;m very sorry to bother you, missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she couldn&rsquo;t do it. No. Certainly not. Decidedly not! All her
    drinks were sixpence. She had her license to pay, and the rent, and a family
    to keep. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay out there&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t worth her
    while. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay the cost of carting the liquor out, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus,&rdquo; poor Smith blurted out at last, in sheer desperation,  &ldquo;give
    me what you can in a bottle for this. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate
    outside.&rdquo; And he put the four coppers on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got a bottle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I give you one, will you bring it back? You can&rsquo;t expect
    me to give you a bottle as well as a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; I&rsquo;ll bring it back directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reached out a bottle from under the bar, and very deliberately measured
    out a little over a pint and poured it into the bottle, which she handed
    to Smith without a cork.</p>
  <p>Smith went his way without rejoicing. It struck him forcibly that he should
    have saved the money until they reached Petone, or the city, where Steelman
    would be sure to get a decent drink. But how was he to know? He had chanced
    it, and lost; Steelman might have done the same. What troubled Smith most
    was the thought of what Steelman would say; he already heard him, in imagination,
    saying: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mug, Smith&mdash; Smith, you <i>are</i> a mug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman didn&rsquo;t say much. He was prepared for the worst by seeing
    Smith come along so soon. He listened to his story with an air of gentle
    sadness, even as a stern father might listen to the voluntary confession
    of a wayward child; then he held the bottle up to the fading light of departing
    day, looked through it (the bottle), and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t worth while dividing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith&rsquo;s heart shot right down through a hole in the sole of his left
    boot into the hard road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, handing him the bottle, &ldquo;drink
    it, old man; you want it. It wasn&rsquo;t altogether your fault; it was an
    oversight of mine. I didn&rsquo;t bargain for a woman of that kind, and,
    of course, <i>you</i> couldn&rsquo;t be expected to think of it. Drink it!
    Drink it down, Smith. I&rsquo;ll manage to work the oracle before this night
    is out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith was forced to believe his ears, and, recovering from his surprise,
    drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promised to take back the bottle,&rdquo; he said, with the ghost
    of a smile.</p>
  <p>Steelman took the bottle by the neck and broke it on the fence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Smith; I&rsquo;ll carry the swag for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they tramped on in the gathering starlight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HowSteelmantoldhisStory"></a>How Steelman told his Story</b></h2>
  <p>It was Steelman&rsquo;s humour, in some of his moods, to take Smith into
    his confidence, as some old bushmen do their dogs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly as good as an intelligent sheep-dog to talk to,
    Smith&mdash;  when a man gets tired of thinking to himself and wants a relief.
    You&rsquo;re a bit of a mug and a good deal of an idiot, and the chances
    are that you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m driving at half the time&mdash; that&rsquo;s
    the main reason why I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you. You ought to consider
    yourself honoured; it ain&rsquo;t every man I take into my confidence, even
    that far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner talk to you&mdash;or a stump&mdash;any day than
    to one of those silent, suspicious, self-contained, worldly-wise chaps that
    listen to everything you say&mdash;sense and rubbish alike&mdash;as if you
    were trying to get them to take shares in a mine. I drop the man who listens
    to me all the time and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get bored. He isn&rsquo;t safe.
    He isn&rsquo;t to be trusted. He mostly wants to grind his axe against yours,
    and there&rsquo;s too little profit for me where there are two axes to grind,
    and no stone&mdash;though I&rsquo;d manage it once, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are several ways. Either you join forces, for instance, and
    find a grindstone&mdash;or make one of the other man&rsquo;s axe. But the
    last way is too slow, and, as I said, takes too much brain-work&mdash; besides,
    it doesn&rsquo;t pay. It might satisfy your vanity or pride, but I&rsquo;ve
    got none. I had once, when I was younger, but it&mdash;well, it nearly killed
    me, so I dropped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can mostly trust the man who wants to talk more than you do;
    he&rsquo;ll make a safe mate&mdash;or a good grindstone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat blinking at the fire, with
    the puzzled expression of a woman pondering over a life-question or the trimming
    of a hat. Steelman took his chin in his hand and watched Smith thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I say, Steely,&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, suddenly, sitting
    up and scratching his head and blinking harder than ever&mdash;&ldquo;wha&mdash;what
    am I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I the axe or the grindstone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your brain seems in extra good working order to-night, Smith.
    Well, you turn the grindstone and I grind.&rdquo; Smith settled. &ldquo;If
    you could grind better than I, I&rsquo;d turn the stone and let <i>you</i> grind,
    I&rsquo;d never go against the interests of the firm&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair
    enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; admitted Smith; &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I. Now, Smith, we&rsquo;ve got along all right together for
    years, off and on, but you never know what might happen. I might stop breathing,
    for instance&mdash;and so might you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith began to look alarmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poetical justice might overtake one or both of us&mdash;such things
    have happened before, though not often. Or, say, misfortune or death might
    mistake us for honest, hard-working mugs with big families to keep, and cut
    us off in the bloom of all our wisdom. You might get into trouble, and, in
    that case, I&rsquo;d be bound to leave you there, on principle; or I might
    get into trouble, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have the brains to get me out&mdash; though
    I know you&rsquo;d be mug enough to try. I might make a rise and cut you,
    or you might be misled into showing some spirit, and clear out after I&rsquo;d
    stoushed you for it. You might get tired of me calling you a mug, and bossing
    you and making a tool or convenience of you, you know. You might go in for
    honest graft (you were always a bit weak-minded) and then I&rsquo;d have
    to wash my hands of you (unless you agreed to keep me) for an irreclaimable
    mug. Or it might suit me to become a respected and worthy fellow townsman,
    and then, if you came within ten miles of me or hinted that you ever knew
    me, I&rsquo;d have you up for vagrancy, or soliciting alms, or attempting
    to levy blackmail. I&rsquo;d have to fix you&mdash;so I give you fair warning.
    Or we might get into some desperate fix (and it needn&rsquo;t be very desperate,
    either) when I&rsquo;d be obliged to sacrifice you for my own personal safety,
    comfort, and convenience. Hundreds of things might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, we&rsquo;ve been at large together for some years,
    and I&rsquo;ve found you sober, trustworthy, and honest; so, in case we do
    part &mdash;as we will sooner or later&mdash;and you survive, I&rsquo;ll
    give you some advice from my own experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place: If you ever happen to get born again &mdash;and
    it wouldn&rsquo;t do you much harm&mdash;get born with the strength of a
    bullock and the hide of one as well, and a swelled head, and no brains&mdash; at
    least no more brains than you&rsquo;ve got now. I was born with a skin like
    tissue-paper, and brains; also a heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get born without relatives, if you can: if you can&rsquo;t help it,
    clear out on your own just as soon after you&rsquo;re born as you possibly
    can. I hung on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you have relations, and feel inclined to help them any time when
    you&rsquo;re flush (and there&rsquo;s no telling what a weak-minded man like
    you might take it into his head to do)&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. They&rsquo;ll
    get a down on you if you do. It only causes family troubles and bitterness.
    There&rsquo;s no dislike like that of a dependant. You&rsquo;ll get neither
    gratitude nor civility in the end, and be lucky if you escape with a character.
    (You&rsquo;ve got <i>no</i> character, Smith; I&rsquo;m only just supposing
    you have.) There&rsquo;s no hatred too bitter for, and nothing too bad to
    be said of, the mug who turns. The worst yarns about a man are generally
    started by his own tribe, and the world believes them at once on that very
    account. Well, the first thing to do in life is to escape from your friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you ever go to work&mdash;and miracles have happened before&mdash; no
    matter what your wages are, or how you are treated, you can take it for granted
    that you&rsquo;re sweated; act on that to the best of your ability, or you&rsquo;ll
    never rise in the world. If you go to see a show on the nod you&rsquo;ll
    be found a comfortable seat in a good place; but if you pay the chances are
    the ticket clerk will tell you a lie, and you&rsquo;ll have to hustle for
    standing room. The man that doesn&rsquo;t ante gets the best of this world;
    anything he&rsquo;ll stand is good enough for the man that pays. If you try
    to be too sharp you&rsquo;ll get into gaol sooner or later; if you try to
    be too honest the chances are that the bailiff will get into your house&mdash;if
    you have one&mdash;and make a holy show of you before the neighbours. The
    honest softy is more often mistaken for a swindler, and accused of being
    one, than the out-and-out scamp; and the man that tells the truth too much
    is set down as an irreclaimable liar. But most of the time crow low and roost
    high, for it&rsquo;s a funny world, and you never know what might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you get married (and there&rsquo;s no accounting for a woman&rsquo;s
    taste) be as bad as you like, and then moderately good, and your wife will
    love you. If you&rsquo;re bad all the time she can&rsquo;t stand it for ever,
    and if you&rsquo;re good all the time she&rsquo;ll naturally treat you with
    contempt. Never explain what you&rsquo;re going to do, and don&rsquo;t explain
    afterwards, if you can help it. If you find yourself between two stools,
    strike hard for your own self, Smith&mdash;strike hard, and you&rsquo;ll
    be respected more than if you fought for all the world. Generosity isn&rsquo;t
    understood nowadays, and what the people don&rsquo;t understand is either &lsquo;mad&rsquo; or &lsquo;cronk&rsquo;.
    Failure has no case, and you can&rsquo;t build one for it. . . . I started
    out in life very young&mdash;and very soft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to tell me your story, Steely,&rdquo; remarked
    Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman smiled sadly.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><a name="OvertheSliprails"></a>Over the Sliprails </h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShantyKeepersWife"></a>The Shanty-Keeper&rsquo;s
      Wife</b></h2>
  <p>There were about a dozen of us jammed into the coach, on the box seat and
    hanging on to the roof and tailboard as best we could. We were shearers,
    bagmen, agents, a squatter, a cockatoo, the usual joker&mdash;and one or
    two professional spielers, perhaps. We were tired and stiff and nearly frozen&mdash;too
    cold to talk and too irritable to risk the inevitable argument which an interchange
    of ideas would have led up to. We had been looking forward for hours, it
    seemed, to the pub where we were to change horses. For the last hour or two
    all that our united efforts had been able to get out of the driver was a
    grunt to the effect that it was &ldquo;&rsquo;bout a couple o&rsquo; miles.&rdquo; Then
    he said, or grunted, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t fur now,&rdquo; a couple
    of times, and refused to commit himself any further; he seemed grumpy about
    having committed himself that far.</p>
  <p>He was one of those men who take everything in dead earnest; who regard
    any expression of ideas outside their own sphere of life as trivial, or,
    indeed, if addressed directly to them, as offensive; who, in fact, are darkly
    suspicious of anything in the shape of a joke or laugh on the part of an
    outsider in their own particular dust-hole. He seemed to be always thinking,
    and thinking a lot; when his hands were not both engaged, he would tilt his
    hat forward and scratch the base of his skull with his little finger, and
    let his jaw hang. But his intellectual powers were mostly concentrated on
    a doubtful swingle-tree, a misfitting collar, or that there bay or piebald
    (on the off or near side) with the sore shoulder.</p>
  <p>Casual letters or papers, to be delivered on the road, were matters which
    troubled him vaguely, but constantly&mdash;like the abstract ideas of his
    passengers.</p>
  <p>The joker of our party was a humourist of the dry order, and had been slyly
    taking rises out of the driver for the last two or three stages. But the
    driver only brooded. He wasn&rsquo;t the one to tell you straight if you
    offended him, or if he fancied you offended him, and thus gain your respect,
    or prevent a misunderstanding which would result in life-long enmity. He
    might meet you in after years when you had forgotten all about your trespass&mdash;if
    indeed you had ever been conscious of it&mdash;and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; you
    unexpectedly on the ear.</p>
  <p>Also you might regard him as your friend, on occasion, and yet he would
    stand by and hear a perfect stranger tell you the most outrageous lies, to
    your hurt, and know that the stranger was telling lies, and never put you
    up to it. It would never enter his head to do so. It wouldn&rsquo;t be any
    affair of his&mdash;only an abstract question.</p>
  <p>It grew darker and colder. The rain came as if the frozen south were spitting
    at your face and neck and hands, and our feet grew as big as camel&rsquo;s,
    and went dead, and we might as well have stamped the footboards with wooden
    legs for all the feeling we got into ours. But they were more comfortable
    that way, for the toes didn&rsquo;t curl up and pain so much, nor did our
    corns stick out so hard against the leather, and shoot.</p>
  <p>We looked out eagerly for some clearing, or fence, or light&mdash;some sign
    of the shanty where we were to change horses&mdash;but there was nothing
    save blackness all round. The long, straight, cleared road was no longer
    relieved by the ghostly patch of light, far ahead, where the bordering tree-walls
    came together in perspective and framed the ether. We were down in the bed
    of the bush.</p>
  <p>We pictured a haven of rest with a suspended lamp burning in the frosty
    air outside and a big log fire in a cosy parlour off the bar, and a long
    table set for supper. But this is a land of contradictions; wayside shanties
    turn up unexpectedly and in the most unreasonable places, and are, as likely
    as not, prepared for a banquet when you are not hungry and can&rsquo;t wait,
    and as cold and dark as a bushman&rsquo;s grave when you are and can.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the driver said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re there now.&rdquo; He said this
    as if he had driven us to the scaffold to be hanged, and was fiercely glad
    that he&rsquo;d got us there safely at last. We looked but saw nothing; then
    a light appeared ahead and seemed to come towards us; and presently we saw
    that it was a lantern held up by a man in a slouch hat, with a dark bushy
    beard, and a three-bushel bag around his shoulders. He held up his other
    hand, and said something to the driver in a tone that might have been used
    by the leader of a search party who had just found the body. The driver stopped
    and then went on slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; we asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The publican&rsquo;s wife is sick,&rdquo; somebody said, &ldquo;and
    he wants us to come quietly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The usual little slab and bark shanty was suggested in the gloom, with a
    big bark stable looming in the background. We climbed down like so many cripples.
    As soon as we began to feel our legs and be sure we had the right ones and
    the proper allowance of feet, we helped, as quietly as possible, to take
    the horses out and round to the stable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she very bad?&rdquo; we asked the publican, showing as much concern
    as we could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a subdued voice of a rough man who had spent
    several anxious, sleepless nights by the sick bed of a dear one. &ldquo;But,
    God willing, I think we&rsquo;ll pull her through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus encouraged we said, sympathetically: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry
    to trouble you, but I suppose we could manage to get a drink and a bit to
    eat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to eat in the
    house, and I&rsquo;ve only got rum and milk. You can have that if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the pilgrims broke out here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well of all the pubs,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>The pilgrim scowled and retired to the rear. You can&rsquo;t express your
    feelings freely when there&rsquo;s a woman dying close handy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, who says rum and milk?&rdquo; asked the joker, in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; said the publican, and disappeared into the little
    front passage.</p>
  <p>Presently a light showed through a window, with a scratched and fly-bitten
    B and A on two panes, and a mutilated R on the third, which was broken. A
    door opened, and we sneaked into the bar. It was like having drinks after
    hours where the police are strict and independent.</p>
  <p>When we came out the driver was scratching his head and looking at the harness
    on the verandah floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fellows &rsquo;ll have ter put in the time for an hour or so.
    The horses is out back somewheres,&rdquo; and he indicated the interior of
    Australia with a side jerk of his head, &ldquo;and the boy ain&rsquo;t back
    with &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But dash it all,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long are the horses likely to be?&rdquo; we asked the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Might be three or four hours. It&rsquo;s
    all accordin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate wanter
    catch the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; from the publican in a fierce whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, boss,&rdquo; said the joker, &ldquo;can you let us have beds,
    then? I don&rsquo;t want to freeze here all night, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I can do that, but some of
    you will have to sleep double and some of you&rsquo;ll have to take it out
    of the sofas, and one or two &rsquo;ll have to make a shakedown on the floor.
    There&rsquo;s plenty of bags in the stable, and you&rsquo;ve got rugs and
    coats with you. Fix it up amongst yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; interrupted the Pilgrim, desperately, &ldquo;we
    can&rsquo;t afford to wait! We&rsquo;re only &lsquo;battlers&rsquo;, me and
    my mate, pickin&rsquo; up crumbs by the wayside. We&rsquo;ve got to catch
    the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican, savagely. &ldquo;You fool, didn&rsquo;t
    I tell you my missus was bad? I won&rsquo;t have any noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; protested the Pilgrim, &ldquo;we must catch
    the train at Dead Camel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch my boot presently,&rdquo; said the publican, with
    a savage oath, &ldquo;and go further than Dead Camel. I won&rsquo;t have
    my missus disturbed for you or any other man! Just you shut up or get out,
    and take your blooming mate with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We lost patience with the Pilgrim and sternly took him aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, for God&rsquo;s sake, hold your jaw,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any consideration at all? Can&rsquo;t you see the man&rsquo;s wife
    is ill&mdash;dying perhaps&mdash;and he nearly worried off his head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pilgrim and his mate were scraggy little bipeds of the city push variety,
    so they were suppressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; yawned the joker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to roost
    on a stump all night. I&rsquo;m going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be eighteenpence each,&rdquo; hinted the landlord. &ldquo;You
    can settle now if you like to save time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We took the hint, and had another drink. I don&rsquo;t know how we  &ldquo;fixed
    it up amongst ourselves,&rdquo; but we got settled down somehow. There was
    a lot of mysterious whispering and scuffling round by the light of a couple
    of dirty greasy bits of candle. Fortunately we dared not speak loud enough
    to have a row, though most of us were by this time in the humour to pick
    a quarrel with a long-lost brother.</p>
  <p>The Joker got the best bed, as good-humoured, good-natured chaps generally
    do, without seeming to try for it. The growler of the party got the floor
    and chaff bags, as selfish men mostly do&mdash;without seeming to try for
    it either. I took it out of one of the &ldquo;sofas&rdquo;, or rather that
    sofa took it out of me. It was short and narrow and down by the head, with
    a leaning to one corner on the outside, and had more nails and bits of gin-case
    than original sofa in it.</p>
  <p>I had been asleep for three seconds, it seemed, when somebody shook me by
    the shoulder and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take yer seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I got out, the driver was on the box, and the others were getting rum
    and milk inside themselves (and in bottles) before taking their seats.</p>
  <p>It was colder and darker than before, and the South Pole seemed nearer,
    and pretty soon, but for the rum, we should have been in a worse fix than
    before.</p>
  <p>There was a spell of grumbling. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe them horses was lost at all. I was round behind
    the stable before I went to bed, and seen horses there; and if they wasn&rsquo;t
    them same horses there, I&rsquo;ll eat &rsquo;em raw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer?&rdquo; said the driver, in a disinterested tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the passenger. Then, with a sudden ferocity, &ldquo;and
    you too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The driver said nothing. It was an abstract question which didn&rsquo;t
    interest him.</p>
  <p>We saw that we were on delicate ground, and changed the subject for a while.
    Then someone else said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where his missus was? I didn&rsquo;t see any signs of her
    about, or any other woman about the place, and we was pretty well all over
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have kept her in the stable,&rdquo; suggested the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she wasn&rsquo;t, for Scotty and that chap on the roof was there
    after bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She might have been in the loft,&rdquo; reflected the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no loft,&rdquo; put in a voice from the top of the coach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Mister&mdash;Mister man,&rdquo; said the Joker suddenly to
    the driver,  &ldquo;Was his missus sick at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied the driver. &ldquo;She might have been. He
    said so, anyway. I ain&rsquo;t got no call to call a man a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said the cannibalistic individual to the driver,
    in the tone of a man who has made up his mind for a row, &ldquo;has that
    shanty-keeper got a wife at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe he has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is she living with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t&mdash;if yer wanter know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno. How am I to know? She left him three or four years ago.
    She was in Sydney last time I heard of her. It ain&rsquo;t no affair of mine,
    anyways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is there any woman about the place at all, driver?&rdquo; inquired
    a professional wanderer reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not that I knows on. There useter be a old black gin come
    pottering round sometimes, but I ain&rsquo;t seen her lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And excuse me, driver, but is there anyone round there at all?&rdquo;  enquired
    the professional wanderer, with the air of a conscientious writer, collecting
    material for an Australian novel from life, with an eye to detail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the driver&mdash;and recollecting that he was expected
    to be civil and obliging to his employers&rsquo; patrons, he added in surly
    apology, &ldquo;Only the boss and the stableman, that I knows of.&rdquo; Then
    repenting of the apology, he asserted his manhood again, and asked, in a
    tone calculated to risk a breach of the peace, &ldquo;Any more questions,
    gentlemen&mdash;while the shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; asked the Pilgrim appealingly, &ldquo;was them horses
    lost at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;He said they was. He&rsquo;s
    got the looking after them. It was nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve drinks at sixpence a drink&rdquo;&mdash;said the Joker, as
    if calculating to himself&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s six bob, and, say on
    an average, four shouts&mdash;that&rsquo;s one pound four. Twelve beds at
    eighteenpence a bed&mdash;that&rsquo;s eighteen shillings; and say ten bob
    in various drinks and the stuff we brought with us, that&rsquo;s two pound
    twelve. That publican didn&rsquo;t do so bad out of us in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We wondered how much the driver got out of it, but thought it best not to
    ask him.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t say much for the rest of the journey. There was the usual
    man who thought as much and knew all about it from the first, but he wasn&rsquo;t
    appreciated. We suppressed him. One or two wanted to go back and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; that
    landlord, and the driver stopped the coach cheerfully at their request; but
    they said they&rsquo;d come across him again and allowed themselves to be
    persuaded out of it. It made us feel bad to think how we had allowed ourselves
    to be delayed, and robbed, and had sneaked round on tiptoe, and how we had
    sat on the inoffensive Pilgrim and his mate, and all on account of a sick
    wife who didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
  <p>The coach arrived at Dead Camel in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and
    distrust, and we spread ourselves over the train and departed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AGentlemanSharperandSteelmanSharper"></a>A Gentleman
      Sharper and Steelman Sharper</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman and Smith had been staying at the hotel for several days in the
    dress and character of bushies down for what they considered a spree. The
    gentleman sharper from the Other Side had been hanging round them for three
    days now. Steelman was the more sociable, and, to all appearances, the greener
    of the two bush mates; but seemed rather too much under the influence of
    Smith, who was reserved, suspicious, self-contained, or sulky. He almost
    scowled at Gentleman Sharper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fine
    day!&rdquo;, replied in monosyllables and turned half away with an uneasy,
    sullen, resentful hump of his shoulder and shuffle of his feet.</p>
  <p>Steelman took Smith for a stroll on the round, bald tussock hills surrounding
    the city, and rehearsed him for the last act until after sundown.</p>
  <p>Gentleman Sharper was lounging, with a cigar, on the end of the balcony,
    where he had been contentedly contemplating the beautiful death of day. His
    calm, classic features began to whiten (and sharpen) in the frosty moonlight.</p>
  <p>Steelman and Smith sat on deck-chairs behind a half-screen of ferns on the
    other end of the balcony, smoked their after-dinner smoke, and talked in
    subdued tones as befitted the time and the scene&mdash;great, softened, misty
    hills in a semicircle, and the water and harbour lights in moonlight.</p>
  <p>The other boarders were loitering over dinner, in their rooms, or gone out;
    the three were alone on the balcony, which was a rear one.</p>
  <p>Gentleman Sharper moved his position, carelessly, noiselessly, yet quickly,
    until he leaned on the rail close to the ferns and could overhear every word
    the bushies said. He had dropped his cigar overboard, and his scented handkerchief
    behind a fern-pot en route.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he looks all right, and acts all right, and talks all right&mdash;and
    shouts all right,&rdquo; protested Steelman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not stumped,
    for I saw twenty or thirty sovereigns when he shouted; and he doesn&rsquo;t
    seem to care a damn whether we stand in with him or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you are! That&rsquo;s just where it is!&rdquo; said Smith,
    with some logic, but in a tone a wife uses in argument (which tone, by the
    way, especially if backed by logic or common sense, makes a man wild sooner
    than anything else in this world of troubles).</p>
  <p>Steelman jerked his chair half-round in disgust. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; he
    snorted, &ldquo;always suspicious! Always suspicious of everybody and everything!
    If I found myself shot into a world where I couldn&rsquo;t trust anybody
    I&rsquo;d shoot myself out of it. Life would be worse than not worth living.
    Smith, you&rsquo;ll never make money, except by hard graft&mdash;hard, bullocking,
    nigger-driving graft like we had on that damned railway section for the last
    six months, up to our knees in water all winter, and all for a paltry cheque
    of one-fifty&mdash;twenty of that gone already. How do you expect to make
    money in this country if you won&rsquo;t take anything for granted, except
    hard cash? I tell you, Smith, there&rsquo;s a thousand pounds lost for every
    one gained or saved by trusting too little. How did Vanderbilt and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman elaborated to a climax, slipping a glance warily, once or twice,
    out of the tail of his eye through the ferns, low down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There never was a fortune made that wasn&rsquo;t made by chancing
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nudged Smith to come to the point. Presently Smith asked, sulkily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what was he saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I told you! He says he&rsquo;s behind the scenes in this
    gold boom, and, if he had a hundred pounds ready cash to-morrow, he&rsquo;d
    make three of it before Saturday. He said he could put one-fifty to one-fifty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t he worth three hundred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; demanded Steelman, with an impatient
    ring, and speaking rapidly, &ldquo;that he lost his mail in the wreck of
    the &lsquo;Tasman&rsquo;? You know she went down the day before yesterday,
    and the divers haven&rsquo;t got at the mails yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.... But why doesn&rsquo;t he wire to Sydney for some stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;! Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to have patience
    with a born natural. Look here, Smith, the fact of the matter is that he&rsquo;s
    a sort of black-sheep&mdash;sent out on the remittance system, if the truth
    is known, and with letters of introduction to some big-bugs out here&mdash;that
    explains how he gets to know these wire-pullers behind the boom. His people
    have probably got the quarterly allowance business fixed hard and tight with
    a bank or a lawyer in Sydney; and there&rsquo;ll have to be enquiries about
    the lost &lsquo;draft&rsquo; (as he calls a cheque) and a letter or maybe
    a cable home to England; and it might take weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Smith, hesitatingly. &ldquo;That all sounds right
    enough. But&rdquo;&mdash;with an inspiration&mdash;&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
    he go to one of these big-bug boomsters he knows&mdash;that he got letters
    of introduction to&mdash;and get him to fix him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Steelman, hopelessly. &ldquo;Listen to
    him! Can&rsquo;t you see that they&rsquo;re the last men he wants to let
    into his game? Why, he wants to use <i>them!</i> They&rsquo;re the mugs as
    far as he is concerned!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I see!&rdquo; said Smith, after hesitating, and rather slowly&mdash;as
    if he hadn&rsquo;t quite finished seeing yet.</p>
  <p>Steelman glanced furtively at the fern-screen, and nudged Smith again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said if he had three hundred, he&rsquo;d double it by Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said,&rdquo; replied Steelman, seeming by his
    tone to be losing interest in the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And... well, if he had a hundred he could double that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. What are you driving at now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he had twenty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, God! I&rsquo;m sick of you, Smith. What the&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on. Let me finish. I was only going to say that I&rsquo;m willing
    to put up a fiver, and you put up another fiver, and if he doubles that for
    us then we can talk about standing in with him with a hundred&mdash;provided
    he can show his hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After some snarling Steelman said: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try him! Now
    are you satisfied?&rdquo;...</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s moved off now,&rdquo; he added in a whisper; &ldquo;but
    stay here and talk a bit longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Passing through the hall they saw Gentleman Sharper standing carelessly
    by the door of the private bar. He jerked his head in the direction of drinks.
    Steelman accepted the invitation&mdash;Smith passed on. Steelman took the
    opportunity to whisper to the Sharper&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking
    that over with my mate, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come for a stroll,&rdquo; suggested the professional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo; and they passed out.</p>
  <p>When they returned Steelman went straight to the room he occupied with Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much stuff have we got, Smith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine pounds seventeen and threepence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman gave an exclamation of disapproval with that state of financial
    affairs. He thought a second. &ldquo;I know the barman here, and I think
    he knows me. I&rsquo;ll chew his lug for a bob or may be a quid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Twenty minutes later he went to Gentleman Sharper&rsquo;s room with ten
    pounds&mdash;in very dirty Bank of New Zealand notes&mdash;such as those
    with which bush contractors pay their men.</p>
  <p>Two mornings later the sharper suggested a stroll. Steelman went with him,
    with a face carefully made up to hear the worst.</p>
  <p>After walking a hundred yards in a silence which might have been ominous&mdash;and
    was certainly pregnant&mdash;the sharper said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well... I tried the water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Steelman in a nervous tone. &ldquo;And how did you
    find it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as warm as I thought. Warm for a big splash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How? Did you lose the ten quid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lose it! What did you take me for? I put ten to your ten as I told
    you I would. I landed 50 Pounds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds for twenty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the tune of it&mdash;and not much of a tune, either.
    My God! If I&rsquo;d only had that thousand of mine by me, or even half of
    it, I&rsquo;d have made a pile!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds for twenty!&rdquo; cried Steelman excitedly. &ldquo;Why,
    that&rsquo;s grand! And to think we chaps have been grafting like niggers
    all our lives! By God, we&rsquo;ll stand in with you for all we&rsquo;ve
    got!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it,&rdquo; as they reached the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you come to my room I&rsquo;ll give you the 25 Pounds now, if
    you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; exclaimed Steelman impulsively; &ldquo;you
    mustn&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t you say any more about it. You&rsquo;d
    best have the stuff to-night to show your mate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so; he&rsquo;s a suspicious fool, but I made a bargain with
    him about our last cheque. He can hang on to the stuff, and I can&rsquo;t.
    If I&rsquo;d been on my own I&rsquo;d have blued it a week ago. Tell you
    what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call our share (Smith&rsquo;s and mine)
    twenty quid. You take the odd fiver for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That looks fair enough. We&rsquo;ll call it twenty guineas to you
    and your mate. We&rsquo;ll want him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In his own and Smith&rsquo;s room Steelman thoughtfully counted twenty-one
    sovereigns on the toilet-table cover, and left them there in a pile.</p>
  <p>He stretched himself, scratched behind his ear, and blinked at the money
    abstractedly. Then he asked, as if the thought just occurred to him: &ldquo;By
    the way, Smith, do you see those yellow boys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith saw. He had been sitting on the bed with a studiously vacant expression.
    It was Smith&rsquo;s policy not to seem, except by request, to take any interest
    in, or, in fact, to be aware of anything unusual that Steelman might be doing&mdash;from
    patching his pants to reading poetry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s twenty-one sovereigns there!&rdquo; remarked Steelman
    casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer, Steely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Steelman, solemnly and grimly, &ldquo;if you get
    taken down for &rsquo;em, or lose &rsquo;em out of the top-hole in your pocket,
    or spend so much as a shilling in riotous living, I&rsquo;ll stoush you,
    Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith didn&rsquo;t seem interested. They sat on the beds opposite each other
    for two or three minutes, in something of the atmosphere that pervades things
    when conversation has petered out and the dinner-bell is expected to ring.
    Smith screwed his face and squeezed a pimple on his throat; Steelman absently
    counted the flies on the wall. Presently Steelman, with a yawning sigh, lay
    back on the pillow with his hands clasped under his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take a few quid, Smith, and get that suit you were looking
    at the other day. Get a couple of shirts and collars, and some socks; better
    get a hat while you&rsquo;re at it&mdash;yours is a disgrace to your benefactor.
    And, I say, go to a chemist and get some cough stuff for that churchyarder
    of yours&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got no use for it just now, and it makes me sentimental.
    I&rsquo;ll give you a cough when you want one. Bring me a syphon of soda,
    some fruit, and a tract.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tract. Go on. Start your boots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While Smith was gone, Steelman paced the room with a strange, worried, haunted
    expression. He divided the gold that was left&mdash;(Smith had taken four
    pounds)&mdash;and put ten sovereigns in a pile on the extreme corner of the
    table. Then he walked up and down, up and down the room, arms tightly folded,
    and forehead knitted painfully, pausing abruptly now and then by the table
    to stare at the gold, until he heard Smith&rsquo;s step. Then his face cleared;
    he sat down and counted flies.</p>
  <p>Smith was undoing and inspecting the parcels, having placed the syphon and
    fruit on the table. Behind his back Steelman hurriedly opened a leather pocketbook
    and glanced at the portrait of a woman and child and at the date of a post-office
    order receipt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re two honest, ignorant,
    green coves; hard-working chaps from the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we are or not&mdash;we are as far
    as the world is concerned. Now we&rsquo;ve grafted like bullocks, in heat
    and wet, for six months, and made a hundred and fifty, and come down to have
    a bit of a holiday before going back to bullock for another six months or
    a year. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Smith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could take your oath on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is so or not&mdash;it <i>is</i> so,
    so far as the world is concerned. Now we&rsquo;ve paid our way straight.
    We&rsquo;ve always been pretty straight anyway, even if we are a pair of
    vagabonds, and I don&rsquo;t half like this new business; but it had to be
    done. If I hadn&rsquo;t taken down that sharper you&rsquo;d have lost confidence
    in me and wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to mask your feelings, and I&rsquo;d
    have had to stoush you. We&rsquo;re two hard-working, innocent bushies, down
    for an innocent spree, and we run against a cold-blooded professional sharper,
    a paltry sneak and a coward, who&rsquo;s got neither the brains nor the pluck
    to work in the station of life he togs himself for. He tries to do us out
    of our hard-earned little hundred and fifty&mdash;no matter whether we had
    it or not&mdash;and I&rsquo;m obliged to take him down. Serve him right for
    a crawler. You haven&rsquo;t the least idea what I&rsquo;m driving at, Smith,
    and that&rsquo;s the best of it. I&rsquo;ve driven a nail of my life home,
    and no pincers ever made will get it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Steely, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman rose, took up the pile of ten sovereigns, and placed it neatly
    on top of the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put the stuff away, Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After breakfast next morning, Gentleman Sharper hung round a bit, and then
    suggested a stroll. But Steelman thought the weather looked too bad, so they
    went on the balcony for a smoke. They talked of the weather, wrecks, and
    things, Steelman leaning with his elbows on the balcony rail, and Sharper
    sociably and confidently in the same position close beside him. But the professional
    was evidently growing uneasy in his mind; his side of the conversation grew
    awkward and disjointed, and he made the blunder of drifting into an embarrassing
    silence before coming to the point. He took one elbow from the rail, and
    said, with a bungling attempt at carelessness which was made more transparent
    by the awkward pause before it:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I must see to my correspondence. By the way, when could
    you make it convenient to let me have that hundred? The shares are starting
    up the last rise now, and we&rsquo;ve got no time to lose if we want to double
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman turned his face to him and winked once&mdash;a very hard, tight,
    cold wink&mdash;a wink in which there was no humour: such a wink as Steelman
    had once winked at a half-drunken bully who was going to have a lark with
    Smith.</p>
  <p>The sharper was one of those men who pull themselves together in a bad cause,
    as they stagger from the blow. But he wanted to think this time.</p>
  <p>Later on he approached Steelman quietly and proposed partnership. But Steelman
    gave him to understand (as between themselves) that he wasn&rsquo;t taking
    on any pupils just then.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnIncidentatStiffners"></a>An Incident at Stiffner&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>They called him &ldquo;Stiffner&rdquo; because he used, long before, to
    get a living by poisoning wild dogs near the Queensland border. The name
    stuck to him closer than misfortune did, for when he rose to the proud and
    independent position of landlord and sole proprietor of an out-back pub he
    was Stiffner still, and his place was &ldquo;Stiffner&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;widely
    known.</p>
  <p>They do say that the name ceased not to be applicable&mdash;that it fitted
    even better than in the old dingo days, but&mdash;well, they do say so. All
    we can say is that when a shearer arrived with a cheque, and had a drink
    or two, he was almost invariably seized with a desire to camp on the premises
    for good, spend his cheque in the shortest possible time, and forcibly shout
    for everything within hail&mdash;including the Chinaman cook and Stiffner&rsquo;s
    disreputable old ram.</p>
  <p>The shanty was of the usual kind, and the scenery is as easily disposed
    of. There was a great grey plain stretching away from the door in front,
    and a mulga scrub from the rear; and in that scrub, not fifty yards from
    the kitchen door, were half a dozen nameless graves.</p>
  <p>Stiffner was always drunk, and Stiffner&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a hard-featured
    Amazon&mdash;was boss. The children were brought up in a detached cottage,
    under the care of a &ldquo;governess&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Stiffner had a barmaid as a bait for chequemen. She came from Sydney, they
    said, and her name was Alice. She was tall, boyishly handsome, and characterless;
    her figure might be described as &ldquo;fine&rdquo; or &ldquo;strapping&rdquo;,
    but her face was very cold&mdash;nearly colourless. She was one of those
    selfishly sensual women&mdash;thin lips, and hard, almost vacant grey eyes;
    no thought of anything but her own pleasures, none for the man&rsquo;s. Some
    shearers would roughly call her &ldquo;a squatter&rsquo;s girl&rdquo;. But
    she &ldquo;drew&rdquo;; she was handsome where women are scarce&mdash;very
    handsome, thought a tall, melancholy-looking jackeroo, whose evil spirit
    had drawn him to Stiffner&rsquo;s and the last shilling out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>Over the great grey plain, about a fortnight before, had come &ldquo;Old
    Danny&rdquo;, a station hand, for his semi-annual spree, and one &ldquo;Yankee
    Jack&rdquo; and his mate, shearers with horses, travelling for grass; and,
    about a week later, the Sydney jackeroo. There was also a sprinkling of assorted
    swagmen, who came in through the scrub and went out across the plain, or
    came in over the plain and went away through the scrub, according to which
    way their noses led them for the time being.</p>
  <p>There was also, for one day, a tall, freckled native (son of a neighbouring &ldquo;cocky&rdquo;),
    without a thought beyond the narrow horizon within which he lived. He had
    a very big opinion of himself in a very small mind. He swaggered into the
    breakfast-room and round the table to his place with an expression of ignorant
    contempt on his phiz, his snub nose in the air and his under lip out. But
    during the meal he condescended to ask the landlord if he&rsquo;d noticed
    that there horse that chap was ridin&rsquo; yesterday; and Stiffner having
    intimated that he had, the native entertained the company with his opinion
    of that horse, and of a certain &ldquo;youngster&rdquo; he was breaking in
    at home, and divers other horses, mostly his or his father&rsquo;s, and of
    a certain cattle slut,  &amp;c.... He spoke at the landlord, but to the company,
    most of the time. After breakfast he swaggered round some more, but condescended
    to &ldquo;shove&rdquo; his hand into his trousers, &ldquo;pull&rdquo; out
    a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; and &ldquo;chuck&rdquo; it into the (blanky) hat for
    a pool. Those words express the thing better than any others we can think
    of. Finally, he said he must be off; and, there being no opposition to his
    departure, he chucked his saddle on to his horse, chucked himself into the
    saddle, said &ldquo;s&rsquo;long,&rdquo; and slithered off. And no one missed
    him.</p>
  <p>Danny had been there a fortnight, and consequently his personal appearance
    was not now worth describing&mdash;it was better left alone, for the honour
    of the bush. His hobby was that he was the &ldquo;stranger&rsquo;s friend&rdquo;,
    as he put it. He&rsquo;d welcome &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo; and chum with
    him, and shout for him to an unlimited extent, and sympathise with him, hear
    of jobs or a &ldquo;show&rdquo; for him, assure him twenty times a day that
    he was his friend, give him hints and advice more or less worthless, make
    him drunk if possible, and keep him so while the cheque lasted; in short,
    Danny would do almost anything for the stranger except lend him a shilling,
    or give him some rations to carry him on. He&rsquo;d promise that many times
    a day, but he&rsquo;d sooner spend five pounds on drink for a man than give
    him a farthing.</p>
  <p>Danny&rsquo;s cheque was nearly gone, and it was time he was gone too; in
    fact, he had received, and was still receiving, various hints to that effect,
    some of them decidedly pointed, especially the more recent ones. But Danny
    was of late becoming foolishly obstinate in his sprees, and less disposed
    to &ldquo;git&rdquo; when a landlord had done with him. He saw the hints
    plainly enough, but had evidently made up his mind to be doggedly irresponsive.
    It is a mistake to think that drink always dulls a man&rsquo;s feelings.
    Some natures are all the more keenly sensitive when alcoholically poisoned.</p>
  <p>Danny was always front man at the shanty while his cheque was fresh&mdash;at
    least, so he was given to understand, and so he apparently understood. He
    was then allowed to say and do what he liked almost, even to mauling the
    barmaid about. There was scarcely any limit to the free and easy manner in
    which you could treat her, so long as your money lasted. She wouldn&rsquo;t
    be offended; it wasn&rsquo;t business to be so&mdash;&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
    pay.&rdquo; But, as soon as your title to the cheque could be decently shelved,
    you had to treat her like a lady. Danny knew this&mdash;none better; but
    he had been treated with too much latitude, and rushed to his destruction.</p>
  <p>It was Sunday afternoon, but that made no difference in things at the shanty.
    Dinner was just over. The men were in the mean little parlour off the bar,
    interested in a game of cards, and Alice sat in one corner sewing. Danny
    was &ldquo;acting the goat&rdquo; round the fireplace; as ill-luck would
    have it, his attention was drawn to a basket of clean linen which stood on
    the side table, and from it, with sundry winks and grimaces, he gingerly
    lifted a certain garment of ladies&rsquo; underwear&mdash;to put the matter
    decently. He held it up between his forefingers and thumbs, and cracked a
    rough, foolish joke&mdash;no matter what it was. The laugh didn&rsquo;t last
    long. Alice sprang to her feet, flinging her work aside, and struck a stage
    attitude&mdash;her right arm thrown out and the forefinger pointing rigidly,
    and rather crookedly, towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; she snapped at Danny. &ldquo;Leave the room!
    How dare you talk like that before me-e-ee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Danny made a step and paused irresolutely. He was sober enough to feel the
    humiliation of his position, and having once been a man of spirit, and having
    still the remnants of manhood about him, he did feel it. He gave one pitiful,
    appealing look at her face, but saw no mercy there. She stamped her foot
    again, jabbed her forefinger at the door, and said, &ldquo;Go-o-o!&rdquo; in
    a tone that startled the majority of the company nearly as much as it did
    Danny. Then Yankee Jack threw down his cards, rose from the table, laid his
    strong, shapely right hand&mdash;not roughly&mdash;on Danny&rsquo;s ragged
    shoulder, and engineered the drunk gently through the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;s better go out for a while, Danny,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there
    wasn&rsquo;t much harm in what you said, but your cheque&rsquo;s gone, and
    that makes all the difference. It&rsquo;s time you went back to the station.
    You&rsquo;ve got to be careful what you say now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Jack returned to the parlour the barmaid had a smile for him; but he
    didn&rsquo;t take it. He went and stood before the fire, with his foot resting
    on the fender and his elbow on the mantelshelf, and looked blackly at a print
    against the wall before his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old beast!&rdquo; said Alice, referring to Danny. &ldquo;He ought
    to be kicked off the place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s as good as you!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was Jack&rsquo;s; he flung the stab over his shoulder, and with
    it a look that carried all the contempt he felt.</p>
  <p>She gasped, looked blankly from face to face, and witheringly at the back
    of Jack&rsquo;s head; but that didn&rsquo;t change colour or curl the least
    trifle less closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; she cried, appealing to anyone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    a nice lot o&rsquo; men, you are, to sit there and hear a woman insulted,
    and not one of you man enough to take her part&mdash;cowards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Sydney jackeroo rose impulsively, but Jack glanced at him, and he sat
    down again. She covered her face with her hands and ran hysterically to her
    room.</p>
  <p>That afternoon another bushman arrived with a cheque, and shouted five times
    running at a pound a shout, and at intervals during the rest of the day when
    they weren&rsquo;t fighting or gambling.</p>
  <p>Alice had &ldquo;got over her temper&rdquo; seemingly, and was even kind
    to the humble and contrite Danny, who became painfully particular with his  &ldquo;Thanky,
    Alice&rdquo;&mdash;and afterwards offensive with his unnecessarily frequent
    threats to smash the first man who insulted her.</p>
  <p>But let us draw the curtain close before that Sunday afternoon at Stiffner&rsquo;s,
    and hold it tight. Behind it the great curse of the West is in evidence,
    the chief trouble of unionism&mdash;drink, in its most selfish, barren, and
    useless form.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>All was quiet at Stiffner&rsquo;s. It was after midnight, and Stiffner lay
    dead-drunk on the broad of his back on the long moonlit verandah, with all
    his patrons asleep around him in various grotesque positions. Stiffner&rsquo;s
    ragged grey head was on a cushion, and a broad maudlin smile on his red,
    drink-sodden face, the lower half of which was bordered by a dirty grey beard,
    like that of a frilled lizard. The red handkerchief twisted round his neck
    had a ghastly effect in the bright moonlight, making him look as if his throat
    was cut. The smile was the one he went to sleep with when his wife slipped
    the cushion under his head and thoughtfully removed the loose change from
    about his person. Near him lay a heap that was Danny, and spread over the
    bare boards were the others, some with heads pillowed on their swags, and
    every man about as drunk as his neighbour. Yankee Jack lay across the door
    of the barmaid&rsquo;s bedroom, with one arm bent under his head, the other
    lying limp on the doorstep, his handsome face turned out to the bright moonlight.
    The &ldquo;family&rdquo; were sound asleep in the detached cottage, and Alice&mdash;the
    only capable person on the premises&mdash;was left to put out the lamps and &ldquo;shut
    up&rdquo; for the night. She extinguished the light in the bar, came out,
    locked the door, and picked her way among and over the drunkards to the end
    of the verandah. She clasped her hands behind her head, stretched herself,
    and yawned, and then stood for a few moments looking out into the night,
    which softened the ragged line of mulga to right and left, and veiled the
    awful horizon of that great plain with which the &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;  commenced,
    or ended, the thirty-mile &ldquo;dry stretch&rdquo;. Then she moved towards
    her own door; before it she halted and stood, with folded arms, looking down
    at the drunken Adonis at her feet.</p>
  <p>She breathed a long breath with a sigh in it, went round to the back, and
    presently returned with a buggy-cushion, which she slipped under his head&mdash;her
    face close to his&mdash;very close. Then she moved his arms gently off the
    threshold, stepped across him into her room, and locked the door behind her.</p>
  <p>There was an uneasy movement in the heap that stood, or lay, for Danny.
    It stretched out, turned over, struggled to its hands and knees, and became
    an object. Then it crawled to the wall, against which it slowly and painfully
    up-ended itself, and stood blinking round for the water-bag, which hung from
    the verandah rafters in a line with its shapeless red nose. It staggered
    forward, held on by the cords, felt round the edge of the bag for the tot,
    and drank about a quart of water. Then it staggered back against the wall,
    stood for a moment muttering and passing its hand aimlessly over its poor
    ruined head, and finally collapsed into a shapeless rum-smelling heap and
    slept once more.</p>
  <p>The jackeroo at the end of the verandah had awakened from his drunken sleep,
    but had not moved. He lay huddled on his side, with his head on the swag;
    the whole length of the verandah was before him; his eyes were wide open,
    but his face was in the shade. Now he rose painfully and stood on the ground
    outside, with his hands in his pockets, and gazed out over the open for a
    while. He breathed a long breath, too&mdash;with a groan in it. Then he lifted
    his swag quietly from the end of the floor, shouldered it, took up his water-bag
    and billy, and sneaked over the road, away from the place, like a thief.
    He struck across the plain, and tramped on, hour after hour, mile after mile,
    till the bright moon went down with a bright star in attendance and the other
    bright stars waned, and he entered the timber and tramped through it to the &ldquo;cleared
    road&rdquo;, which stretched far and wide for twenty miles before him, with
    ghostly little dust-clouds at short intervals ahead, where the frightened
    rabbits crossed it. And still he went doggedly on, with the ghastly daylight
    on him&mdash;like a swagman&rsquo;s ghost out late. And a mongrel followed
    faithfully all the time unnoticed, and wondering, perhaps, at his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was yer doin&rsquo; to that girl yesterday?&rdquo; asked Danny
    of Yankee Jack next evening, as they camped on the far side of the plain. &ldquo;What
    was you chaps sayin&rsquo; to Alice? I heerd her cryin&rsquo; in her room
    last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they reckoned that he had been too drunk to hear anything except an
    invitation to come and have another drink; and so it passed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHeroofRedclay"></a>The Hero of Redclay</b></h2>
  <p>The &ldquo;boss-over-the-board&rdquo; was leaning with his back to the wall
    between two shoots, reading a reference handed to him by a green-hand applying
    for work as picker-up or woolroller&mdash;a shed rouseabout. It was terribly
    hot. I was slipping past to the rolling-tables, carrying three fleeces to
    save a journey; we were only supposed to carry two. The boss stopped me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got three fleeces there, young man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that I had just slipped a light ragged fleece into
    the belly-wool and &ldquo;bits&rdquo; basket, I felt deeply injured, and
    righteously and fiercely indignant at being pulled up. It was a fearfully
    hot day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I catch you carrying three fleeces again,&rdquo; said the boss
    quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the sack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it now if you like,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>He nodded. &ldquo;You can go on picking-up in this man&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he
    said to the jackeroo, whose reference showed him to be a non-union man&mdash;a  &ldquo;free-labourer&rdquo;,
    as the pastoralists had it, or, in plain shed terms, &ldquo;a blanky scab&rdquo;.
    He was now in the comfortable position of a non-unionist in a union shed
    who had jumped into a sacked man&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>Somehow the lurid sympathy of the men irritated me worse than the boss-over-the-board
    had done. It must have been on account of the heat, as Mitchell says. I was
    sick of the shed and the life. It was within a couple of days of cut-out,
    so I told Mitchell&mdash;who was shearing&mdash;that I&rsquo;d camp up the
    Billabong and wait for him; got my cheque, rolled up my swag, got three days&rsquo;  tucker
    from the cook, said so-long to him, and tramped while the men were in the
    shed.</p>
  <p>I camped at the head of the Billabong where the track branched, one branch
    running to Bourke, up the river, and the other out towards the Paroo&mdash;and
    hell.</p>
  <p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the third morning Mitchell came along with his cheque
    and his swag, and a new sheep-pup, and his quiet grin; and I wasn&rsquo;t
    too pleased to see that he had a shearer called &ldquo;the Lachlan&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>The Lachlan wasn&rsquo;t popular at the shed. He was a brooding, unsociable
    sort of man, and it didn&rsquo;t make any difference to the chaps whether
    he had a union ticket or not. It was pretty well known in the shed&mdash;there
    were three or four chaps from the district he was reared in&mdash;that he&rsquo;d
    done five years hard for burglary. What surprised me was that Jack Mitchell
    seemed thick with him; often, when the Lachlan was sitting brooding and smoking
    by himself outside the hut after sunset, Mitchell would perch on his heels
    alongside him and yarn. But no one else took notice of anything Mitchell
    did out of the common.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better camp with us till the cool of the evening,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to the Lachlan, as they slipped their swags. &ldquo;Plenty time for you to
    start after sundown, if you&rsquo;re going to travel to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the Lachlan was going to travel all night and on a different track. I
    felt more comfortable, and put the billy on. I did not care so much what
    he&rsquo;d been or had done, but I was green and soft yet, and his presence
    embarrassed me.</p>
  <p>They talked shearing, sheds, tracks, and a little unionism&mdash;the Lachlan
    speaking in a quiet voice and with a lot of sound, common sense, it seemed
    to me. He was tall and gaunt, and might have been thirty, or even well on
    in the forties. His eyes were dark brown and deep set, and had something
    of the dead-earnest sad expression you saw in the eyes of union leaders and
    secretaries&mdash;the straight men of the strikes of &rsquo;90 and &rsquo;91.
    I fancied once or twice I saw in his eyes the sudden furtive look of the &ldquo;bad
    egg&rdquo; when a mounted trooper is spotted near the shed; but perhaps this
    was prejudice. And with it all there was about the Lachlan something of the
    man who has lost all he had and the chances of all he was ever likely to
    have, and is past feeling, or caring, or flaring up&mdash;past getting mad
    about anything&mdash;something, all the same, that warned men not to make
    free with him.</p>
  <p>He and Mitchell fished along the Billabong all the afternoon; I fished a
    little, and lay about the camp and read. I had an instinct that the Lachlan
    saw I didn&rsquo;t cotton on to his camping with us, though he wasn&rsquo;t
    the sort of man to show what he saw or felt. After tea, and a smoke at sunset,
    he shouldered his swag, nodded to me as if I was an accidental but respectful
    stranger at a funeral that belonged to him, and took the outside track. Mitchell
    walked along the track with him for a mile or so, while I poked round and
    got some boughs down for a bed, and fed and studied the collie pup that Jack
    had bought from the shearers&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>I saw them stop and shake hands out on the dusty clearing, and they seemed
    to take a long time about it; then Mitchell started back, and the other began
    to dwindle down to a black peg and then to a dot on the sandy plain, that
    had just a hint of dusk and dreamy far-away gloaming on it between the change
    from glaring day to hard, bare, broad moonlight.</p>
  <p>I thought Mitchell was sulky, or had got the blues, when he came back; he
    lay on his elbow smoking, with his face turned from the camp towards the
    plain. After a bit I got wild&mdash;if Mitchell was going to go on like that
    he might as well have taken his swag and gone with the Lachlan. I don&rsquo;t
    know exactly what was the matter with me that day, and at last I made up
    my mind to bring the thing to a head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem mighty thick with the Lachlan,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t the first felon I&rsquo;ve been on speaking terms with. I borrowed
    half-a-caser off a murderer once, when I was in a hole and had no one else
    to go to; and the murderer hadn&rsquo;t served his time, neither. I&rsquo;ve
    got nothing against the Lachlan, except that he&rsquo;s a white man and bears
    a faint family resemblance to a certain branch of my tribe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I rolled out my swag on the boughs, got my pipe, tobacco, and matches handy
    in the crown of a spare hat, and lay down.</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, re-lit his pipe at the fire, and mooned round for a while,
    with his hands behind him, kicking sticks out of the road, looking out over
    the plain, down along the Billabong, and up through the mulga branches at
    the stars; then he comforted the pup a bit, shoved the fire together with
    his toe, stood the tea-billy on the coals, and came and squatted on the sand
    by my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe! I&rsquo;ll tell you a yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; fire away! Has it got anything to do with the Lachlan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the Lachlan now; but it&rsquo;s
    about a chap he knew. Don&rsquo;t you ever breathe a word of this to the
    Lachlan or anyone, or he&rsquo;ll get on to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been a good many things in my time. I did a deal
    of house-painting at one time; I was a pretty smart brush hand, and made
    money at it. Well, I had a run of work at a place called Redclay, on the
    Lachlan side. You know the sort of town&mdash;two pubs, a general store,
    a post office, a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, a police station, a branch bank,
    and a dozen private weatherboard boxes on piles, with galvanized-iron tops,
    besides the humpies. There was a paper there, too, called the &lsquo;Redclay
    Advertiser&rsquo; (with which was incorporated the &lsquo;Geebung Chronicle&rsquo;),
    and a Roman Catholic church, a Church of England, and a Wesleyan chapel.
    Now you see more of private life in the house-painting line than in any other&mdash;bar
    plumbing and gasfitting; but I&rsquo;ll tell you about my house-painting
    experiences some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a young chap named Jack Drew editing the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  then.
    He belonged to the district, but had been sent to Sydney to a grammar school
    when he was a boy. He was between twenty-five and thirty; had knocked round
    a good deal, and gone the pace in Sydney. He got on as a boy reporter on
    one of the big dailies; he had brains and could write rings round a good
    many, but he got in with a crowd that called themselves &lsquo;Bohemians&rsquo;,
    and the drink got a hold on him. The paper stuck to him as long as it could
    (for the sake of his brains), but they had to sack him at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went out back, as most of them do, to try and work out their salvation,
    and knocked round amongst the sheds. He &lsquo;picked up&rsquo; in one shed
    where I was shearing, and we carried swags together for a couple of months.
    Then he went back to the Lachlan side, and prospected amongst the old fields
    round there with his elder brother Tom, who was all there was left of his
    family. Tom, by the way, broke his heart digging Jack out of a cave in a
    drive they were working, and died a few minutes after the rescue. (See &ldquo;When
    the Sun Went Down&rdquo;, in &ldquo;While the Billy Boils&rdquo;) But that&rsquo;s
    another yarn. Jack Drew had a bad spree after that; then he went to Sydney
    again, got on his old paper, went to the dogs, and a Parliamentary push that
    owned some city fly-blisters and country papers sent him up to edit the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  at
    two quid a week. He drank again, and no wonder&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know
    what it is to run a &lsquo;Geebung Advocate&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mudgee Budgee
    Chronicle&rsquo;, and live there. He was about the same build as the Lachlan,
    but stouter, and had something the same kind of eyes; but he was ordinarily
    as careless and devil-may-care as the Lachlan is grumpy and quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a doctor there, called Dr. Lebinski. They said he was a
    Polish exile. He was fifty or sixty, a tall man, with the set of an old soldier
    when he stood straight; but he mostly walked with his hands behind him, studying
    the ground. Jack Drew caught that trick off him towards the end. They were
    chums in a gloomy way, and kept to themselves&mdash;they were the only two
    men with brains in that town. They drank and fought the drink together. The
    Doctor was too gloomy and impatient over little things to be popular. Jack
    Drew talked too straight in the paper, and in spite of his proprietors&mdash;about
    pub spieling and such things&mdash;and was too sarcastic in his progress
    committee, town council, and toady reception reports. The Doctor had a hawk&rsquo;s
    nose, pointed grizzled beard and moustache, and steely-grey eyes with a haunted
    look in them sometimes (especially when he glanced at you sideways), as if
    he loathed his fellow men, and couldn&rsquo;t always hide it; or as if you
    were the spirit of morphia or opium, or a dead girl he&rsquo;d wronged in
    his youth&mdash;or whatever his devil was, beside drink. He was clever, and
    drink had brought him down to Redclay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bank manager was a heavy snob named Browne. He complained of
    being a bit dull of hearing in one ear&mdash;after you&rsquo;d yelled at
    him three or four times; sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought he was as deaf as a
    book-keeper in both. He had a wife and youngsters, but they were away on
    a visit while I was working in Redclay. His niece&mdash;or, rather, his wife&rsquo;s
    niece&mdash;a girl named Ruth Wilson, did the housekeeping. She was an orphan,
    adopted by her aunt, and was general slavey and scape-goat to the family&mdash;especially
    to the brats, as is often the case. She was rather pretty, and lady-like,
    and kept to herself. The women and girls called her Miss Wilson, and didn&rsquo;t
    like her. Most of the single men&mdash;and some of the married ones, perhaps&mdash;were
    gone on her, but hadn&rsquo;t the brains or the pluck to bear up and try
    their luck. I was gone worse than any, I think, but had too much experience
    or common sense. She was very good to me&mdash;used to hand me out cups of
    tea and plates of sandwiches, or bread and butter, or cake, mornings and
    afternoons the whole time I was painting the bank. The Doctor had known her
    people and was very kind to her. She was about the only woman&mdash;for she
    was more woman than girl&mdash;that he&rsquo;d brighten up and talk for.
    Neither he nor Jack Drew were particularly friendly with Browne or his push.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The banker, the storekeeper, one of the publicans, the butcher (a
    popular man with his hands in his pockets, his hat on the back of his head,
    and nothing in it), the postmaster, and his toady, the lightning squirter,
    were the scrub-aristocracy. The rest were crawlers, mostly pub spielers and
    bush larrikins, and the women were hags and larrikinesses. The town lived
    on cheque-men from the surrounding bush. It was a nice little place, taking
    it all round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember a ball at the local town hall, where the scrub aristocrats
    took one end of the room to dance in and the ordinary scum the other. It
    was a saving in music. Some day an Australian writer will come along who&rsquo;ll
    remind the critics and readers of Dickens, Carlyle, and Thackeray mixed,
    and he&rsquo;ll do justice to these little customs of ours in the little
    settled-district towns of Democratic Australia. This sort of thing came to
    a head one New Year&rsquo;s Night at Redclay, when there was a &lsquo;public&rsquo; ball
    and peace on earth and good will towards all men&mdash;mostly on account
    of a railway to Redclay being surveyed. We were all there. They&rsquo;d got
    the Doc. out of his shell to act as M.C.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the aristocrats was the daughter of the local storekeeper;
    she belonged to the lawn-tennis clique, and they <i>were</i> select. For
    some reason or other&mdash;because she looked upon Miss Wilson as a slavey,
    or on account of a fancied slight, or the heat working on ignorance, or on
    account of something that comes over girls and women that no son of sin can
    account for&mdash;this Miss Tea-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-sugar tossed her head and
    refused Miss Wilson&rsquo;s hand in the first set and so broke the ladies&rsquo; chain
    and the dance. Then there was a to-do. The Doctor held up his hand to stop
    the music, and said, very quietly, that he must call upon Miss So-and-so
    to apologise to Miss Wilson&mdash;or resign the chair. After a lot of fuss
    the girl did apologise in a snappy way that was another insult. Jack Drew
    gave Miss Wilson his arm and marched her off without a word&mdash;I saw she
    was almost crying. Some one said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go on with the dance.&rsquo; The
    Doctor flashed round on them, but they were too paltry for him, so he turned
    on his heel and went out without a word. But I was beneath them again in
    social standing, so there was nothing to prevent me from making a few well-chosen
    remarks on things in general&mdash;which I did; and broke up that ball, and
    broke some heads afterwards, and got myself a good deal of hatred and respect,
    and two sweethearts; and lost all the jobs I was likely to get, except at
    the bank, the Doctor&rsquo;s, and the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day it was raining&mdash;general rain for a week. Rain, rain,
    rain, over ridge and scrub and galvanised iron and into the dismal creeks.
    I&rsquo;d done all my inside work, except a bit under the Doctor&rsquo;s
    verandah, where he&rsquo;d been having some patching and altering done round
    the glass doors of his surgery, where he consulted his patients. I didn&rsquo;t
    want to lose time. It was a Monday and no day for the Royal, and there was
    no dust, so it was a good day for varnishing. I took a pot and brush and
    went along to give the Doctor&rsquo;s doors a coat of varnish. The Doctor
    and Drew were inside with a fire, drinking whisky and smoking, but I didn&rsquo;t
    know that when I started work. The rain roared on the iron roof like the
    sea. All of a sudden it held up for a minute, and I heard their voices. The
    doctor had been shouting on account of the rain, and forgot to lower his
    voice. &lsquo;Look here, Jack Drew,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there are only
    two things for you to do if you have any regard for that girl; one is to
    stop this&rsquo; (the liquor I suppose he meant) &lsquo;and pull yourself
    together; and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do that&mdash;I know men.
    The other is to throw up the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s doing
    you no good&mdash;and clear out.&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; says
    Drew. &lsquo;Then shoot yourself,&rsquo; said the Doctor. &lsquo;(There&rsquo;s
    another flask in the cupboard). You know what this hole is like.... She&rsquo;s
    a good true girl&mdash;a girl as God made her. I knew her father and mother,
    and I tell you, Jack, I&rsquo;d sooner see her dead than....&rsquo; The roof
    roared again. I felt a bit delicate about the business and didn&rsquo;t like
    to disturb them, so I knocked off for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a week before that I was down in the bed of the Redclay Creek
    fishing for &lsquo;tailers&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d been getting on all right with
    the housemaid at the &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;&mdash;she used to have plates of
    pudding and hot pie for me on the big gridiron arrangement over the kitchen
    range; and after the third tuck-out I thought it was good enough to do a
    bit of a bear-up in that direction. She mentioned one day, yarning, that
    she liked a stroll by the creek sometimes in the cool of the evening. I thought
    she&rsquo;d be off that day, so I said I&rsquo;d go for a fish after I&rsquo;d
    knocked off. I thought I might get a bite. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t catch Lizzie&mdash;tell
    you about that some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Sunday. I&rsquo;d been fishing for Lizzie about an hour when
    I saw a skirt on the bank out of the tail of my eye&mdash;and thought I&rsquo;d
    got a bite, sure. But I was had. It was Miss Wilson strolling along the bank
    in the sunset, all by her pretty self. She was a slight girl, not very tall,
    with reddish frizzled hair, grey eyes, and small, pretty features. She spoke
    as if she had more brains than the average, and had been better educated.
    Jack Drew was the only young man in Redclay she could talk to, or who could
    talk to a girl like her; and that was the whole trouble in a nutshell. The
    newspaper office was next to the bank, and I&rsquo;d seen her hand cups of
    tea and cocoa over the fence to his office window more than once, and sometimes
    they yarned for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Good morning, Miss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some girls I can&rsquo;t talk to like I&rsquo;d talk
    to other girls. She asked me if I&rsquo;d caught any fish, and I said, &lsquo;No,
    Miss.&rsquo; She asked me if it wasn&rsquo;t me down there fishing with Mr.
    Drew the other evening, and I said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;it was me.&rsquo; Then
    presently she asked me straight if he was fishing down the creek that afternoon?
    I guessed they&rsquo;d been down fishing for each other before. I said, &lsquo;No,
    I thought he was out of town.&rsquo; I knew he was pretty bad at the Royal.
    I asked her if she&rsquo;d like to have a try with my line, but she said
    No, thanks, she must be going; and she went off up the creek. I reckoned
    Jack Drew had got a bite and landed her. I felt a bit sorry for her, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next Saturday evening after the rainy Monday at the Doctor&rsquo;s,
    I went down to fish for tailers&mdash;and Lizzie. I went down under the banks
    to where there was a big she-oak stump half in the water, going quietly,
    with an idea of not frightening the fish. I was just unwinding the line from
    my rod, when I noticed the end of another rod sticking out from the other
    side of the stump; and while I watched it was dropped into the water. Then
    I heard a murmur, and craned my neck round the back of the stump to see who
    it was. I saw the back view of Jack Drew and Miss Wilson; he had his arm
    round her waist, and her head was on his shoulder. She said, &lsquo;I <i>will</i> trust
    you, Jack&mdash;I know you&rsquo;ll give up the drink for my sake. And I&rsquo;ll
    help you, and we&rsquo;ll be so happy!&rsquo; or words in that direction.
    A thunderstorm was coming on. The sky had darkened up with a great blue-black
    storm-cloud rushing over, and they hadn&rsquo;t noticed it. I didn&rsquo;t
    mind, and the fish bit best in a storm. But just as she said &lsquo;happy&rsquo; came
    a blinding flash and a crash that shook the ridges, and the first drops came
    peltering down. They jumped up and climbed the bank, while I perched on the
    she-oak roots over the water to be out of sight as they passed. Half way
    to the town I saw them standing in the shelter of an old stone chimney that
    stood alone. He had his overcoat round her and was sheltering her from the
    wind....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke-oh, Joe. The tea&rsquo;s stewing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, stretched himself, and brought the billy and pint-pots
    to the head of my camp. The moon had grown misty. The plain horizon had closed
    in. A couple of boughs, hanging from the gnarled and blasted timber over
    the billabong, were the perfect shapes of two men hanging side by side. Mitchell
    scratched the back of his neck and looked down at the pup curled like a glob
    of mud on the sand in the moonlight, and an idea struck him. He got a big
    old felt hat he had, lifted his pup, nose to tail, fitted it in the hat,
    shook it down, holding the hat by the brim, and stood the hat near the head
    of his doss, out of the moonlight. &ldquo;He might get moonstruck,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want that pup to be a genius.&rdquo; The
    pup seemed perfectly satisfied with this new arrangement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a smoke,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he added,
    with a sly grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make up the yarn as I go along,
    and it&rsquo;s hard work. It seems to begin to remind me of yarns your grandmother
    or aunt tells of things that happened when she was a girl&mdash;but those
    yarns are true. You won&rsquo;t have to listen long now; I&rsquo;m well on
    into the second volume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the storm I hurried home to the tent&mdash;I was batching with
    a carpenter. I changed my clothes, made a fire in the fire-bucket with shavings
    and ends of soft wood, boiled the billy, and had a cup of coffee. It was
    Saturday night. My mate was at the Royal; it was cold and dismal in the tent,
    and there was nothing to read, so I reckoned I might as well go up to the
    Royal, too, and put in the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to pass the Bank on the way. It was the usual weatherboard
    box with a galvanised iron top&mdash;four rooms and a passage, and a detached
    kitchen and wash-house at the back; the front room to the right (behind the
    office) was the family bedroom, and the one opposite it was the living room.
    The &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  office was next door. Jack Drew camped in a
    skillion room behind his printing office, and had his meals at the Royal.
    I noticed the storm had taken a sheet of iron off the skillion, and supposed
    he&rsquo;d sleep at the Royal that night. Next to the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo; office
    was the police station (still called the Police Camp) and the Courthouse.
    Next was the Imperial Hotel, where the scrub aristocrats went. There was
    a vacant allotment on the other side of the Bank, and I took a short cut
    across this to the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d forgotten to pull down the blind of the dining-room
    window, and I happened to glance through and saw she had Jack Drew in there
    and was giving him a cup of tea. He had a bad cold, I remember, and I suppose
    his health had got precious to her, poor girl. As I glanced she stepped to
    the window and pulled down the blind, which put me out of face a bit&mdash;though,
    of course, she hadn&rsquo;t seen me. I was rather surprised at her having
    Jack in there, till I heard that the banker, the postmaster, the constable,
    and some others were making a night of it at the Imperial, as they&rsquo;d
    been doing pretty often lately&mdash;and went on doing till there was a blow-up
    about it, and the constable got transferred Out Back. I used to drink my
    share then. We smoked and played cards and yarned and filled &rsquo;em up
    again at the Royal till after one in the morning. Then I started home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d finished giving the Bank a couple of coats of stone-colour
    that week, and was cutting in in dark colour round the spouting, doors, and
    window-frames that Saturday. My head was pretty clear going home, and as
    I passed the place it struck me that I&rsquo;d left out the only varnish
    brush I had. I&rsquo;d been using it to give the sashes a coat of varnish
    colour, and remembered that I&rsquo;d left it on one of the window-sills&mdash;the
    sill of her bedroom window, as it happened. I knew I&rsquo;d sleep in next
    day, Sunday, and guessed it would be hot, and I didn&rsquo;t want the varnish
    tool to get spoiled; so I reckoned I&rsquo;d slip in through the side gate,
    get it, and take it home to camp and put it in oil. The window sash was jammed,
    I remember, and I hadn&rsquo;t been able to get it up more than a couple
    of inches to paint the runs of the sash. The grass grew up close under the
    window, and I slipped in quietly. I noticed the sash was still up a couple
    of inches. Just as I grabbed the brush I heard low voices inside&mdash;Ruth
    Wilson&rsquo;s and Jack Drew&rsquo;s&mdash;in her room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The surprise sent about a pint of beer up into my throat in a lump.
    I tip-toed away out of there. Just as I got clear of the gate I saw the banker
    being helped home by a couple of cronies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went home to the camp and turned in, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.
    I lay think&mdash;think&mdash;thinking, till I thought all the drink out
    of my head. I&rsquo;d brought a bottle of ale home to last over Sunday, and
    I drank that. It only made matters worse. I didn&rsquo;t know how I felt&mdash;I&mdash;well,
    I felt as if I was as good a man as Jack Drew&mdash;I&mdash;you see I&rsquo;ve&mdash;you
    might think it soft&mdash;but I loved that girl, not as I&rsquo;ve been gone
    on other girls, but in the old-fashioned, soft, honest, hopeless, far-away
    sort of way; and now, to tell the straight truth, I thought I might have
    had her. You lose a thing through being too straight or sentimental, or not
    having enough cheek; and another man comes along with more brass in his blood
    and less sentimental rot and takes it up&mdash;and the world respects him;
    and you feel in your heart that you&rsquo;re a weaker man than he is. Why,
    part of the time I must have felt like a man does when a better man runs
    away with his wife. But I&rsquo;d drunk a lot, and was upset and lonely-feeling
    that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but Redclay had a tremendous sensation next day! Jack Drew, of
    all the men in the world, had been caught in the act of robbing the bank.
    According to Browne&rsquo;s account in court and in the newspapers, he returned
    home that night at about twelve o&rsquo;clock (which I knew was a lie, for
    I saw him being helped home nearer two) and immediately retired to rest (on
    top of the quilt, boots and all, I suppose). Some time before daybreak he
    was roused by a fancied noise (I suppose it was his head swelling); he rose,
    turned up a night lamp (he hadn&rsquo;t lit it, I&rsquo;ll swear), and went
    through the dining-room passage and office to investigate (for whisky and
    water). He saw that the doors and windows were secure, returned to bed, and
    fell asleep again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is something in a deaf person&rsquo;s being roused easily.
    I know the case of a deaf chap who&rsquo;d start up at a step or movement
    in the house when no one else could hear or feel it; keen sense of vibration,
    I reckon. Well, just at daybreak (to shorten the yarn) the banker woke suddenly,
    he said, and heard a crack like a shot in the house. There was a loose flooring-board
    in the passage that went off like a pistol-shot sometimes when you trod on
    it; and I guess Jack Drew trod on it, sneaking out, and he weighed nearly
    twelve stone. If the truth were known, he probably heard Browne poking round,
    tried the window, found the sash jammed, and was slipping through the passage
    to the back door. Browne got his revolver, opened his door suddenly, and
    caught Drew standing between the girl&rsquo;s door (which was shut) and the
    office door, with his coat on his arm and his boots in his hands. Browne
    covered him with his revolver, swore he&rsquo;d shoot if he moved, and yelled
    for help. Drew stood a moment like a man stunned; then he rushed Browne,
    and in the struggle the revolver went off, and Drew got hit in the arm. Two
    of the mounted troopers&mdash;who&rsquo;d been up looking to the horses for
    an early start somewhere&mdash;rushed in then, and took Drew. He had nothing
    to say. What could he say? He couldn&rsquo;t say he was a blackguard who&rsquo;d
    taken advantage of a poor unprotected girl because she loved him. They found
    the back door unlocked, by the way, which was put down to the burglar; of
    course Browne couldn&rsquo;t explain that he came home too muddled to lock
    doors after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the girl? She shrieked and fell when the row started, and they
    found her like a log on the floor of her room after it was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They found in Jack&rsquo;s overcoat pocket a parcel containing a
    cold chisel, small screw-wrench, file, and one or two other things that he&rsquo;d
    bought that evening to tinker up the old printing press. I knew that, because
    I&rsquo;d lent him a hand a few nights before, and he told me he&rsquo;d
    have to get the tools. They found some scratches round the key-hole and knob
    of the office door that I&rsquo;d made myself, scraping old splashes of paint
    off the brass and hand-plate so as to make a clean finish. Oh, it taught
    me the value of circumstantial evidence! If I was judge I wouldn&rsquo;t
    give a man till the &lsquo;risin&rsquo; av the coort&rsquo; on it, any more
    than I would on the bare word of the noblest woman breathing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the preliminary examination Jack Drew said he was guilty. But
    it seemed that, according to law, he couldn&rsquo;t be guilty until after
    he was committed. So he was committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions.
    The excitement and gabble were worse than the Dean case, or Federation, and
    sickened me, for they were all on the wrong track. You lose a lot of life
    through being behind the scenes. But they cooled down presently to wait for
    the trial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They thought it best to take the girl away from the place where she&rsquo;d
    got the shock; so the Doctor took her to his house, where he had an old housekeeper
    who was as deaf as a post&mdash;a first class recommendation for a housekeeper
    anywhere. He got a nurse from Sydney to attend on Ruth Wilson, and no one
    except he and the nurse were allowed to go near her. She lay like dead, they
    said, except when she had to be held down raving; brain fever, they said,
    brought on by the shock of the attempted burglary and pistol shot. Dr. Lebinski
    had another doctor up from Sydney at his own expense, but nothing could save
    her&mdash;and perhaps it was as well. She might have finished her life in
    a lunatic asylum. They were going to send her to Sydney, to a brain hospital;
    but she died a week before the Sessions. She was right-headed for an hour,
    they said, and asking all the time for Jack. The Doctor told her he was all
    right and was coming&mdash;and, waiting and listening for him, she died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The case was black enough against Drew now. I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have the pluck to tell the truth now, even if he was that sort of a man.
    I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I spoke to the Doctor straight. I caught
    him coming out of the Royal, and walked along the road with him a bit. I
    suppose he thought I was going to show cause why his doors ought to have
    another coat of varnish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hallo, Mitchell!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s painting?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Doctor!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what am I going to do about
    this business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jack Drew&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He looked at me sideways&mdash;the swift haunted look. Then he walked
    on without a word, for half a dozen yards, hands behind, and studying the
    dust. Then he asked, quite quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know the truth?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a dozen yards this time; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning, and see you afterwards,&rsquo; and
    he shook hands and went on home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next day he came to me where I was doing a job on a step ladder.
    He leaned his elbow against the steps for a moment, and rubbed his hand over
    his forehead, as if it ached and he was tired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, Mitchell,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were mates with him, once, Out Back?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know Drew&rsquo;s hand-writing?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should think so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He laid a leaf from a pocketbook on top of the steps. I read the
    message written in pencil:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To Jack Mitchell.&mdash;We were mates on the track. If you
    know anything of my affair, don&rsquo;t give it away.&mdash;J. D.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tore the leaf and dropped the bits into the paint-pot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Doctor,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but
    is there no way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned away, wearily. He&rsquo;d knocked about so much over the
    world that he was past bothering about explaining things or being surprised
    at anything. But he seemed to get a new idea about me; he came back to the
    steps again, and watched my brush for a while, as if he was thinking, in
    a broody sort of way, of throwing up his practice and going in for house-painting.
    Then he said, slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If she&mdash;the girl&mdash;had lived, we might have tried
    to fix it up quietly. That&rsquo;s what I was hoping for. I don&rsquo;t see
    how we can help him now, even if he&rsquo;d let us. He would never have spoken,
    anyway. We must let it go on, and after the trial I&rsquo;ll go to Sydney
    and see what I can do at headquarters. It&rsquo;s too late now. You understand,
    Mitchell?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve thought it out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he went away towards the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what could Jack Drew or we do? Study it out whatever way you
    like. There was only one possible chance to help him, and that was to go
    to the judge; and the judge that happened to be on that circuit was a man
    who&mdash;even if he did listen to the story and believe it&mdash;would have
    felt inclined to give Jack all the more for what he was charged with. Browne
    was out of the question. The day before the trial I went for a long walk
    in the bush, but couldn&rsquo;t hit on anything that the Doctor might have
    missed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in the court&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t keep away. The Doctor was
    there too. There wasn&rsquo;t so much of a change in Jack as I expected,
    only he had the gaol white in his face already. He stood fingering the rail,
    as if it was the edge of a table on a platform and he was a tired and bored
    and sleepy chairman waiting to propose a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only well-known man in Australia who reminds me of Mitchell is Bland
    Holt, the comedian. Mitchell was about as good hearted as Bland Holt, too,
    under it all; but he was bigger and roughened by the bush. But he seemed
    to be taking a heavy part to-night, for, towards the end of his yarn, he
    got up and walked up and down the length of my bed, dropping the sentences
    as he turned towards me. He&rsquo;d folded his arms high and tight, and his
    face in the moonlight was&mdash;well, it was very different from his careless
    tone of voice. He was like&mdash;like an actor acting tragedy and talking
    comedy. Mitchell went on, speaking quickly&mdash;his voice seeming to harden:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The charge was read out&mdash;I forget how it went&mdash;it sounded
    like a long hymn being given out. Jack pleaded guilty. Then he straightened
    up for the first time and looked round the court, with a calm, disinterested
    look&mdash;as if we were all strangers and he was noting the size of the
    meeting. And&mdash;it&rsquo;s a funny world, ain&rsquo;t it?&mdash;everyone
    of us shifted or dropped his eyes, just as if we were the felons and Jack
    the judge. Everyone except the Doctor; he looked at Jack and Jack looked
    at him. Then the Doctor smiled&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;and
    Drew smiled back. It struck me afterwards that I should have been in that
    smile. Then the Doctor did what looked like a strange thing&mdash;stood like
    a soldier with his hands to Attention. I&rsquo;d noticed that, whenever he&rsquo;d
    made up his mind to do a thing, he dropped his hands to his sides: it was
    a sign that he couldn&rsquo;t be moved. Now he slowly lifted his hand to
    his forehead, palm out, saluted the prisoner, turned on his heel, and marched
    from the court-room. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s boozin&rsquo;  again,&rsquo; someone
    whispered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a touch of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My oath, he&rsquo;s ratty!&rsquo; said someone else. One of the traps
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arder in the car-rt!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The judge gave it to Drew red-hot on account of the burglary being
    the cause of the girl&rsquo;s death and the sorrow in a respectable family;
    then he gave him five years&rsquo; hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It gave me a lot of confidence in myself to see the law of the land
    barking up the wrong tree, while only I and the Doctor and the prisoner knew
    it. But I&rsquo;ve found out since then that the law is often the only one
    that knows it&rsquo;s barking up the wrong tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Mitchell prepared to turn in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about Drew,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he did his time, or most of it. The Doctor went to headquarters,
    but either a drunken doctor from a geebung town wasn&rsquo;t of much account,
    or they weren&rsquo;t taking any romance just then at headquarters. So the
    Doctor came back, drank heavily, and one frosty morning they found him on
    his back on the bank of the creek, with his face like note-paper where the
    blood hadn&rsquo;t dried on it, and an old pistol in his hand&mdash;that
    he&rsquo;d used, they said, to shoot Cossacks from horseback when he was
    a young dude fighting in the bush in Poland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lay silent a good while; then he yawned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s a lonely track the Lachlan&rsquo;s tramping
    to-night; but I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s got his ghosts with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been puzzling for the last half-hour to think where I&rsquo;d
    met or heard of Jack Drew; now it flashed on me that I&rsquo;d been told
    that Jack Drew was the Lachlan&rsquo;s real name.</p>
  <p>I lay awake thinking a long time, and wished Mitchell had kept his yarn
    for daytime. I felt&mdash;well, I felt as if the Lachlan&rsquo;s story should
    have been played in the biggest theatre in the world, by the greatest actors,
    with music for the intervals and situations&mdash;deep, strong music, such
    as thrills and lifts a man from his boot soles. And when I got to sleep I
    hadn&rsquo;t slept a moment, it seemed to me, when I started wide awake to
    see those infernal hanging boughs with a sort of nightmare idea that the
    Lachlan hadn&rsquo;t gone, or had come back, and he and Mitchell had hanged
    themselves sociably&mdash;Mitchell for sympathy and the sake of mateship.</p>
  <p>But Mitchell was sleeping peacefully, in spite of a path of moonlight across
    his face&mdash;and so was the pup.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDarlingRiver"></a>The Darling River</b></h2>
  <p>The Darling&mdash;which is either a muddy gutter or a second Mississippi&mdash;is
    about six times as long as the distance, in a straight line, from its head
    to its mouth. The state of the river is vaguely but generally understood
    to depend on some distant and foreign phenomena to which bushmen refer in
    an off-hand tone of voice as &ldquo;the Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;, which
    seem to be held responsible, in a general way, for most of the out-back trouble.</p>
  <p>It takes less than a year to go up stream by boat to Walgett or Bourke in
    a dry season; but after the first three months the passengers generally go
    ashore and walk. They get sick of being stuck in the same sort of place,
    in the same old way; they grow weary of seeing the same old &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;  drop
    his swag on the bank opposite whenever the boat ties up for wood; they get
    tired of lending him tobacco, and listening to his ideas, which are limited
    in number and narrow in conception.</p>
  <p>It shortens the journey to get out and walk; but then you will have to wait
    so long for your luggage&mdash;unless you hump it with you.</p>
  <p>We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel the
    whole length of the river. He was a newspaper man. He started on his voyage
    of discovery one Easter in flood-time, and a month later the captain got
    bushed between the Darling and South Australian border. The waters went away
    before he could find the river again, and left his boat in a scrub. They
    had a cargo of rations, and the crew stuck to the craft while the tucker
    lasted; when it gave out they rolled up their swags and went to look for
    a station, but didn&rsquo;t find one. The captain would study his watch and
    the sun, rig up dials and make out courses, and follow them without success.
    They ran short of water, and didn&rsquo;t smell any for weeks; they suffered
    terrible privations, and lost three of their number, <i>not</i> including
    the newspaper liar. There are even dark hints considering the drawing of
    lots in connection with something too terrible to mention. They crossed a
    thirty-mile plain at last, and sighted a black gin. She led them to a boundary
    rider&rsquo;s hut, where they were taken in and provided with rations and
    rum.</p>
  <p>Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the boat;
    but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen from the
    nearest waterhole deep enough to float her, so they left her there. She&rsquo;s
    there still, or else the man that told us about it is the greatest liar Out
    Back.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat, blunted a little at the ends
    and cut off about a foot below the water-line, and parallel to it, then you
    will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling mud-rooter.
    But the river boat is much stronger. The boat we were on was built and repaired
    above deck after the different ideas of many bush carpenters, of whom the
    last seemed by his work to have regarded the original plan with a contempt
    only equalled by his disgust at the work of the last carpenter but one. The
    wheel was boxed in, mostly with round sapling-sticks fastened to the frame
    with bunches of nails and spikes of all shapes and sizes, most of them bent.
    The general result was decidedly picturesque in its irregularity, but dangerous
    to the mental welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend
    the design; for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the opportunity
    to work in a little abstract idea of his own.</p>
  <p>The way they &ldquo;dock&rdquo; a Darling River boat is beautiful for its
    simplicity. They choose a place where there are two stout trees about the
    boat&rsquo;s length apart, and standing on a line parallel to the river.
    They fix pulley-blocks to the trees, lay sliding planks down into the water,
    fasten a rope to one end of the steamer, and take the other end through the
    block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second steamer; then
    they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the block on the second
    tree, and aboard a third boat. At a given signal one boat leaves for Wentworth,
    and the other starts for the Queensland border. The consequence is that craft
    number one climbs the bank amid the cheers of the local loafers, who congregate
    and watch the proceedings with great interest and approval. The crew pitch
    tents, and set to work on the hull, which looks like a big, rough shallow
    box.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat called
    the &lsquo;Mud Turtle&rsquo;&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> called
    her. She might reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago. She
    didn&rsquo;t seem particular where she went, or whether she started again
    or stopped for good after getting stuck. Her machinery sounded like a chapter
    of accidents and was always out of order, but she got along all the same,
    provided the steersman kept her off the bank.</p>
  <p>Her skipper was a young man, who looked more like a drover than a sailor,
    and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than to any other
    body we know of, except that they looked a little more independent. They
    seemed clannish, too, with an unemployed or free-labour sort of isolation.
    We have an idea that they regarded our personal appearance with contempt.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Above Louth we picked up a &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;, who came aboard for the
    sake of society and tobacco. Not that he hoped to shorten his journey; he
    had no destination. He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies, and gave
    us a few ornamental facts. One of them took our fancy, and impressed us&mdash;with
    its beautiful simplicity, I suppose. He said: &ldquo;Some miles above where
    the Darlin&rsquo;  and the Warrygo runs inter each other, there&rsquo;s a
    billygong runnin&rsquo; right across between the two rivers and makin&rsquo; a
    sort of tryhangular hyland; &rsquo;n&rsquo; I can tel&rsquo;yer a funny thing
    about it.&rdquo; Here he paused to light his pipe. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
    continued, impressively, jerking the match overboard, &ldquo;when the Darlin&rsquo;s
    up, and the Warrygo&rsquo;s <i>low</i>, the billygong runs from the Darlin&rsquo; into
    the <i>Warrygo</i>; <i>and</i>, when the Warrygo&rsquo;s up &rsquo;n&rsquo; the
    Darlin&rsquo;s down, the waters runs <i>from</i> the Warrygo &rsquo;n&rsquo; inter
    the Darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What could be more simple?</p>
  <p>The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from
    a shed which was cutting out; and first it was necessary to tie up in the
    river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that the boat
    might safely negotiate the shallow waters. A local fisherman, who volunteered
    to act as pilot, was taken aboard, and after he was outside about a pint
    of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence in his ability to take
    us to hell, or anywhere else&mdash;at least, he said so. A man was sent ashore
    with blankets and tucker to mind the wool, and we crossed the river, butted
    into the anabranch, and started out back. Only the Lord and the pilot know
    how we got there. We travelled over the bush, through its branches sometimes,
    and sometimes through grass and mud, and every now and then we struck something
    that felt and sounded like a collision. The boat slid down one hill, and  &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; a
    stump at the bottom with a force that made every mother&rsquo;s son bite
    his tongue or break a tooth.</p>
  <p>The shearers came aboard next morning, with their swags and two cartloads
    of boiled mutton, bread, &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;, and tea and sugar. They numbered
    about fifty, including the rouseabouts. This load of sin sank the steamer
    deeper into the mud; but the passengers crowded over to port, by request
    of the captain, and the crew poked the bank away with long poles. When we
    began to move the shearers gave a howl like the yell of a legion of lost
    souls escaping from down below. They gave three cheers for the rouseabouts&rsquo; cook,
    who stayed behind; then they cursed the station with a mighty curse. They
    cleared a space on deck, had a jig, and afterwards a fight between the shearers&rsquo; cook
    and his assistant. They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the
    boat swung into that grand old gutter, and in the evening they had a general
    all-round time. We got back, and the crew had to reload the wool without
    assistance, for it bore the accursed brand of a &ldquo;freedom-of-contract&rdquo; shed.</p>
  <p>We slept, or tried to sleep, that night on the ridge of two wool bales laid
    with the narrow sides up, having first been obliged to get ashore and fight
    six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there. The live cinders
    from the firebox went up the chimney all night, and fell in showers on deck.
    Every now and again a spark would burn through the &ldquo;Wagga rug&rdquo; of
    a sleeping shearer, and he&rsquo;d wake suddenly and get up and curse. It
    was no use shifting round, for the wind was all ways, and the boat steered
    north, south, east, and west to humour the river. Occasionally a low branch
    would root three or four passengers off their wool bales, and they&rsquo;d
    get up and curse in chorus. The boat started two snags; and towards daylight
    struck a stump. The accent was on the stump. A wool bale went overboard,
    and took a swag and a dog with it; then the owner of the swag and dog and
    the crew of the boat had a swearing match between them. The swagman won.</p>
  <p>About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs, extricated one leg from between
    the wool bales, and found that the steamer was just crayfishing away from
    a mud island, where she had tied up for more wool. Some of the chaps had
    been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee. Shortly after
    the boat had settled down to work again an incident came along. A rouseabout
    rose late, and, while the others were at breakfast, got an idea into his
    head that a good &ldquo;sloosh&rdquo; would freshen him up; so he mooched
    round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it. He carried the
    bucket aft of the wheel. The boat was butting up stream for all she was worth,
    and the stream was running the other way, of course, and about a hundred
    times as fast as a train. The jackeroo gave the line a turn round his wrist;
    before anyone could see him in time to suppress him, he lifted the bucket,
    swung it to and fro, and dropped it cleverly into the water.</p>
  <p>This delayed us for nearly an hour. A couple of men jumped into the row
    boat immediately and cast her adrift. They picked up the jackeroo about a
    mile down the river, clinging to a snag, and when we hauled him aboard he
    looked like something the cat had dragged in, only bigger. We revived him
    with rum and got him on his feet; and then, when the captain and crew had
    done cursing him, he rubbed his head, went forward, and had a look at the
    paddle; then he rubbed his head again, thought, and remarked to his mates:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky I didn&rsquo;t dip that bucket <i>for&rsquo;ard</i> the
    wheel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This remark struck us forcibly. We agreed that it was lucky&mdash;for him;
    but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world, which,
    he explained, was over-populated with fools already.</p>
  <p>Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied
    up to a tree in the wilderness. There was no sign of a man to be seen, nor
    any sign, except the barge, that a human being had ever been there. The captain
    took the craft in tow, towed it about ten miles up the stream, and left it
    in a less likely place than where it was before.</p>
  <p>Floating bottles began to be more frequent, and we knew by that same token
    that we were nearing &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Luck!&rdquo;&mdash;Bourke, we mean.
    And this reminds us.</p>
  <p>When the Brewarrina people observe a more than ordinary number of bottles
    floating down the river, they guess that Walgett is on the spree; when the
    Louth chaps see an unbroken procession of dead marines for three or four
    days they know that Bourke&rsquo;s drunk. The poor, God-abandoned &ldquo;whaler&rdquo; sits
    in his hungry camp at sunset and watches the empty symbols of Hope go by,
    and feels more God-forgotten than ever&mdash;and thirstier, if possible&mdash;and
    gets a great, wide, thirsty, quaking, empty longing to be up where those
    bottles come from. If the townspeople knew how much misery they caused by
    their thoughtlessness they would drown their dead marines, or bury them,
    but on no account allow them to go drifting down the river, and stirring
    up hells in the bosoms of less fortunate fellow-creatures.</p>
  <p>There came a man from Adelaide to Bourke once, and he collected all the
    empty bottles in town, stacked them by the river, and waited for a boat.
    What he wanted them for the legend sayeth not, but the people reckoned he
    had a &ldquo;private still&rdquo;, or something of that sort, somewhere down
    the river, and were satisfied. What he came from Adelaide for, or whether
    he really did come from there, we do not know. All the Darling bunyips are
    supposed to come from Adelaide. Anyway, the man collected all the empty bottles
    he could lay his hands on, and piled them on the bank, where they made a
    good show. He waited for a boat to take his cargo, and, while waiting, he
    got drunk. That excited no comment. He stayed drunk for three weeks, but
    the townspeople saw nothing unusual in that. In order to become an object
    of interest in their eyes, and in that line, he would have had to stay drunk
    for a year and fight three times a day&mdash;oftener, if possible&mdash;and
    lie in the road in the broiling heat between whiles, and be walked on by
    camels and Afghans and free-labourers, and be locked up every time he got
    sober enough to smash a policeman, and try to hang himself naked, and be
    finally squashed by a loaded wool team.</p>
  <p>But while he drank the Darling rose, for reasons best known to itself, and
    floated those bottles off. They strung out and started for the Antarctic
    Ocean, with a big old wicker-worked demijohn in the lead.</p>
  <p>For the first week the down-river men took no notice; but after the bottles
    had been drifting past with scarcely a break for a fortnight or so, they
    began to get interested. Several whalers watched the procession until they
    got the jimjams by force of imagination, and when their bodies began to float
    down with the bottles, the down-river people got anxious.</p>
  <p>At last the Mayor of Wilcannia wired Bourke to know whether Dibbs or Parkes
    was dead, or democracy triumphant, or if not, wherefore the jubilation? Many
    telegrams of a like nature were received during that week, and the true explanation
    was sent in reply to each. But it wasn&rsquo;t believed, and to this day
    Bourke has the name of being the most drunken town on the river.</p>
  <p>After dinner a humorous old hard case mysteriously took us aside and said
    he had a good yarn which we might be able to work up. We asked him how, but
    he winked a mighty cunning wink and said that he knew all about us. Then
    he asked us to listen. He said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was an old feller down the Murrumbidgee named Kelly. He was
    a bit gone here. One day Kelly was out lookin&rsquo; for some sheep, when
    he got lost. It was gettin&rsquo; dark. Bymeby there came an old crow in
    a tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st! Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know I am,&rsquo; sez Kelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fol-ler me, fol-ler me,&rsquo; sez the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rsquo; sez Kelly, with a jerk of his arm. &lsquo;Go
    ahead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So the crow went on, and Kelly follered, an&rsquo; bymeby he found
    he was on the right track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime after Kelly was washin&rsquo; sheep (this was when we useter
    wash the sheep instead of the wool). Kelly was standin&rsquo; on the platform
    with a crutch in his hand landin&rsquo; the sheep, when there came a old
    crow in the tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kelly, I&rsquo;m hun-gry! Kel-ley, I&rsquo;m hun-ger-ry!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alright,&rsquo; sez Kelly; &lsquo;be up at the hut about dinner
    time &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sling you out something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep! Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep, Kel-ley,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blanked if I do,&rsquo; sez Kelly. &lsquo;If I drown a sheep
    I&rsquo;ll have to pay for it, be-God!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t find yer when yer lost agin,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if yer will,&rsquo; says Kelly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take blanky good care I won&rsquo;t get lost again, to be found by a gory
    ole crow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>There are a good many fishermen on the Darling. They camp along the banks
    in all sorts of tents, and move about in little box boats that will only
    float one man. The fisherman is never heavy. He is mostly a withered little
    old madman, with black claws, dirty rags (which he never changes), unkempt
    hair and beard, and a &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; expression. We cannot say that
    we ever saw him catch a fish, or even get a bite, and we certainly never
    saw him offer any for sale.</p>
  <p>He gets a dozen or so lines out into the stream, with the shore end fastened
    to pegs or roots on the bank, and passed over sticks about four feet high,
    stuck in the mud; on the top of these sticks he hangs bullock bells, or substitutes&mdash;jam
    tins with stones fastened inside to bits of string. Then he sits down and
    waits. If the cod pulls the line the bell rings.</p>
  <p>The fisherman is a great authority on the river and fish, but has usually
    forgotten everything else, including his name. He chops firewood for the
    boats sometimes, but it isn&rsquo;t his profession&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fisherman.
    He is only sane on points concerning the river, though he has all the fisherman&rsquo;s
    eccentricities. Of course he is a liar.</p>
  <p>When he gets his camp fixed on one bank it strikes him he ought to be over
    on the other, or at a place up round the bend, so he shifts. Then he reckons
    he was a fool for not stopping where he was before. He never dies. He never
    gets older, or drier, or more withered looking, or dirtier, or loonier&mdash;because
    he can&rsquo;t. We cannot imagine him as ever having been a boy, or even
    a youth. We cannot even try to imagine him as a baby. He is an animated mummy,
    who used to fish on the Nile three thousand years ago, and catch nothing.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We forgot to mention that there are wonderfully few wrecks on the Darling.
    The river boats seldom go down&mdash;their hulls are not built that way&mdash;and
    if one did go down it wouldn&rsquo;t sink far. But, once down, a boat is
    scarcely ever raised again; because, you see, the mud silts up round it and
    over it, and glues it, as it were, to the bottom of the river. Then the forty-foot
    alligators&mdash;which come down with the &ldquo;Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;,
    we suppose&mdash;root in the mud and fill their bellies with sodden flour
    and drowned deck-hands.</p>
  <p>They tried once to blow up a wreck with dynamite because it (the wreck)
    obstructed navigation; but they blew the bottom out of the river instead,
    and all the water went through. The Government have been boring for it ever
    since. I saw some of the bores myself&mdash;there is one at Coonamble.</p>
  <p>There is a yarn along the Darling about a cute Yankee who was invited up
    to Bourke to report on a proposed scheme for locking the river. He arrived
    towards the end of a long and severe drought, and was met at the railway
    station by a deputation of representative bushmen, who invited him, in the
    first place, to accompany them to the principal pub&mdash;which he did. He
    had been observed to study the scenery a good deal while coming up in the
    train, but kept his conclusions to himself. On the way to the pub he had
    a look at the town, and it was noticed that he tilted his hat forward very
    often, and scratched the back of his head a good deal, and pondered a lot;
    but he refrained from expressing an opinion&mdash;even when invited to do
    so. He guessed that his opinions wouldn&rsquo;t do much good, anyway, and
    he calculated that they would keep till he got back &ldquo;over our way&rdquo;&mdash;by
    which it was reckoned he meant the States.</p>
  <p>When they asked him what he&rsquo;d have, he said to Watty the publican:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you can build me your national drink. I guess I&rsquo;ll
    try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A long colonial was drawn for him, and he tried it. He seemed rather startled
    at first, then he looked curiously at the half-empty glass, set it down very
    softly on the bar, and leaned against the same and fell into a reverie; from
    which he roused himself after a while, with a sorrowful jerk of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Show me this river of yourn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They led him to the Darling, and he had a look at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this your river?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied, apprehensively.</p>
  <p>He tilted his hat forward till the brim nearly touched his nose, scratched
    the back of his long neck, shut one eye, and looked at the river with the
    other. Then, after spitting half a pint of tobacco juice into the stream,
    he turned sadly on his heel and led the way back to the pub. He invited the
    boys to &ldquo;pisen themselves&rdquo;; after they were served he ordered
    out the longest tumbler on the premises, poured a drop into it from nearly
    every bottle on the shelf, added a lump of ice, and drank slowly and steadily.</p>
  <p>Then he took pity on the impatient and anxious population, opened his mouth,
    and spake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows,&rdquo; he drawled, jerking his arm in the direction
    of the river, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll dew. I&rsquo;ll
    bottle that damned river of yourn in twenty-four hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later on he mellowed a bit, under the influence of several drinks which
    were carefully and conscientiously &ldquo;built&rdquo; from plans and specifications
    supplied by himself, and then, among other things, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that there river rises as high as you say it dew&mdash;and if
    this was the States&mdash;why, we&rsquo;d have had the Great Eastern up here
    twenty years ago&rdquo;&mdash;or words to that effect.</p>
  <p>Then he added, reflectively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I come over here I calculated that I was going to make things
    hum, but now I guess I&rsquo;ll have to change my prospectus. There&rsquo;s
    a lot of loose energy laying round over our way, but I guess that if I wanted
    to make things move in your country I&rsquo;d have to bring over the entire
    American nation&mdash;also his wife and dawg. You&rsquo;ve got the makings
    of a glorious nation over here, but you don&rsquo;t get up early enough!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The only national work performed by the blacks is on the Darling. They threw
    a dam of rocks across the river&mdash;near Brewarrina, we think&mdash;to
    make a fish trap. It&rsquo;s there yet. But God only knows where they got
    the stones from, or how they carried them, for there isn&rsquo;t a pebble
    within forty miles.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACasefortheOracle"></a>A Case for the Oracle</b></h2>
  <p>The Oracle and I were camped together. The Oracle was a bricklayer by trade,
    and had two or three small contracts on hand. I was &ldquo;doing a bit of
    house-painting&rdquo;. There were a plasterer, a carpenter, and a plumber&mdash;we
    were all T&rsquo;othersiders, and old mates, and we worked things together.
    It was in Westralia&mdash;the Land of T&rsquo;othersiders&mdash;and, therefore,
    we were not surprised when Mitchell turned up early one morning, with his
    swag and an atmosphere of salt water about him.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d had a rough trip, he said, and would take a spell that day and
    take the lay of the land and have something cooked for us by the time we
    came home; and go to graft himself next morning. And next morning he went
    to work, &ldquo;labouring&rdquo; for the Oracle.</p>
  <p>The Oracle and his mates, being small contractors and not pressed for time,
    had dispensed with the services of a labourer, and had done their own mixing
    and hod-carrying in turns. They didn&rsquo;t want a labourer now, but the
    Oracle was a vague fatalist, and Mitchell a decided one. So it passed.</p>
  <p>The Oracle had a &ldquo;Case&rdquo; right under his nose&mdash;in his own
    employ, in fact; but was not aware of the fact until Mitchell drew his attention
    to it. The Case went by the name of Alfred O&rsquo;Briar&mdash;which hinted
    a mixed parentage. He was a small, nervous working-man, of no particular
    colour, and no decided character, apparently. If he had a soul above bricks,
    he never betrayed it. He was not popular on the jobs. There was something
    sly about Alf, they said.</p>
  <p>The Oracle had taken him on in the first place as a day-labourer, but afterwards
    shared the pay with him as with Mitchell. O&rsquo;Briar shouted&mdash;judiciously,
    but on every possible occasion&mdash;for the Oracle; and, as he was an indifferent
    workman, the boys said he only did this so that the Oracle might keep him
    on. If O&rsquo;Briar took things easy and did no more than the rest of us,
    at least one of us would be sure to get it into his head that he was loafing
    on us; and if he grafted harder than we did, we&rsquo;d be sure to feel indignant
    about that too, and reckon that it was done out of nastiness or crawlsomeness,
    and feel a contempt for him accordingly. We found out accidentally that O&rsquo;Briar
    was an excellent mimic and a bit of a ventriloquist, but he never entertained
    us with his peculiar gifts; and we set that down to churlishness.</p>
  <p>O&rsquo;Briar kept his own counsel, and his history, if he had one; and
    hid his hopes, joys, and sorrows, if he had any, behind a vacant grin, as
    Mitchell hid his behind a quizzical one. He never resented alleged satire&mdash;perhaps
    he couldn&rsquo;t see it&mdash;and therefore he got the name of being a cur.
    As a rule, he was careful with his money, and was called mean&mdash;not,
    however, by the Oracle, whose philosophy was simple, and whose sympathy could
    not realise a limit; nor yet by Mitchell. Mitchell waited.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>O&rsquo;Briar occupied a small tent by himself, and lived privately of evenings.
    When we began to hear two men talking at night in his tent, we were rather
    surprised, and wondered in a vague kind of way how any of the chaps could
    take sufficient interest in Alf to go in and yarn with him. In the days when
    he was supposed to be sociable, we had voted him a bore; even the Oracle
    was moved to admit that he was &ldquo;a bit slow&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>But late one night we distinctly heard a woman&rsquo;s voice in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s
    tent. The Oracle suddenly became hard of hearing, and, though we heard the
    voice on several occasions, he remained exasperatingly deaf, yet aggressively
    unconscious of the fact. &ldquo;I have got enough to do puzzling over me
    own whys and wherefores,&rdquo; he said. Mitchell began to take some interest
    in O&rsquo;Briar, and treated him with greater respect. But our camp had
    the name of being the best-constructed, the cleanest, and the most respectable
    in the vicinity. The health officer and constable in charge had complimented
    us on the fact, and we were proud of it. And there were three young married
    couples in camp, also a Darby and Joan; therefore, when the voice of a woman
    began to be heard frequently and at disreputable hours of the night in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s
    tent, we got uneasy about it. And when the constable who was on night duty
    gave us a friendly hint, Mitchell and I agreed that something must be done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Av coorse, men will be men,&rdquo; said the constable, as he turned
    his horse&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;but I thought I&rsquo;d mention it. O&rsquo;Briar
    is a dacent man, and he&rsquo;s one of yer mates. Av coorse. There&rsquo;s
    a bad lot in that camp in the scrub over yander, and&mdash;av coorse. Good-day
    to ye, byes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Next night we heard the voice in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s tent again, and decided
    to speak to Alf in a friendly way about it in the morning. We listened outside
    in the dark, but could not distinguish the words, though I thought I recognised
    the voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hussy from the camp over there; she&rsquo;s got holt
    of that fool, and she&rsquo;ll clean him out before she&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; I
    said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Alf&rsquo;s mates, any way it goes, and we ought
    to put a stop to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hussy?&rdquo; asked Mitchell; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s three or
    four there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one with her hair all over her head,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where else should it be?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
    just have a peep and see who it is. There&rsquo;s no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He crept up to the tent and cautiously moved the flap. Alf&rsquo;s candle
    was alight; he lay on his back in his bunk with his arms under his head,
    calmly smoking. We withdrew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They must have heard us,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s
    slipped out under the tent at the back, and through the fence into the scrub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s respect for Alf increased visibly.</p>
  <p>But we began to hear ominous whispers from the young married couples, and
    next Saturday night, which was pay-night, we decided to see it through. We
    did not care to speak to Alf until we were sure. He stayed in camp, as he
    often did, on Saturday evening, while the others went up town. Mitchell and
    I returned earlier than usual, and leaned on the fence at the back of Alf&rsquo;s
    tent.</p>
  <p>We were scarcely there when we were startled by a &ldquo;rat-tat-tat&rdquo; as
    of someone knocking at a door. Then an old woman&rsquo;s voice <i>inside</i> the
    tent asked: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Alf&rsquo;s voice from the front, &ldquo;Mr.
    O&rsquo;Briar from Perth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, go and open the door!&rdquo; said the old woman. (Mitchell
    nudged me to keep quiet.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;Come
    in. How do you do? When did you get back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only last night,&rdquo; said Alf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that now! Bless us all! And how did you like the country
    at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care much for it,&rdquo; said Alf. We lost the thread
    of it until the old woman spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you had your tea, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo; (Mitchell trod
    on my foot.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you have a drop of whisky or a glass of beer, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a glass of beer, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There seemed to be a long pause. Then the old woman said, &ldquo;Ah, well,
    I must get my work done, and Mary will stop here and keep you company, Mr.
    O&rsquo;Breer.&rdquo; The arrangement seemed satisfactory to all parties,
    for there was nothing more said for a while. (Mitchell nudged me again, with
    emphasis, and I kicked his shin.)</p>
  <p>Presently Alf said: &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; And a girl&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;Yes,
    Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember the night I went away, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Alf, I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have travelled long ways since then, Mary; I worked hard and lived
    close. I didn&rsquo;t make my fortune, but I managed to rub a note or two
    together. It was a hard time and a lonesome time for me, Mary. The summer&rsquo;s
    awful over there, and livin&rsquo;s bad and dear. You couldn&rsquo;t have
    any idea of it, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come back so well off as I expected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t matter, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got heart-sick and tired of it, and couldn&rsquo;t stand it any
    longer, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all over now, Alf; you mustn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your mother wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know she did&rdquo;&mdash;(very low and gently).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you know what she put in it, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you ask her to put it in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all true, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, but the silence seemed satisfactory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And be sure you have yourself down here on Sunday, Alf, me son.&rdquo;  (&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    the old woman come back!&rdquo; said Mitchell.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; since the girl&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to have ye, and the
    ould woman&rsquo;s willin&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s me hand on it, Alf,
    me boy. An&rsquo; God bless ye both.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s come
    now,&rdquo; said Mitchell.)</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Mitchell, leading the way to the front of
    the tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t like to intrude on them. It&rsquo;s hardly right,
    Mitchell, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He tapped the tent
    pole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Alf. Alf was lying on his bunk as before, with
    his arms under his head. His face wore a cheerful, not to say happy, expression.
    There was no one else in the tent. I was never more surprised in my life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got the paper, Alf?&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ll find it there at the foot of the bunk. There it
    is. Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;We brought you a bottle
    of ale. We&rsquo;re just going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And we said &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said to Mitchell
    when we got inside, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of it at all,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Do
    you mean to say you can&rsquo;t see it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m dashed if I can,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Some of us must
    be drunk, I think, or getting rats. It&rsquo;s not to be wondered at, and
    the sooner we get out of this country the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you must be a fool, Joe,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    you see? <i>Alf thinks aloud</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talks to himself. He was thinking about going back to his sweetheart.
    Don&rsquo;t you know he&rsquo;s a bit of a ventriloquist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lay awake a long time, in the position that Alf usually lay in,
    and thought. Perhaps he thought on the same lines as Alf did that night.
    But Mitchell did his thinking in silence.</p>
  <p>We thought it best to tell the Oracle quietly. He was deeply interested,
    but not surprised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd of such cases before,&rdquo; he
    said. But the Oracle was a gentleman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s things that a
    man wants to keep to himself that ain&rsquo;t his business,&rdquo; he said.
    And we understood this remark to be intended for our benefit, and to indicate
    a course of action upon which the Oracle had decided, with respect to this
    case, and which we, in his opinion, should do well to follow.</p>
  <p>Alf got away a week or so later, and we all took a holiday and went down
    to Fremantle to see him off. Perhaps he wondered why Mitchell gripped his
    hand so hard and wished him luck so earnestly, and was surprised when he
    gave him three cheers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; remarked Mitchell, as we turned up the wharf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd of such cases before,&rdquo; said the Oracle, meditatively.  &ldquo;They
    ain&rsquo;t common, but I&rsquo;ve hear&rsquo;d of such cases before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">A Sketch of Poor-Class Maoris</p>
  <p>The new native-school teacher, who was &ldquo;green&rdquo;, &ldquo;soft&rdquo;,
    and poetical, and had a literary ambition, called her &ldquo;August&rdquo;,
    and fondly hoped to build a romance on her character. She was down in the
    school registers as Sarah Moses, Maori, 16 years and three months. She looked
    twenty; but this was nothing, insomuch as the mother of the youngest child
    in the school&mdash;a dear little half-caste lady of two or three summers&mdash;had
    not herself the vaguest idea of the child&rsquo;s age, nor anybody else&rsquo;s,
    nor of ages in the abstract. The church register was lost some six years
    before, when &ldquo;Granny&rdquo;, who was a hundred, if a day, was supposed
    to be about twenty-five. The teacher had to guess the ages of all the new
    pupils.</p>
  <p>August was apparently the oldest in the school&mdash;a big, ungainly, awkward
    girl, with a heavy negro type of Maori countenance, and about as much animation,
    mentally or physically, as a cow. She was given to brooding; in fact, she
    brooded all the time. She brooded all day over her school work, but did it
    fairly well. How the previous teachers had taught her all she knew was a
    mystery to the new one. There had been a tragedy in August&rsquo;s family
    when she was a child, and the affair seemed to have cast a gloom over the
    lives of the entire family, for the lowering brooding cloud was on all their
    faces. August would take to the bush when things went wrong at home, and
    climb a tree and brood till she was found and coaxed home. Things, according
    to pa gossip, had gone wrong with her from the date of the tragedy, when
    she, a bright little girl, was taken&mdash;a homeless orphan&mdash;to live
    with a sister, and, afterwards, with an aunt-by-marriage. They treated her, &rsquo;twas
    said, with a brutality which must have been greatly exaggerated by pa-gossip,
    seeing that unkindness of this description is, according to all the best
    authorities, altogether foreign to Maori nature.</p>
  <p>Pa-gossip&mdash;which is less reliable than the ordinary washerwoman kind,
    because of a deeper and more vicious ignorance&mdash;had it that one time
    when August was punished by a teacher (or beaten by her sister or aunt-by-marriage)
    she &ldquo;took to the bush&rdquo; for three days, at the expiration of which
    time she was found on the ground in an exhausted condition. She was evidently
    a true Maori or savage, and this was one of the reasons why the teacher with
    the literary ambition took an interest in her. She had a print of a portrait
    of a man in soldier&rsquo;s uniform, taken from a copy of the <i>Illustrated
    London News</i>, pasted over the fireplace in the whare where she lived,
    and neatly bordered by vandyked strips of silvered tea-paper. She had pasted
    it in the place of honour, or as near as she could get to it. The place of
    honour was sacred to framed representations of the Nativity and Catholic
    subjects, half-modelled, half-pictured. The print was a portrait of the last
    Czar of Russia, of all the men in the world; and August was reported to have
    said that she loved that man. His father had been murdered, so had her mother.
    This was one of the reasons why the teacher with the literary ambition thought
    he could get a romance out of her.</p>
  <p>After the first week she hung round the new schoolmistress, dog-like&mdash;with &ldquo;dog-like
    affection&rdquo;, thought the teacher. She came down often during the holidays,
    and hung about the verandah and back door for an hour or so; then, by-and-bye,
    she&rsquo;d be gone. Her brooding seemed less aggressive on such occasions.
    The teacher reckoned that she had something on her mind, and wanted to open
    her heart to &ldquo;the wife&rdquo;, but was too ignorant or too shy, poor
    girl; and he reckoned, from his theory of Maori character, that it might
    take her weeks, or months, to come to the point. One day, after a great deal
    of encouragement, she explained that she felt &ldquo;so awfully lonely, Mrs.
    Lorrens.&rdquo;  All the other girls were away, and she wished it was school-time.</p>
  <p>She was happy and cheerful again, in her brooding way, in the playground.
    There was something sadly ludicrous about her great, ungainly figure slopping
    round above the children at play. The schoolmistress took her into the parlour,
    gave her tea and cake, and was kind to her; and she took it all with broody
    cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>One Sunday morning she came down to the cottage and sat on the edge of the
    verandah, looking as wretchedly miserable as a girl could. She was in rags&mdash;at
    least, she had a rag of a dress on&mdash;and was barefooted and bareheaded.
    She said that her aunt had turned her out, and she was going to walk down
    the coast to Whale Bay to her grandmother&mdash;a long day&rsquo;s ride.
    The teacher was troubled, because he was undecided what to do. He had to
    be careful to avoid any unpleasantness arising out of Maori cliquism. As
    the teacher he couldn&rsquo;t let her go in the state she was in; from the
    depths of his greenness he trusted her, from the depths of his softness he
    pitied her; his poetic nature was fiercely indignant on account of the poor
    girl&rsquo;s wrongs, and the wife spoke for her. Then he thought of his unwritten
    romance, and regarded August in the light of copy, and that settled it. While
    he talked the matter over with his wife, August &ldquo;hid in the dark of
    her hair,&rdquo; awaiting her doom. The teacher put his hat on, walked up
    to the pa, and saw her aunt. She denied that she had turned August out, but
    the teacher believed the girl. He explained his position, in words simplified
    for Maori comprehension, and the aunt and relations said they understood,
    and that he was &ldquo;perfectly right, Mr. Lorrens.&rdquo;  They were very
    respectful. The teacher said that if August would not return home, he was
    willing to let her stay at the cottage until such time as her uncle, who
    was absent, returned, and he (the teacher) could talk the matter over with
    him. The relations thought that that was the very best thing that could be
    done, and thanked him. The aunt, two sisters, and as many of the others,
    including the children, as were within sight or hail at the time&mdash;most
    of them could not by any possible means have had the slightest connection
    with the business in hand&mdash;accompanied the teacher to the cottage. August
    took to the flax directly she caught sight of her relations, and was with
    difficulty induced to return. There was a lot of talk in Maori, during which
    the girl and her aunt shuffled and swung round at the back of each other,
    and each talked over her shoulder, and laughed foolishly and awkwardly once
    or twice; but in the end the girl was sullenly determined not to return home,
    so it was decided that she should stay. The schoolmistress made tea.</p>
  <p>August brightened from the first day. She was a different girl altogether. &ldquo;I
    never saw such a change in a girl,&rdquo; said the young schoolmistress,
    and one or two others. &ldquo;I always thought she was a good girl if taken
    the right way; all she wanted was a change and kind treatment.&rdquo; But
    the stolid old Maori chairman of the school committee only shrugged his shoulders
    and said (when the schoolmistress, woman-like, pressed him for an opinion
    to agree with her own), &ldquo;You can look at it two ways, Mrs. Lorrens.&rdquo; Which,
    by the way, was about the only expression of opinion that the teacher was
    ever able to get out of him on any subject.</p>
  <p>August worked and behaved well. She was wonderfully quick in picking up
    English ways and housework. True, she was awkward and not over cleanly in
    some things, but her mistress had patience with her. Who wouldn&rsquo;t have?
    She &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t do enough&rdquo; for her benefactress; she hung
    on her words and sat at her footstool of evenings in a way that gladdened
    the teacher&rsquo;s sentimental nature; she couldn&rsquo;t bear to see him
    help his wife with a hat-pin or button&mdash;August must do it. She insisted
    on doing her mistress&rsquo; hair every night. In short, she tried in every
    way to show her gratitude. The teacher and his wife smiled brightly at each
    other behind her back, and thought how cheerful the house was since she came,
    and wondered what they&rsquo;d do without her. It was a settled thing that
    they should take her back to the city with them, and have a faithful and
    grateful retainer all their lives and a sort of Aunt Chloe for their children,
    when they had any. The teacher got yards of copy out of her for his &ldquo;Maori
    Sketches and Characters&rdquo;, worked joyously at his romance, and felt
    great already, and was happy. She had a bed made up temporarily (until the
    teacher could get a spring mattress for her from town) on the floor in the
    dining-room, and when she&rsquo;d made her bed she&rsquo;d squat on it in
    front of the fire and sing Maori songs in a soft voice. She&rsquo;d sing
    the teacher and his wife, in the next room, to sleep. Then she&rsquo;d get
    up and have a feed, but they never heard her.</p>
  <p>Her manners at the table (for she was treated &ldquo;like one of themselves&rdquo; in
    the broadest sense of the term) were surprisingly good, considering that
    the adults of her people were decidedly cow-like in white society, and scoffed
    sea-eggs, shell-fish, and mutton-birds at home with a gallop which was not
    edifying. Her appetite, it was true, was painful at times to the poetic side
    of the teacher&rsquo;s nature; but he supposed that she&rsquo;d been half-starved
    at home, poor girl, and would get over it. Anyway, the copy he&rsquo;d get
    out of her would repay him for this and other expenses a hundredfold. Moreover,
    begging and borrowing had ceased with her advent, and the teacher set this
    down to her influence.</p>
  <p>The first jar came when she was sent on horseback to the town for groceries,
    and didn&rsquo;t get back till late the next day. She explained that some
    of her relations got hold of her and made her stay, and wanted her to go
    into public-houses with them, but she wouldn&rsquo;t. She said that <i>she</i> wanted
    to come home. But why didn&rsquo;t she? The teacher let it pass, and hoped
    she&rsquo;d gain strength of character by-and-bye. He had waited up late
    the night before with her supper on the hob; and he and his wife had been
    anxious for fear something had happened to the poor girl who was under their
    care. He had walked to the treacherous river-ford several times during the
    evening, and waited there for her. So perhaps he was tired, and that was
    why he didn&rsquo;t write next night.</p>
  <p>The sugar-bag, the onion-basket, the potato-bag and the tea-chest began
    to &ldquo;go down&rdquo; alarmingly, and an occasional pound of candles,
    a pigeon, a mutton-bird (plucked and ready for Sunday&rsquo;s cooking), and
    other little trifles went, also. August couldn&rsquo;t understand it, and
    the teacher believed her, for falsehood and deceit are foreign to the simple
    natures of the modern Maoris. There were no cats; but no score of ordinary
    cats could have given colour to the cat theory, had it been raised in this
    case. The breath of August advertised onions more than once, but no human
    stomach could have accounted for the quantity. She surely could not have
    eaten the other things raw&mdash;and she had no opportunities for private
    cooking, as far as the teacher and his wife could see. The other Maoris were
    out of the question; they were all strictly honest.</p>
  <p>Thefts and annoyances of the above description were credited to the &ldquo;swaggies&rdquo; who
    infested the roads, and had a very bad name down that way; so the teacher
    loaded his gun, and told August to rouse him at once, if she heard a sound
    in the night. She said she would; but a heavy-weight &ldquo;swaggie&rdquo;  could
    have come in and sat on her and had a smoke without waking her.</p>
  <p>She couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to go a message. She&rsquo;d take from three
    to six hours, and come back with an excuse that sounded genuine from its
    very simplicity. Another sister of hers lay ill in an isolated hut, alone
    and uncared for, except by the teacher&rsquo;s wife, and occasionally by
    a poor pa outcast who had negro blood in her veins, and a love for a white
    loafer. God help her! All of which sounds strange, considering that Maoris
    are very kind to each other. The schoolmistress sent August one night to
    stay with the sick Maori woman and help her as she could, and gave her strict
    instructions to come to the cottage first thing in the morning, and tell
    her how the sick woman was. August turned up at lunch-time next day. The
    teacher gave her her first lecture, and said plainly that he wasn&rsquo;t
    to be taken for a fool; then he stepped aside to get cool, and, when he returned,
    the girl was sobbing as if her heart would break, and the wife comforting
    her. She had been up all night, poor girl, and was thoroughly worn out. Somehow
    the teacher didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable about it. He went down to the
    whare. August had not touched a dishcloth or broom. She had slept, as she
    always did, like a pig, all night, while her sister lay and tossed in agony;
    in the morning she ate everything there was to eat in the house (which, it
    seemed, was the Maori way of showing sympathy in sickness and trouble), after
    which she brooded by the fire till the children, running out of school, announced
    the teacher&rsquo;s lunch hour.</p>
  <p>August braced up again for a little while. The master thought of the trouble
    they had with Ayacanora in &ldquo;Westward Ho&rdquo;, and was comforted,
    and tackled his romance again. Then the schoolmistress fell sick and things
    went wrong. The groceries went down faster than ever, and the house got very
    dirty, and began to have a native smell about it. August grew fat, and lazy,
    and dirty, and less reliable on washing-days, or when there was anything
    special to do in the house. &ldquo;The savage blood is strong,&rdquo; thought
    the teacher, &ldquo;and she is beginning to long for her own people and free
    unconventional life.&rdquo; One morning&mdash;on a washing-day, too, as it
    happened&mdash;she called out, before the teacher and his wife were up, that
    the Maoris who supplied them with milk were away, and she had promised to
    go up and milk the cow and bring the milk down. The teacher gave her permission.
    One of the scholars usually brought the milk early. Lunch time came and no
    August, no milk&mdash;strangest of all, only half the school children. The
    teacher put on his hat, and went up to the pa once more. He found August
    squatted in the midst of a circle of relations. She was entertaining them
    with one of a series of idealistic sketches of the teacher&rsquo;s domestic
    life, in which she showed a very vivid imagination, and exhibited an unaccountable
    savage sort of pessimism. Her intervals of absence had been occupied in this
    way from the first. The astounding slanders she had circulated concerning
    the teacher&rsquo;s private life came back, bit by bit, to his ears for a
    year afterwards, and her character sketches of previous teachers, and her
    own relations&mdash;for she spared nobody&mdash;would have earned a white
    woman a long and well-merited term of imprisonment for criminal libel. She
    had cunningly, by straightforward and unscrupulous lying, prejudiced the
    principal mother and boss woman of the pa against the teacher and his wife;
    as a natural result of which the old lady, who, like the rest, was very ignorant
    and ungrateful,  &ldquo;turned nasty&rdquo; and kept the children from school.
    The teacher lost his temper, so the children were rounded up and hurried
    down to school immediately; with them came August and her aunt, with alleged
    explanations and excuses, and a shell-fish. The aunt and sisters said they&rsquo;d
    have nothing to do with August. They didn&rsquo;t want her and wouldn&rsquo;t
    have her. The teacher said that, under those circumstances, she&rsquo;d better
    go and drown herself; so she went home with them.</p>
  <p>The whole business had been a plot by her nearest relations. They got rid
    of the trouble and expense of keeping her, and the bother of borrowing in
    person, whenever in need of trifles in the grocery line. Borrowing recommenced
    with her dismissal; but the teacher put a full stop to it, as far as he was
    concerned. Then August, egged on by her aunt, sent a blackguardly letter
    to the teacher&rsquo;s wife; the sick sister, by the way, who had been nursed
    and supplied with food by her all along, was in it, and said she was glad
    August sent the letter, and it served the schoolmistress right. The teacher
    went up to the pa once more; an hour later, August in person, accompanied,
    as usual, by a relation or two, delivered at the cottage an abject apology
    in writing, the composition of which would have discouraged the most enthusiastic
    advocate of higher education for the lower classes.</p>
  <p>Then various petty annoyances were tried. The teacher is firmly convinced
    that certain animal-like sounds round the house at night were due to August&rsquo;s
    trying to find out whether his wife was as likely to be haunted as the Maoris
    were. He didn&rsquo;t dream of such a thing at the time, for he did not believe
    that one of them had the pluck to venture out after dark. But savage superstition
    must give way to savage hate. The girl&rsquo;s last &ldquo;try-on&rdquo; was
    to come down to the school fence, and ostentatiously sharpen a table-knife
    on the wires, while she scowled murderously in the direction of the schoolmistress,
    who was hanging out her washing. August looked, in her dark, bushy, Maori
    hair, a thoroughly wild savage. Her father had murdered her mother under
    particularly brutal circumstances, and the daughter took after her father.</p>
  <p>The teacher called her and said: &ldquo;Now, look here, my lady, the best
    thing you can do is to drop that nonsense at once&rdquo; (she had dropped
    the knife in the ferns behind her), &ldquo;for we&rsquo;re the wrong sort
    of people to try it on with. Now you get out of this and tell your aunt&mdash;she&rsquo;s
    sneaking there in the flax&mdash;what I tell you, and that she&rsquo;d better
    clear out of this quick, or I&rsquo;ll have a policeman out and take the
    whole gang into town in an hour. Now be off, and shut that gate behind you,
    carefully, and fasten it.&rdquo; She did, and went.</p>
  <p>The worst of it was that the August romance copy was useless. Her lies were
    even less reliable and picturesque than the common Jones Alley hag lie. Then
    the teacher thought of the soft fool he&rsquo;d been, and that made him wild.
    He looked like a fool, and was one to a great extent, but it wasn&rsquo;t
    good policy to take him for one.</p>
  <p>Strange to say, he and others had reason to believe that August respected
    him, and liked him rather than otherwise; but she hated his wife, who had
    been kind to her, as only a savage can hate. The younger pupils told the
    teacher, cheerfully and confidently, that August said she&rsquo;d cut Mrs.
    Lorrens&rsquo;  throat the first chance she got. Next week the aunt sent
    down to ask if the teacher could sell her a bar of soap, and sent the same
    old shilling; he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front of him, so he
    took it, put it in his pocket, and sent the soap. This must have discouraged
    them, for the borrowing industry petered out. He saw the aunt later on, and
    she told him, cheerfully, that August was going to live with a half-caste
    in a certain house in town.</p>
  <p>Poor August! For she was only a tool after all. Her &ldquo;romance&rdquo; was
    briefly as follows:&mdash;She went, per off-hand Maori arrangement, as &lsquo;housekeeper&rsquo;  in
    the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring saw-mill. She stayed three months,
    for a wonder; at the expiration of which time she put on her hat and explained
    that she was tired of stopping there, and was going home. He said, &lsquo;All
    right, Sarah, wait a while and I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rsquo; At the door
    of her aunt&rsquo;s house he said, &lsquo;Well, good-bye, Sarah,&rsquo; and
    she said, in her brooding way, &lsquo;Good-bye, Jim.&rsquo; And that was
    all.</p>
  <p>As the last apparent result of August&rsquo;s mischief-making, her brother
    or someone one evening rode up to the cottage, drunk and inclined to bluster.
    He was accompanied by a friend, also drunk, who came to see the fun, and
    was ready to use his influence on the winning side. The teacher went inside,
    brought out his gun, and slipped two cartridges in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
    enough of this,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Now then, be off, you insolent blackguards,
    or I&rsquo;ll shoot you like rabbits. Go!&rdquo; and he snapped his jaw and
    the breech of his gun together. As they rode off, the old local hawk happened
    to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the garden, and
    the teacher, who had been &ldquo;laying&rdquo;  for him a long time, let
    fly both barrels at him, without thinking. When he turned, there was only
    a cloud of dust down the track.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter, without a hitch.
    But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines. And, for years after
    he had gone, his name was spoken of with great respect by the Maoris.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="NewYearsNight"></a>New Year&rsquo;s Night</b></h2>
  <p>It was dark enough for anything in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gap&mdash;a round, warm,
    close darkness, in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly
    at a distance of a hundred yards or so, instead of growing faint and fainter,
    and dying away, to strike the ear once or twice again&mdash;and after minutes,
    it might seem&mdash;with startling distinctness, before being finally lost
    in the distance, as it is on clear, frosty nights. So with the sounds of
    horses&rsquo; hoofs, stumbling on the rough bridle-track through the &ldquo;saddle&rdquo;,
    the clatter of hoof-clipped stones and scrape of gravel down the hidden &ldquo;siding&rdquo;,
    and the low sound of men&rsquo;s voices, blurred and speaking in monosyllables
    and at intervals it seemed, and in hushed, awed tones, as though they carried
    a corpse. To practical eyes, grown used to such a darkness, and at the nearest
    point, the passing blurs would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading
    a third with an empty saddle on its back&mdash;a lady&rsquo;s or &ldquo;side-saddle&rdquo;,
    if one could have distinguished the horns. They may have struck a soft track
    or level, or rounded the buttress of the hill higher up, but before they
    had time to reach or round the foot of the spur, blurs, whispers, stumble
    and clatter of hoofs, jingle of bridle rings, and the occasional clank together
    of stirrup irons, seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as though a
    great sound-proof door had swung to behind them.</p>
  <p>It was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow or &ldquo;pocket&rdquo;,
    between two spurs, at the head of a blind gully behind Mount Buckaroo, where
    there was a more or less dusty patch, barely defined even in broad daylight
    by a spidery dog-legged fence on three sides, and a thin  &ldquo;two-rail&rdquo; (dignified
    with the adjective &ldquo;split-rail&rdquo;&mdash;though rails and posts
    were mostly of saplings split in halves) running along the frontage. In about
    the middle of it a little slab hut, overshadowed by a big stringy-bark shed,
    was pointed out as Johnny Mears&rsquo;s Farm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Black as&mdash;as charcoal,&rdquo; said Johnny Mears. He had never
    seen coal, and was a cautious man, whose ideas came slowly. He stooped, close
    by the fence, with his hands on his knees, to &ldquo;sky&rdquo; the loom
    of his big shed and so get his bearings. He had been to have a look at the
    penned calves, and see that all slip-rails were up and pegged, for the words
    of John Mears junior, especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in
    injured tones, were not to be relied upon in these matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle,&rdquo; said
    Johnny Mears to his wife, who sat on a three-legged stool by the rough table
    in the little whitewashed &ldquo;end-room&rdquo;, putting a patch of patches
    over the seat of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers. He lit his pipe, moved
    a stool to the side of the great empty fireplace, where it looked cooler&mdash;might
    have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the presence
    of the chimney, and where, therefore, he felt a breath cooler. He took his
    fiddle from a convenient shelf, tuned it slowly and carefully, holding his
    pipe (in his mouth) well up and to one side, as if the fiddle were an inquisitive
    and restless baby. He played &ldquo;Little Drops o&rsquo; Brandy&rdquo; three
    times, right through, without variations, blinking solemnly the while; then
    he put the violin carefully back in its box, and started to cut up another
    pipeful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have gone, Johnny,&rdquo; said the haggard little woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rackin&rsquo; the horse out a night like this,&rdquo; retorted Johnny, &ldquo;and
    startin&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo; to-morrow. It ain&rsquo;t worth while. Let
    them come for me if they want me. Dance on a night like this! Why! they&rsquo;ll
    dance in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you promised. It won&rsquo;t do you no good, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do me no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little woman went on stitching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s smotherin&rsquo; hot,&rdquo; said Johnny, with an impatient
    oath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll turn in, or turn out,
    under the shed to-night. It&rsquo;s too d&mdash;d hot to roost indoors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent her head lower over the patch. One smoked and the other stitched
    in silence for twenty minutes or so, during which time Johnny might be supposed
    to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether he&rsquo;d camp out on
    account of the heat, or turn in. But he broke the silence with a clout at
    a mosquito on the nape of his neck, and a bad word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t swear so much, Johnny,&rdquo; she said
    wearily&mdash;&ldquo;at least not to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at her blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why to-night? What&rsquo;s the matter with you to-night,
    Mary? What&rsquo;s to-night more than any other night to you? I see no harm&mdash;can&rsquo;t
    a man swear when a mosquito sticks him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was only thinking of the boys, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boys! Why, they&rsquo;re both on the hay in the shed.&rdquo; He
    stared at her again, shifted uneasily, crossed the other leg tightly, frowned,
    blinked, and reached for the matches. &ldquo;You look a bit off-colour, Mary.
    It&rsquo;s the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times. Better put that
    by and have a swill o&rsquo;  oatmeal and water, and turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to go to bed. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I&rsquo;m
    all right. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just finish this. Just reach me a
    drink from the water-bag&mdash;the pannikin&rsquo;s on the hob there, by
    your boot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He scratched his head helplessly, and reached for the drink. When he sat
    down again, he felt strangely restless. &ldquo;Like a hen that didn&rsquo;t
    know where to lay,&rdquo; he put it. He couldn&rsquo;t settle down or keep
    still, and didn&rsquo;t seem to enjoy his pipe somehow. He rubbed his head
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thunderstorm comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    what it is; and the sooner it comes the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went to the back door, and stared at the blackness to the east, and,
    sure enough, lightning was blinking there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming, sure enough; just hang out and keep cool for another
    hour, and you&rsquo;ll feel the difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down again on the three-legged stool, folded his arms, with his elbows
    on his knees, drew a long breath, and blinked at the clay floor for a while;
    then he twisted the stool round on one leg, until he faced the old-fashioned
    spired wooden clock (the brass disc of the pendulum moving ghost-like through
    a scarred and scratched marine scene&mdash;Margate in England&mdash;on the
    glass that covered the lower half) that stood alone on the slab shelf over
    the fireplace. The hands indicated half-past two, and Johnny, who had studied
    that clock and could &ldquo;hit the time nigh enough by it,&rdquo; after
    knitting his brows and blinking at the dial for a full minute by its own
    hand, decided &ldquo;that it must be getting on toward nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It must have been the heat. Johnny stood up, raking his hair, turned to
    the door and back again, and then, after an impatient gesture, took up his
    fiddle and raised it to his shoulder. Then the queer thing happened. He said
    afterwards, under conditions favourable to such sentimental confidence, that
    a cold hand seemed to take hold of the bow, through his, and&mdash;anyway,
    before he knew what he was about he had played the first bars of &ldquo;When
    First I Met Sweet Peggy&rdquo;, a tune he had played often, twenty years
    before, in his courting days, and had never happened to play since. He sawed
    it right through (the cold hand left after the first bar or two) standing
    up; then still stood with fiddle and bow trembling in his hands, with the
    queer feeling still on him, and a rush of old thoughts going through his
    head, all of which he set down afterwards to the effect of the heat. He put
    the fiddle away hastily, damning the bridge of it at the same time in loud
    but hurried tones, with the idea of covering any eccentricity which the wife
    might have noticed in his actions. &ldquo;Must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got a touch
    o&rsquo; sun,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. He sat down, fumbled with knife,
    pipe, and tobacco, and presently stole a furtive glance over his shoulder
    at his wife.</p>
  <p>The washed-out little woman was still sewing, but stitching blindly, for
    great tears were rolling down her worn cheeks.</p>
  <p>Johnny, white-faced on account of the heat, stood close behind her, one
    hand on her shoulder and the other clenched on the table; but the clenched
    hand shook as badly as the loose one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! What is the matter, Mary? You&rsquo;re sick!&rdquo; (They
    had had little or no experience of illness.) &ldquo;Tell me, Mary&mdash;come
    now! Has the boys been up to anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Johnny; it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it then? You&rsquo;re taken sick! What have you been doing
    with yourself? It might be fever. Hold up a minute. You wait here quiet while
    I roost out the boys and send &rsquo;em for the doctor and someone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! I&rsquo;m not sick, John. It&rsquo;s only a turn. I&rsquo;ll
    be all right in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shifted his hand to her head, which she dropped suddenly, with a life-weary
    sigh, against his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; cried Johnny, wildly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you faint
    or go into disterricks, Mary! It&rsquo;ll upset the boys; think of the boys!
    It&rsquo;s only the heat&mdash;you&rsquo;re only takin&rsquo; queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that; you ought to know me better than that. It was&mdash;I&mdash;Johnny,
    I was only thinking&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been married twenty years to-night&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    New Year&rsquo;s Night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never thought of it!&rdquo; said Johnny (in the afterwards).  &ldquo;Shows
    what a God-forgotten selection will make of a man. She&rsquo;d thought of
    it all the time, and was waiting for it to strike me. Why! I&rsquo;d agreed
    to go and play at a darnce at Old Pipeclay School-house all night&mdash;that
    very night&mdash;and leave her at home because she hadn&rsquo;t asked to
    come; and it never struck me to ask her&mdash;at home by herself in that
    hole&mdash;for twenty-five bob. And I only stopped at home because I&rsquo;d
    got the hump, and knew they&rsquo;d want me bad at the school.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They sat close together on the long stool by the table, shy and awkward
    at first; and she clung to him at opening of thunder, and they started apart
    guiltily when the first great drops sounded like footsteps on the gravel
    outside, just as they&rsquo;d done one night-time before&mdash;twenty years
    before.</p>
  <p>If it was dark before, it was black now. The edge of the awful storm-cloud
    rushed up and under the original darkness like the best &ldquo;drop&rdquo;  black-brushed
    over the cheap &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; variety, turning it grey by contrast. The
    deluge lasted only a quarter of an hour; but it cleared the night, and did
    its work. There was hail before it, too&mdash;big as emu eggs, the boys said&mdash;that
    lay feet deep in the old diggers&rsquo; holes on Pipeclay for days afterwards&mdash;weeks
    some said.</p>
  <p>The two sweethearts of twenty years ago and to-night watched the retreat
    of the storm, and, seeing Mount Buckaroo standing clear, they went to the
    back door, which opened opposite the end of the shed, and saw to the east
    a glorious arch of steel-blue, starry sky, with the distant peaks showing
    clear and blue away back under the far-away stars in the depth of it.</p>
  <p>They lingered awhile&mdash;arms round each other&rsquo;s waists&mdash;before
    she called the boys, just as they had done this time of night twenty years
    ago, after the boys&rsquo; grandmother had called her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awlright, mother!&rdquo; bawled back the boys, with unfilial independence
    of Australian youth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re awlright! We&rsquo;ll be in directly!
    Wasn&rsquo;t it a pelterer, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They went in and sat down again. The embarrassment began to wear off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out of this, Mary,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take Mason&rsquo;s offer for the cattle and things, and take that job of
    Dawson&rsquo;s, boss or no boss&rdquo;&mdash;(Johnny&rsquo;s bad luck was
    due to his inability in the past to &ldquo;get on&rdquo; with any boss for
    any reasonable length of time)&mdash;&ldquo;I can get the boys on, too. They&rsquo;re
    doing no good here, and growing up. It ain&rsquo;t doing justice to them;
    and, what&rsquo;s more, this life is killin&rsquo; you, Mary. That settles
    it! I was blind. Let the jumpt-up selection go! It&rsquo;s making a wall-eyed
    bullock of me, Mary&mdash;a dry-rotted rag of a wall-eyed bullock like Jimmy
    Nowlett&rsquo;s old Strawberry. And you&rsquo;ll live in town like a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somebody coming!&rdquo; yelled the boys.</p>
  <p>There was a clatter of sliprails hurriedly thrown down, and clipped by horses&rsquo; hoofs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insoide there! Is that you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; (&ldquo;I knew they&rsquo;d come for you,&rdquo; said
    Mrs. Mears to Johnny.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come, Johnny. There&rsquo;s no get out of it.
    Here&rsquo;s Jim Mason with me, and we&rsquo;ve got orders to stun you and
    pack you if you show fight. The blessed fiddler from Mudgee didn&rsquo;t
    turn up. Dave Regan burst his concertina, and they&rsquo;re in a fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t leave the missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;ve got the school missus&rsquo;s
    mare and side-saddle. She says you ought to be jolly well ashamed of yourself,
    Johnny Mears, for not bringing your wife on New Year&rsquo;s Night. And so
    you ought!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Johnny did not look shame-faced, for reasons unknown to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boys couldn&rsquo;t find the horses,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Mears. &ldquo;Johnny
    was just going down the gully again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave her a grateful look, and felt a strange, new thrill of admiration
    for his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;there&rsquo;s a bottle of the best put by for you, Johnny,&rdquo; added
    Pat McDurmer, mistaking Johnny&rsquo;s silence; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll call
    it thirty bob!&rdquo;  (Johnny&rsquo;s ideas were coming slowly again, after
    the recent rush.) &ldquo;Or&mdash;two quid!&mdash;there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want two quid, nor one either, for taking my wife to
    a dance on New Year&rsquo;s Night!&rdquo; said Johnny Mears. &ldquo;Run and
    put on your best bib and tucker, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she hurried to dress as eager and excited, and smiling to herself as
    girlishly as she had done on such occasions on evenings before the bright
    New Year&rsquo;s Night twenty years ago.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BlackJoe"></a>Black Joe</b></h2>
  <p>They called him Black Joe, and me White Joe, by way of distinction and for
    the convenience of his boss (my uncle), and my aunt, and mother; so, when
    we heard the cry of &ldquo;Bla-a-ack Joe!&rdquo; (the adjective drawn out
    until it became a screech, after several repetitions, and the &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; short
    and sharp) coming across the flat in a woman&rsquo;s voice, Joe knew that
    the missus wanted him at the house, to get wood or water, or mind the baby,
    and he kept carefully out of sight; he went at once when uncle called. And
    when we heard the cry of  &ldquo;Wh-i-i-te Joe!&rdquo; which we did with
    difficulty and after several tries&mdash;though Black Joe&rsquo;s ears were
    of the keenest&mdash;we knew that I was overdue at home, or absent without
    leave, and was probably in for a warming, as the old folk called it. On some
    occasions I postponed the warming as long as my stomach held out, which was
    a good while in five-corner, native-cherry, or yam season&mdash;but the warming
    was none the cooler for being postponed.</p>
  <p>Sometimes Joe heard the wrong adjective, or led me to believe he did&mdash;and
    left me for a whole afternoon under the impression that the race of Ham was
    in demand at the homestead, when I myself was wanted there, and maternal
    wrath was increasing every moment of my absence.</p>
  <p>But Joe knew that my conscience was not so elastic as his, and&mdash;well,
    you must expect little things like this in all friendships.</p>
  <p>Black Joe was somewhere between nine and twelve when I first met him, on
    a visit to my uncle&rsquo;s station; I was somewhere in those years too.
    He was very black, the darker for being engaged in the interesting but uncertain
    occupation of &ldquo;burning off&rdquo; in his spare time&mdash;which wasn&rsquo;t
    particularly limited. He combined shepherding, &rsquo;possum and kangaroo
    hunting, crawfishing, sleeping, and various other occupations and engagements
    with that of burning off. I was very white, being a sickly town boy; but,
    as I took great interest in burning off, and was not particularly fond of
    cold water&mdash;it was in winter time&mdash;the difference in our complexions
    was not so marked at times.</p>
  <p>Black Joe&rsquo;s father, old Black Jimmie, lived in a gunyah on the rise
    at the back of the sheepyards, and shepherded for my uncle. He was a gentle,
    good-humoured, easy-going old fellow with a pleasant smile; which description
    applies, I think, to most old blackfellows in civilisation. I was very partial
    to the old man, and chummy with him, and used to slip away from the homestead
    whenever I could, and squat by the campfire along with the other piccaninnies,
    and think, and yarn socially with Black Jimmie by the hour. I would give
    something to remember those conversations now. Sometimes somebody would be
    sent to bring me home, when it got too late, and Black Jimmie would say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Piccaninnie alonga possum rug,&rdquo; and there I&rsquo;d be, sound
    asleep, with the other young Australians.</p>
  <p>I liked Black Jimmie very much, and would willingly have adopted him as
    a father. I should have been quite content to spend my days in the scrub,
    enjoying life in dark and savage ways, and my nights &ldquo;alonga possum
    rug&rdquo;; but the family had other plans for my future.</p>
  <p>It was a case of two blackfellows and one gin, when Black Jimmie went a-wooing&mdash;about
    twelve years before I made his acquaintance&mdash;and he fought for his bride
    in the black fashion. It was the last affair of that kind in the district.
    My uncle&rsquo;s brother professed to have been present at the fight, and
    gave me an alleged description of it. He said that they drew lots, and Black
    Jimmie put his hands on his knees and bent his head, and the other blackfellow
    hit him a whack on the skull with a nulla nulla. Then they had a nip of rum
    all round&mdash;Black Jimmie must have wanted it, for the nulla nulla was
    knotted, and heavy, and made in the most approved fashion. Then the other
    blackfellow bent his head, and Jimmie took the club and returned the whack
    with interest. Then the other fellow hit Jimmie a lick, and took a clout
    in return. Then they had another drink, and continued thus until Jimmie&rsquo;s
    rival lost all heart and interest in the business. But you couldn&rsquo;t
    take everything my uncle&rsquo;s brother said for granted.</p>
  <p>Black Mary was a queen by right, and had the reputation of being the cleanest
    gin in the district; she was a great favourite with the squatters&rsquo;  wives
    round there. Perhaps she hoped to reclaim Jimmie&mdash;he was royal, too,
    but held easy views with regard to religion and the conventionalities of
    civilisation. Mary insisted on being married properly by a clergyman, made
    the old man build a decent hut, had all her children christened, and kept
    him and them clean and tidy up to the time of her death.</p>
  <p>Poor Queen Mary was ambitious. She started to educate her children, and
    when they got beyond her&mdash;that is when they had learnt their letters&mdash;she
    was grateful for any assistance from the good-natured bush men and women
    of her acquaintance. She had decided to get her eldest boy into the mounted
    police, and had plans for the rest, and she worked hard for them, too. Jimmie
    offered no opposition, and gave her no assistance beyond the rations and
    money he earned shepherding&mdash;which was as much as could be expected
    of him.</p>
  <p>He did as many husbands do &ldquo;for the sake of peace and quietness&rdquo;&mdash;he
    drifted along in the wake of his wife, and took things as easily as her schemes
    of reformation and education would allow him to.</p>
  <p>Queen Mary died before her time, respected by all who knew or had heard
    of her. The nearest squatter&rsquo;s wife sent a pair of sheets for a shroud,
    with instructions to lay Mary out, and arranged (by bush telegraph) to drive
    over next morning with her sister-in-law and two other white women in the
    vicinity, to see Mary decently buried.</p>
  <p>But the remnant of Jimmie&rsquo;s tribe were there beforehand. They tore
    the sheets in strips and tied Mary up in a bundle, with her chin to her knees&mdash;preparing
    her for burial in their own fashion&mdash;and mourned all night in whitewash
    and ashes. At least, the gins did. The white women saw that it was hopeless
    to attempt to untie any of the innumerable knots and double knots, even if
    it had been possible to lay Mary out afterwards; so they had to let her be
    buried as she was, with black and white obsequies. And we&rsquo;ve got no
    interest in believing that she did not &ldquo;jump up white woman&rdquo; long
    ago.</p>
  <p>My uncle and his brother took the two eldest boys. Black Jimmie shifted
    away from the hut at once with the rest of his family&mdash;for the  &ldquo;devil-devil&rdquo; sat
    down there&mdash;and Mary&rsquo;s name was strictly &ldquo;tabooed&rdquo; in
    accordance with aboriginal etiquette.</p>
  <p>Jimmie drifted back towards the graves of his fathers in company with a
    decreasing flock of sheep day by day (for the house of my uncle had fallen
    on times of drought and depression, and foot-rot and wool rings, and over-drafts
    and bank owners), and a few strips of bark, a dying fire, a black pipe, some
    greasy &rsquo;possum rugs and blankets, a litter of kangaroo tails, etc.,
    four neglected piccaninnies, half a score of mangy mongrels, and, haply,
    a  &ldquo;lilly drap o&rsquo; rum&rdquo;, by night.</p>
  <p>The four little Australians grew dirtier and more shy and savage, and ate
    underdone kangaroo and &rsquo;possum and native bear, with an occasional
    treat of oak grubs and goanna by preference&mdash;and died out, one by one,
    as blacks do when brought within the ever widening circle of civilisation.
    Jimmie moved promptly after each death, and left the evil one in possession,
    and built another mia-mia&mdash;each one being less pretentious than the
    last. Finally he was left, the last of his tribe, to mourn his lot in solitude.</p>
  <p>But the devil-devil came and sat down by King Jimmie&rsquo;s side one night,
    so he, too, moved out across the Old Man border, and the mia-mia rotted into
    the ground and the grass grew there.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>I admired Joe; I thought him wiser and cleverer than any white boy in the
    world. He could smell out &rsquo;possums unerringly, and I firmly believed
    he could see yards through the muddiest of dam water; for once, when I dropped
    my boat in, and was not sure of the spot, he fished it out first try. With
    cotton reels and bits of stick and bark he would make the model of a station
    homestead, slaughter-yards, sheep-yards, and all complete, working in ideas
    and improvements of his own which might have been put into practice with
    advantage. He was a most original and interesting liar upon all subjects
    upon which he was ignorant and which came up incidentally. He gave me a very
    interesting account of an interview between his father and Queen Victoria,
    and mentioned casually that his father had walked across the Thames without
    getting wet.</p>
  <p>He also told me how he, Joe, had tied a mounted trooper to a verandah post
    and thrashed him with pine saplings until the timber gave out and he was
    tired. I questioned Jimmie, but the incidents seemed to have escaped the
    old king&rsquo;s memory.</p>
  <p>Joe could build bigger woodheaps with less wood than any black or white
    tramp or loafer round there. He was a born architect. He took a world of
    pains with his wood-heaps&mdash;he built them hollow, in the shape of a break-wind,
    with the convex side towards the house for the benefit of his employers.
    Joe was easy-going; he had inherited a love of peace and quietness from his
    father. Uncle generally came home after dark, and Joe would have little fires
    lit at safe distances all round the house, in order to convey an impression
    that the burning off was proceeding satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>When the warm weather came, Joe and I got into trouble with an old hag for
    bathing in a waterhole in the creek in front of her shanty, and she impounded
    portions of our wardrobe. We shouldn&rsquo;t have lost much if she had taken
    it all; but our sense of injury was deep, especially as she used very bad
    grammar towards us.</p>
  <p>Joe addressed her from the safe side of the water. He said, &ldquo;Look
    here! Old leather-face, sugar-eye, plar-bag marmy, I call it you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plar-bag marmy&rdquo; meant &ldquo;Mother Flour-bag&rdquo;, and ration
    sugar was decidedly muddy in appearance.</p>
  <p>She came round the waterhole with a clothes prop, and made good time, too;
    but we got across and away with our clothes.</p>
  <p>That little incident might have changed the whole course of my existence.
    Plar-bag Marmy made a formal complaint to uncle, who happened to pass there
    on horseback about an hour later; and the same evening Joe&rsquo;s latest
    and most carefully planned wood heap collapsed while aunt was pulling a stick
    out of it in the dark, and it gave her a bad scare, the results of which
    might have been serious.</p>
  <p>So uncle gave us a thrashing, without the slightest regard for racial distinctions,
    and sent us to bed without our suppers.</p>
  <p>We sought Jimmie&rsquo;s camp, but Joe got neither sympathy nor damper from
    his father, and I was sent home with a fatherly lecture &ldquo;for going
    alonga that fella,&rdquo; meaning Joe.</p>
  <p>Joe and I discussed existence at a waterhole down the creek next afternoon,
    over a billy of crawfish which we had boiled and a piece of gritty damper,
    and decided to retire beyond the settled districts&mdash;some five hundred
    miles or so&mdash;to a place that Joe said he knew of, where there were lagoons
    and billabongs ten miles wide, alive with ducks and fish, and black cockatoos
    and kangaroos and wombats, that only waited to be knocked over with a stick.</p>
  <p>I thought I might as well start and be a blackfellow at once, so we got
    a rusty pan without a handle, and cooked about a pint of fat yellow oak-grubs;
    and I was about to fall to when we were discovered, and the full weight of
    combined family influence was brought to bear on the situation. We had broken
    a new pair of shears digging out those grubs from under the bark of the she-oaks,
    and had each taken a blade as his own especial property, which we thought
    was the best thing to do under the circumstances. Uncle wanted those shears
    badly, so he received us with the buggy whip&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t draw
    the colour line either. All that night and next day I wished he had. I was
    sent home, and Joe went droving with uncle soon after that, else I might
    have lived a life of freedom and content and died out peacefully with the
    last of my adopted tribe.</p>
  <p>Joe died of consumption on the track. When he was dying uncle asked: &ldquo;Is
    there anything you would like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Joe said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a lilly drap o&rsquo; rum, boss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which were his last words, for he drank the rum and died peacefully.</p>
  <p>I was the first to hear the news at home, and, being still a youngster,
    I ran to the house, crying &ldquo;Oh, mother! aunt&rsquo;s Joe is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were visitors at our place at the time, and, as the eldest child of
    the maternal aunt in question had also been christened Joe&mdash;after a
    grandfather of our tribe (my tribe, not Black Joe&rsquo;s)&mdash;the news
    caused a sudden and unpleasant sensation. But cross-examination explained
    the mistake, and I retired to the rear of the pig-sty, as was my custom when
    things went wrong, with another cause for grief.</p>

  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Seems to me that honest, hard-working men seem to
      accumulate the heaviest swags of trouble in this world.&rdquo;&mdash;Steelman.</i></p>
  <p align="center" class="note">Told by Mitchell&rsquo;s Mate.</p>
  <p>We were coming back from West Australia, steerage&mdash;Mitchell, the Oracle,
    and I. I had gone over saloon, with a few pounds in my pocket. Mitchell said
    this was a great mistake&mdash;I should have gone over steerage with nothing
    but the clothes I stood upright in, and come back saloon with a pile. He
    said it was a very common mistake that men made, but, as far as his experience
    went, there always seemed to be a deep-rooted popular prejudice in favour
    of going away from home with a few pounds in one&rsquo;s pocket and coming
    back stumped; at least amongst rovers and vagabonds like ourselves&mdash;it
    wasn&rsquo;t so generally popular or admired at home, or in the places we
    came back to, as it was in the places we went to. Anyway it went, there wasn&rsquo;t
    the slightest doubt that our nearest and dearest friends were, as a rule,
    in favour of our taking away as little as we could possibly manage with,
    and coming back with a pile, whether we came back saloon or not; and that
    ought to settle the matter as far as any chap that had the slightest consideration
    for his friends or family was concerned.</p>
  <p>There was a good deal of misery, underneath, coming home in that steerage.
    One man had had his hand crushed and amputated out Coolgardie way, and the
    stump had mortified, and he was being sent to Melbourne by his mates. Some
    had lost their money, some a couple of years of their life, some their souls;
    but none seemed to have lost the heart to call up the quiet grin that southern
    rovers, vagabonds, travellers for &ldquo;graft&rdquo; or fortune, and professional
    wanderers wear in front of it all. Except one man&mdash;an elderly eastern
    digger&mdash;he had lost his wife in Sydney while he was away.</p>
  <p>They sent him a wire to the Boulder Soak, or somewhere out back of White
    Feather, to say that his wife was seriously ill; but the wire went wrong,
    somehow, after the manner of telegrams not connected with mining, on the
    lines of &ldquo;the Western&rdquo;. They sent him a wire to say that his
    wife was dead, and that reached him all right&mdash;only a week late.</p>
  <p>I can imagine it. He got the message at dinner-time, or when they came back
    to the camp. His mate wanted him to sit in the shade, or lie in the tent,
    while he got the billy boiled. &ldquo;You must brace up and pull yourself
    together, Tom, for the sake of the youngsters.&rdquo; And Tom for long intervals
    goes walking up and down, up and down, by the camp&mdash;under the brassy
    sky or the gloaming&mdash;under the brilliant star-clusters that hang over
    the desert plain, but never raising his eyes to them; kicking a tuft of grass
    or a hole in the sand now and then, and seeming to watch the progress of
    the track he is tramping out. The wife of twenty years was with him&mdash;though
    two thousand miles away&mdash;till that message came.</p>
  <p>I can imagine Tom sitting with his mates round the billy, they talking in
    quiet, subdued tones about the track, the departure of coaches, trains and
    boats&mdash;arranging for Tom&rsquo;s journey East, and the working of the
    claim in his absence. Or Tom lying on his back in his bunk, with his hands
    under his head and his eyes fixed on the calico above&mdash;thinking, thinking,
    thinking. Thinking, with a touch of his boyhood&rsquo;s faith perhaps; or
    wondering what he had done in his long, hard-working married life, that God
    should do this thing to him now, of all times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best take what money we have in the camp, Tom; you&rsquo;ll
    want it all ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the time you get back from Sydney, and we
    can fix it up arterwards.... There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; clean shirts
    o&rsquo; mine&mdash;you&rsquo;d best take &rsquo;em&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want &rsquo;em
    on the voyage.... You might as well take them there new pants o&rsquo; mine,
    they&rsquo;ll only dry-rot out here&mdash;and the coat, too, if you like&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    too small for me, anyway. You won&rsquo;t have any time in Perth, and you&rsquo;ll
    want some decent togs to land with in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; cared so much if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; seen
    the last of her,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet, patient voice, to us one night
    by the rail. &ldquo;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo;  liked to have seen the last
    of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you been long in the West?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over two years. I made up to take a run across last Christmas, and
    have a look at &rsquo;em. But I couldn&rsquo;t very well get away when &lsquo;exemption-time&rsquo;  came.
    I didn&rsquo;t like to leave the claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do any good over there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things brightened up a bit the last month or two. I had a hard
    pull at first; landed without a penny, and had to send back every shilling
    I could rake up to get things straightened up a bit at home. Then the eldest
    boy fell ill, and then the baby. I&rsquo;d reckoned on bringing &rsquo;em
    over to Perth or Coolgardie when the cool weather came, and having them somewheres
    near me, where I could go and have a look at &rsquo;em now and then, and
    look after them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going back to the West again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I must go for the sake of the youngsters. But I don&rsquo;t
    seem to have much heart in it.&rdquo; He smoked awhile. &ldquo;Over twenty
    years we struggled along together&mdash;the missus and me&mdash;and it seems
    hard that I couldn&rsquo;t see the last of her. It&rsquo;s rough on a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The world is damned rough on a man sometimes,&rdquo; said Mitchell,  &ldquo;most
    especially when he least deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The digger crossed his arms on the rail like an old &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; at
    the fence in the cool of the evening, yarning with an old crony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mor&rsquo;n twenty years she stuck to me and struggled along by my
    side. She never give in. I&rsquo;ll swear she was on her feet till the last,
    with her sleeves tucked up&mdash;bustlin&rsquo; round.... And just when things
    was brightening and I saw a chance of giving her a bit of a rest and comfort
    for the end of her life.... I thought of it all only t&rsquo;other week when
    things was clearing up ahead; and the last &lsquo;order&rsquo; I sent over
    I set to work and wrote her a long letter, putting all the good news and
    encouragement I could think of into it. I thought how that letter would brighten
    up things at home, and how she&rsquo;d read it round. I thought of lots of
    things that a man never gets time to think of while his nose is kept to the
    grindstone. And she was dead and in her grave, and I never knowed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell dug his elbow into my ribs and made signs for the matches to light
    his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yer never knowed,&rdquo; reflected the Oracle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I always had an idea when there was trouble at home,&rdquo; the
    digger went on presently, in his quiet, patient tone. &ldquo;I always knowed;
    I always had a kind of feeling that way&mdash;I felt it&mdash;no matter how
    far I was away. When the youngsters was sick I knowed it, and I expected
    the letter that come. About a fortnight ago I had a feeling that way when
    the wife was ill. The very stars out there on the desert by the Boulder Soak
    seemed to say: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s trouble at home. Go home. There&rsquo;s
    trouble at home.&rsquo; But I never dreamed what that trouble was. One night
    I did make up my mind to start in the morning, but when the morning came
    I hadn&rsquo;t an excuse, and was ashamed to tell my mates the truth. They
    might have thought I was going ratty, like a good many go out there.&rdquo; Then
    he broke off with a sort of laugh, as if it just struck him that we might
    think he was a bit off his head, or that his talk was getting uncomfortable
    for us. &ldquo;Curious, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me of a case I knowed,&mdash;&rdquo; commenced the Oracle,
    after a pause.</p>
  <p>I could have pitched him overboard; but that was a mistake. He and the old
    digger sat on the for&rsquo;ard hatch half the night yarning, mostly about
    queer starts, and rum go&rsquo;s, and curious cases the Oracle had knowed,
    and I think the Oracle did him a lot of good somehow, for he seemed more
    cheerful in the morning.</p>
  <p>We were overcrowded in the steerage, but Mitchell managed to give up his
    berth to the old digger without letting him know it. Most of the chaps seemed
    anxious to make a place at the first table and pass the first helpings of
    the dishes to the &ldquo;old cove that had lost his missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all seemed to forget him as we entered the Heads; they had their own
    troubles to attend to. They were in the shadow of the shame of coming back
    hard up, and the grins began to grow faint and sickly. But I didn&rsquo;t
    forget him. I wish sometimes that I didn&rsquo;t take so much notice of things.</p>
  <p>There was no mistaking them&mdash;the little group that stood apart near
    the end of the wharf, dressed in cheap black. There was the eldest single
    sister&mdash;thin, pale, and haggard-looking&mdash;that had had all the hard
    worry in the family till her temper was spoilt, as you could see by the peevish,
    irritable lines in her face. She had to be the mother of them all now, and
    had never known, perhaps, what it was to be a girl or a sweetheart. She gave
    a hard, mechanical sort of smile when she saw her father, and then stood
    looking at the boat in a vacant, hopeless sort of way. There was the baby,
    that he saw now for the first time, crowing and jumping at the sight of the
    boat coming in; there was the eldest boy, looking awkward and out of place
    in his new slop-suit of black, shifting round uneasily, and looking anywhere
    but at his father. But the little girl was the worst, and a pretty little
    girl she was, too; she never took her streaming eyes off her father&rsquo;s
    face the whole time. You could see that her little heart was bursting, and
    with pity for him. They were too far apart to speak to each other as yet.
    The boat seemed a cruel long long time swinging alongside&mdash;I wished
    they&rsquo;d hurry up. He&rsquo;d brought his traps up early, and laid &rsquo;em
    on the deck under the rail; he stood very quiet with his hands behind him,
    looking at his children. He had a strong, square, workman&rsquo;s face, but
    I could see his chin and mouth quivering under the stubbly, iron-grey beard,
    and the lump working in his throat; and one strong hand gripped the other
    very tight behind, but his eyelids never quivered&mdash;only his eyes seemed
    to grow more and more sad and lonesome. These are the sort of long, cruel
    moments when a man sits or stands very tight and quiet and calm-looking,
    with his whole past life going whirling through his brain, year after year,
    and over and over again. Just as the digger seemed about to speak to them
    he met the brimming eyes of his little girl turned up to his face. He looked
    at her for a moment, and then turned suddenly and went below as if pretending
    to go down for his things. I noticed that Mitchell&mdash;who hadn&rsquo;t
    seemed to be noticing anything in particular&mdash;followed him down. When
    they came on deck again we were right alongside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Nell!&rdquo; said the digger to the eldest daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, father!&rdquo; she said, with a sort of gasp, but trying
    to smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jack, how are you getting on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, father,&rdquo; said the boy, brightening up, and seeming
    greatly relieved.</p>
  <p>He looked down at the little girl with a smile that I can&rsquo;t describe,
    but didn&rsquo;t speak to her. She still stood with quivering chin and mouth
    and great brimming eyes upturned, full of such pity as I never saw before
    in a child-face&mdash;pity for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can get ashore now,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;see, they&rsquo;ve
    got the gangway out aft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently I saw Mitchell with the portmanteau in his hand, and the baby
    on his arm, steering them away to a quiet corner of the shed at the top of
    the wharf. The digger had the little girl in his arms, and both hers were
    round his neck, and her face hidden on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>When Mitchell came back, he leant on the rail for a while by my side, as
    if it was a boundary fence out back, and there was no hurry to break up camp
    and make a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you follow him below that time for, Mitchell?&rdquo; I asked
    presently, for want of something better to say.</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked at me out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to score a drink!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought he wanted
    one and wouldn&rsquo;t like to be a Jimmy Woodser.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SeeingtheLastofYou"></a>Seeing the Last of You</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re going away by boat,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you
    ought to say good-bye to the women at home, and to the chaps at the last
    pub. I hate waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boat&rsquo;s behind
    time. There&rsquo;s no sense in it, and a lot of unnecessary misery. Your
    friends wait on the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the bitter end,
    just when they and you most want a spell. And why? Some of them hang out
    because they love you, and want to see the last of you; some because they
    don&rsquo;t like you to see them going away without seeing the last of you;
    and you hang out mostly because it would hurt &rsquo;em if you went below
    and didn&rsquo;t give them a chance of seeing the last of you all the time&mdash;and
    you curse the boat and wish to God it would start. And those who love you
    most&mdash;the women-folk of the family&mdash;and who are making all the
    fuss and breaking their hearts about having to see the last of you, and least
    want to do it&mdash;they hang out the longest, and are the most determined
    to see it. Where&rsquo;s the sense in it? What&rsquo;s the good of seeing
    the last of you? How do women manage to get consolation out of a thing like
    that?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But women get consolation out of queer things sometimes,&rdquo; he
    added reflectively, &ldquo;and so do men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember when I was knocking about the coasts, an old aunt of mine
    always persisted in coming down to see the last of me, and bringing the whole
    family too&mdash;no matter if I was only going away for a month. I was her
    favourite. I always turned up again in a few months; but if I&rsquo;d come
    back every next boat it wouldn&rsquo;t have made the slightest difference
    to her. She&rsquo;d say that I mightn&rsquo;t come back some day, and then
    she&rsquo;d never forgive herself nor the family for not seeing me off. I
    suppose she&rsquo;ll see the end of me yet if she lives long enough&mdash;and
    she&rsquo;s a wiry old lady of the old school. She was old-fashioned and
    dressed like a fright, they said at home. They hated being seen in public
    with her; to tell the truth, I felt a bit ashamed, too, at times. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be, now. When I&rsquo;d get her off on to the wharf I&rsquo;d be overcome
    with my feelings, and have to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my
    emotions till the boat was going. And she&rsquo;d stand on the end of the
    pier and wave her handkerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she was
    removed by force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless her old heart! There wasn&rsquo;t so much affection wasted
    on me at home that I felt crowded by hers; and I never lost anything by her
    seeing the last of me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do wish the Oracle would stop that confounded fiddle of his&mdash;it
    makes you think over damned old things.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoBoysatGrinderBrothers"></a>Two Boys at Grinder
      Brothers&rsquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Five or six half-grown larrikins sat on the cemented sill of the big window
    of Grinder Bros.&rsquo; Railway Coach Factory waiting for the work bell,
    and one of the number was Bill Anderson&mdash;known as &ldquo;Carstor Hoil&rdquo;&mdash;a
    young terror of fourteen or fifteen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes Balmy Arvie,&rdquo; exclaimed Bill as a pale, timid-looking
    little fellow rounded the corner and stood against the wall by the door. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
    your parents, Balmy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy made no answer; he shrank closer to the entrance. The first bell
    went.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What yer got for dinner, Balmy? Bread &rsquo;n&rsquo; treacle?&rdquo; asked
    the young ruffian; then for the edification of his chums he snatched the
    boy&rsquo;s dinner bag and emptied its contents on the pavement.</p>
  <p>The door opened. Arvie gathered up his lunch, took his time-ticket, and
    hurried in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Balmy,&rdquo; said one of the smiths as he passed, &ldquo;what
    do you think of the boat race?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the boy, goaded to reply, &ldquo;that it would
    be better if young fellows of this country didn&rsquo;t think so much about
    racin&rsquo; an&rsquo; fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The questioner stared blankly for a moment, then laughed suddenly in the
    boy&rsquo;s face, and turned away. The rest grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie&rsquo;s getting balmier than ever,&rdquo; guffawed young Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Carstor Hoil,&rdquo; cried one of the smiths&rsquo; strikers, &ldquo;how
    much oil will you take for a chew of terbaccer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teaspoonful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s see the chew, first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get it. What yer frighten&rsquo; of?... Come on,
    chaps, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  see Bill drink oil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill measured out some machine oil and drank it. He got the tobacco, and
    the others got what they called &ldquo;the fun of seein&rsquo; Bill drink
    oil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The second bell rang, and Bill went up to the other end of the shop, where
    Arvie was already at work sweeping shavings from under a bench.</p>
  <p>The young terror seated himself on the end of this bench, drummed his heels
    against the leg, and whistled. He was in no hurry, for his foreman had not
    yet arrived. He amused himself by lazily tossing chips at Arvie, who made
    no protest for a while. &ldquo;It would be&mdash;better&mdash;for this country,&rdquo; said
    the young terror, reflectively and abstractedly, cocking his eye at the whitewashed
    roof beams and feeling behind him on the bench for a heavier chip&mdash;&ldquo;it
    would be better&mdash;for this country&mdash;if young fellers didn&rsquo;t
    think so much about&mdash;about&mdash;racin&rsquo;&mdash;<i>and</i> fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You let me alone,&rdquo; said Arvie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo; exclaimed Bill, bringing his eye
    down with feigned surprise. Then, in an indignant tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    mind takin&rsquo; a fall out of yer, now, if yer like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Arvie went on with his work. Bill tossed all the chips within reach, and
    then sat carelessly watching some men at work, and whistling the  &ldquo;Dead
    March&rdquo;. Presently he asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name, Balmy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t yer answer a civil question? I&rsquo;d soon knock the
    sulks out of yer if I was yer father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Arvie; you know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie Aspinall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill cocked his eye at the roof and thought a while and whistled; then he
    said suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Balmy, where d&rsquo;yer live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jones&rsquo; Alley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jones&rsquo; Alley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A short, low whistle from Bill. &ldquo;What house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garn! What yer giv&rsquo;nus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth. What&rsquo;s there funny about it? What
    do I want to tell you a lie for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, we lived there once, Balmy. Old folks livin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother is; father&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill scratched the back of his head, protruded his under lip, and reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Arvie, what did yer father die of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heart disease. He dropped down dead at his work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long, low, intense whistle from Bill. He wrinkled his forehead and stared
    up at the beams as if he expected to see something unusual there. After a
    while he said, very impressively: &ldquo;So did mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coincidence hadn&rsquo;t done striking him yet; he wrestled with it
    for nearly a minute longer. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose yer mother goes out washin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; cleans offices?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does mine. Any brothers &rsquo;n&rsquo; sisters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two&mdash;one brother &rsquo;n&rsquo; one sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill looked relieved&mdash;for some reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got nine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yours younger&rsquo;n you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lot of bother with the landlord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a good lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had any bailiffs in yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They compared notes a while longer, and tailed off into a silence which
    lasted three minutes and grew awkward towards the end.</p>
  <p>Bill fidgeted about on the bench, reached round for a chip, but recollected
    himself. Then he cocked his eye at the roof once more and whistled, twirling
    a shaving round his fingers the while. At last he tore the shaving in two,
    jerked it impatiently from him, and said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Arvie! I&rsquo;m sorry I knocked over yer barrer yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This knocked Bill out the first round. He rubbed round uneasily on the bench,
    fidgeted with the vise, drummed his fingers, whistled, and finally thrust
    his hands in his pockets and dropped on his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Arvie!&rdquo; he said in low, hurried tones. &ldquo;Keep
    close to me goin&rsquo; out to-night, &rsquo;n&rsquo; if any of the other
    chaps touches yer or says anything to yer I&rsquo;ll hit &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he swung himself round the corner of a carriage &ldquo;body&rdquo; and
    was gone.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Arvie was late out of the shop that evening. His boss was a sub-contractor
    for the coach-painting, and always tried to find twenty minutes&rsquo;  work
    for his boys just about five or ten minutes before the bell rang. He employed
    boys because they were cheap and he had a lot of rough work, and they could
    get under floors and &ldquo;bogies&rdquo; with their pots and brushes, and
    do all the  &ldquo;priming&rdquo; and paint the trucks. His name was Collins,
    and the boys were called  &ldquo;Collins&rsquo; Babies&rdquo;. It was a joke
    in the shop that he had a &ldquo;weaning&rdquo; contract. The boys were all &ldquo;over
    fourteen&rdquo;, of course, because of the Education Act. Some were nine
    or ten&mdash;wages from five shillings to ten shillings. It didn&rsquo;t
    matter to Grinder Brothers so long as the contracts were completed and the
    dividends paid. Collins preached in the park every Sunday. But this has nothing
    to do with the story.</p>
  <p>When Arvie came out it was beginning to rain and the hands had all gone
    except Bill, who stood with his back to a verandah-post, spitting with very
    fair success at the ragged toe of one boot. He looked up, nodded carelessly
    at Arvie, and then made a dive for a passing lorry, on the end of which he
    disappeared round the next corner, unsuspected by the driver, who sat in
    front with his pipe in his mouth and a bag over his shoulders.</p>
  <p>Arvie started home with his heart and mind pretty full, and a stronger,
    stranger aversion to ever going back to the shop again. This new, unexpected,
    and unsought-for friendship embarrassed the poor lonely child. It wasn&rsquo;t
    welcome.</p>
  <p>But he never went back. He got wet going home, and that night he was a dying
    child. He had been ill all the time, and Collins was one &ldquo;baby&rdquo;  short
    next day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSelectorsDaughter"></a>The Selector&rsquo;s
      Daughter</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I.</b></h3>
  <p>She rode slowly down the steep siding from the main road to a track in the
    bed of the Long Gully, the old grey horse picking his way zig-zag fashion.
    She was about seventeen, slight in figure, and had a pretty freckled face
    with a pathetically drooping mouth, and big sad brown eyes. She wore a faded
    print dress, with an old black riding skirt drawn over it, and her head was
    hidden in one of those ugly, old-fashioned white hoods, which, seen from
    the rear, always suggest an old woman. She carried several parcels of groceries
    strapped to the front of the dilapidated side-saddle.</p>
  <p>The track skirted a chain of rocky waterholes at the foot of the gully,
    and the girl glanced nervously at these ghastly, evil-looking pools as she
    passed them by. The sun had set, as far as Long Gully was concerned. The
    old horse carefully followed a rough bridle track, which ran up the gully
    now on one side of the watercourse and now on the other; the gully grew deeper
    and darker, and its sullen, scrub-covered sides rose more steeply as he progressed.</p>
  <p>The girl glanced round frequently, as though afraid of someone following
    her. Once she drew rein, and listened to some bush sound.  &ldquo;Kangaroos,&rdquo; she
    murmured; it was only kangaroos. She crossed a dimmed little clearing where
    a farm had been, and entered a thick scrub of box and stringy-bark saplings.
    Suddenly with a heavy thud, thud, an &ldquo;old man&rdquo; kangaroo leapt
    the path in front, startling the girl fearfully, and went up the siding towards
    the peak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she gasped, with her hand on her heart.</p>
  <p>She was very nervous this evening; her heart was hurt now, and she held
    her hand close to it, while tears started from her eyes and glistened in
    the light of the moon, which was rising over the gap ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if I could only go away from the bush!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
  <p>The old horse plodded on, and now and then shook his head&mdash;sadly, it
    seemed&mdash;as if he knew her troubles and was sorry.</p>
  <p>She passed another clearing, and presently came to a small homestead in
    a stringy-bark hollow below a great gap in the ridges&mdash;&ldquo;Deadman&rsquo;s
    Gap&rdquo;. The place was called &ldquo;Deadman&rsquo;s Hollow&rdquo;, and
    looked like it. The  &ldquo;house&rdquo;&mdash;a low, two-roomed affair,
    with skillions&mdash;was built of half-round slabs and stringy-bark, and
    was nearly all roof; the bark, being darkened from recent rain, gave it a
    drearier appearance than usual.</p>
  <p>A big, coarse-looking youth of about twenty was nailing a green kangaroo
    skin to the slabs; he was out of temper because he had bruised his thumb.
    The girl unstrapped the parcels and carried them in; as she passed her brother,
    she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take the saddle off for me, will you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, carnt yer take it off yerself?&rdquo; he snarled; &ldquo;carnt
    yer see I&rsquo;m busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took off the saddle and bridle, and carried them into a shed, where
    she hung them on a beam. The patient old hack shook himself with an energy
    that seemed ill-advised, considering his age and condition, and went off
    towards the &ldquo;dam&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>An old woman sat in the main room beside a fireplace which took up almost
    the entire end of the house. A plank-table, supported on stakes driven into
    the ground, stood in the middle of the room, and two slab benches were fixtures
    on each side. The floor was clay. All was clean and poverty-stricken; all
    that could be whitewashed was white, and everything that could be washed
    was scrubbed. The slab shelves were covered with clean newspapers, on which
    bright tins, and pannikins, and fragments of crockery were set to the greatest
    advantage. The walls, however, were disfigured by Christmas supplements of
    illustrated journals.</p>
  <p>The girl came in and sat down wearily on a stool opposite to the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you any better, mother?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little, Mary, very little. Have you seen your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might wonder. What&rsquo;s the use of worrying about it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s drinking again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most likely. Worrying yourself to death won&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman sat and moaned about her troubles, as old women do. She had
    plenty to moan about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where your brother Tom is? We haven&rsquo;t heard from him
    for a year now. He must be in trouble again; something tells me he must be
    in trouble again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary swung her hood off into her lap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you worry about it, mother? What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew. I only wish I knew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What good would that do? You know Tom went droving with Fred Dunn,
    and Fred will look after him; and, besides, Tom&rsquo;s older now and got
    more sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you don&rsquo;t care! You don&rsquo;t
    feel it, but I&rsquo;m his mother, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t start that again, mother; it
    hurts me more than you think. I&rsquo;m his sister; I&rsquo;ve suffered enough,
    God knows! Don&rsquo;t make matters worse than they are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes father!&rdquo; shouted one of the children outside, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    bringing home a steer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman sat still, and clasped her hands nervously. Mary tried to
    look cheerful, and moved the saucepan on the fire. A big, dark-bearded man,
    mounted on a small horse, was seen in the twilight driving a steer towards
    the cow-yard. A boy ran to let down the slip-rails.</p>
  <p>Presently Mary and her mother heard the clatter of rails let down and put
    up again, and a minute later a heavy step like the tread of a horse was heard
    outside. The selector lumbered in, threw his hat in a corner, and sat down
    by the table. His wife rose and bustled round with simulated cheerfulness.
    Presently Mary hazarded&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where have you been, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somewheers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a wretched silence, lasting until the old woman took courage to
    say timidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve brought a steer, Wylie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he snapped; the tone seemed defiant.</p>
  <p>The old woman&rsquo;s hands trembled, so that she dropped a cup. Mary turned
    a shade paler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, git me some tea. Git me some <i>tea</i>!&rdquo; shouted Mr.
    Wylie. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to sit here all night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His wife made what haste her nervousness would allow, and they soon sat
    down to tea. Jack, the eldest son, was sulky, and his father muttered something
    about knocking the sulks out of him with an axe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s annoyed you, Jack?&rdquo; asked his mother, humbly.</p>
  <p>He scowled and made no answer.</p>
  <p>The younger children&mdash;three boys and a girl&mdash;began quarrelling
    as soon as they sat down. Wylie yelled at them now and then, and grumbled
    at the cooking, and at his wife for not being able to keep the children quiet.
    It was:  &ldquo;Marther! you didn&rsquo;t put no sugar in my tea.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother,
    Jimmy&rsquo;s got my place; make him move.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mawther! do speak
    to this Fred.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! father, this big brute of a Harry&rsquo;s
    kickin&rsquo; me!&rdquo; And so on.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
  <p>When the miserable meal was over, Wylie got a rope and a butcher&rsquo;s
    knife, and went out to slaughter the steer; but first there was a row, because
    he thought&mdash;or pretended to think&mdash;that somebody had been using
    his knife. He lassoed the beast, drew it up to the rails, and slaughtered
    it.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Jack and his next brother took an old gun, let the dogs loose,
    and went &rsquo;possum shooting.</p>
  <p>Presently Wylie came in again, sat down by the fire, and smoked. The children
    quarrelled over a boy&rsquo;s book; Mrs. Wylie made weak attempts to keep
    the peace, but they took no notice of her. Suddenly her husband rose with
    an oath, seized the novel, and threw it behind the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Git to bed! git to bed!&rdquo; he roared at the children; &ldquo;git
    to bed, or I&rsquo;ll smash your brains with the axe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They got to bed. It was made of saplings and bark, covered with three bushel-bags
    full of straw and old pieces of blanket sewn together. The children quarrelled
    in bed till their father took off his belt and &ldquo;went into&rdquo;  them,
    according to promise. There was a sudden hush, followed by a sound like a
    bird-clapper; then howls; then a peaceful calm fell upon that happy home.</p>
  <p>Wylie went out again, and was absent an hour; on his return he sat by the
    fire and smoked sullenly. After a while he snatched the pipe from his mouth,
    and looked impatiently at the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake, git to bed,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;and
    don&rsquo;t be asittin&rsquo; there like a blarsted funeral! You&rsquo;re
    enough to give a man the dismals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Wylie gathered up her sewing and retired. Then he said to his daughter: &ldquo;You
    come and hold the candle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary put on her hood and followed her father to the yard. The carcase lay
    close to the rails, against which two sheets of bark had been raised as a
    break-wind. The beast had been partly skinned, and a portion of the hide,
    where a brand might have been, was carefully turned back. Mary noticed this
    at once. Her father went on with his work, and occasionally grumbled at her
    for not holding the candle right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you buy the steer, father?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask no questions and hear no lies.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t
    you see it&rsquo;s a clear skin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had a keen sense of humour, and the idea of a &ldquo;&lsquo;clear skin&rsquo;  steer&rdquo; would
    have amused her at any other time. She didn&rsquo;t smile now.</p>
  <p>He turned the carcase over; the loose hide fell back, and the light shone
    on a distinct brand. White as a sheet went Mary&rsquo;s face, and her hand
    trembled so that she nearly let the candle fall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you adoin&rsquo; of now?&rdquo; shouted her father. &ldquo;Hold
    the candle, carn&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re worse than the old woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! the beast is branded! See!&mdash; What does PB stand for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Beggar, like myself. Hold the candle, carn&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and
    hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary was startled again by hearing the tread of a horse, but it was only
    the old grey munching round. Her father finished skinning, and drew the carcase
    up to a make-shift &ldquo;gallows&rdquo;. &ldquo;Now you can go to bed,&rdquo; he
    said, in a gentler tone.</p>
  <p>She went to her bedroom&mdash;a small, low, slab skillion, built on to the
    end of the house&mdash;and fell on her knees by the bunk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God help me! God help us all!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>She lay down, but could not sleep. She was nervously ill&mdash;nearly mad,
    because of the dark, disgraceful cloud of trouble which hung over her home.
    Always in trouble&mdash;always in trouble. It started long ago, when her
    favourite brother Tom ran away. She was little more than a child then, intensely
    sensitive; and when she sat in the old bark school she fancied that the other
    children were thinking or whispering to each other, &ldquo;Her brother&rsquo;s
    in prison! Mary Wylie&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s in prison! Tom Wylie&rsquo;s
    in gaol!&rdquo; She was thinking of it still. They were ever with her, those
    horrible days and nights of the first shadow of shame. She had the same horror
    of evil, the same fearful dread of disgrace that her mother had. She had
    been ambitious; she had managed to read much, and had wild dreams of going
    to the city and rising above the common level, but that was all past now.</p>
  <p>How could she rise when the cruel hand of disgrace was ever ready to drag
    her down at any moment. &ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; she moaned in her misery, &ldquo;if
    we could only be born without kin&mdash;with no one to disgrace us but ourselves!
    It&rsquo;s cruel, God, it&rsquo;s cruel to suffer for the crimes of others!&rdquo; She
    was getting selfish in her troubles&mdash;like her mother. &ldquo;I want
    to go away from the bush and all I know.... O God, help me to go away from
    the bush!&rdquo; Presently she fell asleep&mdash;if sleep it may be called&mdash;and
    dreamt of sailing away, sailing away far out on the sea beyond the horizon
    of her dread. Then came a horrible nightmare, in which she and all her family
    were arrested for a terrible crime. She woke in a fright, and saw a reddish
    glare on the window. Her father was poking round some logs where they had
    been &ldquo;burning-off&rdquo;. A pungent odour came through a broken pane
    and turned her sick. He was burning the hide.</p>
  <p>Wylie did not go to bed that night; he got his breakfast before daylight,
    and rode up through the frosty gap while the stars were still out, carrying
    a bag of beef in front of him on the grey horse. Mary said nothing about
    the previous night. Her mother wondered how much &ldquo;father&rdquo; had
    given for the steer, and supposed he had gone into town to sell the hide;
    the poor soul tried to believe that he had come by the steer honestly. Mary
    fried some meat, and tried to eat it for her mother&rsquo;s sake, but could
    manage only a few mouthfuls. Mrs. Wylie also seemed to have lost her appetite.
    Jack and his brother, who had been out all night, made a hearty breakfast.
    Then Jimmy started to peg out the &rsquo;possum skins, while Jack went to
    look for a missing pony. Mary was left to milk all the cows, and feed the
    calves and pigs.</p>
  <p>Shortly after dinner one of the children ran to the door, and cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, mother&mdash;here&rsquo;s three mounted troopers comin&rsquo; up
    the gully!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried the mother, sinking back in her chair and
    trembling like a leaf. The children ran and hid in the scrub. Mary stood
    up, terribly calm, and waited. The eldest trooper dismounted, came to the
    door, glanced suspiciously at the remains of the meal, and abruptly asked
    the dreaded question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wylie, where&rsquo;s your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She dropped the tea-cup, from which she had pretended to be drinking unconcernedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? Why, what do you want my husband for?&rdquo; she asked in pitiful
    desperation. <i>She</i> looked like the guilty party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know well enough,&rdquo; he sneered impatiently.</p>
  <p>Mary rose and faced him. &ldquo;How dare you talk to my mother like that?&rdquo; she
    cried. &ldquo;If my poor brother Tom was only here&mdash;you&mdash;you coward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The youngest trooper whispered something to his senior, and then, stung
    by a sharp retort, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be a pig.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His two companions passed through into the spare skillion, where they found
    some beef in a cask, and more already salted down under a bag on the end
    of a bench; then they went out at the back and had a look at the cow-yard.
    The younger trooper lingered behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get them up the gully on some excuse,&rdquo; he
    whispered to Mary. &ldquo;You plant the hide before we come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. Look there!&rdquo; She pointed through the doorway.</p>
  <p>The other two were at the logs where the fire had been; the burning hide
    had stuck to the logs in places like glue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wylie&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; remarked the old trooper.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III</b><i>.</i></p>
  <p>Jack disappeared shortly after his father&rsquo;s arrest on a charge of
    horse and cattle-stealing, and Tom, the prodigal, turned up unexpectedly.
    He was different from his father and eldest brother. He had an open good-humoured
    face, and was very kind-hearted; but was subject to peculiar fits of insanity,
    during which he did wild and foolish things for the mere love of notoriety.
    He had two natures&mdash;one bright and good, the other sullen and criminal.
    A taint of madness ran in the family&mdash;came down from drunken and unprincipled
    fathers of dead generations; under different conditions, it might have developed
    into genius in one or two&mdash;in Mary, perhaps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old woman!&rdquo; cried Tom, patting his mother on the
    back.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be happy yet. I&rsquo;ve been wild and foolish,
    I know, and gave you some awful trouble, but that&rsquo;s all done with.
    I mean to keep steady, and by-and-bye we&rsquo;ll go away to Sydney or Queensland.
    Give us a smile, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He got some &ldquo;grubbing&rdquo; to do, and for six months kept the family
    in provisions. Then a change came over him. He became moody and sullen&mdash;even
    brutal. He would sit for hours and grin to himself without any apparent cause;
    then he would stay away from home for days together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s going wrong again,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Wylie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
    get into trouble again, I know he will. We are disgraced enough already,
    God knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your best, mother,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and
    can do no more. People will pity us; after all, the thing itself is not so
    bad as the everlasting dread of it. This will be a lesson for father&mdash;he
    wanted one&mdash;and maybe he&rsquo;ll be a better man.&rdquo; (She knew
    better than that.) &ldquo;<i>You</i> did your best, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Mary! you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve gone through these
    thirty years in the bush with your father. I&rsquo;ve had to go down on my
    knees and beg people not to prosecute him&mdash;and the same with your brother
    Tom; and this is the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better to have let them go, mother; you should have left father when
    you found out what sort of a man he was; it would have been better for all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was my duty to stick by him, child; he was my husband. Your father
    was always a bad man, Mary&mdash;a bad man; I found it out too late. I could
    not tell you a quarter of what I have suffered with him.... I was proud,
    Mary; I wanted my children to be better than others.... It&rsquo;s my fault;
    it&rsquo;s a judgment.... I wanted to make my children better than others....
    I was so proud, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary had a sweetheart, a drover, who was supposed to be in Queensland. He
    had promised to marry her, and take her and her mother away when he returned;
    at least, she had promised to marry him on that condition. He had now been
    absent on his latest trip for nearly six months, and there was no news from
    him. She got a copy of a country paper to look for the &ldquo;stock passings&rdquo;;
    but a startling headline caught her eye:</p>
  <p align="center" class="newspaper">IMPUDENT ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY UNDER ARMS</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;A drover known to the police as Frederick Dunn,
    alias Drew, was arrested last week at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She read to the bitter end, and burned the paper. And the shadow of another
    trouble, darker and drearier than all the rest, was upon her.</p>
  <p>So the little outcast family in Long Gully existed for several months, seeing
    no one save a sympathetic old splitter who would come and smoke his pipe
    by the fire of nights, and try to convince the old woman that matters might
    have been worse, and that she wouldn&rsquo;t worry so much if she knew the
    troubles of some of our biggest families, and that things would come out
    all right and the lesson would do Wylie good. Also, that Tom was a different
    boy altogether, and had more sense than to go wrong again. &ldquo;It was
    nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing; they didn&rsquo;t know what trouble
    was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But one day, when Mary and her mother were alone, the troopers came again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wylie, where&rsquo;s your son Tom?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>She sat still. She didn&rsquo;t even cry, &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Mrs. Wylie,&rdquo; said one of the troopers,
    gently. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for much anyway, and maybe Tom&rsquo;ll be
    able to clear himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary sank on her knees by her mother&rsquo;s side, crying &ldquo;Speak to
    me, mother. Oh, my God, she&rsquo;s dying! Speak for my sake, mother. Don&rsquo;t
    die, mother; it&rsquo;s all a mistake. Don&rsquo;t die and leave me here
    alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the poor old woman was dead.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Wylie came out towards the end of the year, and a few weeks later he brought
    home a&mdash;another woman.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>IV</b> </h3>
  <p>Bob Bentley, general hawker, was camping under some rocks by the main road,
    near the foot of Long Gully. His mate was fast asleep under the tilted trap.
    Bob stood with his back to the fire, his pipe in his mouth, and his hands
    clasped behind him. The fire lit up the undersides of the branches above;
    a native bear sat in a fork blinking down at it, while the moon above him
    showed every hair on his ears. From among the trees came the pleasant jingle
    of hobble-chains, the slow tread of hoofs, and the &ldquo;crunch, crunch&rdquo; at
    the grass, as the horses moved about and grazed, now in moonlight, now in
    the soft shadows. &ldquo;Old Thunder&rdquo;, a big black dog of no particular
    breed, gave a meaning look at his master, and started up the ridge, followed
    by several smaller dogs. Soon Bob heard from the hillside the &ldquo;hy-yi-hi,
    whomp, whomp, whomp!&rdquo; of old Thunder, and the yop-yop-yopping of the
    smaller fry&mdash;they had tree&rsquo;d a &rsquo;possum. Bob threw himself
    on the grass, and pretended to be asleep. There was a sound as of a sizeable
    boulder rolling down the hill, and presently Thunder trotted round the fire
    to see if his master would come. Bob snored. The dog looked suspiciously
    at him, trotted round once or twice, and as a last resource gave him two
    great slobbery licks across the face. Bob got up with a good-natured oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old party,&rdquo; he said to Thunder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
    thundering old nuisance; but I s&rsquo;pose you won&rsquo;t be satisfied
    till I come.&rdquo; He got a gun from the waggonette, loaded it, and started
    up the ridge; old Thunder rushing to and fro to show the way&mdash;as if
    the row the other dogs were making wasn&rsquo;t enough to guide his master.</p>
  <p>When Bob returned with the &rsquo;possums he was startled to see a woman
    in the camp. She was sitting on a log by the fire, with her elbows on her
    knees and her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what the dev&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl raised a white desperate face to him. It was Mary Wylie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father and&mdash;and the woman&mdash;they&rsquo;re drinking&mdash;they
    turned me out! they turned me out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they now? I&rsquo;m sorry for that. What can I do for you?...
    She&rsquo;s mad sure enough,&rdquo; he thought to himself; &ldquo;I thought
    it was a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
    You&rsquo;re a man, and I&rsquo;m a helpless girl. They turned me out! My
    mother&rsquo;s dead, and my brothers gone away. Look! Look here!&rdquo; pointing
    to a bruise on her forehead. &ldquo;The woman did that. My own father stood
    by and saw it done&mdash;said it served me right! Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What woman? Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woman father brought home!... I want to go away from the bush!
    Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake take me away from the bush!... Anything! anything!&mdash;you
    know!&mdash;only take me away from the bush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob and his mate&mdash;who had been roused&mdash;did their best to soothe
    her; but suddenly, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, she sprang to her feet
    and scrambled to the top of the rock overhanging the camp. She stood for
    a moment in the bright moonlight, gazing intently down the vacant road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; she cried, pointing down the road. &ldquo;Here
    they come&mdash;the troopers! I can see their cap-peaks glistening in the
    moonlight!... I&rsquo;m going away! Mother&rsquo;s gone. I&rsquo;m going
    now!&mdash;Good-bye!&mdash;Good-bye! I&rsquo;m going away from the bush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she ran through the trees towards the foot of Long Gully. Bob and his
    mate followed; but, being unacquainted with the locality, they lost her.</p>
  <p>She ran to the edge of a granite cliff on the higher side of the deepest
    of the rocky waterholes. There was a heavy splash, and three startled kangaroos,
    who had been drinking, leapt back and sped away, like three grey ghosts,
    up the ridge towards the moonlit peak.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellontheSexandOtherProblems"></a>Mitchell
      on the &ldquo;Sex&rdquo; and Other &ldquo;Problems&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I agree with &lsquo;T&rsquo; in last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bulletin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, after cogitating some time over the last drop of tea in his pannikin,
    held at various angles, &ldquo;about what they call the &lsquo;Sex Problem&rsquo;.
    There&rsquo;s no problem, really, except Creation, and that&rsquo;s not our
    affair; we can&rsquo;t solve it, and we&rsquo;ve no right to make a problem
    out of it for ourselves to puzzle over, and waste the little time that is
    given us about. It&rsquo;s we that make the problems, not Creation. We make &rsquo;em,
    and they only smother us; they&rsquo;ll smother the world in the end if we
    don&rsquo;t look out. Anything that can be argued, for and against, from
    half a dozen different points of view&mdash;and most things that men argue
    over can be&mdash;and anything that has been argued about for thousands of
    years (as most things have) is worse than profitless; it wastes the world&rsquo;s
    time and ours, and often wrecks old mateships. Seems to me the deeper you
    read, think, talk, or write about things that end in ism, the less satisfactory
    the result; the more likely you are to get bushed and dissatisfied with the
    world. And the more you keep on the surface of plain things, the plainer
    the sailing&mdash;the more comfortable for you and everybody else. We&rsquo;ve
    always got to come to the surface to breathe, in the end, in any case; we&rsquo;re
    meant to live on the surface, and we might as well stay there and look after
    it and ourselves for all the good we do diving down after fish that aren&rsquo;t
    there, except in our imagination. And some of &rsquo;em are very dead fish,
    too&mdash;the &lsquo;Sex Problem&rsquo;, for instance. When we fall off the
    surface of the earth it will be time enough to make a problem out of the
    fact that we couldn&rsquo;t stick on. I&rsquo;m a Federal Pro-trader in this
    country; I&rsquo;m a Federalist because I think Federation is the plain and
    natural course for Australia, and I&rsquo;m a Free-tectionist because I&rsquo;m
    in favour of sinking any question, or any two things, that enlightened people
    can argue and fight over, and try, one after the other, for fifty years without
    being able to come to a decision about, or prove which is best for the welfare
    of the country. It only wastes a young country&rsquo;s time, and keeps it
    off the right track. Federation isn&rsquo;t a problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
    plain fact&mdash;but they make a problem out of every panel they have to
    push down in the rotten old boundary fences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Personal interests,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s personal interest of the wrong sort that makes
    all the problems. You can trace the sex problem to people who trade in unhealthy
    personal interests. I believe in personal interests of the right sort&mdash;true
    individualism. If we all looked after ourselves, and our wives and families&mdash;if
    we have any&mdash;in the proper way, the world would be all right. We waste
    too much time looking after each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, supposing we&rsquo;re travelling and have to get a shed and
    make a cheque so&rsquo;s to be able to send a few quid home, as soon as we
    can, to the missus, or the old folks, and the next water is twenty miles
    ahead. If we sat down and argued over a social problem till doomsday, we
    wouldn&rsquo;t get to the tank; we&rsquo;d die of thirst, and the missus
    and kids, or the old folks, would be sold up and turned out into the streets,
    and have to fall back on a &lsquo;home of hope&rsquo;, or wait their turn
    at the Benevolent Asylum with bags for broken victuals. I&rsquo;ve seen that,
    and I don&rsquo;t want anybody belonging to me to have to do it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me that when a poor, deserted girl goes to a &lsquo;home&rsquo; they
    don&rsquo;t make a problem of her&mdash;they do their best for her and try
    to get her righted. And the priests, too: if there&rsquo;s anything in the
    sex or any other problem&mdash;anything that hasn&rsquo;t been threshed out&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    the men that&rsquo;ll know it. I&rsquo;m not a Catholic, but I know this:
    that if a girl that&rsquo;s been left by one&mdash;no matter what Church
    she belongs to&mdash;goes to the priest, they&rsquo;ll work all the points
    they know (and they know &rsquo;em all) to get her righted, and, if the chap,
    or his people, won&rsquo;t come up to the scratch, Father Ryan&rsquo;ll frighten
    hell out of &rsquo;em. I can&rsquo;t say as much for our own Churches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re in favour of socialism and democracy?&rdquo; asked
    Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I am. But the world won&rsquo;t do any good arguing over
    it. The people will have to get up and walk, and, what&rsquo;s more, stick
    together&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll ever do that&mdash;it
    ain&rsquo;t in human nature. Socialism, or democracy, was all right in this
    country till it got fashionable and was made a fad or a problem of. Then
    it got smothered pretty quick. And a fad or a problem always breeds a host
    of parasites or hangers-on. Why, as soon as I saw the advanced idealist fools&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    generally the middle-class, shabby-genteel families that catch Spiritualism
    and Theosophy and those sort of complaints, at the end of the epidemic&mdash;that
    catch on at the tail-end of things and think they&rsquo;ve caught something
    brand, shining, new;&mdash;as soon as I saw them, and the problem spielers
    and notoriety-hunters of both sexes, beginning to hang round Australian Unionism,
    I knew it was doomed. And so it was. The straight men were disgusted, or
    driven out. There are women who hang on for the same reason that a girl will
    sometimes go into the dock and swear an innocent man&rsquo;s life away. But
    as soon as they see that the cause is dying, they drop it at once, and wait
    for another. They come like bloody dingoes round a calf, and only leave the
    bones. They&rsquo;re about as democratic as the crows. And the rotten &lsquo;sex-problem&rsquo;  sort
    of thing is the cause of it all; it poisons weak minds&mdash;and strong ones
    too sometimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you could make a problem out of Epsom salts. You might argue
    as to why human beings want Epsom salts, and try to trace the causes that
    led up to it. I don&rsquo;t like the taste of Epsom salts&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    nasty in the mouth&mdash;but when I feel that way I take &rsquo;em, and I
    feel better afterwards; and that&rsquo;s good enough for me. We might argue
    that black is white, and white is black, and neither of &rsquo;em is anything,
    and nothing is everything; and a woman&rsquo;s a man and a man&rsquo;s a
    woman, and it&rsquo;s really the man that has the youngsters, only we imagine
    it&rsquo;s the woman because she imagines that she has all the pain and trouble,
    and the doctor is under the impression that he&rsquo;s attending to her,
    not the man, and the man thinks so too because he imagines he&rsquo;s walking
    up and down outside, and slipping into the corner pub now and then for a
    nip to keep his courage up, waiting, when it&rsquo;s his wife that&rsquo;s
    doing that all the time; we might argue that it&rsquo;s all force of imagination,
    and that imagination is an unknown force, and that the unknown is nothing.
    But, when we&rsquo;ve settled all that to our own satisfaction, how much
    further ahead are we? In the end we&rsquo;ll come to the conclusion that
    we ain&rsquo;t alive, and never existed, and then we&rsquo;ll leave off bothering,
    and the world will go on just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about science?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Science ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;sex problems&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s facts....
    Now, I don&rsquo;t mind Spiritualism and those sort of things; they might
    help to break the monotony, and can&rsquo;t do much harm. But the &lsquo;sex
    problem&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s written about to-day, does; it&rsquo;s dangerous
    and dirty, and it&rsquo;s time to settle it with a club. Science and education,
    if left alone, will look after sex facts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get anything out of the &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo;,
    no matter how you argue. In the old Bible times they had half a dozen wives
    each, but we don&rsquo;t know for certain how <i>they</i> got on. The Mormons
    tried it again, and seemed to get on all right till we interfered. We don&rsquo;t
    seem to be able to get on with one wife now&mdash;at least, according to
    the &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo;. The &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo; troubled the
    Turks so much that they tried three. Lots of us try to settle it by knocking
    round promiscuously, and that leads to actions for maintenance and breach
    of promise cases, and all sorts of trouble. Our blacks settle the &lsquo;sex
    problem&rsquo; with a club, and so far I haven&rsquo;t heard any complaints
    from them.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take hereditary causes and surrounding circumstances, for instance.
    In order to understand or judge a man right, you would need to live under
    the same roof with him from childhood, and under the same roofs, or tents,
    with his parents, right back to Adam, and then you&rsquo;d be blocked for
    want of more ancestors through which to trace the causes that led to Abel&mdash;I
    mean Cain&mdash;going on as he did. What&rsquo;s the use or sense of it?
    You might argue away in any direction for a million miles and a million years
    back into the past, but you&rsquo;ve got to come back to where you are if
    you wish to do any good for yourself, or anyone else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes it takes you a long while to get back to where you are&mdash;sometimes
    you never do it. Why, when those controversies were started in the &lsquo;Bulletin&rsquo; about
    the kangaroos and other things, I thought I knew something about the bush.
    Now I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m sure I could tell a kangaroo from a wombat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trying to find out things is the cause of all the work and trouble
    in this world. It was Eve&rsquo;s fault in the first place&mdash;or Adam&rsquo;s,
    rather, because it might be argued that he should have been master. Some
    men are too lazy to be masters in their own homes, and run the show properly;
    some are too careless, and some too drunk most of their time, and some too
    weak. If Adam and Eve hadn&rsquo;t tried to find out things there&rsquo;d
    have been no toil and trouble in the world to-day; there&rsquo;d have been
    no bloated capitalists, and no horny-handed working men, and no politics,
    no freetrade and protection&mdash;and no clothes. The woman next door wouldn&rsquo;t
    be able to pick holes in your wife&rsquo;s washing on the line. We&rsquo;d
    have been all running about in a big Garden of Eden with nothing on, and
    nothing to do except loaf, and make love, and lark, and laugh, and play practical
    jokes on each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would have been glorious. Wouldn&rsquo;t it, Joe? There&rsquo;d
    have been no &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo; then.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMastersMistake"></a>The Master&rsquo;s Mistake</b></h2>
  <p>William Spencer stayed away from school that hot day, and &ldquo;went swimming&rdquo;.
    The master wrote a note to William&rsquo;s father, and gave it to William&rsquo;s
    brother Joe to carry home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give that to your father to-night, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill waited for Joe near the gap, and walked home with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ve got a note for father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you know what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes. Oh, why did you stop away, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;re dirty mean enough to
    give it to father? Hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must, Will. I promised the master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He needn&rsquo;t never know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he will. He&rsquo;s coming over to our place on Saturday,
    and he&rsquo;s sure to ask me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Joe!&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get
    a hiding and go without supper to-night. I promised to go &rsquo;possuming
    with Johnny Nowlett, and he&rsquo;s going to give me a fire out of his gun.
    You can come, too. I don&rsquo;t want to cop out on it to-night&mdash;if
    I do I&rsquo;ll run away from home again, so there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill walked on a bit in moody, Joe in troubled, silence.</p>
  <p>Bill tried again: he threatened, argued, and pleaded, but Joe was firm. &ldquo;The
    master trusted me, Will,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Bill at last, after a long pause, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
    do it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe was troubled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it to you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe thought how Bill had stood up and fought for him only last week.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tear the note in bits; I&rsquo;d tell a hundred lies; I&rsquo;d
    take a dozen hidings first, Joe&mdash;I would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe was greatly troubled. His chest heaved, and the tears came to his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do more than that for you, Joe, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe knew it. They were crossing the old goldfield now. There was a shaft
    close to the path; it had fallen in, funnel-shaped, at the top, but was still
    thirty or forty feet deep; some old logs were jammed across about five feet
    down. Joe suddenly snatched the note from his pocket and threw it in. It
    fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece of the old timber. Bill
    saw it, but said nothing, and, seeing their father coming home from work,
    they hurried on.</p>
  <p>Joe was deep in trouble now. Bill tried to comfort and cheer him, but it
    was no use. Bill promised never to run away from home any more, to go to
    school every day, and never to fight, or steal, or tell lies. But Joe had
    betrayed his trust for the first time in his life, and wouldn&rsquo;t be
    comforted.</p>
  <p>Some time in the night Bill woke, and found Joe sitting up in bed crying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never done a mean thing like that before,&rdquo; sobbed Joe. &ldquo;I
    wished I&rsquo;d chucked meself down the shaft instead. The master trusted
    me, Will; an&rsquo; now, if he asks me to-morrow, I&rsquo;ll have to tell
    a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell the truth, Joe, an&rsquo; take the hidin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;ll
    soon be over&mdash;just a couple of cuts with the cane and it&rsquo;ll be
    all over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it won&rsquo;t. He won&rsquo;t never trust me any more. I&rsquo;ve
    never been caned in that school yet, Will, and if I am I&rsquo;ll never go
    again. Oh! why will you run away from home, Will, and play the wag, and steal,
    and get us all into such trouble? You don&rsquo;t know how mother takes on
    about it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know how it hurts father! I&rsquo;ve deceived
    the master, and mother and father to-day, just because you&rsquo;re so&mdash;so
    selfish,&rdquo; and he laid down and cried himself to sleep.</p>
  <p>Bill lay awake and thought till daylight; then he got up quietly, put on
    his clothes, and stole away from the house and across the flat, followed
    by the dog, who thought it was a &rsquo;possum-hunting expedition. Bill wished
    the dog would not be quite so demonstrative, at least until they got away
    from the house. He went straight to the shaft, let himself down carefully
    on to one of the old logs, and stooped to pick up the note, gleaming white
    in the sickly summer daylight. Then the rotten timber gave way suddenly,
    without a moment&rsquo;s warning.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>They found him that morning at about nine o&rsquo;clock. The dog attracted
    the attention of an old fossicker passing to his work. The letter was gripped
    in Bill&rsquo;s right hand when they brought him up. They took him home,
    and the father went for a doctor. Bill came to himself a little just before
    the last, and said: &ldquo;Mother! I wasn&rsquo;t running away, mother&mdash;tell
    father that&mdash;I&mdash;I wanted to try and catch a &rsquo;possum on the
    ground.... Where&rsquo;s Joe? I want Joe. Go out, mother, a minute, and send
    Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here I am, Bill,&rdquo; said Joe, in a choking, terrified voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has the master been yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bend down, Joe. I went for the note, and the logs gave way. I meant
    to be back before they was up. I dropped it down inside the bed; you watch
    your chance and get it; and say you forgot it last night&mdash;say you didn&rsquo;t
    like to give it&mdash;that won&rsquo;t be a lie. Tell the master I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    sorry&mdash;tell the master never to send no notes no more&mdash;except by
    girls&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.... Mother! Take the blankets off me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    dyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryoftheOracle"></a>The Story of the Oracle</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We young fellows,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Sympathy Joe&rdquo; to Mitchell,
    after tea, in their first camp west the river&mdash;&ldquo;and you and I <i>are</i> young
    fellows, comparatively&mdash;think we know the world. There are plenty of
    young chaps knocking round in this country who reckon they&rsquo;ve been
    through it all before they&rsquo;re thirty. I&rsquo;ve met cynics and men-o&rsquo;-the-world,
    aged twenty-one or thereabouts, who&rsquo;ve never been further than a trip
    to Sydney. They talk about &lsquo;this world&rsquo; as if they&rsquo;d knocked
    around in half-a-dozen other worlds before they came across here&mdash;and
    they are just as off-hand about it as older Australians are when they talk
    about this colony as compared with the others. They say: &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;same
    here.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been there.&rsquo; &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;you&rsquo;re
    right.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take it from me!&rsquo; and all that sort of thing.
    They understand women, and have a contempt for &rsquo;em; and chaps that
    don&rsquo;t talk as they talk, or do as they do, or see as they see, are
    either soft or ratty. A good many reckon that &lsquo;life ain&rsquo;t blanky
    well worth livin&rsquo;&rsquo;; sometimes they feel so blanky somehow that
    they wouldn&rsquo;t give a blank whether they chucked it or not; but that
    sort never chuck it. It&rsquo;s mostly the quiet men that do that, and if
    they&rsquo;ve got any complaints to make against the world they make &rsquo;em
    at the head station. Why, I&rsquo;ve known healthy, single, young fellows
    under twenty-five who drank to drown their troubles&mdash;some because they
    reckoned the world didn&rsquo;t understand nor appreciate &rsquo;em&mdash;as
    if it <i>could</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the world don&rsquo;t understand or appreciate you,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell solemnly, as he reached for a burning stick to light his pipe&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Make</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To drown <i>their</i> troubles!&rdquo; continued Joe, in a tone of
    impatient contempt. &ldquo;The Oracle must be well on towards the sixties;
    he can take his glass with any man, but you never saw him drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Oracle to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear his history?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, though I don&rsquo;t think he has any idea that I do. Now, we
    were talking about the Oracle a little while ago. We know he&rsquo;s an old
    ass; a good many outsiders consider that he&rsquo;s a bit soft or ratty,
    and, as we&rsquo;re likely to be mates together for some time on that fencing
    contract, if we get it, you might as well know what sort of a man he is and
    was, so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t get uneasy about him if he gets deaf for
    a while when you&rsquo;re talking, or does funny things with his pipe or
    pint-pot, or walks up and down by himself for an hour or so after tea, or
    sits on a log with his head in his hands, or leans on the fence in the gloaming
    and keeps looking in a blank sort of way, straight ahead, across the clearing.
    For he&rsquo;s gazing at something a thousand miles across country, south-east,
    and about twenty years back into the past, and no doubt he sees himself (as
    a young man), and a Gippsland girl, spooning under the stars along between
    the hop-gardens and the Mitchell River. And, if you get holt of a fiddle
    or a concertina, don&rsquo;t rasp or swank too much on old tunes, when he&rsquo;s
    round, for the Oracle can&rsquo;t stand it. Play something lively. He&rsquo;ll
    be down there at that surveyor&rsquo;s camp yarning till all hours, so we&rsquo;ll
    have plenty of time for the story&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you ever give him
    a hint that you know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My people knew him well; I got most of the story from them&mdash;mostly
    from Uncle Bob, who knew him better than any. The rest leaked out through
    the women&mdash;you know how things leak out amongst women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell dropped his head and scratched the back of it. <i>He</i> knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on the Cudgegong River. My Uncle Bob was mates with him on
    one of those &lsquo;rushes&rsquo; along there&mdash;the &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;,
    I think it was, or the &lsquo;Log Paddock&rsquo;. The Oracle was a young
    man then, of course, and so was Uncle Bob (he was a match for most men).
    You see the Oracle now, and you can imagine what he was when he was a young
    man. Over six feet, and as straight as a sapling, Uncle Bob said, clean-limbed,
    and as fresh as they made men in those days; carried his hands behind him,
    as he does now, when he hasn&rsquo;t got the swag&mdash;but his shoulders
    were back in those days. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t the Oracle then; he was
    young Tom Marshall&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Everybody liked him&mdash;especially
    women and children. He was a bit happy-go-lucky and careless, but he didn&rsquo;t
    know anything about &lsquo;this world&rsquo;, and didn&rsquo;t bother about
    it; he hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;been there&rsquo;. &lsquo;And his heart was as
    good as gold,&rsquo; my aunt used to say. He didn&rsquo;t understand women
    as we young fellows do nowadays, and therefore he hadn&rsquo;t any contempt
    for &rsquo;em. Perhaps he understood, and understands, them better than any
    of us, without knowing it. Anyway, you know, he&rsquo;s always gentle and
    kind where a woman or child is concerned, and doesn&rsquo;t like to hear
    us talk about women as we do sometimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a girl on the goldfields&mdash;a fine lump of a blonde,
    and pretty gay. She came from Sydney, I think, with her people, who kept
    shanties on the fields. She had a splendid voice, and used to sing &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo;.
    There might have been one or two bad women before that, in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    world, but no cold-blooded, designing ones. He calls the bad ones &lsquo;unfortunate&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was Tom&rsquo;s looks, or his freshness, or his innocence,
    or softness&mdash;or all together&mdash;that attracted her. Anyway, he got
    mixed up with her before the goldfield petered out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt it took a long while for the facts to work into Tom&rsquo;s
    head that a girl might sing like she did and yet be thoroughly unprincipled.
    The Oracle was always slow at coming to a decision, but when he does it&rsquo;s
    generally the right one. Anyway, you can take that for granted, for you won&rsquo;t
    move him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he found out that she wasn&rsquo;t all
    that she pretented to be to him, or whether they quarrelled, or whether she
    chucked him over for a lucky digger. Tom never had any luck on the goldfields.
    Anyway, he left and went over to the Victorian side, where his people were,
    and went up Gippsland way. It was there for the first time in his life that
    he got what you would call &lsquo;properly gone on a girl&rsquo;; he got
    hard hit&mdash;he met his fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her name was Bertha Bredt, I remember. Aunt Bob saw her afterwards.
    Aunt Bob used to say that she was &lsquo;a girl as God made her&rsquo;&mdash;a
    good, true, womanly girl&mdash;one of those sort of girls that only love
    once. Tom got on with her father, who was packing horses through the ranges
    to the new goldfields&mdash;it was rough country and there were no roads;
    they had to pack everything there in those days, and there was money in it.
    The girl&rsquo;s father took to Tom&mdash;as almost everybody else did&mdash;and,
    as far as the girl was concerned, I think it was a case of love at first
    sight. They only knew each other for about six months, and were only &lsquo;courting&rsquo; (as
    they called it then) for three or four months altogether, but she was that
    sort of girl that can love a man for six weeks and lose him for ever, and
    yet go on loving him to the end of her life&mdash;and die with his name on
    her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things were brightening up every way for Tom, and he and his
    sweetheart were beginning to talk about their own little home in future,
    when there came a letter from the &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo; girl in New South
    Wales.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was in terrible trouble. Her baby was to be born in a month.
    Her people had kicked her out, and she was in danger of starving. She begged
    and prayed of him to come back and marry her, if only for his child&rsquo;s
    sake. He could go then, and be free; she would never trouble him any more&mdash;only
    come and marry her for the child&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle doesn&rsquo;t know where he lost that letter, but I do.
    It was burnt afterwards by a woman, who was more than a mother to him in
    his trouble&mdash;Aunt Bob. She thought he might carry it round with the
    rest of his papers, in his swag, for years, and come across it unexpectedly
    when he was camped by himself in the bush and feeling dull. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done him any good then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must have fought the hardest fight in his life when he got that
    letter. No doubt he walked to and fro, to and fro, all night, with his hands
    behind him, and his eyes on the ground, as he does now sometimes. Walking
    up and down helps you to fight a thing out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt he thought of things pretty well as he thinks now: the poor
    girl&rsquo;s shame on every tongue, and belled round the district by every
    hag in the township; and she looked upon by women as being as bad as any
    man who ever went to Bathurst in the old days, handcuffed between two troopers.
    There is sympathy, a pipe and tobacco, a cheering word, and, maybe, a whisky
    now and then, for the criminal on his journey; but there is no mercy, at
    least as far as women are concerned, for the poor foolish girl, who has to
    sneak out the back way and round by back streets and lanes after dark, with
    a cloak on to hide her figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom sent what money he thought he could spare, and next day he went
    to the girl he loved and who loved him, and told her the truth, and showed
    her the letter. She was only a girl&mdash;but the sort of girl you <i>could</i> go
    to in a crisis like that. He had made up his mind to do the right thing,
    and she loved him all the more for it. And so they parted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When Tom reached &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;, the girl&rsquo;s relations,
    that she was stopping with, had a parson readied up, and they were married
    the same day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened after that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing happened for three or four months; then the child was born.
    It wasn&rsquo;t his!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell stood up with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl was thoroughly bad. She&rsquo;d been carrying on with God
    knows how many men, both before and after she trapped Tom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you know how the Oracle argues over things, and I suppose he
    was as big an old fool then as he is now. He thinks that, as most men would
    deceive women if they could, when one man gets caught, he&rsquo;s got no
    call to squeal about it; he&rsquo;s bound, because of the sins of men in
    general against women, to make the best of it. What is one man&rsquo;s wrong
    counted against the wrongs of hundreds of unfortunate girls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommon way of arguing&mdash;like most of the Oracle&rsquo;s
    ideas&mdash;but it seems to look all right at first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thought she&rsquo;d go straight; perhaps she convinced
    him that he was the cause of her first fall; anyway he stuck to her for more
    than a year, and intended to take her away from that place as soon as he&rsquo;d
    scraped enough money together. It might have gone on up till now, if the
    father of the child&mdash;a big black Irishman named Redmond&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
    come sneaking back at the end of a year. He&mdash;well, he came hanging round
    Mrs. Marshall while Tom was away at work&mdash;and she encouraged him. And
    Tom was forced to see it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom wanted to fight out his own battle without interference, but
    the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;they reckoned that he&rsquo;d stand
    very little show against Redmond, who was a very rough customer and a fighting
    man. My uncle Bob, who was there still, fixed it up this way: The Oracle
    was to fight Redmond, and if the Oracle got licked Uncle Bob was to take
    Redmond on. If Redmond whipped Uncle Bob, that was to settle it; but if Uncle
    Bob thrashed Redmond, then he was also to fight Redmond&rsquo;s mate, another
    big, rough Paddy named Duigan. Then the affair would be finished&mdash;no
    matter which way the last bout went. You see, Uncle Bob was reckoned more
    of a match for Redmond than the Oracle was, so the thing looked fair enough&mdash;at
    first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Redmond had his mate, Duigan, and one or two others of the rough
    gang that used to terrorise the fields round there in the roaring days of
    Gulgong. The Oracle had Uncle Bob, of course, and long Dave Regan, the drover&mdash;a
    good-hearted, sawny kind of chap that&rsquo;d break the devil&rsquo;s own
    buck-jumper, or smash him, or get smashed himself&mdash;and little Jimmy
    Nowlett, the bullocky, and one or two of the old, better-class diggers that
    were left on the field.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear space among the saplings in Specimen Gully,
    where they used to pitch circuses; and here, in the cool of a summer evening,
    the two men stood face to face. Redmond was a rough, roaring, foul-mouthed
    man; he stripped to his shirt, and roared like a bull, and swore, and sneered,
    and wanted to take the whole of Tom&rsquo;s crowd while he was at it, and
    make one clean job of &rsquo;em. Couldn&rsquo;t waste time fighting them
    all one after the other, because he wanted to get away to the new rush at
    Cattle Creek next day. The fool had been drinking shanty-whisky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom stood up in his clean, white moles and white flannel shirt&mdash;one
    of those sort with no sleeves, that give the arms play. He had a sort of
    set expression and a look in his eyes that Uncle Bob&mdash;nor none of them&mdash;had
    ever seen there before. &lsquo;Give us plenty of&mdash;room!&rsquo; roared
    Redmond; &lsquo;one of us is going to hell, now! This is going to be a fight
    to a&mdash;finish, and a&mdash;short one!&rsquo;  And it was!&rdquo; Joe
    paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle never got a mark! He was top-dog right from the start.
    Perhaps it was his strength that Redmond had underrated, or his want of science
    that puzzled him, or the awful silence of the man that frightened him (it
    made even Uncle Bob uneasy). Or, perhaps, it was Providence (it was a glorious
    chance for Providence), but, anyway, as I say, the Oracle never got a mark,
    except on his knuckles. After a few rounds Redmond funked and wanted to give
    in, but the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;not even his own mates&mdash;except
    Duigan. They made him take it as long as he could stand on his feet. He even
    shammed to be knocked out, and roared out something about having broken his&mdash;ankle&mdash;but
    it was no use. And the Oracle! The chaps that knew thought that he&rsquo;d
    refuse to fight, and never hit a man that had given in. But he did. He just
    stood there with that quiet look in his eyes and waited, and, when he did
    hit, there wasn&rsquo;t any necessity for Redmond to <i>pretend</i> to be
    knocked down. You&rsquo;ll see a glint of that old light in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    eyes even now, once in a while; and when you do it&rsquo;s a sign that you
    or someone are going too far, and had better pull up, for it&rsquo;s a red
    light on the line, old as he is.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Jimmy Nowlett was a nuggety little fellow, hard as cast iron,
    good-hearted, but very excitable; and when the bashed Redmond was being carted
    off (poor Uncle Bob was always pretty high-strung, and was sitting on a log
    sobbing like a great child from the reaction), Duigan made some sneering
    remark that only Jimmy Nowlett caught, and in an instant he was up and at
    Duigan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Duigan was demoralised by his mate&rsquo;s defeat, or by
    the suddenness of the attack; but, at all events, he got a hiding, too. Uncle
    Bob used to say that it was the funniest thing he ever saw in his life. Jimmy
    kept yelling: &lsquo;Let me get at him! By the Lord, let me get at him!&rsquo; And
    nobody was attempting to stop him, he <i>was</i> getting at him all the time&mdash;and
    properly, too; and, when he&rsquo;d knocked Duigan down, he&rsquo;d dance
    round him and call on him to get up; and every time he jumped or bounced,
    he&rsquo;d squeak like an india-rubber ball, Uncle Bob said, and he would
    nearly burst his boiler trying to lug the big man on to his feet so&rsquo;s
    he could knock him down again. It took two of Jimmy&rsquo;s mates all their
    time to lam him down into a comparatively reasonable state of mind after
    the fight was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle left for Sydney next day, and Uncle Bob went with him.
    He stayed at Uncle Bob&rsquo;s place for some time. He got very quiet, they
    said, and gentle; he used to play with the children, and they got mighty
    fond of him. The old folks thought his heart was broken, but it went through
    a deeper sorrow still after that and it ain&rsquo;t broken yet. It takes
    a lot to break the heart of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his wife,&rdquo; asked Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;what became of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever saw her again. She dropped down pretty
    low after he left her&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s living somewhere
    quietly. The Oracle&rsquo;s been sending someone money ever since I knew
    him, and I know it&rsquo;s a woman. I suppose it&rsquo;s she. He isn&rsquo;t
    the sort of a man to see a woman starve&mdash;especially a woman he had ever
    had anything to do with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the Gippsland girl?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst part of it all, I think. The Oracle went up
    North somewhere. In the course of a year or two his affair got over Gippsland
    way through a mate of his who lived over there, and at last the story got
    to the ears of this girl, Bertha Bredt. She must have written a dozen letters
    to him, Aunt Bob said. She knew what was in &rsquo;em, but, of course, she&rsquo;d
    never tell us. The Oracle only wrote one in reply. Then, what must the girl
    do but clear out from home and make her way over to Sydney&mdash;to Aunt
    Bob&rsquo;s place, looking for Tom. She never got any further. She took ill&mdash;brain-fever,
    or broken heart, or something of that sort. All the time she was down her
    cry was&mdash;&lsquo;I want to see him! I want to find Tom! I only want to
    see Tom!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When they saw she was dying, Aunt Bob wired to the Oracle to come&mdash;and
    he came. When the girl saw it was Tom sitting by the bed, she just gave one
    long look in his face, put her arms round his neck, and laid her head on
    his shoulder&mdash;and died.... Here comes the Oracle now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lifted the tea-billy on to the coals.
