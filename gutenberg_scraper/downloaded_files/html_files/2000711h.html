  <p>Down here where the ships loom large in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloom when the sea-storms veer,<br>
    Down here on the south-west margin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the western hemisphere,<br>
    Where the might of a world-wide ocean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the youngest land rolls free&mdash;<br>
    Storm-bound from the world&rsquo;s commotion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>By the bluff where the grey sand reaches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kerb of the spray-swept street,<br>
    By the sweep of the black sand beaches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the main-road travellers&rsquo; feet,<br>
    By the heights like a work Titanic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begun ere the gods&rsquo; work ceased,<br>
    By a bluff-lined coast volcanic<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the Ports of the wild South-east.</p>
  <p>By the steeps of the snow-capped ranges,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the scarped and terraced hills&mdash;<br>
    Far away from the swift life-changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wear of the strife that kills&mdash;<br>
    Where the land in the Spring seems younger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a land of the Earth might be&mdash;<br>
    Oh! the hearts of the rovers hunger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>But the captains watch and hearken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a sign of the South Sea wrath&mdash;<br>
    Let the face of the South-east darken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they turn to the ocean path.<br>
    Ay, the sea-boats dare not linger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the cargo be;<br>
    When the South-east lifts a finger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>South by the bleak Bluff faring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North where the Three Kings wait,<br>
    South-east the tempest daring&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight through the storm-tossed strait;<br>
    Yonder a white-winged roamer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck where the rollers roar&mdash;<br>
    Where the great green froth-flaked comber<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks down on a black-ribbed shore.</p>
  <p>For the South-east lands are dread lands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sailor in the shrouds,<br>
    Where the low clouds loom like headlands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black bluffs blur like clouds.<br>
    When the breakers rage to windward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lights are masked a-lee,<br>
    And the sunken rocks run inward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a Port of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>But oh! for the South-east weather&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweep of the three-days&rsquo; gale&mdash;<br>
    When, far through the flax and heather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spindrift drives like hail.<br>
    Glory to man&rsquo;s creations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drive where the gale grows gruff,<br>
    When the homes of the sea-coast stations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash white from the dark&rsquo;ning bluff!</p>
  <p>When the swell of the South-east rouses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the Maori sprite,<br>
    And the brown folk flee their houses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crouch in the flax by night,<br>
    And wait as they long have waited&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear as the brown folk be&mdash;<br>
    The wave of destruction fated<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>Grey cloud to the mountain bases,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild boughs that rush and sweep;<br>
    On the rounded hills the tussocks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flocks of flying sheep;<br>
    A lonely storm-bird soaring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er tussock, fern and tree;<br>
    And the boulder beaches roaring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hymn of the Open Sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheThreeKings"></a>The Three Kings</b></h2>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">[Three sea-girt pinnacles off North Cape, New Zealand.]</font></p>
  <p>The East is dead and the West is done, and again our course lies thus:&mdash;<br>
    South-east by Fate and the Rising Sun where the Three Kings wait for us.<br>
    <i>When our hearts are young and the world is wide, and the heights seem grand
  to climb&mdash;</i><br>
  <i>We are off and away to the Sydney-side; but the Three Kings bide their time.</i></p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the West,&rsquo; the digger said: he was bearded,
    bronzed and old;<br>
&lsquo;Ah, the smothering curse of the East is wool, and the curse of the West
  is gold.<br>
&lsquo;I went to the West in the golden boom, with Hope and a life-long mate,<br>
&lsquo;They sleep in the sand by the Boulder Soak, and long may the Three Kings
  wait.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had my fling on the Sydney-side,&rsquo; said a black-sheep
    to the sea,<br>
  &lsquo;Let the young fool learn when he can&rsquo;t be taught: I&rsquo;ve learnt
  what&rsquo;s good for me.&rsquo;<br>
    And he gazed ahead on the sea-line dim&mdash;grown dim in his softened eyes&mdash;<br>
    With a pain in his heart that was good for him&mdash;as he saw the Three
    Kings rise.</p>
  <p>A pale girl sits on the foc&rsquo;sle head&mdash;she is back, Three Kings!
    so soon;<br>
    But it seems to her like a life-time dead since she fled with him &lsquo;saloon.&rsquo;<br>
    There is refuge still in the old folks&rsquo; arms for the child that loved
    too well;<br>
    They will hide her shame on the Southern farm&mdash;and the Three Kings will
    not tell.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a restless heart on the tide of life, and a false star in the
    skies<br>
    That led me on to the deadly strife where the Southern London lies;<br>
    But I dream in peace of a home for me, by a glorious southern sound,<br>
    As the sunset fades from a moonlit sea, and the Three Kings show us round.</p>
  <p><i>Our hearts are young and the old hearts old, and life on the farms is
      slow,</i><br>
      <i>And away in the world there is fame and gold&mdash;and the Three Kings
      watch us go.</i><br>
      <i>Our heads seem wise and the world seems wide, and its heights are ours
      to climb,</i><br>
      <i>So it&rsquo;s off and away in our youthful pride&mdash;but the Three
      Kings bide our time.</i></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheOutsideTrack"></a>The Outside Track</b></h2>
  <p>There were ten of us there on the moonlit quay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one on the for&rsquo;ard hatch;<br>
    No straighter mate to his mates than he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ever said: &lsquo;Len&rsquo;s a match!&rsquo;<br>
  &rsquo;Twill be long, old man, ere our glasses clink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill be long ere we grip your hand!&mdash;<br>
    And we dragged him ashore for a final drink<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the whole wide world seemed grand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they marry and go as
    the world rolls back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
  marry and vanish and die;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their spirit shall live
  on the Outside Track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
  long as the years go by.</p>
  <p>The port-lights glowed in the morning mist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rolled from the waters green;<br>
    And over the railing we grasped his fist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dark tide came between.</p>
  <p>We cheered the captain and cheered the crew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our mate, times out of mind;<br>
    We cheered the land he was going to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the land he had left behind.</p>
  <p>We roared Lang Syne as a last farewell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my heart seemed out of joint;<br>
    I well remember the hush that fell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the steamer had passed the point<br>
    We drifted home through the public bars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were ten times less by one<br>
    Who sailed out under the morning stars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the rising sun.</p>
  <p>And one by one, and two by two,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have sailed from the wharf since then;<br>
    I have said good-bye to the last I knew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last of the careless men.<br>
    And I can&rsquo;t but think that the times we had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the best times after all,<br>
    As I turn aside with a lonely glass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drink to the bar-room wall.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;ll try my luck
    for a cheque Out Back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
  a last good-bye to the bush;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my heart&rsquo;s away on
  the Outside Track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
  the track of the steerage push.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SydneySide"></a>Sydney-Side</b></h2>
  <p>Where&rsquo;s the steward?&mdash;Bar-room steward? Berth? Oh, any berth
    will do&mdash;<br>
    I have left a three-pound billet just to come along with you.<br>
    Brighter shines the Star of Rovers on a world that&rsquo;s growing wide,<br>
    But I think I&rsquo;d give a kingdom for a glimpse of Sydney-Side.</p>
  <p>Run of rocky shelves at sunrise, with their base on ocean&rsquo;s bed;<br>
    Homes of Coogee, homes of Bondi, and the lighthouse on South Head;<br>
    For in loneliness and hardship&mdash;and with just a touch of pride&mdash;<br>
    Has my heart been taught to whisper, &lsquo;You belong to Sydney-Side.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Oh, there never dawned a morning, in the long and lonely days,<br>
    But I thought I saw the ferries streaming out across the bays&mdash;<br>
    And as fresh and fair in fancy did the picture rise again<br>
    As the sunrise flushed the city from Woollahra to Balmain.</p>
  <p>And the sunny water frothing round the liners black and red,<br>
    And the coastal schooners working by the loom of Bradley&rsquo;s Head;<br>
    And the whistles and the sirens that re-echo far and wide&mdash;<br>
    All the life and light and beauty that belong to Sydney-Side.</p>
  <p>And the dreary cloud-line never veiled the end of one day more,<br>
    But the city set in jewels rose before me from &lsquo;The Shore.&rsquo;<br>
    Round the sea-world shine the beacons of a thousand ports o&rsquo; call,<br>
    But the harbour-lights of Sydney are the grandest of them all!</p>

  <p>Jim Duff&nbsp;was a &lsquo;native,&rsquo;as wild as could be;<br>
    A stealer and duffer of cattle was he,<br>
    But back in his youth he had stolen a pearl&mdash;<br>
    Or a diamond rather&mdash;the heart of a girl;<br>
    She served with a squatter who lived on the plain,<br>
    And the name of the girl it was Mary Lemaine.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a drear, rainy day and the twilight was done,<br>
    When four mounted troopers rode up to the run.<br>
    They spoke to the squatter&mdash;he asked them all in.<br>
    The homestead was small and the walls they were thin;<br>
    And in the next room, with a cold in her head,<br>
    Our Mary was sewing on buttons&mdash;in bed.</p>
  <p>She heard a few words, but those words were enough&mdash;<br>
    The troopers were all on the track of Jim Duff.<br>
    The super, his rival, was planning a trap<br>
    To capture the scamp in Maginnis&rsquo;s Gap.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve warned him before, and I&rsquo;ll do it again;&mdash;<br>
  <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;save him to-night,&rsquo; whispered Mary Lemaine.</p>
  <p>No petticoat job&mdash;there was no time to waste,<br>
    The suit she was mending she slipped on in haste,<br>
    And five minutes later they gathered in force,<br>
    But Mary was off, on the squatter&rsquo;s best horse;<br>
    With your hand on your heart, just to deaden the pain,<br>
    Ride hard to the ranges, brave Mary Lemaine!</p>
  <p>She rode by the ridges all sullen and strange,<br>
    And far up long gullies that ran through the range,<br>
    Till the rain cleared away, and the tears in her eyes<br>
    Caught the beams of the moon from Maginnis&rsquo;s Rise.<br>
    A fire in the depths of the gums she espied,<br>
  &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; shouted Jim. &lsquo;It is Mary!&rsquo;she
  cried.</p>
  <p>Next morning the sun rose in splendour again,<br>
    And two loving sinners rode out on the plain.<br>
    And baffled, and angry, and hungry and damp,<br>
    The four mounted troopers rode back to the camp.<br>
    But they hushed up the business&mdash;the reason is plain,<br>
    They all had been &lsquo;soft&rsquo; on fair Mary Lemaine.</p>
  <p>The squatter got back all he lost from his mob,<br>
    And old Sergeant Kennedy winked at the job.<br>
    Jim Duff keeps a shanty far out in the west,<br>

    With the two &lsquo;Black Brothers&rsquo; trudging<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be dancing oft with me;<br>
    What cared I, because she loved me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world were there to see?<br>
    But we lingered by the slip rails<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the rest were riding home,<br>
    Ere the hour before the dawning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimmed the great star-clustered dome.</p>
  <p>Small brown hands that spread the mattress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the old folk winked to see<br>
    How she&rsquo;d find an extra pillow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an extra sheet for me.<br>
    For a moment shyly smiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would grant me one kiss more&mdash;<br>
    Slip away and leave me happy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shake-down on the floor.</p>
  <p>Rock me hard in steerage cabins,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock me soft in wide saloons,<br>
    Lay me on the sand-hill lonely<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waning western moons;<br>
    But wherever night may find me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I rest for evermore<br>
    I will dream that I am happy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shake-down on the floor.</p>
  <p>Ah! she often watched at sunset&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her people told me so&mdash;<br>
    Where I left her at the slip-rails<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than fifteen years ago.<br>
    And she faded like a flower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she died, as such girls do,<br>
    While, away in Northern Queensland,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working hard, I never knew.</p>
  <p>And we suffer for our sorrows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we suffer for our joys,<br>
    From the old bush days when mother<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread the shake-down for the boys.<br>
    But to cool the living fever,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a cold breath to my brow,<br>
    And I feel that Mary&rsquo;s spirit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is beside me, even now.</p>

  <p>Ten&nbsp;miles down Reedy River<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pool of water lies,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the skies,<br>
    And in that pool&rsquo;s broad bosom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is room for all the stars;<br>

    We left our horses grazing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till shadows climbed the peak,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks of Rocky Creek.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night we rode a race,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thro&rsquo; that moonlight ride,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew closer side by side.</p>
  <p>Ten miles from Ryan&rsquo;s crossing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And five below the peak,<br>
    I built a little homestead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the banks of Rocky Creek:<br>
    I cleared the land and fenced it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ploughed the rich red loam,<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OldStoneChimney"></a>Old Stone Chimney</b></h2>
  <p>The rising&nbsp;moon on the peaks was blending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver light with the sunset glow,<br>
    When a swagman came as the day was ending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a path that he seemed to know.<br>
    But all the fences were gone or going&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of ruin was everywhere;<br>
    The creek unchecked in its course was flowing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For none of the old clay dam was there.</p>
  <p>Here Time had been with his swiftest changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And husbandry had westward flown;<br>
    The cattle tracks in the rugged ranges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were long ago with the scrub o&rsquo;ergrown.<br>
    It must have needed long years to soften<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road, that as hard as rock had been;<br>
    The mountain path he had trod so often<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay hidden now with a carpet green.</p>
  <p>He thought at times from the mountain courses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of a bullock bell,<br>
    The distant gallop of stockmen&rsquo;s horses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockwhip&rsquo;s crack that he knew so well:<br>
    But these were sounds of his memory only,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were gone from the flat and hill,<br>
    For when he listened the place was lonely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range was dumb and the bush was still.</p>
  <p>The swagman paused by the gap and faltered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For down the gully he feared to go,<br>
    The scene in memory never altered&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene before him had altered so.<br>
    But hope is strong, and his heart grew bolder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over his sorrows he raised his head,<br>
    He turned his swag to the other shoulder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plodded on with a firmer tread.</p>
  <p>Ah, hope is always the keenest hearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fancies much when assailed by fear;<br>
    The swagman thought, as the farm drew nearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sounds that he used to hear.<br>
    His weary heart for a moment bounded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment brief he forgot his dread;<br>
    For plainly still in his memory sounded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome bark of a dog long dead.</p>
  <p>A few steps more and his face grew ghostly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then white as death in the twilight grey;<br>
    Deserted wholly, and ruined mostly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Old Selection before him lay.<br>
    Like startled spectres that paused and listened,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few white posts of the stockyard stood;<br>
    And seemed to move as the moonlight glistened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paled again on the whitened wood.</p>
  <p>And thus he came, from a life long banished<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To other lands, and of peace bereft,<br>
    To find the farm and the homestead vanished,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the old stone chimney left.<br>
    The field his father had cleared and gardened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was overgrown with saplings now;<br>
    The rain had set and the drought had hardened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furrows made by a vanished plough.</p>
  <p>And this, and this was the longed-for haven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he might rest from a life of woe;<br>
    He read a name on the mantel graven&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name was his ere he stained it so.<br>
  &lsquo;And so remorse on my care encroaches&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I have not suffered enough,&rsquo; he said;<br>
  &lsquo;That name is pregnant with deep reproaches&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The past won&rsquo;t bury dishonoured dead!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Ah, now he knew it was long years after,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt how swiftly a long year speeds;<br>
    The hardwood post and the beam and rafter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rotted long in the tangled weeds.<br>
    He found that time had for years been sowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coarse wild scrub on the homestead path,<br>
    And saw young trees by the chimney growing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mountain ferns on the wide stone hearth.</p>
  <p>He wildly thought of the evil courses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brought disgrace on his father&rsquo;s name;<br>
    The escort robbed, and the stolen horses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felon&rsquo;s dock with its lasting shame.<br>
  &lsquo;Ah, God! Ah, God! is there then no pardon?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried in a voice that was strained and hoarse;<br>
    He fell on the weeds that were once a garden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sobbed aloud in his great remorse.</p>
  <p>But grief must end, and his heart ceased aching<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pitying sleep to his eye-lids crept,<br>
    And home and friends who were lost in waking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all came back while the stockman slept.<br>
    And when he woke on the empty morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain at his heart was a deadened pain;<br>
    And bravely bearing his load of sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wandered back to the world again.</p>

  <p>Far back&nbsp;in the days when the blacks used to ramble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In long single file &rsquo;neath the evergreen tree,<br>
    The wool-teams in season came down from Coonamble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And journeyed for weeks on their way to the sea,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas then that our hearts and our sinews were stronger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those were the days when the bushman was bred.<br>
    We journeyed on roads that were rougher and longer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than roads where the feet of our grandchildren tread.</p>
  <p>With mates who have gone to the great Never-Never,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mates whom I&rsquo;ve not seen for many a day,<br>
    I camped on the banks of the Cudgegong River<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yarned at the fire by the old bullock-dray.<br>
    I would summon them back from the far Riverina,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From days that shall be from all others distinct,<br>
    And sing to the sound of an old concertina<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rugged old songs where strange fancies were linked.</p>
  <p>We never were lonely, for, camping together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We yarned and we smoked the long evenings away,<br>
    And little I cared for the signs of the weather<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When snug in my hammock slung under the dray.<br>
    We rose with the dawn, were it ever so chilly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When yokes and tarpaulins were covered with frost,<br>
    And toasted the bacon and boiled the black billy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where high on the camp-fire the branches were tossed.</p>
  <p>On flats where the air was suggestive of &rsquo;possums,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And homesteads and fences were hinting of change,<br>
    We saw the faint glimmer of appletree blossoms<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far in the distance the blue of the range;<br>
    And here in the rain, there was small use in flogging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor, tortured bullocks that tugged at the load,<br>
    When down to the axles the waggons were bogging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And traffic was making a marsh of the road.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas hard on the beasts on the terrible pinches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where two teams of bullocks were yoked to a load,<br>
    And tugging and slipping, and moving by inches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-way to the summit they clung to the road.<br>
    And then, when the last of the pinches was bested,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You&rsquo;ll surely not say that a glass was a sin?)<br>
    The bullocks lay down &rsquo;neath the gum trees and rested &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullockies steered for the bar of the inn.</p>
  <p>Then slowly we crawled by the trees that kept tally<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of miles that were passed on the long journey down.<br>
    We saw the wild beauty of Capertee Valley,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As slowly we rounded the base of the Crown.<br>
    But, ah! the poor bullocks were cruelly goaded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While climbing the hills from the flats and the vales;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas here that the teams were so often unloaded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all knew the meaning of &lsquo;counting your bales.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And, oh! but the best-paying load that I carried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one to the run where my sweetheart was nurse.<br>
    We courted awhile, and agreed to get married,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And couple our futures for better or worse.<br>
    And as my old feet grew too weary to drag on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miles of rough metal they met by the way,<br>
    My eldest grew up and I gave him the waggon &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s plodding along by the bullocks to-day.</p>

  <p>We take a bright girl actress through western dust and damps,<br>

    Five miles this side the gold-field, a loud, triumphant shout:<br>

    That cheer for her, and cheer for Home, and cheer for Cobb and Co.</p>
  <p>Three lamps above the ridges and gorges dark and deep,<br>

    But a nation was born when the immigrants said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; as they stepped ashore!<br>
    In their loneliness they were parted thus<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the work to do,<br>
    A wild wide land to be won for us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hearts and hands so few.</p>
  <p>The darkest land &rsquo;neath a blue sky&rsquo;s dome,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the widest waste on earth;<br>
    The strangest scenes and the least like home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lands of our fathers&rsquo; birth;<br>
    The loneliest land in the wide world then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And away on the furthest seas,<br>
    A land most barren of life for men&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they won it by twos and threes!</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With &lsquo;nulla&rsquo; and spear held low;<br>
    Death was hidden amongst the trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bare on the glaring sand<br>
    They fought and perished by twos and threes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s how they won the land!</p>
  <p>It was two that failed by the dry creek bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While one reeled on alone&mdash;<br>
    The dust of Australia&rsquo;s greatest dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dust of the desert blown!<br>
    Gaunt cheek-bones cracking the parchment skin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scorched in the blazing sun,<br>
    Black lips that broke in a ghastly grin&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childbirth under the dray!<br>
    The childbirth out in the desolate hut<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a half-wild gin for nurse&mdash;<br>
    That&rsquo;s how the first were born to bear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brunt of the first man&rsquo;s curse!</p>

    When he musn&rsquo;t look black or indulge in a grin,<br>
    And thirty or forty men hate him like Sin&mdash;<br>
    I am moved to admit&mdash;when the total is scored&mdash;<br>
    That it&rsquo;s just a bit off for the Boss-of -the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
  have battled a lot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
  my dream&rsquo;s never soared<br>
    To the lonely position of Boss-of-the-board.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a black-listed shed down the Darling: the Boss<br>
    Was a small man to see&mdash;though a big man to cross&mdash;<br>
    We had nought to complain of&mdash;except what we thought,<br>
    And the Boss didn&rsquo;t boss any more than he ought;<br>
    But the Union was booming, and Brotherhood soared,<br>
    So we hated like poison the Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  could tolerate &lsquo;hands&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  respected the cook;<br>
    But the name of a Boss was a blot in our book.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d a row with Big Duggan&mdash;a rough sort of Jim&mdash;<br>
    Or, rather, Jim Duggan was &lsquo;laying for&rsquo; him!<br>
    His hate of Injustice and Greed was so deep<br>
    That his shearing grew rough&mdash;and he ill-used the sheep.<br>
    And I fancied that Duggan his manliness lower&rsquo;d<br>
    When he took off his shirt to the Boss-of-the-board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  the Boss was ten stone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the shearer full-grown,<br>
    And he might have, they said, let the crawler alone.</p>
  <p>Though some of us there wished the fight to the strong,<br>
    Yet we knew in our hearts that the shearer was wrong.<br>
    And the crawler was plucky, it can&rsquo;t be denied,<br>
    For he had to fight Freedom and Justice beside,<br>
    But he came up so gamely, as often as floored,<br>
    That a blackleg stood up for the Boss-of-the-board!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the fight was a sight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  we pondered that night&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s surprising how some of those blacklegs can fight!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Next day at the office, when sadly the wreck<br>
    Of Jim Duggan came up like a lamb for his cheque,<br>
    Said the Boss, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be childish! It&rsquo;s all past and gone;<br>
  &lsquo;I am short of good shearers. You&rsquo;d better stay on.&rsquo;<br>
    And we fancied Jim Duggan our dignity lower&rsquo;d<br>
    When he stopped to oblige a damned Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  said nothing to Jim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  a joke might be grim,<br>
    And the subject, we saw, was distasteful to him.</p>
  <p>The Boss just went on as he&rsquo;d done from the first,<br>
    And he favoured Big Duggan no more than the worst;<br>
    And when we&rsquo;d cut out and the steamer came down&mdash;<br>
    With the hawkers and spielers&mdash;to take us to town,<br>
    And we&rsquo;d all got aboard, &rsquo;twas Jim Duggan, good Lord!<br>
    Who yelled for three cheers for the Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas
  a bit off, no doubt&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  with Freedom about&mdash;<br>
    But a lot is forgot when a shed is cut out.</p>
  <p>With Freedom of Contract maintained in his shed,<br>
    And the curse of the Children of Light on his head,<br>
    He&rsquo;s apt to long sadly for sweetheart or wife,<br>
    And his views be inclined to the dark side of life.<br>
    The Truth must be spread and the Cause must be shored&mdash;<br>
    But it&rsquo;s just a bit rough on the Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
  am all for the Right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a childish word like &lsquo;damn,&rsquo;<br>
    Would give a pound that his tongue were loose<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronzed skin, and his shearer&rsquo;s dress;<br>

  <p>I learned what college had to teach, and in the school of men<br>
    By camp-fires I have learned, or, say, unlearned it all again;<br>
    But this I&rsquo;ve learned, that truth is strong, and if a man go straight<br>
    He&rsquo;ll live to see his enemy struck down by time and fate!</p>
  <p>We hold him true who&rsquo;s true to one however false he be<br>

  &lsquo;Those foreign gunners will give us rats, but I wish it was Bill they

  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to get at their bleeding hats with a rock in my (something)

    And, groaning and swearing, the pug replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done . . .

  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d fight them all for a pound a-side, from the boss to the rouseabout.<br>
  &lsquo;My nut is cracked and my legs is broke, and it gives me worse than hell;<br>

  &lsquo;The push that ran from the George-street traps won&rsquo;t run from

    And they hiss through their blackened teeth: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll stick! by

  after the cattle pup;&rsquo;<br>
    But his eyes grew bright, though his voice was sad, and he said, as I held
    him up:<br>
  &lsquo;I have been happy on western farms. And once, when I first went wrong,<br>
  &lsquo;Around my neck were the trembling arms of the girl I&rsquo;d loved so
  long.<br>
  &lsquo;Far out on the southern seas I&rsquo;ve sailed, and ridden where brumbies
  roam,<br>
  &lsquo;And oft, when all on the station failed, I&rsquo;ve driven the outlaw
  home.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a cheque in a day and night, and I&rsquo;ve made a
  cheque as quick;<br>
  &lsquo;I struck a nugget when times were tight, and the stores had stopped
  our tick.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve led the field on the old bay mare, and I hear the cheering
  still,<br>
  &lsquo;When mother and sister and she were there, and the old man yelled for
  Bill;<br>
  &lsquo;But, save for her, could I live my while again in the old bush way,<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give it all for the last half-mile in the race we rode to-day!&rsquo;<br>

  <p>The Eagle&nbsp;screams at the beck of trade, so Spain, as the world goes
    round,<br>
    Must wrestle the right to live or die from the sons of the land she found;<br>
    For, as in the days when the buccaneer was abroad on the Spanish Main,<br>
    The national honour is one thing dear to the hearts of the Dons of Spain.</p>
  <p>She has slaughtered thousands with fire and sword, as the Christian world
    might know;<br>
    We murder millions, but, thank the Lord! we only starve &rsquo;em slow.<br>
    The times have changed since the days of old, but the same old facts remain&mdash;<br>
    We fight for Freedom, and God, and Gold, and the Spaniards fight for Spain.</p>
  <p>We fought with the strength of the moral right, and they, as their ships
    went down,<br>
    They only fought with the grit to fight and their armour to help &rsquo;em
    drown.<br>
    It mattered little what chance or hope, for ever their path was plain,<br>
    The Church was the Church, and the Pope the Pope&mdash;but the Spaniards
    fought for Spain.</p>
  <p>If Providence struck for the honest thief at times in the battle&rsquo;s
    din&mdash;<br>
    If ever it struck at the hypocrite&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s where the Turks
    came in;<br>
    But this remains ere we leave the wise to argue it through in vain&mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s something great in the wrong that dies as the Spaniards die
    for Spain.</p>
  <p>The foes of Spain may be kin to us who are English heart and soul,<br>
    And proud of our national righteousness and proud of the lands we stole;<br>
    But we yet might pause while those brave men die and the death-drink pledge
    again&mdash;<br>
    For the sake of the past, if you&rsquo;re doomed, say I, may your death be
    a grand one, Spain!</p>
  <p>Then here&rsquo;s to the bravest of Freedom&rsquo;s foes who ever with death
    have stood&mdash;<br>
    For the sake of the courage to die on steel as their fathers died on wood;<br>
    And here&rsquo;s a cheer for the flag unfurled in a hopeless cause again,<br>
    For the sake of the days when the Christian world was saved by the Dons of

  <p align="center"><i>A Ballad of Ninety-three</i> </p>
  <p>Over there, above the jetty, stands the mansion of the Vardens,<br>
    With a tennis ground and terrace, and a flagstaff in the gardens:<br>
    They are gentlemen and ladies &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;toffs&rsquo; for
    generations,<br>
    But old Varden&rsquo;s been unlucky &mdash; lost a lot in speculations.</p>
  <p>Troubles gathered fast upon him when the mining bubble &lsquo;busted,&rsquo;<br>
    Then the bank suspended payment, where his little all he trusted;<br>
    And the butcher and the baker sent their bills in when they read it,<br>
    Even John, the Chow that served him, has refused to give him &lsquo;cledit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And the daughters of the Vardens &mdash; they are beautiful as Graces &mdash;<br>
    But the balcony&rsquo;s deserted, and they rarely show their faces;<br>
    And the swells of their acquaintance never seem to venture near them,<br>
    And the bailiff says they seldom have a cup of tea to cheer them.</p>
  <p>They were butterflies &mdash; I always was a common caterpillar,<br>
    But I&rsquo;m sorry for the ladies over there in &rsquo;Tony Villa,<br>
    Shut up there in &rsquo;Tony Villa with the bailiff and their trouble;<br>
    And the dried-up reservoir, where my tears were seems to bubble.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Rooney thinks it nothing when she sends a brat to &lsquo;borry&rsquo;<br>
    Just a pinch of tea and sugar till the grocer comes &lsquo;temorry;&rsquo;<br>
    But it&rsquo;s dif&rsquo;rent with the Vardens &mdash; they would starve
    to death as soon as<br>
    Knuckle down. You know, they weren&rsquo;t raised exactly like the Rooneys!</p>
  <p>There is gossip in the &lsquo;boxes&rsquo; and the drawing-rooms and gardens &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Have you heard of Varden&rsquo;s failure? Have you heard about the Vardens?&rsquo;<br>
    And no doubt each toney mother on the Point across the water&rsquo;s<br>
    Mighty glad about the downfall of the rivals of her daughters.</p>
  <p>(Tho&rsquo; the poets and the writers say that man to man&rsquo;s inhuman,<br>
    I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s nothing to what woman is to woman,<br>
    More especially, the ladies, save perhaps a fellow&rsquo;s mother;<br>
    And I think that men are better &mdash; they are kinder to each other.)</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a youngster by the jetty gathering cinders from the ashes,<br>
    He was known as &lsquo;Master Varden&rsquo; ere the great financial crashes.<br>
    And his manner shows the dif&rsquo;rence &rsquo;twixt the nurs&rsquo;ry and
    gutter &mdash;<br>
    But I&rsquo;ve seen him at the grocer&rsquo;s buying half a pound of butter.</p>
  <p>And his mother fights her trouble in the house across the water,<br>
    She is just as proud as Varden, though she was a &lsquo;cocky&rsquo;s&rsquo; daughter;<br>
    And at times I think I see her with the flick&rsquo;ring firelight o&rsquo;er
    her,<br>
    Sitting pale and straight and quiet, gazing vacantly before her.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a slight and girlish figure &mdash; Varden&rsquo;s youngest
    daughter, Nettie &mdash;<br>
    On the terrace after sunset, when the boat is near the jetty;<br>
    She is good and pure and pretty, and her rivals don&rsquo;t deny it,<br>
    Though they say that Nettie Varden takes in sewing on the quiet.</p>
  <p>(How her sister graced the &lsquo;circle,&rsquo; all unconscious of a lover<br>
    In the seedy &lsquo;god&rsquo; who watched her from the gallery above her!<br>
    Shade of Poverty was on him, and the light of Wealth upon her,<br>
    But perhaps he loved her better than the swells attending on her.)</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a white man&rsquo;s heart in Varden, spite of all the blue
    blood in him,<br>
    There are working men who wouldn&rsquo;t stand and hear a word agin&rsquo; him;<br>
    But his name was never printed by the side of his &lsquo;donations,&rsquo;<br>
    Save on hearts that have &mdash; in this world &mdash; very humble circulations.</p>
  <p>He was never stiff or hoggish &mdash; he was affable and jolly,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d always say &lsquo;Good morning&rsquo; to the deck hand on
    the &lsquo;Polly;&rsquo;<br>
    He would &lsquo;barrack&rsquo; with the newsboys on the Quay across the ferry,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d very often tip &rsquo;em coming home a trifle merry.</p>
  <p>But his chin is getting higher, and his features daily harden<br>
    (He will not &lsquo;give up possession&rsquo; &mdash; there&rsquo;s a lot
    of fight in Varden);<br>
    And the way he steps the gangway! oh, you couldn&rsquo;t but admire it!<br>
    Just as proud as ever hero walked the plank aboard a pirate!</p>
  <p>He will think about the hardships that his girls were never &lsquo;useter,&rsquo;<br>
    And it must be mighty heavy on the thoroughbred old rooster;<br>
    But he&rsquo;ll never strike his colours, and I tell a lying tale if<br>
    Varden&rsquo;s pride don&rsquo;t kill him sooner than the bankers or the
    bailiff.</p>
  <p>You remember when we often had to go without our dinners,<br>
    In the days when Pride and Hunger fought a finish out within us;<br>
    And how Pride would come up groggy &mdash; Hunger whooping loud and louder &mdash;<br>
    And the swells are proud as we are; they are just as proud &mdash; and prouder.</p>
  <p>Yes, the toffs have grit, in spite of all our sneering and our scorning &mdash;<br>
    What&rsquo;s the crowd? What&rsquo;s that? God help us! &mdash; Varden shot
    himself this morning! . . . .<br>
    There&rsquo;ll be gossip in the &lsquo;circle,&rsquo; in the drawing-rooms
    and gardens;<br>
    But I&rsquo;m sorry for the family; yes I&rsquo;m sorry for the Vardens.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><a name="SecondClassWaitHere"></a>Second Class Wait Here </h2>
  <p>On suburban railway stations &mdash; you may see them as you pass &mdash;<br>
    There are signboards on the platforms saying, &lsquo;Wait here second class;&rsquo;<br>

    And the second class are waiting &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been waiting ever
    since.<br>
    There are gardens in the background, and the line is bare and drear,<br>
    Yet they wait beneath a signboard, sneering &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I have waited oft in winter, in the mornings dark and damp,<br>
    When the asphalt platform glistened underneath the lonely lamp.<br>
    Ghastly on the brick-faced cutting &lsquo;Sellum&rsquo;s Soap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blower&rsquo;s
    Beer;&rsquo;<br>
    Ghastly on enamelled signboards with their &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And the others seemed like burglars, slouched and muffled to the throats,<br>
    Standing round apart and silent in their shoddy overcoats,<br>
    And the wind among the wires, and the poplars bleak and bare,<br>
    Seemed to be for ever snarling, snarling &lsquo;Second class wait there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Out beyond the further suburb, &rsquo;neath a chimney stack alone,<br>
    Lay the works of Grinder Brothers, with a platform of their own;<br>
    And I waited there and suffered, waited there for many a year,<br>
    Slaved beneath a phantom signboard, telling our class to wait here.</p>
  <p>Ah! a man must feel revengeful for a boyhood such as mine.<br>
    God! I hate the very houses near the workshop by the line;<br>
    And the smell of railway stations, and the roar of running gear,<br>
    And the scornful-seeming signboards, saying &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a train with Death for driver, which is ever going past,<br>
    And there are no class compartments, and we all must go at last<br>
    To the long white jasper platform with an Eden in the rear;<br>
    And there won&rsquo;t be any signboards, saying &lsquo;Second class wait

    I write, after reading your letter &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pipe with old memories rife &mdash;<br>
    And I feel in a mood that had better<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not meet the true eyes of the wife.</p>
  <p>You must never admit a suggestion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old things are good to recall;<br>
    You must never consider the question:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Was I happier then, after all?&rsquo;<br>
    You must banish the old hope and sorrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That make the sad pleasures of life,<br>
    You must live for To-day and To-morrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be just to the wife.</p>
  <p>I have changed since the first day I kissed her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is due &mdash; Heaven bless her! &mdash; to her;<br>
    I&rsquo;m respected and trusted &mdash; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressed by the children as &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo;<br>
    And I feel the respect without feigning &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&rsquo;d laugh the great laugh of your life<br>
    If you only saw me entertaining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old lady friend of the wife.</p>
  <p>By-the-way, when you&rsquo;re writing, remember<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you never went drinking with me,<br>
    And forget our last night of December,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest our sev&rsquo;ral accounts disagree.<br>
    And, for my sake, old man, you had better<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid the old language of strife,<br>
    For the technical terms of your letter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be misunderstood by the wife.</p>
  <p>Never hint of the girls appertaining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the past (when you&rsquo;re writing again),<br>
    For they take such a lot of explaining,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know how I hate to explain.<br>
    There are some things, we know to our sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cut to the heart like a knife,<br>
    And your past is To-day and To-morrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be true to the wife.</p>
  <p>I believe that the creed we were chums in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was grand, but too abstract and bold,<br>
    And the knowledge of life only comes in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re married and fathered and old.<br>
    And it&rsquo;s well. You may travel as few men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may stick to a mistress for life;<br>
    But the world, as it is, born of woman<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be seen through the eyes of the wife.</p>
  <p>No doubt you are dreaming as&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;did<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going the careless old pace,<br>
    While my future grows dull and decided,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world narrows down to the Place.<br>
    Let it be. If my &lsquo;treason&rsquo;s&rsquo; resented,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>You</i>&nbsp;may do worse, old man, in your life;<br>
    Let me dream, too, that I am contented &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of a true little wife.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><a name="TheUnculturedRhymerToHisCulturedCritics"></a>The Uncultured Rhymer To His Cultured Critics </h2>
  <p>Fight through ignorance, want, and care &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the griefs that crush the spirit;<br>
    Push your way to a fortune fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smiles of the world you&rsquo;ll merit.<br>
    Long, as a boy, for the chance to learn &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the chance that Fate denies you;<br>
    Win degrees where the Life-lights burn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scores will teach and advise you.</p>
  <p>My cultured friends! you have come too late<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your bypath nicely graded;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve fought thus far on my track of Fate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll follow the rest unaided.<br>
    Must I be stopped by a college gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the track of Life encroaching?<br>
    Be dumb to Love, and be dumb to Hate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lack of a college coaching?</p>
  <p>You grope for Truth in a language dead &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dust &rsquo;neath tower and steeple!<br>
    What know you of the tracks we tread?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what know you of our people?<br>
  &lsquo;I must read this, and that, and the rest,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And write as the cult expects me? &mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;ll read the book that may please me best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And write as my heart directs me!</p>
  <p>You were quick to pick on a faulty line<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I strove to put my soul in:<br>
    Your eyes were keen for a &lsquo;dash&rsquo; of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place of a semi-colon &mdash;<br>
    And blind to the rest. And is it for such<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you I must brook restriction?<br>
  &lsquo;I was taught too little?&rsquo; I learnt too much<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To care for a pedant&rsquo;s diction!</p>
  <p>Must I turn aside from my destined way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a task your Joss would find me?<br>
    I come with strength of the living day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with half the world behind me;<br>
    I leave you alone in your cultured halls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drivel and croak and cavil:<br>
    Till your voice goes further than college walls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep out of the tracks we travel!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="TheWritersDream"></a>The Writer&rsquo;s Dream </h2>
  <p>A writer wrote of the hearts of men, and he followed their tracks afar;<br>
    For his was a spirit that forced his pen to write of the things that are.<br>
    His heart grew tired of the truths he told, for his life was hard and grim;<br>
    His land seemed barren, its people cold &mdash; yet the world was dear to
    him; &mdash;<br>
    So he sailed away from the Streets of Strife, he travelled by land and sea,<br>
    In search of a people who lived a life as life in the world should be.</p>
  <p>And he reached a spot where the scene was fair, with forest and field and
    wood,<br>
    And all things came with the seasons there, and each of its kind was good;<br>
    There were mountain-rivers and peaks of snow, there were lights of green
    and gold,<br>
    And echoing caves in the cliffs below, where a world-wide ocean rolled.<br>
    The lives of men from the wear of Change and the strife of the world were
    free  &mdash;<br>
    For Steam was barred by the mountain-range and the rocks of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>And the last that were born of a noble race &mdash; when the page of the
    South was fair &mdash;<br>
    The last of the conquered dwelt in peace with the last of the victors there.<br>
    He saw their hearts with the author&rsquo;s eyes who had written their ancient
    lore,<br>
    And he saw their lives as he&rsquo;d dreamed of such &mdash; ah! many a year
    before.<br>
    And &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write a book of these simple folk ere I to the world
    return,<br>
  &lsquo;And the cold who read shall be kind for these &mdash; and the wise who
  read shall learn.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never again in a song of mine shall a jarring note be heard:<br>
  &lsquo;Never again shall a page or line be marred by a bitter word;<br>
  &lsquo;But love and laughter and kindly hours will the book I&rsquo;ll write
  recall,<br>
  &lsquo;With chastening tears for the loss of one, and sighs for their sorrows
  all.<br>
  &lsquo;Old eyes will light with a kindly smile, and the young eyes dance with
  glee &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;And the heart of the cynic will rest awhile for my simple folk and me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The lines ran on as he dipped his pen &mdash; ran true to his heart and
    ear &mdash;<br>
    Like the brighter pages of memory when every line is clear.<br>
    The pictures came and the pictures passed, like days of love and light &mdash;<br>
    He saw his chapters from first to last, and he thought it grand to write.<br>
    And the writer kissed his girlish wife, and he kissed her twice for pride:<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a book of love, though a book of life! and a book&nbsp;<i>you&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;read!&rsquo;  he
  cried.</p>
  <p>He was blind at first to each senseless slight (for shabby and poor he came)<br>
    From local &lsquo;Fashion&rsquo; and mortgaged pride that scarce could sign
    its name.<br>
    What dreamer would dream of such paltry pride in a scene so fresh and fair?<br>
    But the local spirit intensified &mdash; with its pitiful shams &mdash; was
    there;<br>
    There were cliques wherever two houses stood (no rest for a family ghost!)<br>
    They hated each other as women could &mdash; but they hated the stranger
    most.</p>
  <p>The writer wrote by day and night and he cried in the face of Fate  &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cleave to my dream of life in spite of the cynical ghosts
  that wait.<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the shyness born of their simple lives,&rsquo; he said to
  the paltry pride &mdash;<br>
    (The homely tongues of the simple wives ne&rsquo;er erred on the generous
    side) &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll prove me true and they&rsquo;ll prove me kind ere the
  year of grace be passed,&rsquo;<br>
    But the ignorant whisper of &lsquo;axe to grind!&rsquo; went home to his
    heart at last.</p>
  <p>The writer sat by his drift-wood fire three nights of the South-east gale,<br>
    His pen lay idle on pages vain, for his book was a fairy tale.<br>
    The world-wise lines of an elder age were plain on his aching brow,<br>
    As he sadly thought of each brighter page that would never be written now.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write no more!&rsquo; But he bowed his head, for his heart
  was in Dreamland yet  &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The pages written I&rsquo;ll burn,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and the pages
  thought forget.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But he heard the hymn of the Open Sea, and the old fierce anger burned,<br>
    And he wrenched his heart from its dreamland free as the fire of his youth
      returned:&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The weak man&rsquo;s madness, the strong man&rsquo;s scorn &mdash; the
  rebellious hate of youth<br>
  &lsquo;From a deeper love of the world are born! And the cynical ghost is Truth!&rsquo;<br>
    And the writer rose with a strength anew wherein Doubt could have no part;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write my book and it&nbsp;<i>shall</i>&nbsp;be true &mdash; the
  truth of a writer&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ay! cover the wrong with a fairy tale &mdash; who never knew want
    or care &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;A bright green scum on a stagnant pool that will reek the longer there.<br>
  &lsquo;You may starve the writer and buy the pen &mdash; you may drive it with
  want and fear &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;But the lines run false in the hearts of men &mdash; and false to the
  writer&rsquo;s ear.<br>
  &lsquo;The bard&rsquo;s a rebel and strife his part, and he&rsquo;ll burst
  from his bonds anew,<br>
  &lsquo;Till all pens write from a single heart! And so may the dream come true.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis ever the same in the paths of men where money and dress
    are all,<br>
  &lsquo;The crawler will bully whene&rsquo;er he can, and the bully who can&rsquo;t
  will crawl.<br>
  &lsquo;And this is the creed in the local hole, where the souls of the selfish
  rule;<br>
  &lsquo;Borrow and cheat while the stranger&rsquo;s green, then sneer at the
  simple fool.<br>
  &lsquo;Spit your spite at the men whom Fate has placed in the head-race first,<br>
  &lsquo;And hate till death, with a senseless hate, the man you have injured
  worst!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There are generous hearts in the grinding street, but the Hearts
    of the World go west;<br>
  &lsquo;For the men who toil in the dust and heat of the barren lands are best!<br>
  &lsquo;The stranger&rsquo;s hand to the stranger, yet &mdash; for a roving
  folk are mine &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The stranger&rsquo;s store for the stranger set &mdash; and the camp-fire
  glow the sign!<br>
  &lsquo;The generous hearts of the world, we find, thrive best on the barren
  sod,<br>
  &lsquo;And the selfish thrive where Nature&rsquo;s kind (they&rsquo;d bully
  or crawl to God!)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was born to write of the things that are! and the strength was
    given to me.<br>
  &lsquo;I was born to strike at the things that mar the world as the world should
  be!<br>
  &lsquo;By the dumb heart-hunger and dreams of youth, by the hungry tracks I&rsquo;ve
  trod &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight as a man for the sake of truth, nor pose as a martyred
  god.<br>
  &lsquo;By the heart of &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; and the heart of &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; and
  the men that&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;hearts deem &ldquo;white,&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;By the handgrips fierce, and the hard eyes dim with forbidden tears! &mdash; I&rsquo;ll
  write!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write untroubled by cultured fools, or the dense that
    fume and fret &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;For against the wisdom of all their schools I would stake mine instinct
  yet!<br>
  &lsquo;For the cynical strain in the writer&rsquo;s song is the&nbsp;<i>world</i>,
  not&nbsp;<i>he</i>, to blame,<br>
  &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll write as I think, in the knowledge strong that thousands
  think the same;<br>
  &lsquo;And the men who fight in the Dry Country grim battles by day, by night,<br>
  &lsquo;Will believe in me, and will stand by me, and will say to the world, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  right!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="TheJollyDeadMarch"></a>The Jolly Dead March </h2>
  <p>If I ever be worthy or famous &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I&rsquo;m sadly beginning to doubt &mdash;<br>
    When the angel whose place &rsquo;tis to name us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall say to my spirit, &lsquo;Pass out!&rsquo;<br>
    I wish for no sniv&rsquo;lling about me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(My work was the work of the land),<br>
    But I hope that my country will shout me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a decent brass band.</p>
  <p>Thump! thump! of the drum and &lsquo;Ta-ra-rit,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thump! thump! and the music &mdash; it&rsquo;s grand,<br>
    If only in dreams, or in spirit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride or march after the band!<br>
    And myself and my mourners go straying,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strolling and drifting along<br>
    With a band in the front of us playing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tune of an old battle song!</p>
  <p>I ask for no &lsquo;turn-out&rsquo; to bear me;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask not for railings or slabs,<br>
    And spare me! my country &mdash; oh, spare me!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearse and the long string of cabs!<br>
    I ask not the baton or &lsquo;starts&rsquo; of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bore with the musical ear,<br>
    But the music that&rsquo;s blown from the hearts of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men who work hard and drink beer.</p>
  <p>And let &rsquo;em strike up &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let them burst out with &lsquo;Lang Syne&rsquo; &mdash;<br>
    Twin voices of sadness and glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have ever been likings of mine.<br>
    And give the French war-hymn deep-throated<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Watch of the Germans between,<br>
    And let the last mile be devoted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wearing the Green.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And if, in the end &mdash; more&rsquo;s the pity &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is fame more than money to spare &mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s a van-man I know in the city<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;ll convey me, right side up with care.<br>
    True sons of Australia, and noble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have gone from the long dusty way,<br>
    While the sole mourner fought down his trouble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his pipe on the shaft of the dray.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let them strike up &lsquo;Annie
  Laurie,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
  <p>And my spirit will join the procession &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will pause, if it may, on the brink &mdash;<br>
    Nor feel the least shade of depression<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mourners drop out for a drink;<br>
    It may be a hot day in December,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a cold day in June it may be,<br>
    And the drink will but help them remember<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good points the world missed in me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help &rsquo;em to love &lsquo;Annie
  Laurie,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And help &rsquo;em to raise &lsquo;Auld
  Lang Syne,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Unhook the West Port&rsquo; for an orphan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old digger chorus revive &mdash;<br>
    If you don&rsquo;t hear a whoop from the coffin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;being buried alive.<br>
    But I&rsquo;ll go with a spirit less bitter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than mine own on the earth may have been,<br>
    And, perhaps, to save trouble, Saint Peter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will pass me, two comrades between.</p>
  <p>And let them strike up &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let &rsquo;em burst out with &lsquo;Lang Syne,&rsquo;<br>
    Twin voices of sadness and glory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have ever been likings of mine.<br>
    Let them swell the French war-hymn deep-throated<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I&rsquo;ll not buck at &lsquo;God Save the Queen&rsquo;),<br>
    But let the last mile be devoted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wearing the Green.&rsquo;</p>
  <p><i>Thump! thump! of the drums we inherit</i>&nbsp;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War-drums of my dreams! Oh it&rsquo;s grand,<br>
    If only in fancy or spirit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ride or march after a band!<br>
    And we, the World-Battlers, go straying<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loving and laughing along &mdash;<br>
    With Hope in the lead of us playing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tune of a life-battle song!</p>
